1 Petitioner, TULARE LAKE CANAL COMPANY ("Petitioner') prays for this Court to

2 take action as required by law, including but not limited to issuing a writ of mandate directed

3 against STRATFORD PUBLIC UTILITY DISTRICT ("Stratford PUD") and ANGIOLA

4 WATER DISTRICT (*Angiola WD*) (collectively referred to as "Respondents*), SANDRIDGE
5 PARTNERS L.P., and ROLLER LAND CO. (collectively referred to as "Real Parties in Interest")
6 to take appropriate action and/or refrain from further illegal conduct based on the following
7 allegations:
INTRODUCTION

Ilojel espues' 1. In this petition, Petitioner challenges the failure of Respondents to comply with the
10 California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA," Pub. Res. Code §§ 21000, et seq.) when it
11 commenced a joint pro ject to install a water and sewage pipeline (*"Project") with the Real Parties
7 12
California, County of Kings, 2/22/2022 1:32 in Interest, Sandridge Partners L.P. and Roller Land Co. Petitioner seeks to set aside such
13 approvals or, in the alternative, Petitioner seeks an order compelling Respondents Stratford PUD
14 and Angiola WD to act as the lead agency for approval of the project by Sandridge Partners L.P.
15 and Roller Land Co. and conduct review of the project or to determine whether another agency
16

17 should act as the lead agency to fulfill that roll.

18 2. On or about November, 2021, Real Parties in Interest, began undergoing construction

19 activities to build two pipelines near the City of Lemoore and community of Stratford. At the

20 same time construction commenced Real Parties in Interest embarked upon a concerted effort to
%
Court Superior 21 keep the details of this construction secret. In further of this conspiracy to keep Project secret,

22 Real Parties in Interest took action described in this pleading and in other ways not currently

23 known but will be proven at trial. Real Parties in Interest and other co-conspirators took the effort

6 Electronically filed 24 to keep Project secret because they knew Project would cause environmental harm, such as

25 lowering the water table in the area, ground subsidence, illegally transporting surface water out

26 of the area and illegal discharge of human waste. Petitioner was made aware of the project when

27 representatives from Sandridge Partners L.P. informed Petitioner the project necessitated crossing

2 Petitioner's canal. Petitioner could not have reasonably learned about the nature and extent of

w Project before November of 2021 because of Real Party in Interest's subterfuge.

3.
4 On or about January, 2022, representatives from Sandridge Partners L.P. and

5 Angiola WD, informed Petitioner that the project was for the purposes of Real Parties in

O Interest as well as Angiola WD. The purpose of the project, at least in part, is to transport

7 groundwater from various well locations north of Stratford and southwest of the City of

8 Lemoore to undisclosed locations. Despite this, Angiola WD has held no public hearing on

Ilojel espues' the project, conducted noenvironmental review of the project, or even posted the project as an

10 agenda item to be discussed at a public meeting.

11 Attached hereto as Exhibit A is a copy of
correspondence received from Sandridge Partners L.P. and Angiola WD.

&
California, County of Kings, 2/22/2022 1:32 12

13 4. On or about January 25, 2022, Petitioners filed suit against Real Parties in Interest to halt

14 their construction activities across Petitioner's canal. In so doing, Real Parties in Interest alleged

15 in their Cross-Complaint that in addition to moving water, Project included a pipeline to transport

sewage

16 from the "City of Stratford'. Prior to this disclosure, Real Parties in Interest and
Respondents have kept this information secret.

17
18 5. Stratford PUD is a public entity and as such is responsible for wastewater treatment within

19 the community of Stratford. At all times referenced herein Stratford PUD has obligations to the

% 20 people of Kings County and the community of Stratford to act in the public good in an open and

Court Superior 21 transparent manner. Although Real Parties in interest have falsely proclaimed the existence of a

22 municipality by the name of Stratford, no incorporated community named the "City of Stratford"

23 exists in the County of Kings. Stratford PUD has held no public hearing on the project, conducted

6 Electronically filed 24 no environmental review of the project, posted the project as an agenda item to be discussed at a

25 public meeting, or obtained permits for wastewater disposal. Despite this, Real Parties in Interest

26 allege the purpose of the pro ject includes transportation of sewage. Attached hereto as Exhibit

27 B is a copy of the signed declaration of Craig Andrew filed in support of an application for

28 injunctive relief by Real Parties in Interest testifying under oath on behalf of Sandridge Partners

1 and will be used to transport public sewage, effluent and other toxic substances from is under way

2 Stratford to some other undisclosed, unpermitted, secret location.

3 6. Because Respondents have failed to hold any public forum for Petitioners to properly
4 object to the project, combined with a conspiracy to keep details of Project secret from the public,
5 Petitioner has not had the opportunity to raise objections prior to filing this action. (See, Pub.
6 Res. Code§ 21177(e).) The conduct of Respondents and Real Parties in Interests, as referenced
7 in this Petition has effiectively prevented any environmental review of the Project as required by
8 law. Absent judicial action, the Project's significant potential environmental impact will go
¡|lojel eupues' 9 without review.
10 PARTIES
11 7. Petitioner Tulare Lake Canal Company is a California mutual water company corporation
7 12
California, County of Kings, 2/22/2022 1:32 headquartered in Kings County, California, whose primary function is to deliver, vital, non-toxic,
13 clean irrigation water through facilities it owns to stockholders for the production of food and
14 fiber that is later distributed to the public. Critical to the function of Petitioner, is the obligation
15 to take all reasonable steps to guard against the contamination of the water it distributes and

California, County of Kings,2/22/2022 1:32 13 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

14 13. This civil action is brought pursuant to Code Civ. Proc., S§ 1085, and 1094.5; and CEQA,

1 STANDING

2

3 19. Petitioner is beneficially interested in the subject matter of this proceeding because the
project impacts property
4 owned by Petitioner and has the possibility of adversely affecting the

Ur availability of surface and groundwater supplies as well as the possibility of adversely affecting

6 the water quality of Petitioner's supplies causing health and safety concerns. In addition, Project
has the ability to cause environmental harm by way
7 of contributing to and increasing land

8 subsidence. Petitioner will be directly injured by Respondents' failure to comply with CEQA in

¡|lojel eupues' 9 connection with Project as Petitioner's operations will be impacted by significant environmental

10 effiects that have not been adequately disclosed, analyzed, or mitigated. Given the current drought

11 and the competing demands for California's precious water and the concerted effort by Real

& 12 Parties in Interest and Respondents to keep details of Project secret, Petitioner is uniquely

California, County of Kings, 2/22/2022 1:32 13 positioned to bring this matter to the court's attention because Petitioners will be directly impacted

14 by the potential adverse impact Project may have on Petitioner's operations.

15 20. Petitioner has standing in the public interest because this case involves public rights and

16 the enforcement of public duties. As lead and responsible agencies, Respondents have a

17 mandatory duty to comply with the procedural and substantive requirements of CEQA. Petitioner

18 is not seeking relief greater than or diffierent from relief sought for the general public. If

19 successful, this action would enforce the mandates of CEQA, including the public's right to

% 20 adequate and informative environmental review under that statute and meaningful information

Court Jouedns 21 being provided to decision makers prior to the making of decisions affecting the environment.

22 21. California law, as articulated by the State's highest court is clear, "Public entities have,

23 inter alia, a mandatory duty to obey legislative enactments

6 (.Ramos v. County of Madera

Electronically filed 24 (1971) 4 Cal.3d 685, 696.) Indeed, "It is elementary that public of ficials must themselves obey

25 the law." (Wirin v. Parker (1957) 48 Cal.2d 890, 894.) These obligations apply to Respondents.

26 22. Petitioner filed the claim alleged in this petition prior to the expiration of any applicable

27 statute of limitations in compliance with Public Resources Code section 21167, as this action was

28 brought within 180 days of commencement of the project. In alternative, if work on the Project

2 commenced earlier than 180 days prior to this action, the work that began prior to that 180 days

3 was commenced without notice to Petitioner a and was commenced in a manner that did not reveal

4 or trigger a duty to inquire into the project's possible environmental impacts. Further in the
alternative, Petitioners filed the claim within 2 weeks of discovering Real Parties in Interest's and
Stratford PUD's intention to install a sleeve that would haul human waste as part of the project.

7 VIOLATIONS OF CEQA

8 23. CEQA is California's primary statutory mandate for environmental protection. It applies

ellojel eupues' 9 to all state and local agencies, and requires them to "first identify the [significant] environmental

10 effiects of projects, and then to mitigate those adverse effects through the imposition of feasible

11 mitigation measures or through the selection of feasible alternatives." (Sierra Club v. State Board

- 12
California, County of Kings,2/22/2022 1:32 of Forestry (1994) 7 Cal. 4th 1215, 1233. Its most important substantive imperative requires

13 "public agencies to deny approval of a project with significant adverse effects when feasible

14 alternatives or feasible mitigation measures can substantially lessen such effiects." (Sierra Club

15 V. Gilroy City Council (1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 30, 41.)

16 24. CEQA'S mandate for detailed environmental review "ensures that members of the

17 [governmental decision-making body] will fully consider the information necessary to render

18 decisions that intelligently take into account the environmental consequences" of their proposed

19 action. (Mountain Lion Foundation V. Fish and Game Commission (1997) 16 Cal.4th 105, 133;

6 20 Pub. Res. CodeS§ 21080.5(d)(2)(D), 21091(d)(2); 14 C.C.R. [CEQA Guidelines ]§ 15088. The

Electronically filed I unoo Jouedns 21 CEQA process thus "protects not only the environmental but also informed self -government."

22 (Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Board of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 564.)

23
6 25. All California "public agencies" must comply with CEQA when they approve

24 discretionary projects. Respondents are public agencies participating in a project to move water

25 and sewage. Thus, their approvals of such a project is subject to CEQA.

26 26. In complying with CEQA procedures, an agency may not segment a project to avoid

27 preparing an EIR on the entirety, or whole, of the project. (Guidelines con 15378(a), (c), (d).)

28 CEQA's "requirements cannot be avoided by chopping up proposed projects into bite-size pieces

2 which, individually considered, might be found to have no significant effiect on the environment

au A w or to be only ministerial." (Plan for Arcadia, Inc. v. City Council of Arcadia (1974) 42
Cal.App.3d 712, 726.)
27. In order to comply with CEQA, "an EIR must be perfiormed before a project is approved,
for if post-approval environmental review were allowed, EIR's would likely become nothing
more than post hoc rationalizations to
7 support action already taken." (Save Tara v. City of West

8 Holl ywood (2008) 45 Cal.4th 116, 130.)

¡|lojel eupues' 9 28. In commencing a public project without a formal decision, Respondents violated CEQA
by the following:
10
= Commencing ublic project without formal approval through a properly noticed

7
California, County of Kings, 2/22/2022 1:32 12 public hearing by the decision-making body(s);

21299 002 Failing to conduct an initial study to determine significant environmental effiects;
Failure to prepare, circulate and hold a public hearing a on a draft Environmental
Impact Report;
Failure to provide any mitigation measures whatsoever for environmental effiects;
Failure to take official action approving the project after proper environmental

review and documentation; and

20 Improper piecemealing and failure to consider the whole of the action constituting

% the project.

Court Jouedns 21 Other ways Respondents violated CEQA are currently unknown but will be proven

22 at the time of trial.

23
6 INADEQUATE REMEDY AT LAW-STAY AND INJUNCTION

Electronically filed 24 29. Under Code of Civil Procedure sections 526, 1085, and 1094.5 and Public Resources Code

25 sections 21168 and 21168.5, the Court is authorized to impose a stay or to otherwise enjoin

26 operation of any administrative decision or order involved in this proceeding; this Court is also

27

28 authorized to stay or en join further work on the project. With this Court's intervention to require

RUDDELL compliance with CEQA the public, along with Petitioner will be deprived of any analysis of the

1 harm this Project will cause the environment in general and in particular in this water deprived,

2 environmentally sensitive arca of California.

3 30. Because Real Parties in Interest and Respondents have already commenced action on

4 Project, irreparable harm is occurring due to no environmental review of the impacts of the
5 project. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law for the irreparable harm that
6 is occurring as a result of the commencement of the project. A stay or preliminary or permanent
7 injunction is necessary to restrain Respondents and Real Parties in Interest from taking further
g actions until they have complied with CEQA.
Ilojel espues' 31. A stay or injunction of Respondents' action relating to the project would not be against
10 the public interest because Respondents are required to conduct adequate environmental review
11 of the project prior to approval and commencement of the Project, the Project likely has
& 12
California, County of Kings, 2/22/2022 1:32 significant impacts on the environment, and Respondents will not be harmed by a stay or
13 in junction.
14 ATTORNEYS' FEES
15

16 32. In seeking to compel Respondents to lawfully discharge their mandatory public duties,

17 Petitioner is acting in its capacity as private attorneys general in the interest and for the benefit of

18 the public pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5, and any other applicable legal

19 theory, and the enforcement of important rights affecting the public interest. Issuance of the relief

20 requested in this Petition will constitute a significant public benefit by requiring Respondents to
%
Court Jouedns 21 carry out their duties as lead and responsible agencies under CEQA in compliance with the law.

22 33. Further, Petitioner brings this action on the basis, among other things, that Respondents

23 actions in connection with the project were and continue to be arbitrary and capricious. Pursuant

6 Electronically filed 24 to Government Code section 800 and other applicable laws, Petitioner is entitled to reasonable

2 1. I am Chief Operating Officer and Farm Manager for SANDRIDGE PARTNERS,
3 L.P ("Sandridge Partners"), a Cross-Complainant in the above-entitled action.

2. I have personal knowledge of the matters contained herein. As to those matters stated

5 upon infiormation and belief, I believe said matters to be true and correct. If called upon to testify,
6 could and would testify competently hereto.
3. I make this Declaration in Support of the Ex Parte Application for Order to Show
e||oje l eupues' 8 Cause Regarding Preliminary Injunction and Temporary Restraining Order filed by Cross-
Complainants Sandridge Partners, L.P. and Roller Land Company, Inc. (hereafter collectively
10| "Cross-Complainants".)
: 11 4. In my role as Farm Manager, I have been personally tasked by both Cross- ZE:L 12 Complainants with the responsibility of overseeing the construction of the pipeline pro ject being
California, County of Kings,2/22/202 13 laid across APN 026-230-010, which is the northern parcel to the canal at issue owned by Sandridge
14 and APN 026-230-011, which is the southern parcel to the canal at issue owned by Roller (hercafter
15 "the Property"). I have personal knowledge of all aspects of the project, as well as the facts that
16 relate to the two parcels at issue owned by the Cross-Complainants. The canal at issue runs between
17 the subject properties and is also owned by Cross-Complainants. Water flows through the canal
18 from time to time and runs from north west, flowing south east.
%
Court Jouedns 19 5. am intimately fiamiliar with the subject properties as well as the canal that runs
20 through it as I have been employed at Sandridge Partners for over four (4) years and am frequently

21 on the properties as part of my employment, throughout all times of the year. In addition to my
b
Electronically filed 22 employment with Sandridge Partners I have been employed in the farming industry in the Central
23 Valley for over a decade. Therefore, am aware of the irrigation schedule, including when water iS
24 moved and delivered to various recipients for agricultural use.

25 6. Cross-Complainants have, together, embarked upon construction project, whereby
26 one pipe and one sleeve will be built underground and will cross under Sandridge Partners' property,
27 under the subsurfiace of the canal, onto Roller Land's property and beyond. The construction was
28 contemplated for two reasons. First, the sleeve will be constructed to assist the City of Stratford,

RESTRAINING ORDER AND ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE RE PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION

1 located in Kings County, in transporting sewage water away from the City. This eight (8) inch sleeve

2 will lead from the City of Stratford, under property belonging to Sandridge Partners, under the
3 subsurfiace of the canal, and onto neighboring properties. Second, Cross-Complainants are in the

4 process of placing a underground pipe in order to transfer well water belonging to Sandridge

5 Partners for irrigation purposes. This pipeline is forty-eight (48) inches and will cross under
6 Sandridge Partners' property, under the subsurfiace of the canal, onto Roller Land's property and
7 beyond. All portions of the trench being dug, including the area that crosses the canal, are through
e||oje l eupues' 8 land owned by the Cross-Complainants.
7. On behalf of both Cross-Complainants, I have been working I with our licensed
10 general contractor in overseeing this Project. The safety protocols engineered by our team included
: ZE:L zoz/zuz'sbuix jo Áunoo California, 11 assurances that the top of the pipeline would be placed four feet below the bottom of the canal, with
12 three feet first filled with soil with confirmed 95% compaction (a rate of compaction that is a better
13 state than the canal is currently in) and for the final one foot, a cement slurry would be placed to act
14 as a barrier for protection of the integrity of the pipes in the event any maintenance or repair work
15 is performed in the future in the canal. In short, the underground pipeline was engineered, designed
16 and approved in a manner in which would not interfiere with the flow of water in the canal.
17 8. The process of (1) digging the trench, (2) temporarily damming any minimal residual
18 water in the canal, (3) installing the pipeline and sleeve, and (4) re-covering the pipeline and sleeve
%
Court Jouedns 19 and testing for compaction was scheduled to be completed within five (5) days. This portion of the
20 project was scheduled to commence on January 26, 2022.

21 9. When planning this pro ject with our contractor, we were aware that Cross-Defiendant

b
Electronically filed 22 Tulare Lake Canal Company, Inc. uses the canal during certain times of the year to transport water.
23 Of importance to the present action is that the placement of the pipeline and sleeve at issue will not
24 interfiere with the water being moved by any third parties in the canal. In addition, we strategically
25 selected the month of January to commence this Project because third parties typically do not use
26 this portion of the canal to deliver water during this time of year. In my experience in the agriculture
27 industry in the area, and my personal experience and observations over the past four (4) years in

RESTRAINING ORDER AND ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE RE PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION

observing the use of the canal at issue, I am aware that Tulare Lake Canal Company does not use
2 the canal for delivery in the winter months in the area of the pipeline project.

3 10. In fiact, on January 26, 2022, the day the trenching for the pipe and sleeve under the
4 subsurfiace of the canal was set to commence, I personally observed that there was no water being
5 run in this portion of the canal, and the canal contained approximately only one foot of residual
6 water at the location where the trench was to be dug. I went back to the canal on January 28, 2022
7 to confirm this, and took the photograph attached hereto as Exhibit "A", which shows one of our
ejjojel eupues' 8 employee standing in the canal with a measuring tape which records only about 11.5 inches of water
9 at the center of the canal. In my experience with irrigation and use of this specific canal for water
10 delivery, this level is consistent with only residual water and not indicative of an active use of the
: 11
California, County of Kings,2/22/2022 1:32 canal for delivery.

12 11. In an attempt at being courteous, I am aware that Sandridge Partners, through several

13 of its consultants, and directly, communicated with Tulare Lake Canal Company in an effort to let

14 it know of our plans to lay the pipeline and sleeve and also to make clear that we would perfiorm the
15 work across the canal during these winter months to avoid any disruption to its use of the canal for
16 water delivery. In fact, as recently as January 17, 2022, it was communicated that our trench work
17 would commence shortly in order to avoid any interference with Tulare Lake Canal Company's
18 movement of water.
5 Court Superior 19 12. Despite the fact that Cross-Complainants hold title to all portions of the land at issue,
20 including the canal and its embankments, on January 26, 2022, Cross-Defendants, without our
21 permission, came onto the subject properties and parked several pieces of large construction
6
Electronically filed 22 machinery (including but not limited to trucks, trailers, excavators, motor graders and bulldozers)
23 on the embankments of the canal, within the staked parameters of where the trenching was to take
24 place for the Project. I was at the construction site on January 26, 2022 and personally observed
25 Cross-Defendants' obstruction of the Project. The machines and other equipment were parked along
26 the two embankments along the canal essentially forming a wall to block the trench of the Project.
27 Attached as Exhibit "B" hereto is a true and correct copy of a photo I took on January 26, 2022 of
28 the equipment placed on Cross-Complainants' Property by Cross-Defiendants.

13. I personally observed that most, but not all of the equipment on the property have

2 Wood Bros.' logo affixed to the equipment.

3 14. As of the date of the filing of the Cross-Complaint, Cross-Defiendants' equipment

4 unlawfully remained on Cross-Complainants' properties, preventing the completion of the project.

5 However, as of the date of the filing of the present Ex Parte Application, we have been infiormed
and believe that Wood Bros. has removed its equipment, or is in the process of removing its
equipment which was blocking the contemplated project. However, additional equipment belonging
e||oje l eupues' 8 to the remaining Cross-Defiendants or their agents unlawfully remains on Cross-Complainants'
9 properties, preventing the completion of their project. Thus, the in junctive relief requested in the
10 present Ex Parte Application is necessary to prevent Cross-Def endants from the ongoing and
: 11 continuing trespass at issue. ZE:L zozrzziz'sburx jo Ájunoo California, 12 15. Given Cross-Defiendants' intentional ongoing blocking of the canal where the
13 construction was to take place, we remain unable to continue with the contemplated Project, which
14 means that Cross-Complainants' ability to access and use their land is being thwarted, and their
15 plans, once the Project is complete, to move water to irrigate crops for other commercial purposes,
16 and to assist the City of Stratfiord in removing sewage, are being prevented.
17 16. Despite any permission it may have to access the canal at issue to move water, Tulare
18 Lake Canal Company has exceeded the scope of any such permission by intentionally entering the %
Court Jouedns 19 subject properties belonging to Cross-Complainants, without permission, and unlawfully placing,
20 or causing to be placed, large equipment and/or machinery on the property for the exclusive purpose
21 of preventing the Project from being completed. If delayed more than a couple of months, this will

b 22 cause Cross-Complainants to be unable to irrigate crops and thus cause irreparable injury to the Electronically filed 23 cultivated fiarmland. Such losses would take years to recover from.

24 17. Given Cross-Defiendants' refusal to remove the equipment at issue, it is likely that
25 they will continues to trespass on Cross-Complainants' property without Cross-Complainants'
26 consent unless they are restrained from doing so by a Court of law.

27 18. Cross-Complainants continue to be damaged in several ways, including but not
28 limited to the costs of their contractors for days they were mobilized, but unable to work as a result

1 of C ross-Defendants' blockade, the delay to the Project causing the inability to move water for its
2 bencficial use and commercial purposes, and the inability to assist the City of Stratford in its efforts

3 to r'emove sewage. Damages are ongoing and increase every day that the trespassing equipment

4 remains in place and the Pro ject is pr'evented from being completed.

5 19. Additional harm resulting firom Cross-Defendant's offending conduct cannot be

'I¡OJel espues' 6 measured or it would be extremely difficult to ascertain the amount of compensation required to

7 afford full and adequate relief. It is difficult, if not impossible 1o quantify the damages currently
8 being caused by Cross-Defendants' wrongful conduct and such conduct is depriving Cross-

9

: Complainants of its use and en joyment of property, as Well as hindering their ability lo assist the
California, County of Kings,2/22/2022 ZE:L 10 City of Stratford in its efforts to remove sewage.

II 20.

12 Cross-Defendant Tulare Lake Canal Company has ignored our requests that they
remove the equipment and the Sherriff's office has even been involved to no avail.

13 I declare under penalty of per jury under the laws of the Statc of California that the foregoing

14

15 is true and correct and that this Declarations was executed on this 1st day of February, 2022, at

Re: NOTICE OF INTENT TO FILE CEQA PETITION

Dear Ms. Granger and Mr. Grewal:

PLEASE TAKE NOTICE, under Public Resources Code section 21167.5, Petitioner, Tulare Lake Canal Company, intends to file a petition under the provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act against Respondents, Stratford Public Utility District and Angiola Water District challenging its commencement of a public project in violation of CEQA.
As both Stratford Public Utility District and Agiola Water District are aware, Sandridge Partners, L.P. and Roller Land Company, Inc. are currently trenching and installing a pipeline extending from near Lemoore, California to the Blakely Canal with the intention
of moving groundwater and surface water from unknown sources to unknown
consumers; Angiola Water District has stated in no uncertain terms that it is involved
in this project and has undertaken affirmative steps to facilitate the project's completion despite never having considered the environmental impacts of the project.

At the same time, Sandridge Partners and Roller Land Co. are installing a sleeve for yet another pipeline with the intention of hauling human waste from a portion of the area, or all of the area, served by the Stratford Public Utility District, again without having
considered the environmental impacts of this project. They have done so by approving
the projects' commencement without a formal vote, without public hearing, and without providing decision makers with the information necessary to make decisions about CEQA's applicability to the projects and the extent of review appropriate to them.
In commencing a public project in this manner, Respondents violated CEQA by the following:

Commencing a public project without formal approval through a properly
noticed public hearing by the decision-making body(s);
Failing to conduct an initial study to determine significant environmental
effects;

Ms. Granger and Mr. Grewal February 15, 2022 Notice of CEQA Action
Page 2 of 3

Failure to prepare, circulate and hold a public hearing on a draft Environmental
Impact Report;
Failure to provide any mitigation measures whatsoever for environmental
effects;
Failure to take official action approving the project after proper environmental review and documentation; and
Improper piecemealing and failure to consider the whole of the action constituting the project.

Other ways Respondents violated CEQA are currently unknown but will be
the time of trial. proven at

Under Code of Civil Procedure sections 526, 1085, and 1094.5 and Public Resources Code sections 21168 and 21168.5, the Court is authorized to impose a stay or to
otherwise enjoin operation of any administrative decision or order involved in this proceeding; this Court is also authorized to stay or enjoin further work on the project. With this Court's intervention to require compliance with CEQA the public, along with Petitioner will be deprived of any analysis of the harm this Project will cause the environment in general and in particular in this water deprived, environmentally sensitive area of California.

Because Real Parties in Interest and Respondents have already commenced action on the Project, irreparable harm is occurring due to no environmental review of the impacts of the project. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law for the irreparable harm that is occurring as a result of the commencement of the project. A stay or preliminary or permanent injunction is necessary to restrain Respondents and Real Parties in Interest from taking further actions until they have complied with CEQA.

Tulare Lake Canal Company will be praying for the following forms of relief:

1. 2. Issue its writ of mandate setting aside any project approvals;
Enjoin the project and any and all activity that can result in an adverse
change or alteration to the physical environment until and unless Respondents lawfully comply with CEQA and all other applicable state and local laws and regulations as directed by this Court pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21168.9;
3. For a stay, temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, and permanent injunction prohibiting any actions by Respondents that can result in any adverse change or alteration to the physical environment, pursuant to Respondents' approval of the project and fully compliance with all requirements of CEQA and all other applicable state laws, policies, and
regulations;
4. 5. For an award of costs; For an award of attorneys' fees under section 1021.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure and other provisions of law; and
6. For such further relief that the Court deems just.

We expect to be filing the petition in the next few days. A copy of the pleading is enclosed. We look forward to pursuing a scientifically supportable and politically forward-thinking resolution to this issue with you, as I am sure the Respondents and the Real Parties in Interest are as intensely committed to mitigating the potential environmental consequences of this project as are Tulare Lake Canal Company.

1 Petitioner, TULARE LAKE CANAL COMPANY (*Petitioner") prays for this Court to

2 take action as required by law, including but not limited to issuing a writ of mandate directed

3 against STRATFORD PUBLIC UTILITY DISTRICT ("Stratford PUD") and ANGIOLA
4 WATER DISTRICT (*Angiola WD") (collectively referred to as "Respondents), SANDRIDGE
5 PARTNERS L.P., and ROLLER LAND CO. (collectively referred to as "Real Parties in Interest")

6 to take appropriate action and/or refrain from further illegal conduct based on the following
7 allegations:
8 INTRODUCTION
9 1. In this petition, Petitioner challenges the failure of Respondents to comply with the
10 California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA," Pub. Res. Code §§ 21000, et seq.) when it
11 commenced a joint project to install a water and sewage pipeline ("Project") with the Real Parties
12 in Interest, Sandridge Partners L.P. and Roller Land Co. Petitioner seeks to set aside such
13 approvals or, in the alternative, Petitioner seeks an order compelling Respondents Stratford PUD
14 and Angiola WD to act as the lead agency for approval of the project by Sandridge Partners L.P.
15 and Roller Land Co. and conduct review of the project or to determine whether another agency
16

17 should act as the lead agency to fulfill that roll.

18 2. On or about November, 2021, Real Parties in Interest, began undergoing construction

19 activities to build two pipelines near the City of Lemoore and community of Stratford. At the

20 same time construction commenced Real Parties in Interest embarked upon a concerted effort to

21 keep the details of this construction secret. In further of this conspiracy to keep Project secret,

22 Real Parties in Interest took action described in this pleading and in other ways not currently

23 known but will be proven at trial. Real Parties in Interest and other co-conspirators took the effort

24 to keep Project secret because they knew Project would cause environmental harm, such as

25 lowering the water table in the area, ground subsidence, illegally transporting surface water out

26 of the area and illegal discharge of human waste. Petitioner was made aware of the project when

27 representatives from Sandridge Partners L.P. informed Petitioner the project necessitated crossing

1 Petitioner's canal. Petitioner could not have reasonably learned about the nature and extent of

2 Project before November of 2021 because of Real Party in Interest's subterfuge.
3 3. On or about January, 2021, representatives from Sandridge Partners L.P. and Angiola

4 WD, informed Petitioner that the project was for the purposes of Real Parties in Interest as well
5 as Angiola WD. The purpose of the project, at least in part, is to transport groundwater from
6 various well locations north of Stratford and southwest of the City of Lemoore to undisclosed
7 locations. Despite this, Angiola WD has held no public hearing on the project, conducted no
8 environmental review of the project, or even posted the project as an agenda item to be discussed
9 at a public meeting. Attached hereto as Exhibit A is a copy of correspondence received from
10 Sandridge Partners L.P. and Angiola WD.
11 4. On or about January 25, 2021, Petitioners filed suit against Real Parties in Interest to halt
12 their construction activities across Petitioner's canal. In so doing, Real Parties in Interest alleged
13 in their Cross-Complaint that in addition to moving water, Project included a pipeline to transport
14
sewage from the "City of Stratford". Prior to this disclosure, Real Parties in Interest and 15

16 Respondents have kept this information secret.

17 5. Stratford PUD is public entity and as such is responsible for wastewater treatment within

18 the community of Stratford. At all times referenced herein Stratford PUD has obligations to the
people of Kings County and the community of Stratford to act in the public good in an open and
19

20 transparent manner. Although Real Parties in interest have falsely proclaimed the existence of a

21 municipality by the name of Stratford, no incorporated community named the "City of Stratford"

22 exists in the County of Kings. Stratford PUD has held no public hearing on the project, conducted

23 no environmental review of the project, posted the project as an agenda item to be discussed at

24 public meeting, or obtained permits for wastewater disposal. Despite this, Real Parties in Interest

25 allege the purpose of the project includes transportation of sewage. Attached hereto as Exhibit

26 B is a copy of the signed declaration of Craig Andrew filed in support of an application for

27 injunctive relief by Real Parties in Interest testifying under oath on behalf of Sandridge Partners

28 L.P. as what appears to be a very important officer of the corporate body that the pipeline project

RUDDELL STANTON BIXLER - 3 - MAURITSON & EVANS, 1102 N. Chinowth St Visalia, CA 93291 Tel: (559) 733-5770 Fax: (559) 733-4922 TULARE LAKE CANAL COMPANY'S VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 is under way and will be used to transport public sewage, effluent and other toxic substances from

2 Stratford to some other undisclosed, unpermitted, secret location.
cn t 6. Because Respondents have failed to hold any public forum for Petitioners to properly
object to the project, combined with a conspiracy to keep details of Project secret from the public,
Un Petitioner has not had the opportunity to raise objections prior to filing this action. (See, Pub.
6 Res. Code § 21177(e).) The conduct of Respondents and Real Parties in Interests, as referenced
7 in this Petition has effectively prevented any environmental review of the Project as required by
8 law. Absent judicial action, the Project's significant potential environmental impact will go
9 without review.
10 PARTIES
11 7. Petitioner Tulare Lake Canal Company is a California mutual water company corporation
12 headquartered in Kings County, California, whose primary function is to deliver, vital, non-toxic,
13 clean irrigation water through facilities it owns to stockholders for the production of food and
14 fiber that is later distributed to the public. Critical to the function of Petitioner, is the obligation
15

16 to take all reasonable steps to guard against the contamination of the water it distributes and

17 protect the sustainability of that water for the people of Kings County and the State of California.

18 Fulfilling that responsibility is an overarching responsibility of Petitioner.

19 8. Respondent and Defendant Stratford Public Utility District is a public utility district within

20 the County of Kings, whose primary responsibility is the treatment of wastewater for the

21 community of Stratford. As a public entity, it is required at all times to act in an open, transparent

22 manner in conformity with the letter and spirit of the law governing public entities.

23 9. Respondent and Defendant Angiola Water District is a California water district whose

24 boundaries are within both County of Kings and County of Tulare, whose primary responsibility

25 is the delivery of water. As a public entity, it is required at all times to act in an open, transparent

26 manner in conformity with the letter and spirit of the law governing public entities.

27 10. Real Party in Interest Sandridge Partners L.P. is a limited partnership, organized under

28 California law, and engaged in the construction, operation and ownership of the project.

4 12. Does 1 through 50, inclusive, may have an interest or claim to the project whose specific

a details are not presently known to the Petitioner. The true names and capacities, whether
individual, corporate, associate, governmental, or other designations, of Does through 25 are

7 not presently known to petitioner and are therefore referenced here by fictitious names. Should

8 their true names and capacities later be ascertained, petitioners and plaintiffs will seek to amend

9

10 this petition and complaint to identify their true names and capacities. The trues names of Does

11 26 through 50 are known Petitioner but their capacities, whether individual, corporate, associate,

12 governmental, or other designations, to this Project are as of yet unknown to Petitioner are not

13 presently known to petitioner and are therefore referenced here by fictitious names as well.
JURISDICTION AND VENUE

14

15 13. This civil action is brought pursuant to Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1085, and 1094.5; and CEQA,
Public Resources Code section 21000 et seq.

16

17 14. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 393, 394, and 395, venue for this action is
appropriate in Kings County Superior Court.

18

19 15. Respondents have failed to provide a public hearing or other opportunity for members of

20 the public to raise objections before project approval and commencement of the project.

21 16. Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.5 by prior service of a
notice upon Respondents indicating its intent to file this petition.

22

23 17. Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.7 and Code of Civil

24 Procedure section 388 by serving a copy of this petition on the Attorney General. Petitioner also

25 brings this action of behalf of members of the public, to enforce important rights affecting the
public interest.

26

27 18. Petitioner elects to prepare the record of proceedings in the above-captioned proceeding

or to pursue an

28 alternative method of record preparation pursuant to
section 21167.6(b)(2). Public Resources Code

1 STANDING

2 19. Petitioner is beneficially interested in the subject matter of this proceeding because the

3 project impacts property owned by Petitioner and has the possibility of adversely affecting the
4 availability of surface and groundwater supplies as well as the possibility of adversely affecting
5 the water quality of Petitioner's supplies causing health and safety concerns. In addition, Project
6 has the ability to cause environmental harm by way of contributing to and increasing land
7 subsidence. Petitioner will be directly injured by Respondents' failure to comply with CEQA in
8 connection with Project as Petitioner's operations will be impacted by significant environmental
9 effects that have not been adequately disclosed, analyzed, or mitigated. Given the current drought
10 and the competing demands for California's precious water and the concerted effort by Real
11 Parties in Interest and Respondents to keep details of Project secret, Petitioner is uniquely
12 positioned to bring this matter to the court's attention because Petitioners will be directly impacted
13 by the potential adverse impact Project may have on Petitioner's operations.
14 20. Petitioner has standing in the public interest because this case involves public rights and
15 the enforcement of public duties. As lead and responsible agencies, Respondents have a
16 mandatory duty to comply with the procedural and substantive requirements of CEQA. Petitioner
17

18 is not seeking relief greater than or different from relief sought for the general public. If

19 successful, this action would enforce the mandates of CEQA, including the public's right to

20 adequate and informative environmental review under that statute and meaningful information

21 being provided to decision makers prior to the making of decisions affecting the environment.

22 21. California law, as articulated by the State's highest court is clear, "Public entities have,

23 inter alia, a mandatory duty to obey legislative enactments (Ramos v. County of Madera

24 (1971) 4 Cal.3d 685, 696.) Indeed, "It is elementary that public officials must themselves obey

25 the law." (Wirin v. Parker (1957) 48 Cal.2d 890, 894.) These obligations apply to Respondents.

26 22. Petitioner filed the claim alleged in this petition prior to the expiration of any applicable

27 statute of limitations in compliance with Public Resources Code section 21167, as this action was

28 brought within 180 days of commencement of the project. In alternative, if work on the Project

Fax: (559) 733-4922

1 commenced earlier than 180 days prior to this action, the work that began prior to that 180 days

2 was commenced without notice to Petitioner and was commenced in a manner that did not reveal

3 or trigger a duty to inquire into the project's possible environmental impacts. Further in the
alternative, Petitioners filed the claim within 2 weeks of discovering Real Parties in Interest's and
Stratford PUD's intention to install a sleeve that would haul human waste as part of the project.
6 VIOLATIONS OF CEQA
7 23. CEQA is California's primary statutory mandate for environmental protection. It applies
8 to all state and local agencies, and requires them to "first identify the [significant] environmental
9 effects of projects, and then to mitigate those adverse effects through the imposition of feasible
10 mitigation measures or through the selection of feasible alternatives." (Sierra Club v. State Board
11 of Forestry (1994) 7 Cal. 4th 1215, 1233. Its most important substantive imperative requires
12 "public agencies to deny approval of a project with significant adverse effects when feasible
13 alternatives or feasible mitigation measures can substantially lessen such effects." (Sierra Club
14 V. Gilroy City Council (1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 30, 41.)
15 24. CEQA's mandate for detailed environmental review "ensures that members of the
16 [governmental decision-making body] will fully consider the information necessary to render
17

18 decisions that intelligently take into account the environmental consequences" of their proposed

19 action. (Mountain Lion Foundation V. Fish and Game Commission (1997) 16 Cal.4th 105, 133;

20 Pub. Res. Code §§ 21080.5(d)(2)(D), 21091(d)(2); 14 C.C.R. [CEQA Guidelines] § 15088. The

21 CEQA process thus "protects not only the environmental but also informed self-government."

22 (Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Board of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 564.)

23 25. All California "public agencies" must comply with CEQA when they approve

24 discretionary projects. Respondents are public agencies participating in a project to move water

25 and sewage. Thus, their approvals of such a project is subject to CEQA.

26 26. In complying with CEQA procedures, an agency may not segment a project a to avoid

27 preparing an EIR on the entirety, or whole, of the project. (Guidelines § 15378(a), (c), § (d).)

28 CEQA's "requirements cannot be avoided by chopping up proposed projects into bite-size pieces

3 which, individually considered, might be found to have no significant effect on the environment

D or to be only ministerial." (Plan for Arcadia, Inc. v. City Council of Arcadia (1974) 42
Cal.App.3d 712, 726.)

n 27. In order to comply with CEQA, "an EIR must be performed before a project is approved,

7 for if post-approval environmental review were allowed, EIR's would likely become nothing
more than post hoc rationalizations to

8 support action already taken." (Save Tara v. City of West
Hollywood (2008) 45 Cal.4th 116, 130.)

9

10 28. In commencing a public project without a formal decision, Respondents violated CEQA
by the following:

s= Commencing

12 ublic project without formal approval through a properly noticed

13 public hearing by the decision-making body(s);

14
15 Failing to conduct an initial study to determine significant environmental effects;
Failure to prepare, circulate and hold a public hearing a a on a draft Environmental
Impact Report;

16
17

18 Failure to provide any mitigation measures whatsoever for environmental effects;

19 Failure to take official action approving the project after proper environmental
review and documentation; and

20 Improper piecemealing and failure to consider the whole of the action constituting
the project.

21

22

23 Other ways Respondents violated CEQA are currently unknown but will be proven
at the time of trial.

24 INADEQUATE REMEDY AT LAW - STAY AND INJUNCTION

25

26 29. Under Code of Civil Procedure sections 526, 1085, and 1094.5 and Public Resources Code

27 sections 21168 and 21168.5, the Court is authorized to impose a stay or to otherwise enjoin

28 operation of any administrative decision or order involved in this proceeding; this Court is also

RUDDELL
STANTON authorized to stay or enjoin further work on the project. With this Court's intervention to require

BIXLER MAURITSON & EVANS, LLP VORA, Chi Chinowth St. compliance with CEQA the public, along with Petitioner will be deprived of any analysis of the

Fax: (559) 733-4922 TULARE LAKE CANAL COMPANY'S VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 harm this Project will cause the environment in general and in particular in this water deprived,

2 environmentally sensitive area of California.

3 30. Because Real Parties in Interest and Respondents have already commenced action on

4 Project, irreparable harm is occurring due to no environmental review of the impacts of the
5 project. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law for the irreparable harm that
6 is occurring as a result of the commencement of the project. A stay or preliminary or permanent
7 injunction is necessary to restrain Respondents and Real Parties in Interest from taking further
8 actions until they have complied with CEQA.
9 31. A stay or injunction of Respondents' action relating to the project would not be against
10 the public interest because Respondents are required to conduct adequate environmental review
11 of the project prior to approval and commencement of the Project, the Project likely has
12 significant impacts on the environment, and Respondents will not be harmed by a stay or
13 injunction.
14 ATTORNEYS' FEES
15 32. In seeking to compel Respondents to lawfully discharge their mandatory public duties,
16

17 Petitioner is acting in its capacity as private attorneys general in the interest and for the benefit of

18 the public pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5, and any other applicable legal

19 theory, and the enforcement of important rights affecting the public interest. Issuance of the relief

20 requested in this Petition will constitute a significant public benefit by requiring Respondents to

21 carry out their duties as lead and responsible agencies under CEQA in compliance with the law.

22 33. Further, Petitioner brings this action on the basis, among other things, that Respondents

23 actions in connection with the project were and continue to be arbitrary and capricious. Pursuant

24 to Government Code section 800 and other applicable laws, Petitioner is entitled to reasonable

25 attorneys' fees for bringing this action to redress Respondents' arbitrary and capricious actions in

26 connection with the project

Re: TLC Pipeline Crossing

Mark,
I understand you have been talking with Carlo Wilcox on the 42" pipeline Sandridge is going to install under the TLC. In the spirit of cooperation and consideration, we have reached out to you to provide you with the crossing plans. As you are aware, Sandridge owns the parcels upon which the canal is located. We acknowledge the canal right of way is located on our property and we will ensure that the installation will not interfere with the canal or its operation. We intend to install the pipeline
next week.
This is pipeline is being installed by Sandridge, but will be used by Angiola Water District and
other associated entities as well. Sandridge and Angiola will hold TLCC harmless from any damages or
interference with the use and operation of the canal.

JEFFCOACH DECLARATION OF CRAIG ANDREW IN SUPPORT OF EX PARTE APPLICATION FOR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER AND ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE RE PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION

1 I, Craig Andrew, declare as follows:

2 1. I am Chief Operating Officer and Farm Manager for SANDRIDGE PARTNERS,
3 L.P ("Sandridge Partners"), a Cross-Complainant in the above-entitled action.

2. I have personal knowledge of the matters contained herein. As to those matters stated
5 upon information and belief, I believe said matters to be true and correct. If called upon to testify, I
6 could and would testify competently hereto.

3. I make this Declaration in Support of the Ex Parte Application for Order to Show

8 Cause Regarding Preliminary Injunction and Temporary Restraining Order filed by Cross-
Complainants Sandridge Partners, L.P. and Roller Land Company, Inc. (hereafter collectively
10 "Cross-Complainants".)

11 4. In my role as Farm Manager, I have been personally tasked by both Cross-
12 Complainants with the responsibility of overseeing the construction of the pipeline project being
13 laid across APN 026-230-010, which is the northern parcel to the canal at issue owned by Sandridge
14 and APN 026-230-011, which is the southern parcel to the canal at issue owned by Roller (hereafter
15 "the Property"). I have personal knowledge of all aspects of the project, as well as the facts that
16 relate to the two parcels at issue owned by the Cross-Complainants. The canal at issue runs between
17 the subject properties and is also owned by Cross-Complainants. Water flows through the canal
18 from time to time and runs from north west, flowing south east.

19 5. am intimately familiar with the subject properties as well as the canal that runs
20 through it as I have been employed at Sandridge Partners for over four (4) years and am frequently
21 on the properties as part of my employment, throughout all times of the year. In addition to my
22 employment with Sandridge Partners I have been employed in the farming industry in the Central
23 Valley for over a decade. Therefore, am aware of the irrigation schedule, including when water is
24 moved and delivered to various recipients for agricultural use.

25 6. Cross-Complainants have, together, embarked upon a construction project, whereby
26 one pipe and one sleeve will be built underground and will cross under Sandridge Partners' property,
27| under the subsurface of the canal, onto Roller Land's property and beyond. The construction was
28 contemplated for two reasons. First, the sleeve will be constructed to assist the City of Stratford,
WHITNEY
THOMPSON & 54.14 05642909.000 2
JEFFCOACH DECLARATION OF CRAIG ANDREW IN SUPPORT OF EX PARTE APPLICATION FOR TEMPORARY
RESTRAINING ORDER AND ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE RE PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION

1 located in Kings County, in transporting sewage water away from the City. This eight (8) inch sleeve
2 will lead from the City of Stratford, under property belonging to Sandridge Partners, under the
3 subsurface of the canal, and onto neighboring properties. Second, Cross-Complainants are in the
4 process of placing a underground pipe in order to transfer well water belonging to Sandridge
Partners for irrigation purposes. This pipeline is forty-eight (48) inches and will cross under
6 Sandridge Partners' property, under the subsurface of the canal, onto Roller Land's property and
7 beyond. All portions of the trench being dug, including the area that crosses the canal, are through
8 land owned by the Cross-Complainants.
7. On behalf of both Cross-Complainants, I have been working with our licensed I
10 general contractor in overseeing this Project. The safety protocols engineered by our team included
11 assurances that the top of the pipeline would be placed four feet below the bottom of the canal, with
12 three feet first filled with soil with confirmed 95% compaction (a rate of compaction that is a better
13 state than the canal is currently in) and for the final one foot, a cement slurry would be placed to act
14 as a barrier for protection of the integrity of the pipes in the event any maintenance or repair work
15 is performed in the future in the canal. In short, the underground pipeline was engineered, designed
16 and approved in a manner in which would not interfere with the flow of water in the canal.
17 8. The process of (1) digging the trench, (2) temporarily damming any minimal residual
18 water in the canal, (3) installing the pipeline and sleeve, and (4) re-covering the pipeline and sleeve
19 and testing for compaction was scheduled to be completed within five (5) days. This portion of the
20 project was scheduled to commence on January 26, 2022.
21 9. When planning this project with our contractor, we were aware that Cross-Defendant
22 Tulare Lake Canal Company, Inc. uses the canal during certain times of the year to transport water.
23 Of importance to the present action is that the placement of the pipeline and sleeve at issue will not
24 interfere with the water being moved by any third parties in the canal. In addition, we strategically
25 selected the month of January to commence this Project because third parties typically do not use
26 this portion of the canal to deliver water during this time of year. In my experience in the agriculture
27 industry in the area, and my personal experience and observations over the past four (4) years in

28
WHITNEY
THOMPSON & 54.14 05642909.000
JEFFCOACH DECLARATION OF CRAIG ANDREW IN SUPPORT OF EX PARTE APPLICATION FOR TEMPORARY
RESTRAINING ORDER AND ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE RE PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION

observing the use of the canal at issue, I am aware that Tulare Lake Canal Company does not use

2 the canal for delivery in the winter months in the area of the pipeline project.

3 10. In fact, on January 26, 2022, the day the trenching for the pipe and sleeve under the
4 subsurface of the canal was set to commence, I personally observed that there was no water being
5 run in this portion of the canal, and the canal contained approximately only one foot of residual
6 water at the location where the trench was to be dug. I went back to the canal on January 28, 2022
7 to confirm this, and took the photograph attached hereto as Exhibit "A", which shows one of our
8 employee standing in the canal with a measuring tape which records only about 11.5 inches of water

9 at the center of the canal. In my experience with irrigation and use of this specific canal for water
10 delivery, this level is consistent with only residual water and not indicative of an active use of the
11 canal for delivery.
12 11. In an attempt at being courteous, am aware that Sandridge Partners, through several
13 of its consultants, and directly, communicated with Tulare Lake Canal Company in an effort to let
14 it know of our plans to lay the pipeline and sleeve and also to make clear that we would perform the
15 work across the canal during these winter months to avoid any disruption to its use of the canal for
16 water delivery. In fact, as recently as January 17, 2022, it was communicated that our trench work
17 would commence shortly in order to avoid any interference with Tulare Lake Canal Company's
18 movement of water.

19 12. Despite the fact that Cross-Complainants hold title to all portions of the land at issue,
20 including the canal and its embankments, on January 26, 2022, Cross-Defendants, without our
21 permission, came onto the subject properties and parked several pieces of large construction
22 machinery (including but not limited to trucks, trailers, excavators, motor graders and bulldozers)
23 on the embankments of the canal, within the staked parameters of where the trenching was to take
24 place for the Project. I was at the construction site on January 26, 2022 and personally observed
25 Cross-Defendants' obstruction of the Project. The machines and other equipment were parked along
26 the two embankments along the canal essentially forming a wall to block the trench of the Project.
27 Attached as Exhibit "B" hereto is a true and correct copy of a photo took on January 26, 2022 of
28 the equipment placed on Cross-Complainants' Property by Cross-Defendants.

THOMPSON & 54.14 05642909.000 4
JEFFCOACH DECLARATION OF CRAIG ANDREW IN SUPPORT OF EX PARTE APPLICATION FOR TEMPORARY
RESTRAINING ORDER AND ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE RE PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION

1 13. I personally observed that most, but not all of the equipment on the property have
2 Wood Bros.' logo affixed to the equipment.

3 14. As of the date of the filing of the Cross-Complaint, Cross-Defendants' equipment
4 unlawfully remained on Cross-Complainants' properties, preventing the completion of the project.
However, as of the date of the filing of the present Ex Parte Application, we have been informed
6 and believe that Wood Bros. has removed its equipment, or is in the process of removing its
equipment which was blocking the contemplated project. However, additional equipment belonging
8 to the remaining Cross-Defendants or their agents unlawfully remains on Cross-Complainants'
9 properties, preventing the completion of their project. Thus, the injunctive relief requested in the
10 present Ex Parte Application is necessary to prevent Cross-Defendants from the ongoing and
11 continuing trespass at issue.

12 15. Given Cross-Defendants' intentional ongoing blocking of the canal where the
13 construction was to take place, we remain unable to continue with the contemplated Project, which
14 means that Cross-Complainants' ability to access and use their land is being thwarted, and their
15 plans, once the Project is complete, to move water to irrigate crops for other commercial purposes,

16 and to assist the City of Stratford in removing sewage, are being prevented.

17 16. Despite any permission it may have to access the canal at issue to move water, Tulare
18 Lake Canal Company has exceeded the scope of any such permission by intentionally entering the
19 subject properties belonging to Cross-Complainants, without permission, and unlawfully placing,
20 or causing to be placed, large equipment and/or machinery on the property for the exclusive purpose
21 of preventing the Project from being completed. If delayed more than a couple of months, this will
22 cause Cross-Complainants to be unable to irrigate crops and thus cause irreparable injury to the
23 cultivated farmland. Such losses would take years to recover from.

24 17. Given Cross-Defendants' refusal to remove the equipment at issue, it is likely that
25 they will continues to trespass on Cross-Complainants' property without Cross-Complainants*
26 consent unless they are restrained from doing so by Court of law.

27 18. Cross-Complainants continue to be damaged in several ways, including but not
28 limited to the costs of their contractors for days they were mobilized, but unable to work as a result

- of Cross-Defendants' blockade, the delay to the Project causing the inability to move water for its
2 bencficial use and commercial purposes, and the

3 to r'emove sewage. Damages inability to assist the City of Stratford in its efforts
are ongoing and increase every day that the trespassing equipment
4 remains in place in and the Project is prevented from being completed.

5 19. Additional harm resulting from Cross-Defendant's offending conduct cannot be
6 measured or it would be extremely difficult to ascertain the amount of compensation required to
7 afford full and adequate relief. It is difficult, if not impossible 1o quantify the damages currently
8 being caused by Cross-Defendants' wrongful conduct and such conduct is depriving Cross-
9 Complainants of its use and enjoyment of property, as well as hindering their ability to assist the
10 City of Stratford in its efforts to remove sewage.

l1 20. Cross-Defendant Tulare Lake Canal Company has ignored our requests that they
12 remove the equipment and the Sherriff's office has even been involved to no avail.

Dear Department of Transportation:
PLEASE TAKE NOTICE, under Public Resources Code section 21167.5, Petitioner, TULARE LAKE CANAL COMPANY has filed a petition under the provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act against Respondents Stratford Public Utility District and Angiola Water District challenging its commencement of a public project in violation of CEQA. A copy of the filed petition is attached to this notice. Further, as set forth below, Petitioner intends to amend the Petition substituting the State of California, Department of Transportation ("Caltrans") as DOE 1. A copy of the Amendment to the Petition to be filed by Petitioner is attached to this notice.
On February 16, 2022 my office caused to be filed a Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate
under the provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act against Respondents Stratford Public Utility District, Angiola Water District and Real Parties in Interest, Sandridge Partners, L.P. and Roller Land Co. challenging its commencing of a public project in violation of CEQA.
6 As both Stratford Public Utility District and Angiola Water District are aware, Sandridge Partners, L.P. and Roller Land Company, Inc. are currently trenching and installing a pipe line extending from near Lemoore, California to the Blakely Canal with the intention of moving groundwater and surface water from unknown sources to unknown
consumers. Angiola Water District has stated in no uncertain terms that it is involved
in this project and has undertaken affirmative steps to facilitate the project's completion despite never having considered the environmental impacts of the project.

At the same time, Sandridge Partners and Roller Land Co. are installing a sleeve for yet Page 2 of 2

another pipe line with the intention of hauling human waste from a portion of the area, or all of the area, served by the Stratford Public Utility District, again without having considered the environmental impacts of this project. They have done so by approving the commencement of the projects without a formal vote, without public hearing, and without providing the decision makers with the information necessary to make decisions
about CEQA's applicability to the projects and the extent of review appropriate to them.
It has been determined that the pipe line project has encroached upon State Route 198,
thereby passing under the highway without the issuance of an encroachment permit that would authorize Defendants and Real Parties in Interest to place the pipe line under
a state highway. In that regard, I intend to amend the Petition substituting the State of
elojel Sandra California, Department of Transportation ("Caltrans") as DOE 1.
We expect to be filing the amendment to the petition in the next few days. A copy of the amendment is enclosed. We look forward to pursuing a resolution to this issue with the Department of Transportation, as I am sure the Respondents and the Real Parties in
