- I. INTRODUCTION

2 1.

3 The Grayson Power Plant (*Grayson" or "Power Plant") is an outmoded facility at

4 the end of its useful life in the City of Glendale ("City" or "Glendale"). Rather than taking this

5 moment to develop a realistic picture of its energy needs and how to meet those needs in a way

6 that protects health and the environment, the Glendale City Council adopted a project to install

7 five new natural gas fired engines ("Grayson Repowering Project" or "the Project").

2.

8 As required by the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), the City

9 prepared an environmental impact report ("EIR") to identify and analyze the environmental

10 impacts of the Grayson Repowering Project. The fundamental goal of CEQA is to ensure that

11 decisionmakers and the public have complete information about the environmental impacts of a

12 proposed project before its approval. However, the EIR for the Grayson Repowering Project

13 misinforms the public and decisionmakers to justify a project that continues to rely on
combustion to generate electricity.

14 3.

15 The Project Description in the EIR paints an inaccurate and incomplete picture of

16 the Project that dramatically inflates Glendale's energy needs. Glendale Water and Power uses

17 this inflated energy need to arbitrarily reject several viable alternatives, including a feasible clean

18 energy alternative that could accelerate Glendale's transition away from fossil fuels and reduce

19 impacts to health and the environment. This inflated energy need also disguises Glendale's

20 potential sale of excess fossil-fired energy to neighboring regions.

4.

21 Additionally, the EIR overlooks the potentially significant and harmful effects of

22 the Grayson Repowering Project on environmental justice communities. Although the EIR shows

23 that the Project will lead to an increase in air toxins and pollutants, the EIR ignores the resulting
impacts to surrounding environmental justice communities.

24 5.

25 Further, the EIR includes plans to burn hydrogen as part of the Grayson

26 Repowering Project but fails to analyze the impacts related to burning hydrogen.

6.

27 Despite these deficiencies in the EIR, the Glendale City Council certified the EIR

28 and approved the Grayson Repowering Project. The fundamental flaws in the EIR contradict

- 2 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

-

2 CEQA's requirement to ensure that decisionmakers and the public understand the impacts of

3 projects on the environment and take steps to reduce those impacts when feasible. Accordingly,

4 the EIR is legally deficient and unfit for certification under CEQA.

II. PARTIES

5 7.

6 Petitioner SIERRA CLUB is a non-profit, grassroots environmental organization

7 dedicated to exploring, enjoying, and protecting the wild places of the earth; to practicing and

8 promoting the responsible use of the earth's ecosystems and resources; to educating and

9 encouraging humanity to protect and restore the quality of the natural and human environment;

10 and to using all lawful means to carry out these objectives. Sierra Club is one of the oldest and

11 largest conservation groups in the country, with more than 800,000 members nationally in over

12 60 chapters in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. Sierra Club's particular

13 interest in this case and the issues concerning this case stem from Sierra Club's goals to reduce

14 reliance on fossil fuels and protect the health of vulnerable communities. The Sierra Club's

15 Verdugo Hills Group is one of 14 Regional Groups of the Angeles Chapter of the Sierra Club.

16 The Verdugo Hills Group works in partnership with the Glendale Environmental Coalition as
well as Burbank activists to support climate, clean

17 energy, solid waste, and other environmental

18 issues. Sierra Club has approximately 1,200 members in the Verdugo Hills Group and nearly

19 40,000 members in the Angeles Chapter that will be impacted by the Grayson Repowering

20 Project. These members live, work, and recreate in cities that are affected by the proposed

21 project. The Sierra Club participated extensively in the CEQA administrative process the City

22 used to develop and approve the Grayson Repowering Project. Specifically, the Sierra Club

23 submitted a petition with over 200 Glendale resident signatures opposing the Grayson

24 Repowering Project, filed comments identifying deficiencies in the City's Draft and Final EIRs,
and testified at numerous meetings.

25 8.

26 By this action, Petitioner seeks to protect the health, welfare, and economic

27 interests of its members and the general public and to enforce a public duty owed to them by the

28 City of Glendale. Petitioner's members have an interest in their health and well-being, as well as

- 3 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

-

2 conservation, environmental, aesthetic, and economic interests in the Los Angeles environment.

3 Petitioner's members who live, work, and recreate near the Grayson Power Plant and in Los

4 Angeles County have a right to, and a beneficial interest in, the City of Glendale's compliance

5 with CEQA. These interests have been, and continue to be, threatened by the City's decision to

6 certify the EIR and approve the Project in violation of CEQA, and unless the relief requested in

7 this case is granted, will continue to be adversely affected and irreparably injured by the failure
of the City of Glendale to comply with the law.

8 9.

9 Respondent, CITY OF GLENDALE ("City" or "Glendale") is a political

10 subdivision of the State of California organized and existing under the laws of the State of

11 California, with the capacity to sue and be sued. The City is the lead agency charged with

12 principal responsibility for ensuring the Project's compliance with CEQA, pursuant to Public
Resources Code section 21067.

13 10.

14 Respondent, GLENDALE CITY COUNCIL is the decision-making body for the

15 City of Glendale. The City Council certified the EIR, approved the Grayson Repowering Project,

16 and filed the Notice of Determination for these actions on February 17, 2022.

11.

17 Respondent, GLENDALE WATER AND POWER ("GWP") is a municipal

18 utility that serves the City of Glendale. GWP prepared the EIR and related CEQA findings that
the City Council ultimately certified and adopted.

19 12.

20 As referred to herein, "the City" consists of all councils, boards, commissions,

21 and departments, including the current five-member Glendale City Council.

13.

22 The true names and capacities, whether individual, corporate, or otherwise, of

23 DOES 1 through 20, inclusive, are unknown to Petitioner. Petitioner will amend this Petition and

24 Complaint to set forth the true names and capacities of said Doe parties when they have been

ascertained.

25 III. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

26 14.

27 This Court has jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandate to set aside the City's

28 decision pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5, or, in the alternative, pursuant to

- 4 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

-

2 section 1085. Judicial review is governed under Public Resources Code section 21168.5, or, in
the alternative, pursuant to section 21168.

3 15.

4 This Court has jurisdiction over Petitioner's claim for declaratory relief under

Code of Civil Procedure section 1060.

5 16.

6 Venue is proper in this court pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 395

7 because the City of Glendale, its City Council, and the proposed project are currently located, or
will be located, in Los Angeles County.

8 17.

9 393 and 394. Venue is also proper in the Court pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections

10 18.

11 This action was timely filed within 30 days of the Glendale City Council's filing

12 of the Notice of Determination approving the Project and the EIR with the Los Angeles County

13 Clerk on February 17, 2022. The County Clerk posted the Notice on its website that same day, in

14 accordance with Public Resources Code section 21167, subdivision (c) and California Code of
Regulations, title 14, section 15112, subdivision (c)(1).'

15 19.

16 Petitioner has provided written notice of its intent to file this petition to the City

17 of Glendale, Glendale City Council, and Glendale Water and Power and is including the notice

18 and proof of service as Exhibit A pursuant to the requirements of Public Resources Code section
21167.5.

19 20.

20 Petitioner has served the Attorney General with a copy of its Petition along with

21 a notice of its filing, in compliance with Public Resources Code section 21167.7 and Code of

22 Civil Procedure section 388, and is including the notice and proof of service as Exhibit B.

21.

3 IV. STATEMENT OF FACTS

4 A. The Community and Environmental Setting

5 23.

6 The City of Glendale is home to approximately 203,054 people.2 Located in the

7 San Fernando Valley and Verdugo Mountain regions, Glendale is the fourth-largest city in Los
Angeles County, encompassing about 30 square miles.3

8 24.

9 Glendale is surrounded by other cities and communities in Los Angeles County,

10 including the City of Los Angeles and Burbank. Glendale is bordered to the northwest by the

11 Sun Valley and Tujunga neighborhoods; to the northeast by La Cañada Flintridge and the

12 unincorporated area of La Crescenta; to the west by Griffith Park; to the east by Eagle Rock and

13 Pasadena; to the south by the Atwater Village neighborhood of Los Angeles; and to the southeast

14 by the Glassell Park neighborhood of Los Angeles. The City sits minutes from downtown Los
Angeles, Hollywood, and Universal City.

15 25.

16 The Grayson Power Plant is surrounded by several residential neighborhoods

17 including Pelanconi, Grand Central, Riverside Rancho, Fremont Park, Verdugo Viejo,

18 Grandview, and Vineyard. Grayson sits within one mile of four childcare centers and about one

19 mile away from several public schools, including Benjamin Franklin Elementary School,

20 Thomas Jefferson Elementary School, Eleanor J. Toll Middle School, and Herbert Hoover High
School.

21 26.

22 Glendale sits in the South Coast Air Basin, which has the dirtiest air in the

23 country. The South Coast Air Basin remains in "extreme" nonattainment of various air quality

24 standards established under the Federal Clean Air Act. In particular, the South Coast Air Basin

- has never met the Federal Clean Air Act's ozone standards.4

2 27.

3 Ozone is a harmful air pollutant that forms when Volatile Organic Compounds

4 react with Nitrogen Oxides in the presence of heat and sunlight. Ozone compromises lung

5 function in children and causes negative health effects such as coughing and sore throat, burning

6 eyes, aggravated lung diseases and increased asthma attacks, and heightened risk of heart attacks.

28.

7 CalEnviroScreen5 is a mapping tool, developed by California's Office of

8 Environmental Health Hazard Assessment, that assesses communities at the census tract level to

9 identify those most burdened by pollution from multiple sources and those most vulnerable to its

10 effects, considering socioeconomic factors and underlying health status. Based on these factors,

11 census tracts are assigned a percentile score from 1 to 100. The higher a census tract's percentile

12 score, the greater the pollution burdens and population vulnerabilities of residents in that tract.

13 The Grayson Power Plant sits in a census tract that scores in the 98th percentile of

14 CalEnviroScreen, meaning that the tract ranks higher than 98% of all other census tracts in

15 California for a combination of pollution burden and population vulnerability. A majority of the

16 tracts surrounding the Power Plant have a CalEnviroScreen score in the 80th percentile and
above. See Figure 1.

23 Nitrogen Oxides are produced from the reaction of nitrogen and oxygen gases in the air during 24 combustion (including natural gas and hydrogen combustion) at high temperatures. Volatile
25 Organic Compounds, gases that are emitted into the air from products or processes, can be found

26 In natural gas fuel (e.g., formaldehyde and benzene) and can lead to emissions when not
completely combusted.

15 B. Project Background
16 29. In 2016, GWP proposed the Grayson Repowering Project. The proposed project
17 involved replacing the existing fossil fuel burning units at Grayson with new fossil fuel burning
18 units. The new units would provide Glendale with approximately 278 Megawatts (*MW") of
19 energy. As required by CEQA, GWP released a Draft EIR for the Grayson Repowering Project
20 on September 15, 2017, and presented the 2018 Final EIR to the Glendale City Council on April
21 10, 2018.

22 30. The Glendale City Council declined to certify the 2018 Final EIR and directed
23 GWP to consider clean energy alternatives to meet Glendale's energy needs.
24 31. In response, GWP issued a Clean Energy Request for Proposals ("RFP"),
25 evaluated and modeled the proposals received through the Clean Energy RFP, and identified a
26 new portfolio of resources to meet the City's energy needs. This portfolio included 50 MW of
27 clean distributed energy resources, such as demand response and energy efficiency programs.
28
- 8 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- 32.

2 Based on this updated portfolio, GWP developed two new project alternatives

3 Alternative 7 and Alternative 8in addition to the six alternatives developed in the previous
2018 Final EIR.

4 33.

5 The Tesla/Wartsila Repowering Project Alternative ("Alternative 7"), identified

6 by GWP as the "environmentally superior alternative," repowers the Power Plant with five gas-

7 fired engines that will produce 93 MW of energy coupled with a 75 MW/300 MWH battery
energy storage system.

8 34.

9 The Tesla/Unit 8 Refurbishment Project Alternative ("Alternative 8"), refurbishes

10 existing units at the Power Plant to produce 101 MW of energy coupled with a 75 MW/300
MWH battery storage system.

11 35.

12 In 2021, GWP issued a Partially Recirculated Draft EIR (°2021 PR-DEIR")

13 identifying and analyzing the environmental impacts of Alternative 7 and Alterative 8.

36.

14 In the 2021 PR-DEIR, GWP claims that Glendale is subject to an excessive

15 reserve obligation and uses this to justify installing new fossil fuel units at the Grayson Power
Plant and reject clean energy alternatives.

16 37.

17 Specifically, GWP asserts that Glendale is obligated by law to meet an N-1-15

18 reserve obligation. But GWP is not obligated by law to meet an N-1-1 reserve obligation, and its

19 assertion impacts the validity of its entire environmental impact analysis. For example, GWP's

20 assertion of an N-1-1 reserve obligation results in an oversized project that will cause increased

21 environmental impacts beyond what would occur if the Project was sized to meet Glendale's

22 actual, and significantly smaller, reserve obligation. This oversized Project would enable GWP

23 to sell excess energy to neighboring regions during periods of peak demand. Further, GWP uses

24 the purported N-1-1 reserve obligation to dismiss project alternatives that reduce impacts from
the Grayson Repowering Project.

25 38.

26 The 2021 PR-DEIR also claims that the Grayson Repowering Project will have no

27

28 6 N-1-1 refers to energy reserve for GWP's single largest source of energy (100 MW) and its second largest source of energy (48MW) during peak load conditions.
- 9-

-

2 environmental justice impacts. GWP justifies this claim by noting that no environmental justice

3 communities exist in Glendale. But data from CalEnviroScreen shows that the Grayson Power

4 Plant sits in a census tract in Glendale that scores in the highest percentile category for pollution

5 burden and vulnerability of residents to its effects. The communities in Glendale surrounding the

6 Grayson Power Plant also have high percentile scores on CalEnviroScreen. In addition, the

7 Grayson Power Plant sits at the border of Glendale, Burbank, and Los Angeles. Yet GWP

8 refused to identify and analyze potential impacts to overburdened and vulnerable communities in

9 these cities before claiming that the Project will have no environmental justice impacts.

39.

10 Further, the 2021 PR-DEIR fails to analyze foreseeable impacts of the Project

11 from burning hydrogen. The 2021 PR-DEIR discloses GWP's future plan to burn hydrogen in

12 the fossil fuel burning units included in Alternative 7 and Alternative 8. Burning hydrogen can

13 have significant negative impacts on the communities surrounding the Grayson Power Plant.

14 Combustion of hydrogen-natural gas blends produces significant quantities of pollution,

15 including Nitrogen Oxide emissions that far exceed emissions from burning natural gas alone.

16 However, the 2021 PR-DEIR fails to analyze the impact of burning hydrogen and therefore fails

17 to inform the public about the foreseeable impacts from the Grayson Repowering Project.

40.

18 Petitioner, as well as concerned residents from Glendale, Burbank, and Los

19 Angeles, raised concerns about the 2021 PR-DEIR's inflated energy need, its inadequate

20 environmental justice analysis, and its failure to analyze the impacts of burning hydrogen

21 throughout the City's CEQA administrative process. Nevertheless, GWP did not correct these

22 deficiencies in the 2021 PR-DEIR before issuing the 2022 Final EIR for the Grayson
Repowering Project.

23 41.

24 The Glendale City Council voted to certify the 2022 Final EIR and approve

25 Alternative 7 by a 3-2 vote on February 15, 2022. The Notice of Determination was filed on
February 17, 2022.

26

27 V. CEQA LEGAL BACKGROUND

42.

28 The California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code sections

10 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

-

2 21000-21177, is a comprehensive statute designed to provide for long-term protection of the

3 environment. It accomplishes this in two ways. First, CEQA is designed to inform is

4 decisionmakers and the public about the potential significant environmental effects of a project.

5 CEQA Guidelines, § 15002, subd. (a)(1). Such disclosure ensures that "long term protection of

6 the environment ... shall be the guiding criterion in public decisions." Pub. Resources Code §

7 21001, subd. (d). The EIR is the "heart" of this requirement. See No Oil, Inc. V. City of Los

8 Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 84. The EIR has been described as "an environmental 'alarm bell'

9 whose purpose it is to alert the public and its responsible officials to environmental changes

10 before they have reached ecological points of no return." County of Inyo v. Yorty (1973) 32
Cal.App.3d 795, 810.

11 43.

12 Second, CEQA requires public agencies to avoid or reduce environmental damage

13 whenever feasible by considering changes in projects through project alternatives or mitigation

14 measures. See CEQA Guidelines, § 15002(a)(2) and (3); see also Citizens of Goleta Valley v.

15 Board of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 564; Laurel Heights Improvement Association v.

16 Regents of the University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 399 [as modified on rehg. denied

17 Jan. 26, 1989]. An accurate and complete project description is central to this requirement so

18 "affected outsiders and public decision-makers [can] balance the proposal's benefit against its

19 environmental cost, consider mitigation measures, assess the advantage of terminating the

20 proposal (i.e., the 'no project' alternative), and weigh other alternatives in the balance." County

21 of Inyo v. City of Los Angeles (1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 185, 192-193.
FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

22

23 44. (Violation of CEQA: Inaccurate and Incomplete Project Description)

24 Petitioner incorporates herein by reference the allegations contained in the
foregoing paragraphs.

25 45.

26 CEQA requires an EIR to include an accurate and complete project description

27 that fully discloses and fairly evaluates the nature and objectives of a project. CEQA Guidelines,

28 cop 15124. An accurate and complete project description is necessary SO that the lead agency and

- 11 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR

-

2 the public have enough information to "ascertain the project's environmentally significant

3 effects, assess ways of mitigating them, and consider project alternatives." Sierra Club v. City of

4 Orange (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 523, 533; Save Round Valley Alliance v. County of Inyo (2007)

8 (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 646, 655 [quoting County of Inyo V. City of Los Angeles, supra, 71

9 Cal.App.3d at p. 199.] If a project description gives "conflicting signals to decisionmakers and

10 the public about the nature and scope of the activity being proposed" it is fundamentally

11 inadequate, misleading, and meaningful public participation is stultified. Communities for a

12 Better Environment v. City of Richmond (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 70, 84 [quoting San Joaquin
Raptor, supra, 149 Cal.App.4th at p. 670.]

13 47.

14 The 2022 Final EIR presents an inaccurate and incomplete Project Description

15 that inflates Glendale's reserve obligation to justify the installation of new fossil fuel burning
units at the Grayson Power Plant.

16 48.

17 The Project Description fails to disclose to decisionmakers that GWP's proposal

18 to install fossil fuel burning units includes potential plans to produce and sell excess fossil-fired
energy to neighboring regions.

19 49.

20 The 2022 Final EIR's inflation of the City's reserve obligation leads to the

21 rejection of several viable alternatives to the Project that would have less health and

22 environmental impacts, including an 100% clean energy alternative.

50.

23 By certifying the 2022 Final EIR with an inaccurate and incomplete Project

24 Description, the City committed prejudicial abuse of discretion, failed to proceed in the manner

25 required by law, and acted without substantial evidentiary support in violation of CEQA.

28 Petitioner incorporates herein by reference the allegations contained in the

- 12 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- foregoing paragraphs.

2 52.

3 The CEQA Guidelines require an EIR to identify and analyze the impacts of a

4 project with "a sufficient degree of analysis to provide decisionmakers with information which

5 enables them to make a decision which intelligently takes account of environmental
consequences." CEQA Guidelines, § 15151.

6 53.

7 The omission of relevant information is deemed prejudicial if it prevents informed

8 decision making and public participation, "regardless of whether a different outcome would have

9 resulted if the public agency had complied with those provisions." Washoe Meadows Community

10 v. Department of Parks & Recreation (2017) 17 Cal.App.5th 277, 290; citing Pub. Resources
Code, § 21005, subd. (a).

11 54.

12 The Final EIR improperly dismisses the potential environmental justice impacts

13 of the Grayson Repowering Project. The communities surrounding the Grayson Power Plant

14 have some of the highest percentile scores on CalEnviroScreen, which reflects the

15 disproportionate environmental and socio-economic burdens these communities bear.

16 Nevertheless, the 2022 Final EIR dismisses such information and disregards the potential

17 impacts from the Grayson Repowering Project to these communities. Further, the 2022 Final EIR

18 only considers communities in Glendale when dismissing potential environmental justice

19 impacts, even though the Grayson Repowering Project has the potential to impact communities

20 in Los Angeles and Burbank as well. By excluding communities from these other cities in its

21 analysis of environmental justice impacts, the 2022 Final EIR subverts CEQA's fundamental
informational requirement.

22 55.

23 By certifying the 2022 Final EIR with an inaccurate and incomplete

24 environmental justice analysis, the City committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion, failed to

25 proceed in the manner required by law, and acted without substantial evidentiary support.

environmental effects)

4 56.

5 Petitioner incorporates herein by reference the allegations contained in the

6 57.

7 CEQA Guidelines require the preparation of a single EIR for a series of actions

8 that nonetheless constitute a single, larger project. CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15165, 15168, 15378.

58.

9 An EIR must analyze the environmental effects of a future action when (1) it is a

10 reasonably foreseeable consequence of the initial project; and (2) the future expansion or action
will be significant in that it will likely change the scope or

11 nature of the initial project or its

12 environmental effects. Laurel Heights Improvement Association, supra,

59. 47 Cal. 3d at p. 396.

13 In the 2022 Final EIR, GWP anticipates burning hydrogen at the Grayson Power

14 Plant. Nevertheless, the 2022 Final EIR fails to analyze any of the foreseeable impacts of

15 burning hydrogen at the Grayson Power Plant--including impacts from transporting and storing
hydrogen.

16 60.

17 By certifying the 2022 Final EIR without analyzing the impacts associated with

18 burning hydrogen at Grayson, the City committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion, failed to

19 proceed in the manner required by law, and acted without substantial evidentiary support.

RE: Notice of Intent to File California Environmental Quality Act Petition
Challenging the Certification of the Environmental Impact Report for the
Grayson Repowering Project (State Clearinghouse No. 2016121048)

Dear City Clerk Aram Adjemian:

PLEASE TAKE NOTICE that as required under California Public Resources Code
section 21167.5, Sierra Club ("Petitioner") hereby provides notice of its intent to file
a verified petition for writ of mandate under the California Environmental Quality
Act ("CEQA") against the City of Glendale, Glendale City Council, and Glendale
Water and Power ("Respondents") in Los Angeles County Superior Court. (See Pub.
Res. Code § 21000, et seq.)

Petitioner seeks to challenge the City of Glendale's approval and certification of the
Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") for the Grayson Repowering Project
(*Project") on February 15, 2022. Petitioner will file this CEQA challenge based on
the EIR's failure to adequately disclose and evaluate the Project's significant
environmental impacts.

Among other relief, Petitioner will request that the Court issue a writ of mandate
ordering the City of Glendale to vacate the EIR certification and recirculate an EIR
that conforms to CEQA requirements. Additionally, Petitioner will seek costs and
attorneys' fees. (See Cal. Civ. Proc. § 1021.5.)

Based on the reasons outlined above, Respondents should immediately vacate the
