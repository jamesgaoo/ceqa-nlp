23 INTRODUCTION

24 1. This action challenges the January 25, 2022 decision of the Riverside County

25 Board of Supervisors ("Board of Supervisors"), which evaluated the August 18, 2021 actions

26 taken by the Riverside County Planning Commission (the "Planning Commission," collectively

27 with the Board of Supervisors "Respondents"), in approving Plot Plan No. 26346 and Tentative

28 Parcel Map No. 37398 ("Approvals"). Tentative Parcel Map No. 37398 proposes to subdivide

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 two parcels of land totaling 10.98 gross acres into five (5) commercial lots. Plot Plan 26346

2 proposes to construct a commercial and retail center comprised of a 31,900 square foot grocery

3 store, a 10,000 square foot retail store, a 7,027 square foot tire shop, a 3,000 square foot drive-

4 through restaurant, and a 4,133 square foot car wash on approximately 7.3 acres of land

5 ("Project").
2.
6 Respondents had prepared Environmental Assessment No. 43062, which included
the Initial Study/Mitigated Negative Declaration ("IS/MND"), dated June 2021, a mere two
7 months before the Project Approvals were summarily granted by the Planning Commission. The
8 Project borders multiple residential neighborhoods to the north. The IS/MND failed, however, to
9 evaluate whole segments of Environmental Impact issues as required by the California

10 Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), embodied in Public Resources Code ("PRC") §§ 21000,

11 el seq, and the CEQA Guidelines, embodied at 14 Cal. Code Regs., et seq. Respondents'

12 approach to Environmental review of the Project's Impacts is fundamentally inadequate under

13 CEQA. Respondents have failed to conduct an informationally adequate Environmental review

14 that sufficiently analyzes the Project's Impacts on the Environment and on Human Health. As

15 such, Respondents have failed to proceed in manner required by law.
3. Furthermore, Respondents have failed to explain how their Findings in the
16 IS/MND are supported by substantial evidence in the Administrative Record. For instance, the
17 IS/MND identified potentially Significant Impacts to Biological Resources, Cultural Resources,
18 Transportation, Tribal Cultural Resources, and Mandatory Findings of Significance. The
19 IS/MND then sought to reduce such Impacts by implementing inadequate and illusory Mitigation

20 Measures on the Project without an adequate explanation as to how such proposed Mitigation

21 Measures will reduce the harmful Impacts.

22 4. Members of Petitioners participated in the Public review process for the Project,

23 providing detailed comments and expert analysis on the sufficiency of the IS/MND's analysis,

24 identifying unanalyzed Environmental Impacts, and introducing substantial evidence relevant to
those Impacts. Respondents, in turn, failed to take the issues raised by Petitioners seriously.
25 Rather than address the significant gaps in the IS/MND's analysis, Respondents ignored the
26 Public's concerns regarding the Project's Impacts on the Environment and Human Health. The
27 Planning Commission and Board of Supervisors have each demonstrated that it has approached
28 this Project with tunnel vision. Immense Public concern was not enough for Respondents to

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
-2 -

1 entertain modifications to the Project, or Mitigation of, its Significant Environmental Impacts.
2 Accordingly, Petitioners seek a writ of mandate ordering Respondents to set aside the Project

3 Approvals and the adoption of the IS/MND, and to conduct a reasonable and adequate

4 Environmental review of the Project.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE
5. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
7 ("CCP") §§ 187, 526, 1085, and 1094.5, and PRC §§ 21168 and 21168.5. This Court also has the
8 a authority to issue a writ of mandate directing the Board of Supervisors to vacate and set aside the
9 Project Approvals for the Project under the CCP §§ 1085 and 1094.5. Venue for this action lies

10 in this Court because Petitioners live and work in Riverside County and because Respondents

11 and the Project are located in Riverside County.

12 6. Petitioner, FRIENDS OF GUENTHER WILLOWS PARK, is an unincorporated

13 association of residents, including individual Petitioner, Shirley Labrador, who lives and works

14 in and around the Sky Canyon Retail Center. Petitioners are adversely affected by the Project

15 Approvals and are beneficially interested in the quality of life in and around the Sky Canyon

16 Retail Center through responsible construction project planning and development,
7. Petitioners are beneficially and directly interested in the actions of the Planning
17 Commission and Board of Supervisors in Approving the Project, which would directly, adversely
18 and irreparably affect Petitioners, the Environment, and the larger community near the Sky

19 Canyon Retail Center, as described herein.

20

21 THE PARTIES

22 8. Petitioner, Friends of Guenther Willows Park, is an unincorporated association

23 whose members are adversely affected by the Impacts on Traffic, Air Quality, Greenhouse Gas

24 Emissions, Geology/Soils, Hazards and Hazardous Materials, Noise, Population/Housing,

25 Human Health, Public Services, Utilities, Service Systems and Wildfire danger as well as

26 negative Impacts on the adjacent Tucalota Creek created by the construction and operation of
the Project. Petitioners include individuals and their families, who live and work in the
27 community surrounding the Sky Canyon Retail Center. Because they are local residents, the
28 individual members of Friends of Guenther Willows Park would be directly affected by the

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
-3 •

1 Impacts on Traffic, Air Quality, Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Geology/Soils, Hazards and

2 Hazardous Materials, Noise, Population/Housing, Human Health, Public Services, Utilities,

3 Service Systems and Wildfire danger as well as negative Impacts on the adjacent Tucalota

4 Creek created by the Project. In addition, individual members may also work on the Project

5 itself. As such, they would be first in line to be exposed to any Health and Safety hazards that

6 exist on the Project Site.

7 9. The Planning Commission and the Board of Supervisors, are each a local

8 government agency of the County of Riverside and are each political subdivision of the State
of California, charged with the authority to regulate and administer land use activities within
9 its boundaries, subject at all times to the obligations and limitations of all applicable State,
10 Federal, and other laws, including CEQA. The Planning Commission is the lead agency under
11 CEQA for the preparation of required Environmental analysis pertaining to the Project.
12 10. The Board of Supervisors is the legislative body for the County of Riverside,
13 and, thus, has the authority to legislate land use and policy, including changes thereto, within
14 its jurisdiction. As the legislative body for the County of Riverside, the Board of Supervisors

15 is ultimately responsible for the Approvals granted to the Project.

16 11. AVA Property Investments, LLC is the Real Party in Interest ("RPI") as the

17 developer of the Project. On information and belief, as the sole developer of the Project, AVA
18 Property Investments LLC is in position to represent and protect all development interests in

19 the Project.

20 12. As a result of the objections posed by its constituent members, and others,

21 Petitioners have exhausted, or are excused from exhausting, all of their administrative

22 remedies, and now seek the assistance of the Court to resolve the issues set forth herein

23 pursuant to PRC § 21177(a).

24 13. Moreover, as a result of the actions of Respondents as hereinbefore alleged,

25 Petitioners have been compelled to engage attorneys to challenge the ultra vires actions of
Respondents and to advance costs in connection therewith. Petitioners will accordingly seek
26 the recovery of attorneys' fees and costs upon the successful conclusion of this case.

F STATEMENT OU EACTS

2
Project Background; Environmental Review and Approval
3
%

4 1. The Project

5 14. On September 8, 2017, RPI submitted to the Planning Department Plot Plan No.

6 26346 and Tentative Parcel Map No. 37398 for the siting and development of the 10.98 gross

7 acre Project Site, which is currently vacant and undeveloped. RPI proposed to construct thereon

8 56,060 square feet of commercial buildings, including a grocery store, retail establishment, tire

9 shop, drive-thru restaurant, and car wash.
15. The Project Site is located within Planning Area 24 [PA 24] of Winchester 10 Properties Specific Plan No. 213 is ("Specific Plan") and is zoned Commercial by the Specific
11 Plan. The uses permitted in PA 24 are the same as those uses permitted in the General
12 Commercial ("C-1/C-P") zoning classification as provided in Riverside County Planning
13 Department Ordinance No. 348 ("Ordinance 348"). Although, Ordinance 348 has exceptions to
14 some of its permitted uses, the proposed grocery store, retail establishment, drive-thru restaurant,

15 tire store and car wash are considered permitted uses.

16 16. Since it was adopted in 1987, the Specific Plan has gone through four

17 amendments and four substantial conformances. These amendments primarily were for the

18 reduction of business park planning areas while increasing the acreage of residential and
commercial areas. Most of the residential planning areas of the Specific Plan have been built-out.
19 Commercial and industrial planning areas, however, are still under development or have yet to be
20 developed. Respondents assert that the Project complies with all additional development
21 standards stated in § 9.1 of the C-1/C-P zoning classification as utilized by the Specific Plan.
22 17. The Project Site is located along Winchester Road [State Route 79], north of
23 Willows Avenue, west of Sky Canyon Drive and south of Murrieta Hot Springs Road. The

24 Project Site has an elevation range of 1,108 feet above mean sea level on the southern side of the

25 Site at its lowest point, to the highest point of 1,112 feet above mean sea level on the

26 northwestern side of the Project Site. The Site slopes down from the northwest toward the south,

27 where surface water drains to storm water inlets along Sky Canyon Drive. Tucalota Creek is

28 located downslope from the Project Site.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

18. The General Plan land use designation is Community Development: Commercial

2 Retail ("CD:CR"). The CD:CR designation encourages local and regional retail and service uses.

3 The proposed Project is consistent with the CD:CR land use designation, in that the Project

4 would be a commercial use located adjacent to other commercial land uses. Given the fact that

5 such commercial and retail uses are planned to be constructed adjacent to built-out residential

6 neighborhoods, and upslope from Tucalota Creek, the IS/MND should have reasonably analyzed
potential Impacts to the Environment and to Human Health.

2. The Administrative Process

9 19. The Findings in the IS/MND identified potentially Significant Impacts to

10 Biological Resources, Transportation, Tribal Cultural Resources, and made Mandatory Findings

11 of Significance thereto pertaining. However, with the incorporation of inadequate and illusory

12 Mitigation Measures these Impacts were purportedly reduced to Less-Than-Significant.
20.
13 The IS/MND was completed in June 2021 and was circulated for Public review.

14 The Planning Commission set the Project Approvals to be evaluated on July 21, 2021, less than
30 days after the IS/MND was circulated. As the Public Comment period for the IS/MND had
15 not yet been completed by that date, the hearing on the Approvals was rescheduled to the
16 Planning Commission's August 18, 2021 regularly scheduled hearing.
17 21. The IS/MND was evaluated by the Planning Commission during the August 18th
18 hearing. The Planning Commission granted the Approvals at the conclusion of that hearing.

19 22. On October 1, 2021, Petitioners timely appealed the Planning Commission's

20 decision to the Board of Supervisors. On January 25, 2022, the Board of Supervisors heard

21 Petitioners' appeal of the Planning Commission's grant of the Approvals. At the conclusion of

22 the hearing, the Board of Supervisors voted 5 to 0 to accept the Approvals and to adopt the
IS/MND. No Notice of Determination was filed after the Approvals were accepted and the
23 IS/MND was adopted.
24

25 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES
26

27 23. Petitioners have exhausted their administrative remedies to the extent required by
28 law. Petitioners have performed all conditions precedent to this filing and participated in the

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
-6 -

1 administrative process. Petitioners, either directly or through their members, actively
2

3 participated in the administrative process leading up to Respondents' granting of the Approvals

4 for the Project and adoption of the IS/MND and repeatedly stated their objections to
Respondents' actions.
5
24.
6 Respondents have taken final lead agency actions with respect to granting the

7 Approvals for the Project and adopting the IS/MND in connection therewith. Respondents have

8 a mandatory duty to comply with all State and Federal laws, including but not limited to CEQA,

9 prior to undertaking the discretionary actions at issue in this lawsuit. Their failure to do so is an

10 abuse of discretion and a failure to proceed in the manner required by law.

11
STANDING
12

13 25. Petitioner, FRIENDS OF GUENTHER WILLOWS PARK, has standing to assert

14 the claims raised in this Petition because its members include residents of the County of
15 Riverside, who have personal, health, safety, community and environmental interests that are

16 directly and adversely affected by the Approvals. As a person who lives and work within the
17 County, Petitioner, Shirley Labrador, is within the class of persons beneficially interested in, and

18 aggrieved by, the acts of Respondents as alleged hereinbelow.
19 26. Petitioners have a substantial interest in ensuring the Project's Environmental
20 Impacts are adequately Mitigated. Unless the relief requested herein is granted, Petitioners'
21 Health and Safety, as well as Environmental and community interests, will be adversely
22 Impacted due to Respondent's failure to proceed in a manner required by law. The Approvals
23 are also a matter of Public interest.
24

25 IRREPARABLE HARM
26

27 27. Respondents' failures enumerated in this Petition constitute prejudicial abuse of

28 discretion and a failure to proceed in the manner required by law within the meaning of the CCP

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
-7-

1 and CEQA. Petitioners possess no remaining remedy to challenge Respondents' abuse of
2 discretion and failure to proceed in the manner required by law, other than by means of this
3
lawsuit. If Respondents' actions concerning the Project are effectuated, Petitioners, their
4
members and their Health, the residents of Riverside County, and the Environment, will all be
5

6 irreparably harmed. No money damages could adequately compensate for that harm.

7 PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL DOCTRINE
8

9 28. Petitioners collectively bring this action as a private attorney general pursuant to a

10 § CCP § 1021.5, and any other applicable legal theory, to enforce important rights affecting the

11 Public interest. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will confer a significant benefit on

12 the Public by requiring Respondents to carry out their duties under CEQA before granting the

13 Approvals of the Project. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition for Writ of Mandate will

14 also result in the enforcement of important rights affecting the Public interest by compelling

15 Respondents to engage in a fair, objective, and legally adequate analysis of the Project's
16 Environmental Impacts, and Impacts to Human Health, and to ensure that the Public has a
17 meaningful opportunity to review and comment on such Impacts as well as on reasonable and
18 adequate Mitigation Measures that should be imposed on the Project.
19 29. The necessity and financial burden of enforcement are such as to make an award
20 of attorneys' fees and costs appropriate in this case. Absent enforcement by Petitioners,
21 Respondents and RPI will proceed with a Project that will cause Significant, Unmitigated Human
22 Health and Environmental Impacts that might, otherwise, have been reduced, or avoided, through
23 legally adequate Environmental review and the adoption of adequate, feasible Mitigation
24
Measures.
25 NOTICE OF CEOA SUIT

27 On February 23, 2022, Petitioners served a notice of Petitioners' intent to file this

28 lawsuit, pursuant to PRC § 21167.5. A true and correct copy of the Notice of Intent to File a

PREPARATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD

31. Pursuant to PRC § 21167.6(b)(2), Petitioners elect to prepare the Administrative
7 Record in this action. On February 22, 2022, Petitioners served upon the Board of Supervisors a
8 public records act request, pursuant to Govt Code § 6250, et. seq., a true and correct copy of

9 which is attached hereto as Exhibit B and is made a part hereof. On February 24, 2022,

10 Petitioners served upon the Planning Commission a public records act request, pursuant to Govt.

11 Code § 6250, et. seq., a true and correct copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit C and is

12 made a part hereof. Petitioners shall prepare the Administrative Record from responses provided

13 by Respondents, subject to certification of its accuracy by Respondents.

14

15 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

16 (Violation of CEQA; The IS/MND Failed Adequately to Analyze Project Impacts;

17 Failure to Proceed in a Manner Required by Law)

18 32. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth
19 above.

20 33. The IS/MND failed to provide a legally adequate Environmental review of the

21 |Project's Impacts on Traffic, Air Quality, Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Geology/Soils, Hazards

22 and Hazardous Materials, Noise, Population/Housing, Human Health, Public Services, Utilities,

23 Service Systems and Wildfire danger as well as negative Impacts to the adjacent Tucalota Creek.
This failure to consider these issues renders the IS/MND ineffective as an Environmental review
24
document. Thus, Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law.
25 34. The failures and legal inadequacies of the IS/MND to analyze the Project's
26 Impacts are particularly egregious because the Impacts on Traffic, Air Quality, Greenhouse Gas
27 Emissions, Geology/Soils, Hazards and Hazardous Materials, Noise, Population/Housing,
28 Human Health, Public Services, Utilities, Service Systems and Wildfire danger as well as

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
.9-

P

2 negative Impacts on the adjacent Tucalota Creek created by the Project have not been evaluated

3 under CEQA in the nearly 25 years since the Specific Plan was adopted. The amendments to the

4 Specific Plan functioned primarily to change the proportions of land uses by business parks,
commercial and residential developments. These amendments did not perform a CEQA

5 Environmental analysis of Impacts that development projects would cause to the surrounding

6 community [including Tucalota Creek] due to their Effects on, inter alia, Traffic, Air Quality,
Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Geology/Soils, Hazards and Hazardous Materials, Noise,

8 Population/Housing, Human Health, Public Services, Utilities, Service Systems and Wildfire

9 danger. For instance, the IS/MND failed entirely to address Traffic impacts caused by the

10 extension of Sky Canyon Drive to Willows Avenue. The IS/MND does not address how this

11 additional roadway capacity enhancement impacts Vehicle Miles Travelled (VMT) for this

12 Project. Petitioners addressed this issue in their Public Comments, but their concerns were

13 entirely ignored and no VMT analysis of this roadway extension has been performed.
35. Because the IS/MND failed to provide the legally adequate Environmental

14 analysis required by CEQA, which analysis was also never considered by the underlying Specific

15 Plan, the IS/MND is legally inadequate to support the Approvals without further Site-specific

16 Environmental review. As Respondents did not proceed in the manner required by law, its

17 decisions in granting the Approvals for the Project and adopting the IS/MND are not supported

18 by substantial evidence. Respondents' adoption of the IS/MND and grant of the Approvals must
be set aside. PRC § 21168.5.
19

20 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

21 (Violation of CEQA; The IS/MND Contained Inadequate Findings

22
36. Unsupported by Substantial Evidence; Abuse of Discretion)

23 above. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth

24 37.
25 Respondents violated CEQA by adopting legally inadequate Findings that are
unsupported by substantial evidence. The IS/MND entirely failed to analyze Environmental
26 Impacts in the areas of, inter alia, Traffic, Air Quality, Greenhouse Gas Emissions,
27 Geology/Soils, Hazards and Hazardous Materials, Noise, Population/Housing, Human Health,

28 Public Services, Utilities, Service Systems and Wildfire danger as well as negative Impacts on

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
-10 -

the adjacent Tucalota Creek that would be created by the Project. These Impacts are potentially

2 hugely consequential to the community and must be adequately analyzed.
38. Respondents failed to explain how their Findings are supported by substantial

4 evidence in the Administrative Record. For instance, the IS/MND identified potentially

5 Significant Impacts to Biological Resources, Cultural Resources, Transportation, Tribal Cultural

6 Resources, and Mandatory Findings of Significance. It also Found, oddly, that No Impact would
occur in the area of Air Quality, either during construction or operation of the Project. Thus, no
7 Mitigation Measures were imposed on the Project.
8 39. In other areas, the IS/MND sought to reduce or eliminate Impacts by imposing
9 inadequate and illusory Mitigation Measures on the Project without an adequate explanation as
10 to how such proposed Mitigation Measures will reduce the harmful impacts. For example, in

11 order to "mitigate" danger to the Kangaroo Rat's habitat, RPI is required to pay a "Kangaroo Rat

12 Habitat Conservation Plan Fee," which will be paid prior to issuance of any grading permit.. The

13 IS/MND does not indicate how such a fee will Mitigate injury to the Kangaroo Rat, or its habitat,

14 during construction of the Project. These and other Mitigation issues remain unresolved by the

15 IS/MND. Such is a failure to proceed in the manner required by law.
40. Additionally, The IS/MND evaluated several intersections that provide both local
16 and regional access to the Project Site. This data was used to determine the potential traffic-
17 related deficiencies associated with area growth, cumulative projects, and the proposed Project.
18 This study ignored, however, VMT that would be caused by the roadway extension of Sky
19 Canyon Drive to Willows Avenue. Petitioners pointed this out in their Public Comments. Their

20 concerns were ignored by Respondents. No additional Transportation analysis was performed,

21 and, thus, no additional Mitigation Measures were imposed on the Project. Such failure to

22 perform an adequate Environmental review of the Project Impacts constitutes a failure to proceed

23 in the manner required by law.

24 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION
25 (VIOLATION OF CEQA: The IS/MND Failed Adequately
26 to Evaluate or Implement All Feasible Mitigation Measures)

27 41. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth
28 above,

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
-11 -

1 42. CEQA directs public agencies to avoid or reduce Environmental damage when

2 possible by requiring Alternatives or Mitigation Measures on projects. CEQA Guidelines

3 §15002(a)(2)-(3). PRC $21081. The Environmental review serves to provide public agencies and

4 the Public with information about the Impacts that a proposed project is likely to have on the

5 Environment and to "identify ways that environmental damage can be avoided or significantly

6 reduced." CEQA Guidelines §15002(a)(2). If a project has a Significant Effect on the

7 Environment, the agency may approve the project only upon a finding that it has "eliminated or
substantially lessened all significant effects on the environment where feasible," and that any
8 Unavoidable Significant Impacts on the Environment are "acceptable due to overriding concerns
9 as described in [CEQA Guidelines §] 15093." CEQA Guidelines §15092(b)(2)(A)-(B).

10 Respondents have failed to demonstrate by substantial evidence in the Administrative Record

11 that their Findings of Overriding Concerns are acceptable given the various Negative Impacts

12 that will be caused by the Project.

13 43. Furthermore, the IS/MND erroneously Found that No Impact or Less-Than-

14 Significant Environmental Impacts would result to Health Risk, and/or to Fish or Wildlife, or

15 their Habitats due to the construction or operation of the Project. To be clear, these Impacts were
Found to have No Impact or Less-Than-Significant Impacts on the Environment because
16 Respondents Found that other Overriding economic, legal, social, technological, or other benefits
17 of the Project outweighed these Significant Negative Impacts on the Environment. In other
18 words, Respondents' desire for the Project outweighed their Finding of detrimental Impacts to
19 Health Risk, Fish and Wildlife, and their Habitats caused by the Project, not that such
20 detrimental Impacts did not exist. Such is an abuse of discretion and a violation of CEQA. PRC
21 211685.

22 44. Respondents' abuse of discretion is compounded by the fact that the IS/MND

23 failed entirely to evaluate whole swaths of Environmental Impacts to the community, including,

24 but not limited to Impacts on Traffic, Air Quality, Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Geology/Soils,
Hazards and Hazardous Materials, Noise, Population/Housing, Human Health, Public Services,
25 Utilities, Service Systems and Wildfire danger as well as negative Impacts on the adjacent
26 Tucalota Creek created by the construction and operation of the Project. This economic
27 expediency caused any reasonable Mitigation Measures to be determined to be infeasible or
28 undesirable, and to be wholly and improperly discarded by Respondents.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
-12 -

45.

2 Under CEQA, Respondents cannot Approve the Project as proposed because there

3 are feasible Mitigation Measures available that would substantially lessen one or more of the
Project's Significant Environmental Effects, PRC 21002. For instance, Greenhouse Gas

4 Emissions and other Air Quality issues, Noise and Traffic Impacts can all be expected to occur

5 for the entire duration of the construction period and during operation of the Project. Mitigation

6 Measures can be imposed on the Project to alleviate these Impacts. However, none of these

7 Impacts is adequately identified in, analyzed, or mitigated by, the IS/MND. The Mitigation

8 Measures proposed by Respondents are, thus, vague and constitute ineffective conditions of

9 approval for the Project. Respondents must consider adequate Mitigation Measures that will

10 alleviate these Impacts and that will be made a available in a full environmental review that may
be ordered by this Court.

11

12 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

13 (Violation of CEQA;

14
46; Inadequate Response to Public Comments)

15
l above. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth

16

17 47. Public participation is widely recognized as an essential part of the CEQA
process. CEQA Guidelines §15073(a) provides for Public review of a proposed mitigated
18 negative declaration, like the IS/MND. Additionally, a lead agency's decision-making body must
19

20 consider any Public Comments received during the review period when making its decision

21 whether to adopt a proposed mitigated negative declaration. CEQA Guidelines $15074(b). ÷

48. Public Comments critical of the Project from Petitioners, CalTrans, and other

22 members of the Public were received by the Planning Commission prior to the August 18, 2021

23 hearing where the Approvals were granted. There is no evidence in the Record that these various

24 Comments and corrections were addressed or incorporated into the IS/MND or that the

25 Comments gave rise to any additional conditions of approval on the Project. The IS/MND

26 remained completely unchanged from its initial draft of June 2021. Rather than address the

27 serious concerns raised by Petitioners, Caltrans and other members of the Public, Respondents'

28 Responses to Comments regarding the Project's Environmental Impacts on Traffic, Air Quality,
Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Geology/Soils, Hazards and Hazardous Materials, Noise,

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
-13 -

1 Population/Housing, Human Health, Public Services, Utilities, Service Systems and Wildfire

2 danger as well as negative Impacts on the adjacent Tucalota Creek have been conclusory,

3 evasive, confusing, or otherwise non-responsive and contrary to the requirements of CEQA. The

4 Public has been completely ignored and the Approvals were summarily granted to the Project.

5 49. By failing to provide adequate Responses to Public Comments and ignoring

6 Petitioners' analyses and proposed Alternatives for the Project, Respondents failed to proceed in
the manner required by law. Any Finding by Respondents that adequate Responses to Comments
7 were provided is not supported by substantial evidence in the Administrative Record. As a result
of the foregoing defects, Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by adopting Findings
9 that do not comply with the requirements of CEQA and by approving the Project in reliance
10 40? thereon. PRC § 21168.5 [Abuse of discretion is established if the agency has not proceeded in a

We draw your attention to Government Code Section 6253.1, which requires a public a agency to assist the public in making a focused and effective request by: (1) identifying records and information responsive to the request, (2) describing the information technology and physical location of the records, and (3) providing suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the records or information sought.
If the Planning Division, Planning Commission, Board of Supervisors or other agency
determines that any information is exempt from disclosure, we ask that the responding agency- reconsider that determination in view of Proposition 59 which amended the State Constitution to require that all exemptions be "narrowly construed." Proposition 59 may modify or overturn authoritles on which the County has relted in the past.
If the Planning Division, Planning Commission, Board of Supervisors or other agency determines that any requested records are subject to a still-valid exemption, we request that the responding agency exercise its discretion to disclose some or all of the records notwithstanding the exemption and with respect to records containing both exempt and non-exempt content, the responding agency redact the exempt content and disclose the rest, Should the Planning Division, Planning Commission, Board of Supervisors or other agency deny any part of this request, the responding agency is required to provide a written response describing the legal authority on which the responding agency relies.
Please be advised that Government Code Section 6253(o) states in pertinent part that the agency "shall promptly notify the person making the request of the determination and the reasons therefor." (Emphasis added.) Section 6253(d) further states that nothing in this chapter "shall be construed to permit an agency to delay or obstruet the inspection or copying of public records. The notification of denial of any request for records required by Section 6255 shall set forth the names and titles or positions of each person responsible for the denial."

Additionally, Govemnment Code Section 6255(a) states that the "agency shall justify withholding any record by demonstrating that the record in question is exempt under expressed provisions of this chapter or that on the facts of the particular case the public interest served by not disclosing the record olearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure of the record.It. (Emphasis added.) This provision makes clear that the agency is required to justify withholding any record with particularity as to "the record in question," (Emphasis added.)
Please clearly state in writing pursuant to Section 6255(b): (1) if the Planning Division, Planning Commission, Board of Supervisors or any other agency is withholding any documents; (2) if the Planning Division, Planning Commission, Board of Supervisors or other agency ds redacting any documents; (3) what documents the Planning Division, Planning Commission, Board of Supervisors or other agency is so withholding and/or redacting; and (4) the alleged legal bases for withholding and/ or redacting as to the particular documents. It should also be noted that to the extent documents are being withheld, should thöse documents also contain material that is not subject to any applicable exemption to disclosure, then the disclosable portions of the documents must be segregated and produced. We further request that you preserve intact all documents and computer communications and attachments thereto, including but not limifed to all emails and computer files, wherever originated, received or copied, regarding the subject matter
of the above-referenced requests.

We draw your attention to Government Code Section 6253.1, which requires a public a agency to assist the public in making a focused and effective request by: (1) identifying records and information responsive to the request, (2) deseribing the information technology and physical location of the records, and (3) providing suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the records or information sought.
If the Planning Division, Planning Commission, Board of Supervisors or other agency determines that any information is exempt from the responding agency reconsider that determination in view of Proposition 59 which amended the State Constitution to disclosure, we ask that require that all exemptions be "narrowly construed." Proposition 59 may modify or overturn authorities on which the County has relied in the past.
If the Planning Division, Planning Commission, Board of Supervisors or other agency determines that any requested records are subject to a still-valid exemption, we request that the responding agency exercise its discretion to disclose some or all of the records notwithstanding the exemption and with respect to records containing both exempt and non-exempt content, the responding agency redact the exempt content and disclose the rest. Should the Plänning Division, Planning Commission, Board of Supervisors or other agency deny any part of this request, the responding agency is required to provide a written response describing the legal authority on which the responding agency relies.
Please be advised that Government Code Section 6253(c) states in pertinent part that the agency "shall promptly notify the person making the request of the determination and the reasons therefor." (Emphasis added.) Section 6253(d) further states that nothing in this chapter "shall be construed to permit an ageney to delay or obstruct the inspection or copying of public records. The notification of denial of any request for records required by Section 6255 shall set forth the names and titles or positions of each person responsible for the denial.'

ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION (ADR) - INFORMATION PACKAGE

*** THE PLAINTIFF MUST SERVE THIS INFORMATION PACKAGE ON EACH PARTY WITH THE COMPLAINT. ***
What is ADR?
Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) is a way of solving legal disputes without going to trial. The main types are mediation, arbitration, and settlement conferences.
Advantages of ADR:
Faster: ADR can be done in a 1-day session within months after filing the complaint.
A Less expensive: Parties can save court costs and attorneys' and witness fees. More control: Parties choose their ADR process and provider.
A Less stressful: ADR is done informally in private offices, not public courtrooms.
Disadvantages of ADR:

5 No public trial: Parties do not get a decision by a judge or jury.
A Costs: Parties may have to pay for both ADR and litigation.
Main Types of ADR:

Mediation: In mediation, the mediator listens to each person's concerns, helps them evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of their case, and works with them to create a settlement agreement that-is-acceptable-to everyone. If the-parties do-not wish to-settle the case, they go to trial.
Mediation may be appropriate when the parties:
4 want to work out a solution but need help from a neutral person; or
4 have communication problems or strong emotions that interfere with resolution; or
A have a continuing business or personal relationship.
Mediation is not appropriate when the parties: want their public 'day in court" or a judicial determination on points of law or fact;
4 lack equal bargaining power or have a history of physical/emotional a abuse.
Arbitration: Arbitration is less formal than trial, but like trial, the parties present evidence and arguments to the person who decides the outcome. In "binding" arbitration the arbitrator's decision is final; there is no right to trial. In "non-binding" arbitration, any party can request a trial after the arbitrator's decision. The court's mandatory Judicial Arbitration program is non-binding.

Riverside Superior Court RI-ADR001-INFO [Rev. 06/10/21]

Arbitration may be appropriate when the parties:
want to avoid trial, but still want a neutral person to decide the outcome of the case.
Arbitration is not appropriate when the parties: do not want to risk going through both arbitration and trial (Judicial Arbitration) do not want to give up their right to trial (binding arbitration)
Settlement Conferences: Settlement conferences are similar to mediation, but the settlement officer
usually tries to negotiate an agreement by giving strong opinions about the strengths and weaknesses of the case, its monetary value, and the probable outcome at trial. Settlement conferences often
involve attorneys more than the parties and often take place close to the trial date.
RIVERSIDE COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT ADR REQUIREMENTS
ADR Information and forms are posted on the ADR website:
https://www.riverside.courts.ca.gov/Divisions/ADR/ADR.php

General Policy:
Parties in most general civil cases are expected to participate in an ADR process before requesting a trial date and to participate in settlement conference before trial. (Local Rule 3200)
Court-Ordered ADR:
Certain cases valued at under $50,000 may be ordered to judicial arbitration or mediation. This order is usually made at the Case Management Conference. See the "Court-Ordered Mediation Information Sheet" on the ADR website for more information.

Private ADR (for cases not ordered to arbitration or mediation): Parties schedule and pay for their ADR process without Court involvement. Parties may schedule private ADR at any time; there is no need to wait until the Case Management Conference. See the "Private Mediation Information Sheet" on the ADR website for more information.
BEFORE THE CASE MANAGEMENT CONFERENCE (CMC), ALL PARTIES MUST: 1. -Discuss ADR with all parties at least 30 days before the CMC. Discuss:
e Your preferences for mediation or arbitration. Your schedule for discovery (getting the information you need) to make good decisions about settling the case at mediation or presenting your case at an arbitration. 2. File the attached "Stipulation for ADR" along with the Case Management Statement, if all parties can
agree.
3. Be prepared to tell the judge your preference for mediation or arbitration and the date when you could complete it.
(Local Rule 3218)
