VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

INTRODUCTION 1

2 1. This action alleges violations of the California Environmental Quality Act
3 ("CEQA") by the County of Los Angeles ("County") regarding the adoption of the Title 2 Tune
Up Ordinance ("Project" or "Ordinance").

5 2 As set forth below, the Project at issue proposes revisions to the County's Oak
6 Tree Ordinance. According to the staff report issued by the County, the County seeks to revise
7 the Administrative Oak Tree Permit regulations to (I) Add encroachment to one oak tree, @
8 Add heritage oak as ineligible from administrative review, 3) Remove the notification
9 requirement, (4) Add development standards (some from Conditions of Approval), and (5)
10 Rename certain sections and subsections relating to Findings and Decision to exclude findings
11 for Administrative Oak Tree Permits. Additionally, the revisions seek to "clarify" that the review 8 d'11 'dnoJg meT jauuey) LZ06 LAIS APNE IRHLS IM GSO 12 is "ministerial." The County Oak Ordinance was first approved in the 1980s after public
pressure to safeguard California's iconic oak resource in Los Angeles County. It included
'SIl!H Aueneg noticing, permitting and hearings for any oak removals within the county sO that removals could 13

15 be reduced, tracked and at the very least, mitigated. Numerous individuals participated in this 14

16 effort and subsequent updates to ensure the County's oaks would be protected.
17 3. This action challenges the County's determination that the Project is exempt from
18 environmental review under CEQA.

PARTIES 19

20 Petitioner Santa Clarita Organization for Planning the Environment ("SCOPE" or
21 "Petitioner"), is a California non-profit membership organization concerned with protection of 4.

22 the environment. SCOPE was formed in 1987 and is celebrating its 33rd year of promoting,
23 protecting and preserving the environment, ecology, and quality of life in the Santa Clarita

of Los Angeles. SCOPE and its supporters have a direct and beneficial interest in the County's 24 Valley. Members of SCOPE live and work in Northern Los Angeles County, within the County

26 compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"). These interests are 25

27 directly and adversely affected by the County's violation of CEQA as set forth in this Petition.

8 corporate, associate, or otherwise, of Respondents Doe through Doe 20, inclusive, and

13 CEQA'S SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS 8 14 7. California Environmental Quality Act is California's broadest environmental SIl!H ALEAEg 15 law. CEQA helps to guide public agencies such as the City during issuance of permits and
16 approval of projects. Courts have interpreted CEQA to afford the fullest protection of the
scope of the statutes. CEQA applies to all discretionary 17 environment within the reasonable

19 discretionary government approval. See California Public Resources Code, sections 21000 - 18 projects proposed to be conducted or approved by a City, including private projects requiring

20 21178, and Title 14 Cal. Code Regs., section 753, and Chapter 3, sections 15000 - 15387.
21 8. "CEQA broadly defines a 'project' as 'an activity which may cause either a direct
22| physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the
23 environment, and that involves the issuance to a person of a lease, permit, license, certificate,
24 or other entitlement for use by one or more public agencies.' [Citation.] The statutory definition
25 is augmented by the [CEQA] Guidelines [Cal.Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15000 et seq.], which define
26 a 'project' as 'the whole of an action, which has a potential for resulting in either a direct

phases of a project that are reasonably foreseeable, and all related projects that are directly linked
to the project. (CEQA Guidelines section 15378).

5 9. A strong presumption in favor of requiring preparation of an Environmental
Impact Report ("EIR") is built into CEQA which is reflected in what is known as the "fair
argument" standard, under which an agency must prepare an EIR whenever substantial evidence
8 in the record supports a fair argument that a project may have a significant effect on the

JURISDICTION AND VENUE 2

12. This action arises under CEQA and its implementing regulations, which are
4  prescribed by the Secretary of the California Resources Agency to be followed by all state and 3

5 local agencies when undertaking projects subject to CEQA. (Pub. Resources Code§ 21000 et

6 seq.; Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15000 et seq.) This Court has jurisdiction over the matters
7 alleged in this Petition pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1085, and Public Resources
8 Code section 21168.5. In the alternative, this Court has jurisdiction pursuant to Code of Civil
9 Procedure section 1094.5 and Public Resources Code section 21168.
10 13. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 394(a) venue is proper in "the county
11 in which the city or local agency is situated." Venue is proper in this Court because Respondent - d77 'dno1o MET |euueua 1Z06 12 is located in the County of Los Angeles.
13 14. Members of Petitioner and other interested persons made oral and written 8 euns "pAa bJJys|!m €:€8 SIl!H ApeAeg 14 comments on the Project and raised each of the legal deficiencies asserted in this petition.
STATEMENT OF FACTS 15

16 15. The Project consists of an amendment to the County of Los Angeles' Zoning
17 Code. The County dubbed the Project dubbed the Project the "Title 22 Tune Up Ordinance." The
18 County claimed that the Ordinance was needed in order to "make modifications where necessary
19 to correct discrepancies and typographical errors, clarify provisions, remove redundant language,
20 streamline procedures, remove outdated provisions, reformat/reorganize a limited number of
21 sections for readability, and be consistent with State law and other County regulations." The
22 proposed changes are technical in nature and do not reflect policy changes.
23 16. The County prepared a "List of Amendments" that was presented to the Board of
24 Supervisors. This List of Amendments summarized the proposed changes to the Zoning Code
25 and outlined the changes to the County's Oak Tree Ordinance. The List of Amendments stated as
26 follows:

27 "Revise the Administrative Oak Tree Permit in Chapter 22.174, as follows:

review;
4 Remove the notification requirement;
Add development standards (some from Conditions of Approval);

6 Rename certain sections and subsections relating to Findings and Decision to
7 exclude findings for Administrative Oak Tree Permits."

8 17. The Ordinance was presented at a noticed public hearing with the Regional
9 Planning Commission ("RPC') on October 14, 2020. The RPC closed the public hearing and
10 unanimously adopted the resolution to recommend that the Board of Supervisors consider and
11 adopt the proposed Ordinance, with certain amendments as discussed at the RPC hearing, and R d11 'dnoJg MET jeuueyd LZ06 euns "PALE EJJyS|!M €8E8 12 find that the Ordinance is exempt from CEQA. Thereafter, a public hearing was held before the
13 Board of Supervisors ("Board") on February 23, 2021. The Board directed instructed County &
'SIl!H AjeAeS 14 Counsel to prepare the necessary final documents to amend Title 22 of the County Code and to
15 bring them back to the Board for their consideration. Thereafter, on February 15, 2022, the
16 proposed Ordinance was brought back to the Board of Supervisors and finally adopted. The
17 Board of Supervisors also determined that the Project was exempt from CEQA. The Board
18 concluded that the project qualified for a Categorical Exemption under CEQA Guidelines
19 Section 15305 (Class 5 exemption for minor alterations in land use limitations) and the common-
20 sense exemption found at CEQA Guidelines Section 15061(b)(3).

25 Urban Wildfire Committee, Los Angeles Audubon Society, Urban Wildlands Group and Friends
26 of the Santa Clara River. Other persons objected to the Project in an individual capacity.
27 Commenters asserted that the proposed changes to the Oak Tree Ordinance would make it easier

1 for oak tree removal permits to be issued and therefore the Project would have a significant
2 effect on the environment.

3 19. SCOPE submitted three objection letters to the County dated February 18, 2021,
February 22, 2021 and February 14, 2022. SCOPE also voiced objections orally at the public
5 hearings before the Regional Planning Commission and Board of Supervisors.

20. The County filed a Notice of Exemption with the County Recorder on March 24,
7 2022. This action has been brought within 35 days of the filing of the aforementioned Notice of 6

8 Exemption with the County Recorder.

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION 10 (Violation of the California Environmental Quality Act)
11 21. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs of this 8 d11 'dnoJ9 MET jauueud +706 12 Petition.
13 22. The County Oak Ordinance was first approved in the 1980s after public pressure 8 euns "pAa BJIJySU!M €8E8 SII!H Auereg 14 to safeguard California's iconic oak resource in Los Angeles County. It included noticing,
15 permitting and hearings for any oak removals within the county SO that removals could be
16 reduced, tracked and at the very least, mitigated.
17 23. The County led the public to believe that minor adjustments to code numbers
18 and/or reorganization were all that would be approved. In fact, a major change to the County Oak
19 Ordinance allowing removals of certain oaks administratively without public notice and without
20 the making of any required findings, was included in this "tune up."
21 24. The Ordinance removed the requirement that specific findings be made when an
22 Administrative Oak Tree Permit is issued. The Ordinance removed the following sentence from
23 Section 22.174.040(D)(2) of the Zoning Code: "Prior to making a decision, the Director shall
24 review the application for compliance with Section 22.174.060 (Findings and Decision) and
25 Section 22.174.070 (Conditions of Approval)." The Code had previously required that findings
26 be made - even for a project that was eligible for an Administrative Oak Tree Permit. These
27 findings placed important limitations on the issuance of permits authorizing the removal of oak

2. The removal or relocation of the oak trees proposed will not result in soil erosion through the diversion or increased flow of surface waters which cannot be satisfactorily mitigated. property.

3. In addition to the above facts, at least one of the following findings apply:
a. That the removal or relocation of the oak trees proposed is necessary as continued existence at present locations frustrates the planned improvement or proposed use of the subject property to such an extent that i. Alternative development plans cannot achieve the same permitted density 8
or that the cost of such alternative would be prohibitive, or ii. Placement of such oak trees precludes the reasonable and efficient use of
such property for a use otherwise authorized; 10 b. That the oak trees proposed for removal or relocation interferes with utility services or streets and highways, either within or outside of the subject property, 11
and no reasonable alternative to such interference exists other than removal of the 8 d11 'dnoJ9 Mel |euueyd • IZ06 1A0  VPONSE SIl!H AjeAeg 12

C. That the condition of the oak trees proposed for removal with reference to trees; or.

The Staff Report that was issued for the Ordinance as well as the List of 16 25.

17 Amendments also specifically stated that the Ordinance would "remove the notification
18 requirement" for Administrative Oak Tree Permits.

26. Petitioner explained to the County that changing the requirement for notification
20 and findings would allow a substantial increase in oak destruction, allow destruction of trees 19

21 during the nesting season, and fail to provide notice to neighbors who may consider the tree an
22 iconic part of their neighborhood and want to discuss the matter with the property owner.
23 Petitioner also explained that oaks provide substantial sequestration of greenhouse gases and that
24 their destruction adds to air pollution by eliminating their natural air filtering function. Petitioner
25 cautioned the County that in this time of climate change when planting and protecting trees has
26 been identified as a major means of reducing greenhouse gas effect on climate change, the
27 County Oak Ordinance becomes even more important. Petitioner also alerted the County that
28| even a single-family residence can have numerous oaks and cumulatively provide extensive

1 habitat and character to a neighborhood. Petitioner stated that "removing notification and the
2 required findings removes any impediments a homeowner might have to makes oak removal
3 easy." Petitioner specifically objected to the exemption of the Ordinance from CEQA.
The Class 5 exemption, exempts projects that "consist[] of minor alterations in

5 land use limitations in areas with an average slope of less than 20%, which do not result in any 27.

6 changes in land use or density, including but not limited to: [6] (a) Minor lot line adjustments,
7 side yard, and set back variances not resulting in the creation of any new parcel." (CEQA
8 Guidelines,' 15305.) Further, according to the State CEQA Guidelines, the following exceptions
9 are applicable to the use of this exemption:

10 (a) Location. Classes 3, 4, 5, 6, and 11 are qualified by consideration of where the
a project that is ordinarily insignificant in its impact on the 11 project is to be located ® d11 'dnoJ9 MET jouueyd • LZ06 12 environment may in a particularly sensitive environment be significant. Therefore, these
13 classes are considered to apply all instances, except where the project may impact on an 5 euns "pAla eJjys|!m eseg SIl!H Beverly 14 environmental resource of hazardous or critical concern where designated, precisely
15 mapped, and officially adopted pursuant to law by federal, state, or local agencies.
16 (b) Cumulative Impact. All exemptions for these classes are inapplicable when the
17 cumulative impact of successive projects of the same type in the same place, over time is
18

(c) Significant Effect. A categorical exemption shall not be used for an activity significant.

19

20 where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on
21 the environment due to unusual circumstances.

22 (d) Scenic Highways. A categorical exemption shall not be used for project
23 which may result in damage to scenic resources, including but not limited to, trees,
24 historic buildings, rock outcroppings, or similar resources, within a highway officially
25 designated as a state scenic highway. This does not apply to improvements which are
26 required as mitigation by an adopted negative declaration or certified EIR.
27 (e) Hazardous Waste Sites. A categorical exemption shall not be used for a project

the Government Code.

3 (f) Historical Resources. A categorical exemption shall not be used for a project which may 2

cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of a historical resource

28. The Project is not eligible for the Class 5 exemption because the relaxation of the
6 Oak Ordinance regulations - does not fit within the four corners of the Class 5 exemption. The 5

7 Ordinance does not consist of mere "minor alterations in land use limitations." Further, there are
8 certainly areas within the County where oak tree permits will be issued that have an average
9 slope of more than 50 percent. When determining if a project falls within a specific class of
10 categorical exemption, courts generally look to the list of examples listed under the CEQA
11 Guidelines, and reject the use of the exemption when the activity is not is similar to the listed 8 d11 'dnoJ9 MET jeuuey) 1706 13, and 25 categorical exemptions on basis of dissimilarity to listed examples); Azusa Land

22 are interpreted in a manner affording the greatest environmental protection. Azusa Land

26 Project is not eligible for the Class 5 exemption because there is a reasonably possibility that the
27 activity will have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances. The

reasonably foreseeable significant impacts were outlined by Petitioner and other parties during
2 the administrative process. There are also cumulative impacts associated with the approval of
3 the Ordinance that prevent the usage of the categorical exemption. Finally, the Class 5
4 exemption cannot be used due to the "location exception." Found at CEQA Guidelines Section
5 15300.2(a). Certainly, the County has many oak trees that may now be removed administratively

6 by the County without the making of required findings that are located in environmentally
7 sensitive areas that have been officially adopted pursuant to law by federal, state, or local
8 agencies.
9 29. The Project is not eligible for an exemption under the common-sense exemption.
10 The County failed to refute the claims that the Project will have a significant effect on the
11
R environment to a certainty. As explained in Davidon Homes v. City of San Jose (1996) 54
Channel Law Group, d77 LZ06 LSMPIB SIA A COSO SIl!H ALeAES 12 Cal.App.4th 106, the "showing required of a party challenging an exemption under common
13 sense exemption is slight, since that exemption requires the agency to be certain that there
14 1S no possibility the project may cause significant environmental impacts. If legitimate
15 questions can be raised about whether the project might have a significant a impact and there is
16 any dispute about the possibility of such an impact, the agency cannot find with certainty that a
17 project is exempt." Davidon, supra, 54 Cal.App.4th at p. 117 (emphasis added). Further, claims 18 raised by opponents "even if exaggerated or untrue" may be sufficient to remove a project
19 from the commonsense exemption. Myers v. Bd. of Supervisors (1976) 58 Cal.App.3d 413. A
20  petitioner must simply offer a reasonable argument to suggest possibility that a project may
21 cause a significant environmental impact. Once that occurs, a public agency must refute that
22 claim to a certainty before finding that the commonsense exemption applies. The County
23 offered very little - if any- rebuttal to the arguments raised by interested parties as to the
24| environmental impacts of the Project. The County failed to meet its burden of refuting the
25 legitimate questions raised by Petitioner to a certainty.
26 30. For the aforementioned reasons, Respondent committed a prejudicial abuse of
27 discretion and failed to proceed in a manner required by law by failing to conduct the required
