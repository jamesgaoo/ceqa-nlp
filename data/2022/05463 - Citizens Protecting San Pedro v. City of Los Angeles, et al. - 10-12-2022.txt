2 INTRODUCTION

3

4 1. Petitioner, CITIZENS PROTECTING SAN PEDRO ("Petitioner"), alleges through this
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate (*Petition"), as follows:

5

6 2. Petitioner challenges the approval by Respondent City of Los Angeles ("City" or

7 "Respondent") of discretionary approvals including Density Bonus review, a Conditional Use Permit

8 ("CUP") and Site Plan Review (together, the "Project Approvals") for a proposed development project

9 located at 2111-2139 South Pacific Avenue in San Pedro, CA (the "Project"). Petitioner further

10 challenges the City's determination that the Project was Categorically Exempt from the California

11 Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") pursuant to CEQA Guidelines § 15332 ("Class 32 Categorical

12 Exemption") and its determination that the Project was within the scope of the San Pedro Community

13 Plan Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") and therefore exempt from further review pursuant to

14 Guidelines §§ 15168 and 15162. Petitioner alleges that the City failed to comply with state and local
laws when it approved the Project.

15

16 3. Petitioner requests that this Court vacate, set aside, rescind and void all of the Project

17 approvals considered by Respondent, including rescinding any authorizations to proceed with

18 construction for the Project. Petitioner requests that the Court vacate the Project approvals because

19 Respondent failed to comply with the provisions set forth under CEQA, and state and local law, and
therefore failed to proceed in a manner required by law.

20

21 4. Petitioner seeks a Peremptory Writ of Mandate under Code of Civil Procedure sections

22 1085 and 1094.5, directing Respondent to vacate, rescind and set aside all Project approvals and the

23 environmental determinations because Respondent failed to comply with CEQA, state and local law.

24 PARTIES

25

26 5. Petitioner Citizens Protecting San Pedro is an unincorporated association dedicated to the

27 protection of both the community and the environment in San Pedro. Petitioner and its respective

28 members have a direct and substantial beneficial interest in ensuring that Respondent complies with
laws relating to environmental protection. Petitioner and its respective members are adversely affected
2
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

-.

2 by Respondent's failure to comply with CEQA in approving the Project. Petitioner has standing to
assert the claims raised in this Petition because Petitioner and its members' aesthetic and

3

4 environmental interests are directly and adversely affected by Respondent's approval of the Project.

5 6. Respondent, City of Los Angeles, is a charter city incorporated under the laws of the State
of California. The City is the lead agency under CEQA.

6

7 7. Petitioner is informed and believes and based thereon alleges that Real Party in Interest

8 RKD 2111 Pacific, LLC is a Limited Liability Company organized in California that is the legal
owner of the parcel proposed to be developed.

9

10 8. Petitioner is ignorant of the true names and capacities of Real Parties sued herein as DOES

11 1-25, inclusive, and therefore sues these Real Parties by such fictitious names. Petitioner will amend

12 this Petition to allege the true names and capacities of fictitiously named Real Parties in Interest.

13 Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that each Respondent designated herein as a

14 DOE has some responsibility for the events and happenings alleged in this Petition.
9. Members of Petitioner and other interested persons

15 made oral and written comments on the

Project and raised the legal deficiencies asserted in this petition.

16

17 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

18

19 10. This Court has jurisdiction over the writ action under sections 1085 and 1094.5 of the

20 Code of Civil Procedure, and sections 21168 and 21168.5 of the Public Resources Code.

21 11. Venue for this action properly lies in the Los Angeles Superior Court because Respondent
and the Project are located in Los Angeles County.

22

23 PROJECT

24

25 12. The project site is located at the northwestern corner of the intersection of Pacific Avenue

26 and 22nd Street in the San Pedro Community Plan area, approximately one-half mile west of the

27 harbor/Port of Los Angeles. The project site consists of five (5) lots totaling approximately 20,174

28

3
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

-.

2 square feet, with approximately 215 feet of frontage along the west side of Pacific Avenue and 95 feet

3 of frontage along the north side of 22nd Street. The site is currently improved with a bar, a surface

4 parking lot and a vacant lot which will be demolished for development of the Project.

5 13. The property is located in the Harbor Gateway State Enterprise Zone and Pacific Corridor

6 Redevelopment Plan Project Area. The site is also located within the San Pedro Community Plan

7 Implementation Overlay (*CPIO") District Coastal Commercial A Subarea and Height District No.

8 1XL, which limits Floor Area Ratio ("FAR") to 1.5:1 and building height to 30 feet and two stories.
The surrounding area is developed with a combination of single-story commercial uses and multi-

10 family residential uses up to three stories in height, compliant with the maximum 30-foot height limit,

11 with some one-and two-story single-family residential uses in the surrounding area including one

12 story homes adjacent to the Project site. The Project is also located on a Tsunami Evacuation Route

13 and a High Injury Network based on vehicle-related injuries on Pacific Avenue. Pacific Avenue is the

14 main artery to and from the Harbor (110) Freeway via Miner Street and is subject to exceptional
congestion.

15

16 14. The Project vicinity is already heavily burdened by air quality-related health impacts and

17 is highly vulnerable to additional pollution. The United States Environmental Protection Agency lists

18 the area for 2111-2139 Pacific as among the worst in the nation in the categories of Environmental

19 Indicators, Demographic Indicators, and Environmental Justice Indexes. The California

20 Environmental Protection Agency has identified the project area as an SB 535 Disadvantaged

21 Community, and among the neediest and most at-risk neighborhoods from pollution. The South Coast

22 Air Quality Management District lists the neighborhood as in the highest category for carcinogenic

23 risk from exposure to air toxins and noxious ultrafine particle concentrations. The Los Angeles

24 County Department of Public Health lists Port-adjacent communities as having the highest numbers

25 of childhood asthma cases in the City of LA. A USC Annenberg Center for Health Journalism article
states: ".

26 the intense pollution that emanates from the nation's largest port compromises the health of

27 nearby communities... Asthma, sleep deprivation, hypertension, cancer: all have been linked to living

28 near the Port..." and cites the disproportionate "burden of disease" in communities like San Pedro.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

15. The Project is the development of a new four-story, 45-foot and five-inch-tall mixed-use

2 residential building comprised of 100 dwelling units (including 11 units restricted to Very Low-

3 Income Households) with 1,800 square feet of ground floor retail space. The Project will provide 84

4 vehicular parking spaces in two subterranean parking levels, and 75 long-term and eight short-term

5 bicycle parking spaces. The Project will be 77,945 square feet in floor area and have a FAR of 3.26:1.

6 The site is currently improved with a 1,490 square foot a single-tenant bar, surface parking lot, and

7 vacant lot, with 12 non-protected palm trees on the subject site and ten non-protected palm trees along

8 the public right-of-way, all of which will be removed to clear the lot. The Project proposes grading

9 and export of 20,000 cubic yards of soil.

10
PROJECT BACKGROUND, ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW AND APPROVAL
11

12 16. On or about August 16, 2019, Real Party submitted an application for approval of a CUP

13 for density increase of 46 percent pursuant to Los Angeles Municipal Code ("LAMC") section

14 12.24-U.26, Density Bonus approval, and Site Plan Review. The requested Density Bonus approval

15 included three off-menu incentives and one waiver of development standards: (1) An off-menu

16 incentive to permit a FAR of 3.26 to 1 in lieu of 1.5 to as permitted in the C2-1XL-CPIO Zone and

17 by CPIO Section IV-2.B; (2) An off-menu incentive to permit a reduction in parking to allow 80

18 residential parking spaces in lieu of the 121 parking spaces required by Density Bonus Parking Option

19 and LAMC Section 12.22-A.25(d)(1); (3) An off-menu incentive to permit the elimination of

20 loading space requirements of LAMC Section 12.21-C.6; and (4) A waiver of development standards

21 to permit a 15.5-foot and two-story increase in the maximum building height to allow a height of 45

22 feet, 5 inches and four stories in lieu of 30 feet and two stories as otherwise permitted in the C2-1XL-

23 CPIO Zone and CPIO Section IV-2.A.2.

24 17. On September 9, 2021 the City Planning Commission ("CPC") approved the Project over

25 objections from Petitioner and other members of the public. The Letter of Determination ("LOD")

26 was mailed on October 5, 2021.

27 18. On October 20, 2021, Petitioner timely filed an appeal of the Project Approvals to the City

28 Council.

5
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

F 19. Numerous organizations submitted statements supporting Petitioner's Appeal including the

2 Center on Race, Poverty and the Environment, the Coastal San Pedro Neighborhood Council, the

3 Central San Pedro Neighborhood Council and the Northwest San Pedro Neighborhood Council.

4 Additionally, Congressmember Nanette Diaz Barragan expressed opposition to the Project in a letter

5 addressed to the City Council.

6 20. On August 2, 2022, the Planning and Land Use Management ("PLUM") Committee of the

7 City Council recommended to deny the appeal, sustain the CPC's CUP and Site Plan Review

8 approvals, determine the Project to be categorically exempt pursuant to CEQA Guidelines § 15332

9 and determine the Project to be within the scope of the San Pedro Community Plan Environmental

10 Impact Report ("EIR" or "Program EIR"). The PLUM Committee did not directly act on Petitioner's

11 challenges to the Density Bonus approval, which the Department of City Planning stated were not

12 appealable. Petitioner objected that the off-menu incentives and waiver are appealable because the

13 procedures of LAMC Sections 12.22, 12.24 and 12.36 provide for a right of appeal.

14 21. On August 17, 2022, the City Council adopted the PLUM Committee recommendation.

15
CEQA'S SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS 16

a 17 22. In 1970, the California Legislature enacted CEQA, as means of forcing public agency

18 decision makers, such as Respondent, to document and consider the environmental implications of

19 their actions. CEQA's fundamental goal is to fully inform the public and the decision makers as to the

20 environmental consequences of proposed projects and to assure members of the public that their

21 elected officials are making informed decisions. CEQA requires governmental authorities, such as

22 Respondent, to fully evaluate potential environmental effects of projects, and to seek feasible means

23 to reduce or avoid significant environmental damage that otherwise could result from their actions.

24 CEQA limits agencies from approving projects with significant adverse impacts when feasible

25 alternatives can substantially lessen such impacts.

26 23. CEQA is California's broadest environmental law and helps to guide public agencies such

27 as the City during issuance of permits and approval of projects. Courts have interpreted CEQA to

28 afford the fullest protection of the environment within the reasonable scope of the statutes. CEQA

6
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

applies to all discretionary projects proposed to be conducted or approved by City, including private

2 projects requiring discretionary government approval. See Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21000 - 21178,

3 and Title 14 Cal. Code Regs., section 753.

4 24. A strong presumption in favor of requiring preparation of an EIR is built into CEQA
which is reflected in what is known as the "fair argument" standard, under which an agency must

6 prepare an EIR whenever substantial evidence in the record supports a fair argument that a project a a

7 a may have a significant effect on the environment. No Oil, Inc. V. City of Los Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.3d

8 68, 75, 82; Friends of "B" St. V. City of Haywood (1980) 106 Cal.App.3d 988, 1002.

9 25. "The EIR is the primary means of achieving the Legislature's considered declaration that it

10 is the policy of this state to 'take all action necessary to protect, rehabilitate, and enhance the

11 environmental quality of the state.' [Citation. ] The EIR is therefore 'the heart of CEQA.' [Citations.]

12 An EIR is an 'environmental "alarm bell" whose purpose it is to alert the public and its responsible

13 officials to environmental changes before they have reached ecological points of no return." Laurel

14 Heights Improvement Assn. v. Regents of Univ. of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 392.

15 26. Under CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines, if a project is not exempt and may cause a

16 significant effect on the environment, the agency must prepare an EIR. Pub. Resources Code,

17 §§ 21100, 21151; 14 Cal. Code Regs. §15064(a)(1), (f)(1). "Significant effect upon the environment"

18 is defined as "a substantial or potentially substantial adverse change in the environment." Pub.

19 Resources Code, § 21068; 14 Cal. Code Regs., § 15382. A project "may" a have a significant effect on

20 the environment if there is a "reasonable probability" that it will result in a significant impact. No Oil,

21 Inc. V. City of Los Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 83 n.16; Sundstrom V. Cnty. of Mendocino (1988) 202

22 Cal.App.3d 296, 309. This standard sets a "low threshold" for preparation of an EIR. Pocket

23 Protectors v. City of Sacramento (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 903, 928; Bowman v. City of Berkeley

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

2 Violation of Due Process

3 Cal. Const., art. I, § 7; U.S. Const., 14th Amend.

4

5 27. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in their
entirety, as though fully set forth herein.

6

7 Lack of Fair and Impartial Appeal Hearing

8

9 28. Petitioner's appeal to the City Council of the CPC's approval included arguments

10 challenging the approval of three off-menu incentives and a waiver of development standard. These
allegations are described in detail below.

11

12 29. The Staff Report prepared by the City Planning Department for the Planning and Land Use

13 Management ("PLUM") Committee stated that the off-menu incentives and waiver of development

14 standard were not appealable. At the hearing, Department of City Planning staff stated that the off-

15 menu incentives and waiver were not appealable and were not before the PLUM Committee.
30. The PLUM Committee recommended denial of the

16 appeal and the City Council adopted its

17 recommendation without substantive discussion of the merits of Petitioner's arguments against the
off-menu incentives and waiver of development standard.

18

19 31. The City violated Petitioner's procedural due process rights by failing to conduct a fair and

20 impartial hearing. Because the Staff Report and presentation to the PLUM Committee asserted that

21 the City lacked jurisdiction to hear or act upon its appeal of off-menu incentives and the waiver of

22 development standard, Petitioner was denied a meaningful opportunity to have its claims heard and

23 decided on the merits in violation of applicable LAMC procedures and the California and United

States Constitutions.

24

25 Inadequate Posting

26

27 32. Petitioner's supplemental appeal justifications noted that the Project site was not properly

28 posted in compliance with LAMC Section 12.24-D.3 and Form CP-7762 which the Director of
Planning promulgated to establish mandatory procedures for site posting.

8
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

33. Petitioner noted that the required notice on the 21 st Street frontage had become unattached

2 to the fence and was not visible to the public. Petitioner also noted that the Pacific Avenue frontage,

3 the most prominent frontage of the Project site, had no notice posted, and that the notice failed to

4 include the specific CPC requirements for posting of the agenda as required by the LAMC and

5 required supplemental Planning forms. Petitioner submitted photographic evidence of improper site

6 posting.

7 34. The City violated the procedural due process rights of members of the public by failing to

8 post the Project site in compliance with the LAMC and applicable regulations, in violation of the

9 California and United States Constitutions.

10
Failure to Permit Testimony at Public Hearing 11

12 35. The City violated Petitioner's due process rights by precluding them from directly

13 addressing the decisionmakers of the CPC. Petitioners encountered significant technical difficulties

14 uploading comments to the City website, interfering with their ability to object to the Project

15 approvals. At the September 9, 2021 CPC hearing, numerous interested citizens attempted to provide

16 a public comment by "raising their hand" on the online Zoom meeting as instructed, but they were not

17 called on by the hearing coordinator. The City has violated the Petitioner's due process rights.

18
Procedural Errors
19

20 36. Following the CPC's approval of the Project, the City issued a Letter of Determination

21 with apparently duplicated findings. Petitioner requested clarification from City staff regarding the

22 apparent duplication, and whether there were any differences between the two findings sections.

23 Petitioner received no reply to its inquiries.

SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

2 Violation of Land Use Ordinances

3 CCP §§ 1085, 1094.5

4 37. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in their

5 entirety, as though fully set forth herein.

6
Density Bonus Ordinance
7

8 38. The City improperly approved an off-menu incentive for FAR in excess of the relief

9 authorized in the Density Bonus Ordinance. Specifically, the City approved a 217 percent increase in

10 FAR, exceeding the maximum 35 percent increase authorized by LAMC Section 12.22-A.25(f)(4)(i),

11 to permit a FAR of 3.26 to in lieu of 1.5 to 1 otherwise permitted by CPIO Section IV-2.B and

12 within the C2-1XL-CPIO Zone. The City therefore exceeded its authority and improperly approved

13 the off-menu incentive for FAR exceeding the relief authorized in the Density Bonus Ordinance.

14 39. The City improperly approved a waiver of development standards for height in excess of

15 the relief authorized in the Density Bonus Ordinance. Specifically, the City approved a height increase

16 of 15 feet-6 inches, exceeding the maximum increase of 11 feet authorized by LAMC Section

17 12.22-A.25(f)(5)(i). The City therefore exceeded its authority by improperly approving a height

18 incentive exceeding the relief authorized in the Density Bonus Ordinance.

19 40. The City further exceeded its authority by improperly approving a fourth incentive under

20 the guise of labeling it a waiver of development standards, in violation of the maximum three

21 incentives authorized by LAMC Section 12.22-A.25(e)(1).

22 41. The City improperly approved an off-menu incentive to require only 80 parking spaces in

23 lieu of 121 parking spaces otherwise required by "Option 1" in LAMC Section 12.22-A.25(d)(1). The

24 City therefore exceeded its authority by improperly approving an off-menu parking incentive

25 exceeding relief authorized in the Density Bonus Ordinance.

26 42. The City improperly approved an off-menu incentive eliminating loading space

27 requirements in LAMC Section 12.21-C.6 despite the incentive resulting in specific adverse impacts

28 due to interfering with traffic and causing hazards for pedestrians, bicyclists and motorists.
10
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

-

2 43. The City erroneously approved a parking reduction pursuant to the Bicycle Parking
Ordinance in conjunction with use

3 of Parking Option 1 within the Density Bonus Ordinance, in
violation of LAMC Section 12.21-A.4.

4

5 44. The unlawful refusal to recognize Petitioner's appeal of off-menu incentives and the

6 waiver of development standards precluded Petitioner from arguing the validity of those approvals.

7 First, Appellant was prevented from arguing that the Project improperly approved the elimination of

8 the loading space. The CPC findings asserted the Project would lose two dwelling units by providing

9 loading space instead of parking, but failed to establish that the marginal change in the size of the

10 Project was necessary to provide for affordable housing costs, given that the Project was already

11 obtaining height, FAR and parking relief. The City's analysis fails to define the analytical route by

12 which the removal of two dwelling units would render the development unable to provide for

13 affordable housing costs. Topanga Ass'n. for a Scenic Community v. County of Los Angeles (1974) 11

14 Cal.3d 506, 515. Fundamentally, the findings fail to show that the waiver of the loading space was

15 necessary to provide for affordable housing costs compared to a development already receiving the
other incentives and waivers.

16

17 45. Moreover, Appellant was unable to argue that the Project's incentives were created by its

18 own request for a 46 percent density increase rather than the 35 percent increase authorized by the

19 Density Bonus Ordinance. It is clear that the Project's incentives are the result of a self-created

20 circumstance due to the additional density from the CUP request allowing additional dwelling units

21 and a financial windfall, in direct violation of State Density Bonus law which allows approval of
incentives only to provide for affordable housing costs.

22

23 CUP Findings

24

25 46. The City failed to adequately support the required findings for the CUP, pursuant to

26 LAMC Section 12.24-U.26, for a 46 percent increase in density in lieu of the maximum 35 percent
density increase allowable in LAMC Section 12.22-A.25.

27

28 47. The third required finding to approve the CUP provides: "The project will enhance the
built environment in the surrounding neighborhood or perform a function or provide a service that is
11
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

essential or beneficial to the community, city or region." The City failed to provide evidence

2 supporting its conclusions for this finding, and failed to outline the analytical route it took to justify its

3 conclusions, in violation of the minimum standards for findings established in Topanga Ass'n. for a

4 Scenic Community v. County of Los Angeles (1974) 11 Cal.3d 506, 515.

5 48. Petitioner demonstrated that the Project would not enhance the built environment or

6 perform beneficial functions because (i) the Project's proposed luxury units would be out of reach for

7 working-class community members, with only a token set-aside for lower-income households for a

8 development within an area the City has determined is already subject to high displacement pressure

9 for low income residents; (ii) the Project's height would exceed the tallest nearby apartment building

10 by over 50 percent, dwarfing other residences in the adjacent community; (iii) the lack of adequate
11 parking and reliance on tandem parking will exacerbate a shortage of street parking in the

12 neighborhood, leading to further accidents and road rage incidents, and causing residents, guests, and

13 service/delivery vehicles to double park, blocking emergency access, evacuation routes and freeway

14 access.

15 49. The fourth required finding to approve the CUP provides: "The project's location, size,

16 height, operations and other significant features are compatible with and will not adversely affect and

17 further degrade adjacent properties, the surrounding neighborhood, and the public health, welfare, and

18 safety." The City failed to provide evidence supporting its conclusions for this finding, and failed to

19 outline the analytical route it took to justify its conclusions.

20 50. Petitioner demonstrated that the Project would be incompatible with and would adversely

21 affect the surrounding neighborhood because: (i) the Project would cast shadows on adjacent

22 residences, transitional height requirements are violated and its balconies would compromise the

23 privacy of adjacent residences; (ii) the Project precludes the location of ground floor commercial uses

24 by placing studios at the ground floor; (iii) the Project would exacerbate infrastructure deficiencies in

25 water, sewer, streets, power, cable, internet and emergency services; (iv) the Project would cause

26 significant hazards to pedestrians, bicyclists, motorists and persons relying on emergency services or
27 tsunami evacuation routes by causing a substantial increase in double parking due to its failure to

28

12
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 provide adequate parking; and (iv) the Project would exacerbate air quality impacts in a uniquely

2 vulnerable SB 535 Disadvantaged Community already highly impacted by health consequences of

3 Port of Los Angeles pollution, noise and traffic.

4 51. The fifth required finding to approve the CUP provides: "The project substantially

5 conforms with the purpose, intent and provisions of the General Plan, the applicable community plan,

6 and any applicable specific plan."

7 52. Petitioner demonstrated that the Project does not substantially conform with the General

8 Plan, Mobility Plan, San Pedro Community Plan, CPIO and Redevelopment Plan because: (1) it

9 violates the Framework Element by permitting a four-story structure not supported by existing
10 infrastructure or transit service, and in fact where transit has been reduced and infrastructure limited

11 by installation of a "road diet"; (2) it violates the San Pedro Community Plan by failing to include

12 distinguishing architectural characteristics, lacking adequate infrastructure support, failing to provide

13 adequate affordable housing given San Pedro's working class demographics, failing to incorporate

14 sufficient on-site amenities, inappropriately locating a large development, and failing to provide

15 adequate parking; (3) it violates the Housing Element by failing to provide adequate affordable

16 housing and exacerbating displacement in a vulnerable community; (4) it violates the Mobility Plan

17 by undermining safe streets and locating a development with inadequate parking in an area lacking

18 transit connectivity; (5) it violates the CPIO by developing an out-of-scale apartment building lacking

19 the architectural characteristics distinctive of San Pedro and by failing to comply with CPIO Design

20 Guidelines regarding open space; (6) it violates the Pacific Corridor Redevelopment Plan by

21 undermining San Pedro's "small town feel," residential privacy and architectural cohesiveness despite

22 a token mural included after the Project's architecture received strenuous objections from the

23 community; and (7) it would violate transitional height requirements of the CPIO and Design

24 Guidelines.

25 53. The sixth required finding to approve the CUP provides: "The project is consistent with

26 and implements the affordable housing provisions of the Housing element of the General Plan."

27 54. Petitioner demonstrated that the Project is not consistent with and does not implement the

28 Housing Element by failing to provide a proportional affordable set-aside in consideration of its
13
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 density increase. The applicant is seeking a 47.5% increase in density, or 32 units (100 total units - 68

2 base units). The number of affordable units is only 16% of base units (11/68) and only 11% of total

3 units (11/100). 11 VLI units out of 100 total units, or 11%, is not proportional to the 32 unit/47.5%

4 density increase. In addition, 11 units (11 percent) is not proportional to the incentives approved by

5 the CPC, of a 117% bonus for FAR, a 52% bonus for height and a 34% reduction in parking.

6
Site Plan Review Findings 7

8 55. The first required finding for Site Plan Review states: "The project is in substantial

9 conformance with the purposes, intent and provisions of the General Plan, applicable community

10 plan, and any applicable specific plan.'

11 56. Petitioner demonstrated that the Project is not in substantial conformance with the General

12 Plan, Mobility Plan, San Pedro Community Plan CPIO and Redevelopment Plan, as articulated above.

13 57. The second required finding for Site Plan Review provides: "The project consists of an

14 arrangement of buildings and structures (including height, bulk and setbacks), off-street parking

15 facilities, loading areas, and landscaping that is compatible with existing and future development on

16 adjacent properties and neighboring properties."

17 58. Petitioner demonstrated that the Project is incompatible with existing and future

18 development because: (i) its height, bulk and setbacks are grossly disproportionate to the prevailing

19 scale and setbacks of the surrounding community; (ii) it fails to provide adequate parking, causing

20 residents to rely on on-street parking and exacerbating roadway hazards and inhibiting emergency

21 access by causing residents to double-park in streets; (iii) it fails to provide an adequate loading space,

22 causing delivery drivers and moving trucks to double park in the street and exacerbating roadway

23 hazards and inhibiting emergency access; (iv) it fails to provide required public open space in
24 violation of the CPIO Design Guidelines; and (v) it fails to comply with transitional height

25 requirements of the CPIO and Design Guidelines.

26 59. The third required finding for Site Plan Review provides: "The residential project provides

27 recreational and service amenities to improve habitability for its residents and minimize impacts on

28 neighboring properties."

14
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

F 60. Petitioner demonstrated that the Project does not provide adequate recreational amenities

2 to minimize impacts on neighboring properties because the rooftop deck and balconies will cause a

3 loss of privacy for adjacent residences and cause nuisance noise impacts. Petitioner further

4 demonstrated noncompliance with transitional height requirements of the CPIO and Design

5 Guidelines.

6
Redevelopment Plan
7

8 61. The City improperly approved Redevelopment Plan Administrative Review for a

9 development not in conformance with the Redevelopment Plan or the Design Standards and

10 Guidelines. The Project violates the Pacific Corridor Redevelopment Plan by failing to provide

11 required parking in violation of Redevelopment Plan Section 514 which provides: "in no case shall

12 parking be less than the requirements of the Los Angeles Municipal Code, including reduced parking

13 requirements at and around transit stations and reductions permitted for shared parking." The City

14 removed the Redevelopment Plan Project Compliant entitlement from the Project application,

15 impeding Petitioner's ability to comment on and object to the determination of Redevelopment Plan

16 compliance.

17 62. The Project fails to comply with the Redevelopment Plan parking standards because it

18 proposes parking not in compliance with the requirements of the LAMC, specifically the requirement

19 to provide one individually accessible space per dwelling unit.

20
CPIO
21

22 63. The City failed to comply with the CPIO by misinterpreting its language to permit the

23 45-degree plane limiting the structure illustrated in the Project's elevations. The plain meaning of the

24 language applies to "the structure" and not merely "portions of the structure" indicating that its

25 transition required a setback and not a 45 degree plane limiting the structure. Furthermore, per CPIO

26 Section IV-2.A.3(b), there is no 45-degree plane specified in the CPIO, in contrast to the language of

27 the Central Commercial Subareas.

28

15
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

-

2 64. The Project's height measured above grade is 45 feet, 5 inches, with the adjacent property

3 line at 1 foot, 5 inches above the Property's grade. Thus, the Project's height as measured at the

4 adjacent lot line is 44 feet, and its height measured 15 feet above the adjacent lot line is therefore 29

5 feet. Applying this standard, the structure shall be set back or stepped back 29 feet, with ten feet of

6 this able to be accommodated within the alley, and thus the building must be stepped back 19 feet

7 from the alley, whereas no setback is proposed. Furthermore, the Project fails to provide a corner
entrance as required by the CPIO Design Standards and Guidelines.

8
LAMC
9

10

11 65. The Project improperly relies on tandem and unbundled parking and fails to provide one

12 individually accessible parking space per dwelling unit in violation of LADBS Bulletin P/ZC

13 2002-001. Furthermore, the Project improperly utilizes tandem a parking in a Commercial Corner
Development.

14

15 66. The Project fails to provide required queuing/maneuvering space for automobiles using

16 tandem parking configurations in violation of LADBS Bulletin P/ZC 2002-001.

17 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

18 Violation of Coastal Act

19 CCP §§ 1085, 1094.5, Coastal Act § 30200(a)

20

21 67. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in their
entirety, as though fully set forth herein.

22

23 68. The City erred in approving the Project in violation of Coastal Act § 30200(a), which

24 requires: "All public agencies carrying out or supporting activities outside the coastal zone that could

25 have a direct impact on resources within the coastal zone shall consider the effect of such actions on
coastal zone resources in order to assure that these policies are achieved."

26

27 69. Petitioner demonstrated that the Project would directly impact the availability of

28 desperately-needed public parking within the Coastal Zone, by means of letters summarizing direct

16
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

-

2 observations and a survey of available public parking spaces in the Project vicinity and within the

3 Coastal Zone, therefore conflicting with Coastal Act § 30252 which requires that new development
must provide adequate parking facilities.

4

5 70. Petitioner demonstrated that the Project would impede emergency evacuation routes by

6 causing double-parking on adjacent streets by residents and delivery/move-in trucks, thereby

7 conflicting with Coastal Act § 30253 which requires that new developments shall minimize risks to
life in areas subject to flood hazards.

8

9 71. Petitioner demonstrated that the Project would be located in an area with inadequate public

10 services, including transportation and sewer facilities, causing significant individual and cumulative

11 effects on coastal resources in conflict with Coastal Act § 30250 which requires that new development

12 shall be located in areas with adequate public services to ensure they will not have significant
individual or cumulative effects on coastal resources.

13

14 72. Finally, Petitioner demonstrated that the Project is not visually compatible with the

15 surrounding area because it is grossly out-of-scale with existing development within and adjacent to

16 the Coastal Zone, directly conflicting with Coastal Act § 30251 which requires § that new development

17 shall be visually compatible with surrounding areas. The Project further fails to comply with
transitional height requirements of the CPIO and Design Guidelines and therefore results in an

18 incompatible building mass relative to adjacent structures.

19

20 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

21 Abuse of Discretion; Violation of CEQA

22 CCP §§ 1085, 1094.5

23 Ineligibility for Class 32 Categorical Exemption (Guidelines § 15332)

24

25 73. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in their
entirety, as though fully set forth herein.

26

27 74. The City erred in determining that the Project was exempt from CEQA pursuant to

28 Guidelines § 15332 (Class 32 - Infill Development) because it does not meet the conditions necessary
to qualify for the Class 32 Categorical Exemption. As detailed in CEQA Guidelines Section 15332, to
17
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

use a Class 32 Exemption, a project must meet the following conditions: (1) The project is consistent

2 with the applicable general plan designation and all applicable general plan policies as well as with

3 applicable zoning designation and regulations. (2) The proposed development occurs within city

4 limits on a project site of no more than five acres substantially surrounded by urban uses. (3) The

5 project site has no value as habitat for endangered, rare or threatened species. (4) Approval of the

6 project would not result in any significant effects relating to traffic, noise, air quality, or water quality.
7 (5) The site can be adequately served by all required utilities and public services.

8 75. First, the Project is not consistent with applicable general plan and zoning designation for

9 the reasons stated herein, including violation of the Density Bonus Ordinance, the Redevelopment

10 Plan, the CPIO and failure to justify the required findings for the CUP and Site Plan Review. Second,
11 the Project site is not adequately served by existing infrastructure. Third, the Project would result in

12 significant air quality, noise and traffic impacts.

13 76. Second, Petitioner submitted an expert report from RK Engineering, Inc. establishing that

14 the Project failed to account for CNEL noise levels at sensitive receptors, failed to account for

15 sensitive receptors less than 50 feet from the noise source, underestimated maximum construction

16 noise levels and improperly assumed a 20 dBA noise reduction for construction equipment which

17 would not obstruct line-of-sight to sensitive receptors.

18 77. Third, Petitioner submitted an expert report from SWAPE that established that the Class 32

19 Categorical Exemption was inapplicable because the Project would result in significant air quality

20 impacts for several reasons: (i) the CalEEMod air model relied on unsubstantiated assumptions

21 including land use sizes, changes to construction phase lengths, reductions to off-road equipment

22 usage and reductions in worker trips; (ii) a properly-prepared air model with corrected assumptions

23 demonstrates significant construction and operational air quality impacts for Volatile Organic

24 Compounds (*VOCs") and nitrous oxides ("NOx") emissions; (iii) diesel particulate matter emissions

25 were inadequately evaluated for numerous reasons; and (iv) a screening level analysis utilizing

26 AERSCREEN demonstrates significant health risk impacts. The SWAPE report further demonstrated

27 that the Project would result in significant greenhouse gas emissions.

28

18
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 78. Fourth, Petitioner demonstrated that the City relied on an erroneous baseline for traffic and

2 air quality analysis by considering the commercial structure to be occupied as a high-traffic restaurant.

3 In fact, the structure has been a small local bar with limited hours for many years.

4 79. The City erred determining that the Project was exempt from CEQA pursuant to

5 Guidelines § 15332 because the Project contributes to significant adverse cumulative impacts which

6 preclude use of a categorical exemption pursuant to Guidelines § 15300.2, subd. (b).

7 80. Petitioner demonstrated that the City's cumulative impact analysis improperly restricted

8 "related projects" to those within a 500 foot radius of the Project site, excluding numerous large-scale
related projects including an apartment building at 13th Street and Pacific Avenue proposed by the

10 same developer, the West Harbor Modification Plan and other developments, which would contribute

11 to significant adverse cumulative impacts if properly analyzed.

12 81. The City erred determining that the Project was exempt from CEQA pursuant to

13 Guidelines § 15332 because the Project is subject to unusual circumstances which preclude use of a

14 categorical exemption pursuant to Guidelines § 15300.2, subd. (c).

15 82. Petitioner demonstrated that the Project is subject to unusual circumstances precluding use

16 of a Categorical Exemption including its location within an area with unusually poor air quality and

17 health impacts, its location on the High Injury Network while failing to provide adequate parking or

18 loading facilities, and its location in an area poorly served by infrastructure including sewer facilities.

19
Ineligibility for Program EIR Streamlining
20

21 83. The City erred in determining the Project was eligible for streamlined CEQA review

22 pursuant to Guidelines §§ 15168 and 15162.

23 84. Petitioner established that the Project materially exceeded the scope of the San Pedro

24 Community Plan EIR, which contemplates grants of density bonuses only to the extent authorized by

25 the Density Bonus Ordinance (35 percent) rather than the increase granted to the Project (46 percent).

26 Further, the Project materially exceeds the scope of development contemplated in the Community

27 Plan EIR because it is not compatible with adjacent developments and fails to provide appropriate

28

19
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

F height transitions to maintain compatibility and residential privacy. Finally, Petitioner established that

2 the generic findings in the Statement of Overriding Considerations for the Community Plan EIR are

3 insufficiently specific to apply to the Project.

4 85. Petitioner further established that since the Covid-19 pandemic began in early 2020, the

5 Community Plan area has seen a dramatic increase in work-from-home and remote work, which has

6 created an acute street parking shortage unforeseen when the Community Plan EIR was prepared. As

7 a result, there has been a significant change in the circumstances under which the Community Plan is

8 being undertaken, also causing new impacts as a result of inconsistencies with Coastal Act public

9 access policies, including Coastal Act § 30252.

10 86. Petitioner also demonstrated that the West Harbor Modification Plan will cause significant

11 changes in the circumstances under which the Project is being undertaken, causing new significant

12 and more intense environmental impacts due to an increase in air quality impacts, noise, and traffic

13 congestion due to "tailgating" on public streets during events. The Community Plan EIR and the NOE

14 failed to adequately consider cumulative noise and air quality impacts due to the combination of the

15 Project and the West Harbor Modification Plan.

16 87. Finally, Petitioner submitted an expert report from Soil/Water/Air Protection Enterprise

17 ("SWAPE"). The SWAPE report established that the Project was not consistent with Guidelines

18 co. 15162 because additional mitigation measures substantially different from those identified in the

19 Community Plan EIR would substantially reduce significant impacts. The Community Plan EIR

20 identified only three mitigation measures to reduce air quality impacts, whereas SWAPE identified an

21 additional 28 measures which were not included. SWAPE further identified additional mitigation

22 measures to reduce GHG impacts which were not included in the Community Plan EIR.

23
Unstable Project Description
24

25 88. Throughout the approval process, the City regularly changed the Project description in

26 material ways including using inconsistent soil and grading calculations, removing the

27

28

20
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Redevelopment Project Compliance Review approval from the Project entitlements and adding an off-

2 menu incentive to reduce parking requirements. The regular changes precluded Petitioner from

3 knowledgably reviewing and objecting to the Project.

4 89. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondent prejudicially abused its discretion by

5 failing to proceed in the manner required by law. Accordingly, Respondent's actions must be set aside.

6
NOTICE OF COMMENCEMENT OF CEOA PROCEEDING
7

8 90. On September 28, 2022, prior to filing this Petition, Petitioner, through its counsel, served
the City with notice of Petitioner's intention to immediately commence a proceeding against

10 Respondents for violation of CEQA in connection with the Project. A copy of the letter providing

11 such notice is attached to this Petition as Exhibit A and is incorporated herein by this reference. This

12 letter satisfied Petitioner's duties under Public Resources Code section 21167.5.

13 91. On September 28, 2022, Petitioner, through its counsel, served the California Attorney

14 General with notice of the commencement of this lawsuit, together with a true and correct copy of this

15 Petition. A copy of such notices (without the petition attached to such notices) are attached to this
16 Petition as Exhibit B and are incorporated herein by this reference. Such notice satisfies Petitioner's

17 duties under Public Resources Code section 21167.7 and California Code of Civil Procedure, section

18 388.

19
PREPARATION OF THE RECORD
20

21 92. Pursuant to Public Resources Code, section 21167.6(b)(2), Petitioner elects to prepare the

22 record of proceedings in this action. Concurrently with this Petition, Petitioner is filing notice of its

23 election to prepare the administrative record. A copy of that election is attached as Exhibit C.

24
PRAYER FOR RELIEF
25

26 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for relief as follows:

27 1 . For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate, commanding Respondent:

28

21

a. to vacate and set aside approval of the Project, including, but not limited to, the Planning

2 Director's Determination and associated approvals;

3 b. to vacate and set aside the CEQA exemption determination for the Project;

4 C. to prepare and certify a legally adequate environmental review for the Project;

5 d. to suspend any and all activity pursuant to Respondent's approval of the Project that could

6 result in an adverse change or alteration to the physical environment until Respondent has complied

7 with all requirements of CEQA and all other applicable state and local laws, policies, ordinances and

8 regulations as are directed by this Court pursuant to Public Resource Codes Section 21168.9.

9 2. For a stay, temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, and permanent injunction

10 prohibiting any actions by Respondent pursuant to Respondent's approval of the Project and

11 environmental clearance for the Project until Respondent has fully complied with all requirements of

12 CEQA, Planning and Zoning Laws and all other applicable state and local laws, policies, ordinance

13 and regulations.

14 3. For costs of the suit;

15 4. For attorneys' fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5; and
