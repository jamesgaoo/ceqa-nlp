20 7. a Build Better is a full transition to the collection and expenditure of Citywide
21 Development Impact Fees ("DIF"). Build Better includes citywide development impact fees for
22 mobility, fire and library assets. The citywide fee is intended to allow the City to prioritize funding
23 where the City believes the funds are most needed rather than to the area where the impact from the
24 development occurs. Existing community-specific fees range from as low as $2,000 to as high as
25 $137,000. The citywide fee will reduce the fee in some areas and increase the fee in other areas;
26 regardless of the cost of improvements where the development or needed improvements occur (in
27 particular, land costs). In communities where the citywide DIF is lower than the community specific
28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

DIF; Build Better will go into effect within 60 days of adoption of Build Better. In areas where the

2 citywide DIF is higher than the community specific DIF; Build Better will go into effect stating July 1,
3 2023.

4 BACKGROUND AND HISTORY

5 8. Respondent is a charter city encompassing 342.5 square miles. The City stretches 40

6 miles from north to south. In 2020 the City had a population of 1.5 million residents. Development in
7 the City has shifted significantly from vacant land on the outskirts of the City to the urbanized areas in

8 the City's core.
9 9. The General Plan sets out a citywide long-range vision and policy framework to guide
10 future development, provide public services and maintain the qualities that define San Diego.
11 Community plans are a component of the General Plan. The community plans express the General
12 Plan policies for specific communities through the provision of more site-specific recommendations
13 that implement goals and policies, and guide zoning and the Capital Improvement Program.
14 10. The City encompasses 52 community plan areas with 52 community plans. Six
15 community plans are in the process of being updated. City staff is proposing significant density

16 increases in each of the community plans currently being updated. Only Barrio Logan is considered a
17 Community of Concern that will benefit from Build Better. Although increased density is proposed
18 for Clairemont Mesa, College Area, Mira Mesa, University City and Uptown; these communities may
19 not benefit from Build Better and may see reduced DIF applied to capital improvements outlined as
20 needed in the community plans.
21 11. Prior to adoption of Build Better the Respondent relied on DIF in the urbanized
22 communities to partially mitigate new development impacts. Per City regulations, these fees could be
23 spent only within the communities where the new development occurred. Respondent relied on
24 Facilities Benefits Assessment in the new suburban communities. The FBA historically provided
25 100% of the funds to support development in these areas. FBA was removed from the municipal code
26 in 2016; all communities now rely on DIF.
27

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

12. Respondent initiated public engagement on the Build Better SD program in the Fall of
2 2021. Public engagement included nine meetings with adults and children in "underserved"

3 communities in February 2022 and one virtual public workshop on March 10, 2022.

4 13. The Community Planners Committee ("CPC"') was instituted to ensure communication

5 and solicit citizen input on citywide issues. Council Policy 600-09 designates each Planning Group

6 chair to be the group's representative to the CPC. The City planning department presented Build
7 Better to the CPC on March 22, 2022. The CPC unanimously voted to request Build Better not be

8 approved until each community planning group had an opportunity to review the program. Members
9 of Livable San Diego participated in the discussion at CPC.

10 14. The Planning Commission recommends changes to the City's General Plan and
11 community plans, makes recommendations on the Capital Improvement Budget, re-zonings and
12 related land use matters, and has final approval authority on subdivisions and some discretionary
13 permits. The Planning Commission is made up of seven volunteers appointed by the Mayor and
14 confirmed by the City Council. The Planning Commission considered and approved Build Better on
15 April 21, 2022. At that time, the Planning Commission was comprised of four developers, one
16 landscape architect, one planning consultant and one community planning group representative.
17 Members of Livable San Diego provided comments and public input to the Planning Commission
18 prior to the close of the public hearing.
19 15. The Active Transportation and Infrastructure Committee is a is a committee of the City
20 Council responsible for individual infrastructure projects related to water, wastewater, storm water,
21 and parks. The committee is comprised of four members of the City Council. The Active
22 Transportation and Infrastructure approved Build Better on June 22, 2022. Members of Livable San
23 Diego provided comments and public input to the Active Transportation and Infrastructure Committee
24 prior to the close of the public hearing.
25 16. Notice of the public hearing before the City Council scheduled for August 1, 2022 was
26 published in the San Diego Daily Transcript on July 1, 18 and 25, 2022. The staff report and 34
27 related documents were made available to the public on July 27, 2022. The required Fire and Rescue
28

5
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

Nexus Fee Study was not made available at that time. The City Council agenda provided a link to a

2 file that was corrupted and inaccessible.

3 17. The City Council held a public hearing on August 1, 2022 and approved all the actions

4 associated with Build Better SD. Members of Livable San Diego provided comments and input to the

5 City Council prior to the close of the public hearing.

6 18. The City Council held a public hearing to adopt the Build Better program on September
7 13, 2022. The Council adopted the program at the close of the public hearing. Members and a

8 representative of Livable San Diego provided comments and public input prior to the close of the
9 public hearing.
10 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

11 AND INADEQUATE REMEDIES AT LAW

12 19. Petitioner/Plaintiff has exhausted all available administrative remedies, and objections

13 to the Project have been presented orally and in writing to Respondent.

14 20. Petitioner has no adequate remedy at law unless this Court grants the requested writ of

15 mandamus requiring Respondent to rescind its approval of the Build Better program and declaring the

16 program invalid. In the absence of such remedy, Build Better will remain in effect in violation of the

17 United States Constitution, California Constitution, Mitigation Fee Act and CEQA.

18 Petitioner/Plaintiff will suffer irreparable harm because of significant adverse impacts on city

19 infrastructure caused by development that pays for infrastructure improvements that will not occur in

20 the area of the impacts.

21 21. Petitioner/Plaintiff has performed all conditions precedent to filing this action by

22 complying with all requirements and has no other remedy than to bring this action. All other requests

23 of Respondent, having been previously made, would be futile.

24 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

25 (Constitutional Nexus and Proportionality)
22. Petitioner/Plaintiff incorporates by reference each of the allegations set forth in this
26 Petition as if set forth herein in full.
27

28

6
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

23. Build Better is constitutionally invalid on its face, Respondent cannot avoid an
2 unconstitutional result in the administration of Build Better.

3 24. Respondent cannot make the essential nexus between the imposition of DIF and the

4 impact of the proposed development. A development may be required to pay DIF associated with a

5 project that can be 40 miles from where the improvements paid by the DIF are located. There is no

6 nexus between the payment of DIF and the public impact of the proposed development.
7 25. Respondent cannot show rough proportionality between the magnitude of the DIF and
8 the effects of the proposed development. The cost of public improvements needed to mitigate the

9 impacts of a project in areas of the City where land values are significantly lower are not the same as
10 the cost of public improvements in areas of the City where land values are significantly higher.
11 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

12 (Mitigation Fee Act)

13 26. Petitioner/Plaintiff incorporates by reference each of the allegations set forth in this

14 Petition and Complaint as if set forth herein in full.

15 27. Build Better violates the Mitigation Fee Act on its face.

16 28. Respondent cannot administer Build Better without violating the Mitigation Fee Act.

17 Respondent cannot show the DIF being charged to a development project is related to the specific

18 project being permitted.

19 29. Respondent cannot show there is a reasonable relationship between the use of the DIF,

20 the type of development and the need for the public facility. Respondent cannot show there is a

21 reasonable relationship between the amount of the DIF and the cost of the public facility or portion of

22 the public facility attributable to the development on which the fee is imposed.

23 30. Respondent failed to make the Fire and Rescue Nexus Fee Study available to the public

24 prior to the City Council meeting as required by the Mitigation Fee Act.

25 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION
(CEQA)
26 31. Petitioner/Plaintiff incorporates by reference each of the allegations set forth in this
27 Petition as if set forth herein in full.
28

7
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

32. Respondent cannot rely on an Addendum to the 2008 General Plan EIR because

2 circumstances have changed since the adoption of the General Plan EIR in 2008. Respondents'

3 adoption of Complete Communities allows significant new density not considered in the 2008 EIR

4 a with a significant reduction in DIF paid by projects built under Complete Communities. This places a

5 higher burden on projects not developed under Complete Communities to pay for the necessary

6 infrastructure because Complete Communities projects are not paying their fair share towards
7 infrastructure.

8 33. Respondent cannot rely on an Addendum to the 2008 General Plan EIR because the

9 project has changed. The Public Facilities Element of the General Plan relies on development to pay
10 its fair share of future public facility and public service needs. This was accomplished through FBA
11 and DIF. Build Better would eliminate reliance on community specific DIF and could direct DIF to be
12 used in areas that will not be impacted by the development responsible for paying the DIF.
13 34. Respondent cannot rely on Build Better to mitigate the impacts of development on the
14 community where the impacts occurred. Therefore, impacts on public facilities and services from a
15 specific development will remain significant and an EIR will be required for any project that relies on
16 DIF to mitigate the impacts of development.
17 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

18 WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully prays:
19 1. That this Court find that, Build Better SD is constitutionally invalid on its face;
20 2. That this Court declare that Build Better SD is constitutionally invalid on its face;
21 3. That this Court find that an Addendum to the General Plan EIR does not comply with
22 a CEQA and a new or supplemental EIR is required.
23 4. That this Court order Respondent to rescind approval and adoption of Build Better SD;
24 5. a That this Court issue a peremptory writ of mandamus declaring Build Better SD null
25 and void of no force or effect;
26 6. That Petitioner be awarded its reasonable costs incurred in this action;
27
