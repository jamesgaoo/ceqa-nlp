Petition for Writ of Mandate -

I. INTRODUCTION

2 1. Coastal Ranches Conservancy hereby submits this Petition for Writ of Mandate and
3 Injunctive and Declaratory Relief.
4
2.
5 The Petition requests this Court issue a Writ of Mandate pursuant to California

6 Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 enjoining the California Department of State Parks and

7 Recreation ("State Parks") to obtain permit coverage for their appropriative water use Gaviota

8 Creek; ordering them to evaluate and mitigate the impact of their water diversion on public trust

9 resources and uses at Las Cruces Spring; and ordering them to comply with the mitigated negative

10 declaration prepared pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act.
11 II. THE PARTIES
12
A.
13 Coastal Ranches Conservancy

14 3. Petitioner Coastal Ranches Conservancy is non-profit 501(c)(3) public benefit
15| corporation organized under the laws of California in 2003.

16 4. Coastal Ranches Conservancy's mailing address is located at 68 Hollister Ranch
17 Rd., Gaviota, CA 93117.
18 5. Coastal Ranches Conservancy's mission is to conserve, protect and restore the
19

20 Gaviota Coast, a globally significant Mediterranean landscape and biodiversity hot spot

21 representing fifty percent of the remaining rural coastline in Southern California. Properties within

22 the Gaviota Coast are owned by the State of California and private farmers and ranchers. (Coastal

23 Ranches Conservancy, Where We Work < https://coastalranchesconservancy.org/where-we-work/

24 [as of June 24, 2022].)

25 B. California Department of State Parks and Recreation
26 6. Respondent State Parks is legal subdivision of the State of California, created by
27
the California legislature effective in 1927.
28

Petition for Writ of Mandate 2

1 7. State Parks is the lead agency for purposes of environmental review of the project

2 of constructing new water treatment facilities and new water lines to connect the Las Cruces/Hot

3 Springs and main day use areas of Gaviota State Park and Caltrans rest area at Gaviota Pass under
4
the California Environmental Quality Act.
5
8.
6 According to State Parks, their department's mission is to "help preserve the state's

7 extraordinary biological diversity, protecting its most valued natural and cultural resources. ." for

8 the people of California. (Cal. Dept. of Parks and Rec., About Us,

9 <https://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=91> [as of June 24, 2022].)

10 9. According to State Parks, their "lands protect and preserve and unparalleled
11 collection of culturally and environmentally sensitive structures and habitats, threatened plant and
12
animal species, ancient Native American sites, historic structures and artifacts ... the best of
13

14 California's natural and cultural history." (Cal. Dept. of Parks and Rec., About Us,

15 <https://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=91> [as of June 24, 2022].)

16 III. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

17 10. This Court has the authority to issue a writ of mandate to the State Parks as the
18 Supreme, appellate, and superior courts in California have original jurisdiction over actions in the
19 nature of mandamus, and the Court therefore may issue such a writ to any party over which it has it
20

21 proper jurisdiction. (Cal. Const., art. VI, § 10; see also Civ. Proc. Code § 1085.)

22 11. This Court has jurisdiction over claims against State Parks pursuant to Code of

23 Civil Procedure section 1085, as Coastal Ranches Conservancy seeks to compel from the State

24 Parks "the performance of an act which the law specifically enjoins, as duty resulting from an

25 office, trust, or station." (Civ. Proc. Code, § 1085(a).)
26 12. This Court has jurisdiction over this CEQA writ action under sections 1085 and
27

28 1094.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure. This Court also has jurisdiction over this CEQA writ

Petition for Writ of Mandate 3

1 action under sections 21168 and 21168.5 of the Public Resources Code.

2 13. Venue is proper in this Court under Code of Civil Procedure § 394 because the
3 Respondent, State Parks, is a state agency that operates statewide, including within the County of
4
Santa Barbara and because the impacts of the State Park's activity are and will continue to impede
5

6 on the ecosystems and public trust resources of Gaviota Creek watershed, located in Santa Barbara

7 County.

8 14. Petitioner has standing to bring this action.

9 IV. CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY BACKGROUND

10 A. Code of Civil Procedure Section 1085

11 15. Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 is a codification of the common law remedy
12

13 of traditional mandamus. (Dowell v. Superior Court of San Francisco (1956) 47 Cal.2d 483, 486

14 87.)

15 16. Section 1085(a) allows a party to seek a writ of mandate "by any court to any
16 inferior tribunal, corporation, board, or person, to compel the performance of an act which the law
17 | specially enjoins, as a duty resulting from an office, trust, or station." (Code Civ. Pro., § 1085(a).)
18 17. A writ of mandate is available where a state agency a "has a nondiscretionary duty
19 under the law to take action and has failed or refused to do so." (Cal. Assn. of Sanitation Agencies
20
V.
21 State Water Res. Control Bd. (2012) 208 Cal.App.4th 1438, 1460.)

22 18. While issuance of such a writ lies in the discretion of the court, "where one has

23 substantial right to protect or enforce, and this may be accomplished by such a writ, and there is

24 no other plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, he is entitled as a matter

25 of right to the writ, or, in other words, it would be an abuse of discretion to refuse it." (Gay v.
26 Torrance (1904) 145 Cal. 144, 147-148.)
27

28

Petition for Writ of Mandate 4

1 B. Reasonable Use Doctrine

2 19. The California Constitution requires that all water be put to beneficial use. (Cal.

3 Const., art. X, § 2.)
4
20. In addition to the requirement that all water be put to beneficial use, all water rights
5

6 in Califoria are constrained by the "rule of reasonableness," which has been preserved in the state

7 Constitution since 1928. See, e.g., Light v. State Water Res. Control Bd. (2014) 2014

8 Cal.App.LEXIS 523, at *17 (citing Cal. Const., art. X, § 2)

9 21. This constitutional requirement is "generally construed as applying a rule of

10 reasonable use 'to all water rights enjoyed or asserted in this state, whether the same be grounded
11 on the riparian right or the right, analogous to the riparian right, of the overlying land owner, or
12

13 the percolating water right, or the appropriative right." (Joslin, 67 Cal.2d at 138 (quoting Peabody

14 City of Vallejo (1935) 2 Cal.2d 351, 383).)

15 22. Specifically, article X, section 2 of the Califoria Constitution states:

16 It is hereby declared that because of the conditions prevailing in this State the

17 general welfare requires that the water resources of the State be put to beneficial
use to the fullest extent of which they are capable, and that the waste or
18 unreasonable use or unreasonable method of use of water be prevented, and that the conservation of such waters is to be exercised with a view to the reasonable
19 and beneficial use thereof in the interest of the people and for the public welfare. Tbe right to water or to the use or flow of water in or from any
20 natural stream or water course in this State is and shall be limited to such

21 water as shall be reasonably required for the beneficial use to be served, and
such right does not and shall not extend to the waste or unreasonable use or
22 unreasonable method of use or unreasonable method of diversion of
water. Riparian rights in a stream or water course attach to, but to no more than so
23 much of the flow thereof as may be required or used consistently with this section, for the purposes for which such lands are, or may be made adaptable, in view of
24 such reasonable and beneficial uses; provided, however, that nothing herein contained shall be construed as depriving any riparian owner of the reasonable use
25 of water of the stream to which the owner's land is riparian under reasonable
26 methods of diversion and use, or as depriving any appropriator of water to which the appropriator is lawfully entitled. This section shall be self-executing, and the
27 Legislature may also enact laws in the furtherance of the policy in this section
contained.
28

Petition for Writ of Mandate 5

1 (emphasis added). The rule of reasonableness, i.e., the reasonable use doctrine, is the overriding
2 principle governing the use of water in California. (See Peabody, 2 Cal.2d at 367-68.)
3 23. The constitutional mandate that unreasonable use and waste of the State's waters be
4
prevented is also codified at sections 100 and 101 of the Water Code. (Water Code, § 100 & 101.)
5
24.
6 California Water Code section 100 also requires the water resources of the state to

7 be put to beneficial use to the fullest extent of which they are capable. (Id.)

8 25. What constitutes an unreasonable use of water is determined on a case-by-case

9 basis depending on the totality of circumstances. (See Peabody, 2 Cal.2d at 368; see also Joslin,
10 67 Cal.2d at 139; Imperial Irrigation Dist. v. State Water Res. Control Bd. (1986) 186 Cal.App.3d
11 1160, 1165.)
12
26.
13 "What may be a reasonable beneficial use, where water is present in excess of all

14 needs, would not be a reasonable beneficial use in an area of great scarcity and great

15 need." (Tulare Irrigation Dist. v. Lindsay-Strathmore Dist. (1935) 3 Cal.2d 489, 567.)

16 27. Conformity of a use, method of use, or method of diversion of water with local

17 custom shall not be determinative of its reasonableness, but is considered as one factor to be

18 weighed in determining the reasonableness of the use, method of use, or method of diversion
19 within the meaning of Article X of the California Constitution. (Water Code § 100.5.)
20
28.
21 Impacts on public trust uses are a relevant consideration in determining whether a

22 diversion is unreasonable.

23 29. In issuing regulations to prevent unreasonable use of a water body segment, the

24 California State Water Resources Control Board ("State Board") has acknowledged that high

25 demand for water, and other water uses can impact stream systems in ways that are harmful to
26 salmonids. (SWRCB Resolution No. 2011-0047.)
27

28

Petition for Writ of Mandate 6

1 30. Specifically, the State Board has stated that "Stranding mortality has occurred

2 when salnionids were unable to escape from rapidly receding waters." (SWRCB Resolution No.
3 2011-0047 p.1)
4
31. Further, the State Board has acknowledged properly managing streamflow can
5

6 provide enough water to both meet human needs and prevent stranding mortality. (SWRCB

7 Resolution No. 2011-0047.)

8 32. When reasonable altemnatives to current practices exist, diversions are considered

9 unreasonable. (Id.)

10 33. The reasonableness of a use of water changes over time. "What is a beneficial use
11

12 at one time may, because of changed conditions, become a waste of water at a later time." (Tulare

13 Irrigation Dist., 3 Cal.2d at 576.)

14 34. Further, the reasonableness of a use of water "cannot be resolved in vacuo isolated

15 from statewide considerations of transcendent importance. Paramount among these [is] the ever
16 increasing need for the conservation of water in this state, an inescapable reality of life quite apart

17 from its express recognition in the 1928 amendment." (Joslin, 67 Cal.2d at 140.)
18 35. The Califomia Supreme Court has found the unreasonableness of a specific use of
19
water to be self-evident as a matter of law. Light, 2014 Cal.App.LEXIS at *19-20 (citing Tulare
20

21 Irrigation Dist., 3 Cal.2d at 568; Joslin, 67 Cal.2d at 141 (holding that the use of waters to expose

22 and carry and deposit sand, gravel, and rock was "as a matter of law unreasonable within the

23 meaning of the constitutional amendment").)

24 36. A water user cannot acquire a vested right to the unreasonable use of water. (See,

25 e.g., Joslin, 67 Cal.2d at 145.)
26

27

28

Petition for Writ of Mandate 7

37. A water right holder's water use is properly involuntarily curtailed based on the

2 unreasonableness of the use. (See, e.g., Joslin, 67 Cal.2d at 140-41; see also Gray, The Modern

3 Era in California Water Law (1994) 45 Hastings L.J. 249, 253-72.)
4
38. "When the supply of water in a particular stream system is insufficient to satisfy all
5

6 beneficial uses, water rights users must curtail their use."* (Light, 2014 Cal.App.LEXIS at *39.)

7 39. Compliance with the California Constitution is mandatory and self-

8 executing. (Katzberg v. Regents of U.C. (2020) 29 Cal.4th 300, 307; see also Leger v. Stockton

9 Unified School Dist. (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 1448; State Bd. of Ed. v. Levit (1959) 52 Cal.2d. 441.)
10 40. Mandatory, self-executing Constitutional duties give rise to claims for declaratory
11 and injunctive relief. (Katzberg, supra, at 307; Leger, supra, at 1454-1455.)
12
41.
13 A writ of mandate pursuant to section 1085 is available to compel compliance with

14 constitutional duties, such as prevention of waste, unreasonable use, or unreasonable methods of

15 use. (Light, 2014 Cal.App.)

16 C. The Public Trust Doctrine in California

17 42. The Public Trust Doctrine establishes that the waters and wildlife of the state

18 belong to the people, and that the state acts as a trustee to manage and protect these resources and
19 their associated public uses for its peoples' benefit, including from harmful diversion by water
20

21 rights holders. (Audubon, 33 Cal. 3d at pp. 437, 441-449.)

22 43. Under the common law doctrine, the state holds tidal and navigable waters in trust

23 for public uses, which California courts have expanded to include not only navigation, commerce,

24 and fishing, but also recreation and habitat conservation. (Center for Biological Diversity v. FPL
25 Group, Inc. (2008) 166 Cal.App.4th 1349, 1360-61.)
26 44. All state agencies, such as State Parks, are obligated to "demonstrate affirmatively
27
that that the state has taken the public trust into account when making a decision about the 28

Petition for Writ of Mandate 8

management and use of trust property." (San Francisco Baykeeper, Inc. v. State Lands

2 Commission (2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 202, 242.)

3 45. California's public trust doctrine further imposes "an affinmnative duty to take the
4
public trust into account in the planning and allocation of water resources.' (Audubon, 33 Cal.3d
5

6 at p. 446. see also Environmental Law Foundation, 26 Cal.App.5th 844 at 865.)

7 46. The public trust doctrine, relating to water, is codified in the Califomia

8 Constitution, which states that "[u]se of the people's waters is of vital public concern, and all

9 waters shall be managed for the greatest public benefit." (Cal. Const., art. X, § 2.)
10 47. Section 102 of the Water Code provides that "All water within the State is the
11 property of the people of the State."
12
48.
13 The California Supreme Court has recognized that "[t]he objective of the public

14 trust has evolved in tandem with the changing public perception of the values and uses of

15 waterways" and that "the state is not burdened with an outmoded classification favoring one mode

16 of utilization over another." (Audubon, 33 Cal.3d at p. 434 [internal quotations omitted].)

17 49. California's public trust doctrine has evolved to protect a "far broader" range of
18 protected public trust uses, including "the right to hunt, bathe or swim, and the right to preserve
19
[trust resources] in their natural state." (Berkeley v. Superior Court (1980) 26 Cal.3d 515, 521.)
20
50.
21 The California Supreme Court has held one of the most important public trust uses

22 to be "the preservation of those lands in their natural state, so that they may serve as ecological

23 units for scientific study, as open space, and as environments which provide food and habitat for

24 birds and marine life, and which favorably affect the scenery and climate of the area." (Marks v.
25 Whitney, 6 Cal.3d at pp. 259-260; see also Environmental Law Foundation, 26 Cal.App.5th at p.
26 853 ("The public trust doctrine ... protects the public's right to use, enjoy and preserve the Scott
27

28 River in its natural state and as a habitat for fish" [internal punctuation omitted]).)

Petition for Writ of Mandate 9

51. *Wild fish have always been recognized as a species of property the general right

2 and ownership of which is in the people of the state" - quintessential public trust resources. (Cal.
Trout v. State Wat. Res. Control Bd. (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 585, 630.)
4
52. "The title to and property in the fish within the waters of the state are vested in the
5

6 state of Califomnia and held by it in trust for the people of the state." (Id., quoting People v.

7 Monterey Fish Products Co. (1925) 195 Cal. 548, 563.)

8 53. *The public trust doctrine, as recognized and developed in California decisions,

9 protects navigable waters from harm caused by diversion of nonnavigable tributaries." (National

10 Audubon Society, 33 Cal.3d at 437 (footnotes omitted), see also Environmental Law Foundation v.
11 State Water Resources Control Bd., 26 Cal.App.5th 844.)
12
54.
13 Specifically, the public trust doctrine protects groundwater hydrologically

14 connected to navigable surface waters. (Id. at 436-37., see also Environmental Law Foundation v.

15 State Water Resources Control Bd., 26 Cal.App.5th 844)

16 55. When extraction of groundwater adversely impacts a navigable waterway, the

17 public trust doctrine applies. (Environmental Law Foundation, at 859.)
18 56. The Court in Environmental Law Foundation highlighted that "the pivotal fact is
19 not whether water is diverted or extracted or the fact that it is water itself adversely impacting the
20

21 water within the public trust. Rather, the determinative fact is the impact of the activity on the

22 public trust resource." (Environmental Law Foundation, at 859.)

23 57. Further, "the public trust doctrine is more than a state's raw power to act; it imposes

24 an affirmative duty on the state to act on behalf of the people to protect their interest in navigable

25 water." (Environmental Law Foundation, at 857.)
26 58. In National Audubon, the California Supreme Court expanded the contemplated
27

28 scope of planning and allocation activities that implicate the State's public trust duty to encompass

Petition for Writ of Mandate 10

1 "diversions from a nonnavigable tributary [that] impair the public trust in a downstream river or

2 lake." (National Audubon Society, at p. 436., see also Environmental Law Foundation.)
3 59. Prior to approval of any such allocation, state courts and agencies must "consider
4
the effect of [grants of usufructuary rights] upon interests protected by the public trust, and
5

6 attempt, SO far as feasible, to avoid or minimize any harm to those interests." (ld. at p. 426., see

7 also Environmental Law Foundation.)

8 60. While the State always retains the power to reconsider allocation decisions made

9 "after due consideration of their effect on the public trust," its duty to do SO is "even stronger when
10 that decision failed to weigh and consider public trust uses." (ld. at p. 447, see also Environmental
11 Law Foundation.)
12
61.
13 Citizens may enforce State agency's affirmative duty to comply with the public

14 trust doctrine in court. (Audubon, 33 Cal.3d at p. 431 n.11, citing Marks v. Whitney, 6 Cal.3d at

15 pp. 261-62; see also Center for Biological Diversity (2008) 166 Cal.App.4th 1349, 1366 ["the
16 public retains the right to bring actions to enforce the trust when public agencies fail to discharge

17 their duty"].)
18 62. A writ of mandate pursuant to section 1085 may lie for violations of California's
19 public trust doctrine. (See San Francisco Baykeeper, Inc. v. State Lands Com. (2015) 242
20

21 | Cal.App.4th 202, 242.)

22 D. The California Environmental Quality Act

23 63. The fundamental goals of environmental review under CEQA are information,
24| participation, mitigation, and accountability. (Lincoin Place Tenants Ássn. V. City of Los Angeles.

25 (2007) 155 Cal.App.4th 425, 443-444.)
26 64. Courts have found, "[t]he CEQA process is intended to be a careful examination,
27

28 fully open to the public, of the environmental consequences of a given project, covering the entire

Petition for Writ of Mandate 11

project, from start to finish. This examination is intended to provide the fullest information

2 reasonably available upon which the decision makers and the public they serve can rely in

determining whether or not to start the project at all, not merely to decide whether to finish it. The
[environmental review] is intended to furnish both the road map and the environmental price tag
5

6 for a project, So that the decision maker and the public both know, before the journey begins, just

7 where the journey will lead, and how much they-and the environment-will have to give up in order

8 to take that journey." (NRDC v. City of Los Angeles (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 268, 271.)

65. The purpose of the initial study is to provide the lead agency with adequate

10 information regarding a project to determine the appropriate environmental review document and
11 "documentation of the factual basis for the finding in a negative declaration that a project will not
12
have
13 significant effect on the environment." (Ctr. For Sierra Nevada Conservation v. County of

14 El Dorado (2012) 202 Cal. App. 4th 1156, 1170, citations omitted.)

15 66. There must be a basis within the record to support the conclusions reached by the
16 initial study. (Lighthouse Field Beach Rescue v. City of Santa Cruz (2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 1170,

17 1201.)

18 67. One of CEQA's chief purposes is to reduce the adverse environmental impacts of
19
development projects by incorporating project alternatives or mitigation measures. (Pub.
20

21 Resources Code § 21001.)

22 68. "A 'mitigation measure' is a suggestion or change that would reduce or minimize
23 significant adverse impacts on the environment caused by the project as proposed." (Lincoln Place
24 Tenants Assn. v. City of Los Angeles (2007) 155 Cal.App.4th 425, 445 ("Lincoln Place IM').)

25 69. Mitigation measures must be "fully enforceable through permit conditions,
26 agreements, or other measures." (Pub. Resources Code § 21081.6(b).)
27

28

Petition for Writ of Mandate 12

70. "[MJitigating conditions are not mere expressions of hope." (Lincoln Place Tenants

2 Assn. V. City of Los Angeles (2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 1491, 1508 ("Lincoln Place P').)

71. "The purpose of these requirements is to ensure that feasible mitigation measures
4 will actually be implemented as a condition of development, and not merely adopted and then
5

6 neglected or disregarded." (Federation of Hillside & Canyon V. City of Los Angeles (2000) 83

7 Cal.App.4th 1252, 1261; Katzeff v. California Dept. of Forestry and Fire Protection (2010).181.....

8 Cal.App.4th 601, 612; Lincoln Place I, 130 Cal.App.4th 1491.)

9 72. Relevant here, "[o]nce incorporated, mitigation measures cannot be defeated by
10 ignoring them or by *attempting to render them meaningless by moving ahead with the project in
11 spite of them." (Lincoln Place II, 155 Cal.App.4th at 450.)
12
V. FACTUAL BACKGROUND
13

14 A. Gaviota Creek Watershed

15 73. Gaviota Creek is a tributary to the Pacific Ocean, located along the Gaviota Coast

16 and running largely parallel to U.S. Highway 101 in a north-south orientation.

17 74. The 12,877-acre watershed of Gaviota Creek rises from sea level at Gaviota State

18 Beach to 2,800 feet in elevation near where U.S. 101 and State Highway 1 intersect at Las Cruces.
19
Tributaries, including the West Fork of Gaviota Creek, Las Canovas Creek, and Las Cruces Creek,

21 flow from headwater springs north-west of Gaviota Peak to converge to form Gaviota Creek's

22 Upper Reach, which flows for approximately 5.0 miles toward Gaviota Canyon.

23 75. The waters proceed through the Canyon Reach and Lower Reach another
24| approximately 2.0 miles before joining the Gaviota Lagoon, one of the largest estuarine systems
25| along the southern Santa Barbara County coast. Gaviota Creek's Lower Reach is almost entirely
26 within Gaviota State Park.

Petition for Writ of Mandate 13

1 76. The Gaviota Coast is reputed to be one of the top 15 biodiversity hot spots on the

2 planet. It is a region where the ranges of northern and southern species overlap, cold ocean currents

3 meet warmer curtents, and where many endemic species can be found.

77. The watershed supports endangered and threatened species such as the Southern
5

6 California steelhead, tide-water goby, California red-legged frog, and south-western pond turtle.

7 78. Gaviota Creek is a navigable waterway that contains resources protected by the.

8 public trust doctrine. Public trust protected resources and uses in Gaviota Creek include sensitive

9 and rare species such as the Southern California steelhead, tide-water goby, California red-legged
10 frog, and south-western pond turtle.
11 B. Southern California Steelhead
12
79.
13 The Southern California Steelhead Distinct Population Segment (DPS) is officially

14 listed as an endangered species under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). (Endangered and

15 Threatened Species: Listing of Several Evolutionary Significant Units (ESUs) of West Coast

16 Steelhead, 62 FR 43937-01.)

17 80. Gaviota Creek is a Core 2 watershed supporting endangered Southern California
18 Steelhead. (U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service, Southwest Region, Southern California
19

20 steelhead recovery plan (Jan. 2012) sec. 7-5.)

81.
21 The Core 2 watershed includes both those portions of coastal watersheds that are at

22 least seasonally accessible to Southern California Steelhead entering from the ocean and the

23 upstream portions of watersheds that are currently inaccessible to Southern California Steelhead

24 due to man-made barriers but were historically used by Southern California Steelhead.

25 82. Gaviota Creek watershed is one of the few in southern California that consistently
26 hosts a viable population of Southern California Steelhead.
27
83.
28 Fish passage barriers and decreased water flow in Gaviota Creek inhibit access to

Petition for Writ of Mandate 14

1 potential and historic spawning sites and limit use of the habitat during various life stages of the

2 Southern California Steelhead.

3 84. These habitat concemns must be resolved to sustain the population of Southemn
4 California Steelhead for the long term.
5
85.
6 Like most remaining steelhead streams in California, Gaviota Creek experiences

7 hot, dry summers which leads to low flows and warm water temperatures, both of which will..

8 impact critical steelhead life history requirements including migration, spawning, growth, and

9 survival. (Barnhart, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Biological Report, Species Profiles: Life
10 Histories and Environmental Requirements of Coastal Fishes and Invertebrates (Pacific
11 Southwest) Steelhead (June 1986); see also Moyle, University of California Press. Inland Fishes of

14 https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/prograrns/tmdl/records/state_board/1998/ref2608.pd

15 f> [as of July 15, 2022].)

16 86. Any actions that decrease surface flows and rearing habitat, reduce cool-water

17 inflows, or raise water temperatures, will impact steelhead over a portion, if not all, of their life-
18 history components. (ld.)
19
C. State Parks' Water System
20

21 87. State Parks owns and operates the land surrounding a natural spring ("Las Cruces

22 Spring") on the north slope of Gaviota Peak. (Matthew Foster, State Water Resources Control

23 Board, Las Cruces/Gaviota State Park Sanitary Survey Engineering Report (2015) at p. 3
24 ("Sanitary Survey"); (BergerABAM, Water Source-of-Supply Alternatives Evaluation Report for
25

26 Gaviota State Park (2018) at pp. 5, 7 ("Water Source Report").)

88.
27 When unobstructed, Las Cruces Spring's cool, relatively consistent flow feeds Las

28 Canovas Creek, Gaviota Creek's largest and most significant tributary. (ld.)

Petition for Writ of Mandate 15

1 89. At some time prior to October 6, 1988, State Parks began diverting water from Las

2 Cruces Spring for storage and use at the campground.
3 90. State Parks diverts spring water using a "spring box" originally constructed in 1980
4

5 and rebuilt in 1998, at a rate of about 26,000 GPD through a 900-gallon collection tank and a

6 three-inch transmission pipe to reach the Gaviota-Las Cruces Water Treatment Plant. (Id.)

7 91. After treatment, the diverted creek water travels to a 94,000-gallon steel storage

8 tank constructed in 2015. (Winzler & Kelly Consulting Engineers, Final Water and Sewer

9 Assessment Report (2008) at pp. 1, 7; Sanitary Survey, at p.3.)
10 92. A booster station then supplies potable water up to about 91 people via six service
11 connections through two-inch transmission mains pressurized to between 30 and 80 psi. (Sanitary
12

13 Survey at p.1.)

14 93. Areas served include residences inhabited by State Parks employees, the Gaviota

15 State Park campground, beach and day use areas, and two Caltrans roadside rest stops along
16 Highway 101. (Sanitary Survey at p. 5; Water Source Report at p.5)

17 94. State Parks has no license, permit or other authorization for the diversion and

18 appropriation of water at Las Cruces Spring.
19
95.
20 Historically Las Cruces Spring provided cool, un-diverted spring water to Las

21 Canovas Creek and Gaviota Creek.

22 96. The estimated average output of Las Cruces Spring at this time is 19gpm,

23 97. However, for decades State Parks has diverted 11-40gpm at Las Cruces Spring for

24 use at the Park or at the Caltrans Rest Stop on HWY 101.

25 98. This diversion results in increased water temperatures as well as flow reductions of
26 up to 63% in Hot Springs Creek, 40% in Las Canovas Creek, and 20% in Gaviota Creek.
27
99.
28 Further, this diversion at Las Cruces Spring contributes additional stress to the

Petition for Writ of Mandate 16

1 already endangered Southern Califoria Steelhead living at the southern extent of its range.

2 100. Increased water temperatures and flow reductions result in uninhabitable conditions

3 for Southern Califomia Steelhead.
4
101. Increase water temperatures and flow reductions result in Souther California
5

6 Steelhead mortality, and prevents the recovery of this protected species.

7 D. California Environmental Quality Act and Impact Mitigation

8 102. In order to comply with CEQA, State Parks prepared a negative declaration for a

9 project that would install new water lines to serve Gaviota State Park and the Gaviota rest stops
10 (Project).
11 103. State Parks adopted a negative declaration for the Project in 1998. (State Clearing
12

13 House No. SCH 9806118.) The negative declaration is clear that the Project could cause adverse

14 "impacts to surface water resources and related potential impacts to plants and wildlife" without

15 "the project operation standards described."

16 104. In order to prevent those adverse impacts, State Parks' negative declaration

17 provides for "project operation standards." Specifically, "To ensure that coincidence of peak use
18 periods does not adversely impact biological resources in the Hot Springs and Las Canovas
19

20 Creeks, during the period of July 1 through September 30, the Caltrans well will be utilized at full

21 capacity any time the spring source drops below 30 gpm. Based on the foregoing, potential

22 impacts to surface water resources and related potential impacts to plants and wildlife can be

23 avoided through the project operation standards described and no significant adverse impacts to

24 these resources will occur."

25 105. In January 2022, Petitioner was informed that State Parks was not, in fact.
26 suspending use of the creek water source during the summer months when flows drop below 30
27
gpm.
28

Petition for Writ of Mandate 17

106. State Park's negative declaration and the Conditional Use Permit issued by the

2 County of Santa Barbara (98-DP-029 and 98-CP-074) contains two additional requirements: that
State Parks 1) remove all of the old, obsolete water pipe in the Gaviota Creek channel; and 2)
**prior to approval of a Coastal Development Permit", seek permits or waivers of permits for the
5

6 project from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, US Fish and Wildlife Service, and

7 the Army Corps of Engineers.

8 107. Parks has failed to remove the old, obsolete water pipes in the Gaviota Creek

9 channel as required by the project description. Petitioner has photographed and documented the
10 presence of these pipes as recently as June 26, 2022.
11 108. Petitioner sought documentation under California Public Record Act from the
12

13 California Department of Parks and Recreation, the County of Santa Barbara, and the Califomia

14 Department of Fish and Wildlife to determine if Parks had complied with the permitting

15 requirements described in paragraph 107 above.

16 109. California Department of Parks and Recreation, the County of Santa Barbara, and

17 the California Department of Fish and Wildlife did not produce any evidence that State Parks had
18 applied for or obtained permits or waivers as required.
19
110.
20 Since learning that State Parks has not implemented the Project and its mitigation

21 as described in the negative declaration, Petitioner sought enforcement of the project operation

22 standards with the State Parks, the County of Santa Barbara, and with the State Water Board.

23 111. Given the ongoing nature of the failure to implement the project operation

24 standards, this Petition is timely filed.

25 E. Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies
26 112. The Coastal Ranches Conservancy has made significant efforts to seek State Parks'
27

28 compliance with state law via letters to State Parks and Santa Barbara County and petitions to the

Petition for Writ of Mandate 18

- State Board without success.

2
113. Given that the CEQA violations are based on the failure to implement the Project
3

4 according to the negative declaration, Petitioner's members were not able to raise their concerns

5 during the administrative process for the Project.

6 114. However, after learning that State Parks has not curtailed use of Las Canovas Creek

7 during summer months or when flows drop below 30 gpm, Petitioner raised its concerns with the

8 County of Santa Barbara, California Department of Fish and Wildlife, and the State Water

9 Resources Control Board, by submitting letters and emails to both agency staff and elected
10 officials and copying in the appropriate DPR staff.
11
115. Petitioner, its members, and/or other agencies and individuals raised each of the 12

13 legal deficiencies asserted in this Petition orally or in writing during the Respondent's decision

14 making process or upon learning that the Project and its mitigation were not implemented as

15 approved.

16 116. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law
17 unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate and injunctive relief.
18
117. In the absence of such remedies, State Parks' continued use of Las Canovas Creek
19

20 during the summer and times of low flows would form the basis for a development project that

21 would be proceeding in violation of state law.

22 118. Petitioner complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.7 by sending a copy

23 of this Amended Petition to the California Attorney General. A copy of that notice is attached as

24 Exhibit A.
25
119. Petitioner submitted a notice of commencement of this action to State Parks prior to
26

27 filing the Original Petition. A copy of that notice is attached as Exhibit B.

28 120. Petitioner elects to prepare the administrative record. A copy of that election is

Petition for Writ of Mandate 19

•

attached as Exhibit C.

2 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

3 Against Respondent California Department of State Parks and Recreation

4 Pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure § 1085
For Waste and Unreasonable Use of Water
5
121.
6 Petitioner Coastal Ranches Conservancy herein incorporates each preceding

7 paragraph of this Petition.

8 122. State Parks has failed to comply with their mandatory duty under the California

9 Constitution that requires use of state water resources be reasonable and beneficial.

10 123. State Parks' compliance with this duty is mandatory and self-executing.
11 124. State Parks' diversion of water at Las Cruces spring constitutes an unreasonable
12 diversion of state water resources.
13
125.
14 State Parks' diversion results in increased water temperatures as well as flow

15 reductions of up to or more than 63% in Hot Springs Creek, 40% in Las Canovas Creek, and 20%

16 in Gaviota Creek.

17 126. State Parks' diversion and method of diversion has an adverse impact on public
18 trust resources, specifically, streamflow and Southern California Steelhead populations.
19 127. As such, State Parks' use and method of use is wasteful and unreasonable.
20
WHEREFORE, Coastal Ranches Conservancy prays for the relief set forth below.
21

22 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

23 Against Respondent California Department of State Parks and Recreation Pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure § 1085
24 For Violations of Public Trust Duties

25
128.
26 Petitioner Coastal Ranches Conservancy herein incorporates each preceding

27 paragraph of this petition.

28 129. The state holds tidal and navigable waters in trust for public uses including

Petition for Writ of Mandate 20

4

1 navigation, commerce, fishing, recreation, and habitat conservation.

2 130. Southern California Steelhead are a public trust resource.

131. State Parks' diversion of 10-40gpm at Las Cruces Spring harms Southern
4

5 California Steelhead by it killing fish and making it difficult to repopulate the stream.

132.
6 State Parks has a public trust duty consider the effect of their use of public trust

7 resources. (Environmental Law Foundation, at 862.)

8 133. State Parks has a duty to consider the impact of public trust resources resulting

9 from the diversion at Las Cruces spring, and where feasible, eliminate those impacts.
10 (Environmental Law Foundation, at pp. 859-60.)
11 134. The public trust harms resulting from State Parks' diversion continue.
12

13 WHEREFORE, Coastal Ranches Conservancy prays for the relief set forth below.

14

15 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

16 Against Respondent California Department of State Parks and Recreation Pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act
17 For Failing to Comply with the Negative Declaration as Required by CEQA

18 135. Petitioner Coastal Ranches Conservancy herein incorporates each preceding
19 paragraph of this Petition.
20 136.
21 State Parks' negative declaration provides, "To ensure that coincidence of peak use

22 periods does not adversely impact biological resources in the Hot Springs and Las Canovas

23 Creeks, during the period of July 1 through September 30, the Caltrans well will be utilized at ful!

24 capacity any time the spring source drops below 30 gpm. Based on the foregoing, potential

25 impacts to surface water resources and related potential impacts to plants and wildlife can be
26 avoided through the project operation standards described and no significant adverse impacts to
27 these resources will occur."
28

Petition for Writ of Mandate 21

1 137. Thus, the negative declaration contains concrete and specific mitigation to protect

2 sensitive biological resources.

3 138. The negative declaration is clear that the Project could cause adverse "impacts to
4
surface water resources and related potential impacts to plants and wildlife" without "the project
5

6 operation standards described."

7 139. Despite this requirement, Petitioner has recently learned that State Parks is not, in

8 fact, requiring that the Caltrans well be used instead of water derived from the Hot Springs and

9 Las Canovas Creeks.

10 140. State Parks' failure to enforce the mitigation contained in its CEQA document
11 violates the law.
12
141.
13 State Parks' negative declaration and conditional use permits also require State

14 Parks to remove obsolete water supply pipes in Gaviota channel.

15 142. State Parks has failed to remove those pipes as required.

16 143. State Parks' negative declaration and conditional use permit also require State

17 Parks to seek permits or waivers from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, US Fish

18 and Wildlife Service, and the Army Corps of Engineers.
19
144. State Parks has neither sought nor received permits from those agencies for the
20

21 Project.

22 145. State Parks has neither sought nor received waivers from those agencies for the

23 Project.

24 146. CEQA prohibits lead agency from deleting mitigation measures incorporated into

25 a project without environmental review. If a mitigation measure later becomes "impractical or
26 unworkable," the "governing body must state a legitimate reason for deleting an earlier adopted
27

28 mitigation measure, and must support that statement of reason with substantial evidence." (Sierra

Petition for Writ of Mandate 22

•

1 Club v. County of San Diego (2014) 231 Cal.App.4th 1152, 1168.

2 147. The removal of adopted mitigation requires supplemental environmental review

3 that neither the County nor State Parks appears to have undertaken. Accordingly, pursuant to its
4 CEQA approval, State Parks is required to cease use of Las Cruces Spring, from July 1 to
5

6 September 30, when the spring source drops below 30 gpm.

7 148. CEQA also requires environmental review to contain a stable project description.

8 Adequate CEQA review requires a complete and accurate project description. The MND's "bona

9 fide subject" must be "[t]he defined project and not some different project."(Concerned Citizens

10 of Costa Mesa v. 32nd Dist. Agric. Assn. (1986) 42 Cal.3d 929, 938.) Put differently, "An
11 accurate, stable and finite project description is the Sine qua non of an informative and legally
12

13 sufficient" CEQA review. (County of Inyo v. City of Los Angeles (1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 185, 193.)

14 149. The lead agency must implement the Project as described in the environmental

15 review. If not, additional environmental review is necessary. (Concerned Citizens of Costa Mesa

16 V. 32nd Dist. Agric. Assn. (1986) 42 Cal.3d 929; See, Ventura Foothill Neighbors v. County of

17 Ventura (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 429.)
18 150. The negative declaration describes the Project as requiring use of the Caltrans well
19 during summer when flows drop below 30 gpm.
20
151.
21 Petitioner has recently learned that the Project, as implemented, does not actually

22 involve switching to use of the Caltrans well during these periods of low flow where steelhead and

23 other sensitive species would be harmed by Project operations.

24 152. CEQA does not tolerate attempts to sweep important public safety issues "under

25 the rug." (Concerned Citizens of Costa v Mesa v 32nd Dist. Ag. Ass'n. (1986) 42 Cal. 3d 929, 935.)
26 153. State Parks' implementation of a Project whose actual impacts were never
27

28 disclosed to the public and decisionmakers, analyzed, or mitigated, violates CEQA.

Petition for Writ of Mandate 23

1 WHEREFORE, Coastal Ranches Conservancy prays for the relief set forth below.

2

3 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

154. Petitioner Coastal Ranches Conservancy prays that this Court issue a Writ of
5 Mandate ordering Respondent State Parks to obtain permit coverage for its appropriative water
6
use.
7
155.
8 Coastal Ranches Conservancy prays that this Court order the State Parks to comply

9 with their public trust duties and stop diversions from the Gaviota Creek until there has been

10 sufficient analysis regarding the impact to public trust resources from the spring diversion , and

11 where feasible mitigate those impacts.

12 156. Coastal Ranches Conservancy prays that this Court order the State Parks to comply
13 with CEQA and their negative declaration which contains concrete and specific mitigation to
14

15 protect sensitive biological resources, or, in the altemnative, to implement the Project as described

16 in the negative declaration.

17 157. Coastal Ranches Conservancy seeks other injunctive and/or declaratory relief, as

18 appropriate.

19 158. Coastal Ranches Conservancy further seeks an award of reasonable fees and costs
20 for bringing suit for the State Parks' violations of State law as provided under Code of Civil
21 Procedure Section 1021.5; and
22
159.
23 Any such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.
