9 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
(California Environmental Quality Act)
10 17. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference in this cause of action the preceding paragraphs of this
11 Petition and Complaint as if fully set forth here.
12 18. The County had a mandatory legal duty to apply the environmental review procedures required
13 by CEQA to Permit No. 2014-539 and to determine whether its approval of Permit No. 2014-539 may
14 have significant adverse environmental effects before approving Permit No. 2014-539.

15 19. The County failed to discharge this mandatory legal duty.

16 20. CEQA requires that public agencies determine whether their "discretionary" decisions to

17 approve projects that may affect the physical environment may have significant adverse environmental

18 effects. CEQA does not apply to "ministerial projects." (Public Resources Code § 21080(a), CEQA

19 Guidelines § 15268.) A discretionary project is one that "requires the exercise of judgment or

20 deliberation when the public agency decides to approve or disapprove a particular activity, as

21 distinguished from situations where the public agency or body merely has to determine whether there

22 has been conformity with applicable statutes, ordinances or regulations." (CEQA Guidelines § 15357.)
Ministerial projects, on the other hand "involve little or no personal judgment by the public official as to
23 the wisdom or manner of carrying the project. The public official merely applies the law to the facts as
24 presented but uses no special discretion or judgement in reaching a decision. A ministerial decision a
25 involves only the use of fixed standards or objective measurements, and the public official cannot use

: 26 personal, subjective judgement in deciding whether or how the project should be carried out." (CEQA
27 Guidelines § 15369.)
28 21. Under well settled California law,

Law Offices of •..
N. Lipps the touchstone [for discretionary approvals] is whether the approval process involved allows

the government to shape the project in any way which could respond to any of the concerns
2 which might be identified in an environmental impact report. And when is government foreclosed from influencing the shape of the project? Only when a private party can legally
3 compel approval without any changes in the design of its project which might alleviate adverse
4 environmental consequences. The term "ministerial" is limited to those approvals which can be legally compelled without
5 substantial modification or change. Thus, the fact city lacks the discretion to deny building permit outright in the event environmental problems are identified does not make issuance of the
6 permit "ministerial." It is enough the city retains discretion to require substantial changes in
7 building design. [1] An agency's "classification of a certain approval process as ministerial is not conclusive."

10 App. 3d 817, 823.
11 22. County Code section 9.36.150 provides:
12 Except as may be otherwise provided by this chapter, standards for the construction,
13 repair, reconstruction or abandonment of wells shall be as set forth in Chapter II of the Department of Water Resources Bulletin No. 74, "Water Well Standards" (February
14 1968), or as subsequently revised or supplemented, which are incorporated in this chapter

15 and made a part a of this chapter.
23. The Introduction to Chapter II of Department of Water Resources Bulletin No. 74, "Water Well
16 Standards" (February 1968), provides:
17 The standards presented in this chapter are intended to apply to construction (including
18 reconstruction) or destruction of wells throughout the State of California. Under certain

19 circumstances, adequate protection of ground water quality may require more stringent standards than these presented here: under other circumstances, it may be necessary to
20 deviate from the standards or substitute other measures which will provide protection equal to that provided by. these standards. Since it is impractical to prepare standards for 21 every conceivable situation, provision has been made in the succeeding material for
22 deviation from the standards as well as for addition of appropriate supplementary standards. The need to deviate from general recommendations and to apply additional
23 standards are the principal reasons that the Department is also investigating the
24 development of different or supplemental water well construction standards for various subareas within the State. However, the Department believes that the standards presented
25 in this report are satisfactory under most conditions for the construction and destruction of water wells in all areas of this state.
26 24. Subdivision A of Section 5 of Chapter II provides: 27 In locations where existing geologic or ground water conditions require standards more
28 restrictive than those described herein, or in addition to them, such special standards may be prescribed by the enforcing agency.

25. The County issues well construction permits pursuant to Title 9, Chapter 9.36 of the Stanislaus
2 County Code.

3 26. The County is required to exercise discretion in deciding whether to issue all well construction
4 permits, including Permit No. 2014-539, because County Code section 9.36.150 incorporates the s specific or general grants of discretion to the County health officer set forth in Department of Water

6 Resources Bulletin No. 74 and its updates, and the County may deny permits or require changes in the

7 project as a condition of permit approval to address concerns relating to environmental impacts.

8 Consequently, the County cannot exempt any well construction permits, including Permit No. 2014-539,

9 from CEQA on grounds the decision is ministerial.
27. In the alternative, the County is required to exercise discretion in deciding whether to issue all 10 well construction permits, including Permit No. 2014-539, because the County well construction permit
11 ordinance codified in County Code Chapter 9.36 does not meet or exceed the standards adopted by the
12 state in Department of Wäter Resources Bulletin No. 74 and its updates, as required by Water Code con
13 13801, subd. (c); therefore, as a matter of law, the Model Groundwater Ordinance adopted by the State
14 Water Resources Control Board in 1989 governs the County's approval of well construction permits and
15 said Model Groundwater Ordinance grants discretion to the County health officer to deny permits or
16 require changes in the project as a condition of permit approval to address concerns relating to
17 environmental impacts. Consequently, the County cannot exempt any well construction permits,
18 including Permit No. 2014-539, from CEQA on grounds the decision is ministerial.

19 28. The COUNTY prejudicially abused its discretion in violation of CEQA by issuing Permit No.
-.. ... .. 20 2014-539 without conducting the environmental review required by CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines

21 (Public Resources Code §§21002.1, 21061, 21080, 21100, 21151; Title 14, California Code of

..* 22 Regulations §§15002(k), 15006, 15061, 15063-15065, 15070, 15071).
29. 23 At all times mentioned herein, Respondent COUNTY has been able to comply with CEQA in

24 reviewing and approving Permit No. 2014-539. Notwithstanding such ability, Respondent COUNTY
failed to perform its duty to review by issuing Permit No. 2014-539 pursuant to CEQA.
25 30. Plaintiffs bring this action pursuant to Public Resources.Code §21167, subdivisions (a) or (d).
26 Respondent COUNTY did not file any formal notice authorized by subdivision (b) of Section 21152 of
27 the Public Resources Code with respect to its approval of these permits. Plaintiffs are informed and
28 believe and on that basis allege that the Project commenced on February 23, 2015.

2 had nor had any available administrative remedies to exhaust with respect to the claims alleged in this

13 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
14 (Due Process)

15 135. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference in this cause of action the preceding paragraphs of this

16 Petition and Complaint as if fully set forth here.

17 36. Pursuant to the due process clauses of the federal and state constitutions, Plaintiffs have a

18 procedural due process right to reasonable notice and opportunity to be heard before governmental

19 deprivation of a significant property interest from governmental decisions which are adjudicative in

20 nature. (Horn v. County of Ventura (1979) 24 Cal.3d 605, 612.)
37.
21 The County approved and issued Permit No. 2014-539 without providing Plaintiffs any notice or
opportunity to be heard.
22 38.
23 The County's approval of Permit No. 2014-539 is adjudicative in nature, because it requires
application of general standards to specific real property and is determined by facts peculiar to the
24 individual case. (Horn v. County of Ventura (1979) 24 Cal.3d 605, 614.)
25 39. The County's approval of Permit No. 2014-539 has caused and threatens to continue to cause a
26 substantial interference with Plaintiffs' property interests, including but not limited to loss of
27 groundwater supply in Plaintiffs' wells; increased traffic congestion; increased risk of traffic accidents;
28 increased air pollution by dust, pesticide drift, diesel pump generator exhaust, and increased noise

2 40. Plaintiffs have no other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law and
3 will suffer irreparable injury unless this Court issues the relief requested in this action.
THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION 4 (Declaratory Relief)
5 41. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference in this cause of action the preceding paragraphs of this
6 Petition and Complaint as if fully set forth here.
7 42. The County has a policy of approving well construction permits pursuant to Title 9, Chapter 9.36
8 of the Stanislaus County Code without applying the environmental review procedures of CEQA to its
9 permit approval decisions and without determining whether its approval of such well construction
10 permits maÿy have significant adverse environmental effects before making its permit approval decisions.
11 43. The County is required to exercise discretion in deciding whether to issue all well construction
12 permits because County Code section 9.36.150 incorporates the specific and general grants of discretion
13 to the County health officer set forth in Department of Water Resources Bulletin No. 74 and its updates,
14 and the County may deny permits or require changes in the project as a condition of permit approval to a

15 address concerns relating to environmental impacts. Consequently, the County cannot exempt any well
construction permits from CEQA on grounds the decision is ministerial. 16

17 44. In the alternative, the County is required to exercise discretion in deciding whether to issue all

18 well construction permits because the County well construction permit ordinance codified in County

19 Code Chapter 9.36 does not meet or exceed the standards adopted by the state in Department of Water

20 Resources Bulletin No. 74 and its updates, as required by Water Code § 13801, subd. (c); therefore, as a
matter of law, the Model Groundwater Ordinance adopted by the State Water Resources Control Board
21 in 1989 governs the County's approval of well construction permits and said Model Groundwater
22 Ordinance grants discretion to the County health officer to deny permits or require changes in the
23 project as a condition of permit approval to address concerns relating to environmental impacts.
24 Consequently, the County cannot exempt any well construction permits from CEQA on grounds the
25 decision is ministerial.
26 45. At all times mentioned herein, Respondent County has been able to comply with CEQA in
27 reviewing and approving these permits. Notwithstanding such ability, Respondent County has failed

28 and continues to fail to perform its duty to review these permit applications pursuant to CEQA.

46. An actual and present controversy has arisen and now exists between Plaintiffs and County
2 concerning the County's pattern, practice and policy of not reviewing well construction permit

3 applications pursuant to CEQA, a policy which Plaintiffs challenge herein as unlawful.

4 WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray for judgement as follows:

5 On the First Cause of Action:

6 47. For a peremptory writ of mandate pursuant to subdivision (a) and (b) of Public Resources Code cOp

7 21168.9, which provide:

a. If a a court finds, as a result of a trial, hearing, or remand from an appellate court, that any
determination, finding, or decision of a public agency has been made without compliance with

10 this division, the court shall enter an order that includes one or more of the following: following:

11 (1) A mandate that the determination, finding, or decision be voided by the public

12 agency, in whole or in part.
(2)
13 If the court finds that a specific project activity or activities will prejudice the
consideration or implementation of particular mitigation measures or alternatives to the 14 project, mandate that the public agency and any real parties in interest suspend any or
15 all specific project activity or activities, pursuant to the determination, finding, or
16 decision, that could result in an adverse change or alteration to the physical environment,
17 until the public agency has taken any actions that may be necessary to bring the
18 determination, finding, or decision into compliance with this division.
19 (3) A mandate that the public agency take specific action as may be necessary to

20 bring the determination, finding, or decision into compliance with this division.
21 b. Any order pursuant to subdivision (a) shall include only those mandates which are

22 necessary to achieve compliance with this division and only those specific project activities in

23 noncompliance with this division. The order shall be made by the issuance of a peremptory writ

24 of mandate specifying what action by the public agency is necessary to comply with this

25 division. However, the order shall be limited to that portion of a determination, finding, or
decision or the specific project activity or activities found to be in noncompliance only if a court 26 finds that:

(3) the court has not found the remainder of the project to be in noncompliance with
this division. The trial court shall retain jurisdiction over the public agency's
proceedings by way of a return to the peremptory writ until the court has determined that
the public agency has complied with this division.
On the Second Cause of Action:

48. For a peremptory writ of mandate commanding the County to void its approval and issuance of

procedures of CEQA to its permit approval decisions and without determining whether its approval of
12 such well construction permits may have significant adverse environmental effects before making its
13 permit approval decisions is unlawful because County Code section 9.36.150 incorporates the specific
14 and general grants of discretion to the County health officer set forth in Department of Water Resources
15 Bulletin No. 74 and its updates, and the County may deny permits or require changes in the project as a

24 changes in the project as a condition of permit approval to address concerns relating to environmental

25 impacts. Consequently, the County cannot exempt any well construction permits from CEQA on

Re: Notice of Intent to Commence CEQA Action Regarding Well Construction
Permits

Dear Ms Aggers and Ms Mein:
This office represents Jamie Coston, Heidi Coston, Andrea Medeiros, Milton Medeiros, Kelly Vella, Carl Wong, Vivien Wong (hereinafter referred to as "PLAINTIFFS") with respect to the County's approval of well construction Permit No. 2014-539.
I am writing to provide written notice pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.5 that Plaintiffs intend to a file a lawsuit on or before August 18, 2015, challenging the County's approval of this well construction permit on grounds the approval violates the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") (Public Resources Code 21000 et seq.).
This approval violates CEQA because it is a discretionary decision that triggers the application of CEQA's environmental review procedures, but the County failed to apply CEQA or to determine whether its approval of well construction permits may have significant adverse
environmental effects.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Very truly yours,
1om Apre
Thomas N. Lippe
