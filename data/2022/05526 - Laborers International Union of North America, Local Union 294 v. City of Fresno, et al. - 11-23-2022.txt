Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

INTRODUCTION

2 1. Petitioner Supporters Laborers International Union of North America, Local Union 294

3 ("LIUNA" or "Petitioner") brings this action to challenge the unlawful actions of Respondents City of

4 Fresno, the City Council of the City of Fresno, and the City of Fresno Planning and Development

5 Department (collectively, "City" or "Respondents") in approving the Busseto Foods Processing,

6 Warehousing, and Distribution Facility project ("Busseto Foods Project" or "Project") without first
7 preparing an Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") in accordance with the requirements of the

8 California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code § 21000 et seq., § and the

9 CEQA Guidelines, title 14, California Code of Regulations, § 15000 et seq.

10 2. The Project includes the construction of an approximately 477,470-square-foot food

11 processing, warehousing, and distribution facility for Busseto Foods, Inc., a manufacturer and marketer
12 of Italian-style specialty meats, at 2325 South West Avenue and 995 West Church Avenue in Fresno,

13 California.

14 3. The Project site is located on 18.90-acres of land that consists of valuable habitat for

15 many species of wildlife, including several potential special-status species, such as the American white

16 pelican, California gull, merlin, and red-tailed hawk. Petitioner submitted evidence from experts

17 presenting a fair argument that the Project may have significant adverse environmental effects on air

18 quality, greenhouse gas emissions, energy, and biological resources - including the disruption and loss

19 of habitat of special-status species and cumulative impacts on wildlife - and that the City's Initial Study
20 and Negative Declaration ("IS/ND") is not supported by substantial evidence. Respondents are in

21 violation of CEQA by failing to prepare an EIR for the Project despite substantial evidence in the record

22 of a fair argument that the Project may have significant adverse environmental effects that have not been

23 mitigated to less than significant levels.

24 4. At a minimum, the City was required a to prepare a mitigated negative declaration

25 (*MND") because the City's approval of the Project included the approval of various measures to reduce

26 the Project's environmental impacts, including measures contained in the October 15, 2021 Southwest

27 Fresno Specific Plan EIR Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program.

28 5. Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion in adopting the IS/ND and failing to

2
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

prepare an EIR or MND. Alternatively, Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by relying

2 upon an IS/ND that is not supported by substantial evidence, failing to disclose the Project's baseline
conditions for biological resources, and improperly classifying mitigation measures as project design

4 features. Accordingly, the approval of the Project should be set aside and Respondents should be

5 required to prepare an EIR and fully comply with CEQA, Public Resources Code § 21000 et seq., prior

6 to considering whether to approve the Project.
7 PARTIES

8 6. Petitioner LABORERS INTERNATIONAL UNION OF NORTH AMERICA, LOCAL
UNION 294 ("LIUNA") is a labor organization that has approximately 1,000 members residing in the

10 County of Fresno. LIUNA has more than 600 members who live in the City of Fresno. LIUNA's

11 purposes include advocating on behalf of its members to ensure safe workplace environments; working

12 to protect recreational opportunities for its members to improve its members' quality of life when off the

13 job; advocating to assure its members access to safe, healthful, productive, and aesthetically and

14 culturally pleasing surroundings on and off the job; promoting environmentally sustainable businesses

15 and development projects on behalf of its members, including providing comments raising

16 environmental concerns and benefits on proposed development projects; advocating for changes to

17 proposed development projects that will help to achieve a balance between employment, the human

18 population, and resource use to permit high standards of living and a wide sharing of life's amenities by

19 its members as well as the general public; advocating for steps to preserve important historic, cultural,
and natural aspects of our national heritage, and maintain, wherever possible, an environment that
20 supports diversity and variety of individual choice; advocating on behalf of its members for programs,
21 policies, and development projects that promote not only good jobs but also a healthy natural a
22 environment and working environment, including advocating for changes to proposed projects and
23 policies that, if adopted, would reduce air, soil, and water pollution, minimize harm to wildlife, conserve
24 wild places, reduce traffic congestion, reduce global warming impacts, and assure compliance with
25 applicable land use ordinances; and working to attain the widest range of beneficial uses of the

26 environment without degradation, risk to health or safety, or other undesirable or unintended
27 consequences.

28

3
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

7. LIUNA and its members have direct and beneficial interest in Respondents' compliance

2 with laws bearing upon approval of the Project. These interests will be directly and adversely affected

3 by the Project, which violates the law as set forth in this Petition. The maintenance and prosecution of

4 this action will confer a substantial benefit on the public by protecting the public from the environmental

5 and other harms alleged below and others that may exist but are unknown due to the lack of a full

6 environmental analysis. LIUNA and its members submitted comments to the City's Planning Director

7 and the City Council objecting to and commenting on the Project and its unsupported and inadequate

8 environmental review pursuant to CEQA.

8. Respondent CITY OF FRESNO is a municipal corporation in whose jurisdiction the

10 Project will be located. The City is the "lead agency" for the Project for purposes of Public Resources

11 Code § 21067, and has principal responsibility for conducting environmental review of the Project and

12 taking other actions necessary to comply with CEQA. The City is also listed on the Notice of
Determination as the "Lead Agency."
13 9. Respondent CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF FRESNO serves as the elected
14 governing body of the City of Fresno. As the governing body for the City, the City Council was
15 ultimately responsible for reviewing and approving or denying the Project and the IS/ND. On October
16 13, 2022, the City Council approved the Project, the Plan Amendment and Rezone Application No. P20-
17 04209 and the Development Permit Application No. P20-04211 , and the IS/ND prepared for the Project
18 pursuant to CEQA. The Notice of Determination was filed with the Fresno County Clerk's office on

19 October 19, 2022.

20 10. Respondent CITY OF FRESNO PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT

21 is a local agency of the City. The City of Fresno Planning and Development Department reviews project

22 applications, manages the environmental review of projects for the City, and processes entitlements and

23 approvals. The City of Fresno Planning and Development Department is listed on the Notice of

24 Determination as the "Lead Agency Contact."

25 11. Real Party in Interest ARMEN DEVEJIAN is an individual and is an architect of

26 Associated Design & Engineering, Inc. Armen Devejian is listed on the Notice of Determination as

27 having filed the Plan Amendment and Rezone Application No. P20-04209 and the Development Permit

28 Application No. P20-04211 for the Project on behalf of Busseto Foods, Inc. In addition, the Letter of
Owner Authorization included in the file for the Project (File No. ID 22-1598), signed by G. Michael

4
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

Grazier and dated October 26, 2020, authorized Armen Devejian, "to act as Agent for the following

2 permits: General Plan Amendment/Rezone Application and Development Application." He is also listed

3 as the "Applicant" in the IS/ND. (IS/ND, p. 11.)

4 12. Real Party in Interest ASSOCIATED DESIGN & ENGINEERING, INC. is a California

5 stock corporation and is listed on the Notice of Determination as having filed the Plan Amendment and

6 Rezone Application No. P20-04209 and the Development Permit Application No. P20-04211 for the

7 Project on behalf of Busseto Foods, Inc. The Associated Design & Engineering, Inc. is also listed as the

8 "Applicant" under the pseudonym "ADE Inc." in the IS/ND. (IS/ND, p. 11.)

13. Real Party in Interest BUSSETO FOODS is listed as the owner and developer and future

10 operator of the Project. The Notice of Determination states that "Armen Devejian of Associated Design

11 & Engineering, Inc., on behalf of Busseto Foods has filed Plan Amendment/Rezone Application No.

12 P20-04209 and related Development Permit Application No. P20-04211." Pursuant to Pub. Res. Code cop
21167.6.5, Petitioner must name this entity as a Real Party in Interest. Busseto Foods appears to be
13 Busseto Foods, Inc., which is a California stock corporation that merged into Fratelli Beretta USA, Inc.
14 Petitioner is informed and believes that the City may have intended to name Busseto Foods, Inc. on the
15 Notice of Determination.
16 14. Real Party in Interest BUSSETO FOODS, INC. is a California stock corporation that
17 merged into Fratelli Beretta USA, Inc., and is the owner and developer and future operator of the

18 Project. The Notice of Determination states that Armen Devejian of Associated Design & Engineering,

19 Inc. filed the Plan Amendment and Rezone Application No. P20-04209 and the Development Permit

15 law.

16 FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

17 26. On November 6, 2020, Real Parties in Interest submitted applications to the City for the

18 development and design of the proposed Busseto Foods Project, which consists of a General Plan

19 Amendment and Rezone (Plan Amendment and Rezone Application No. P20-04209) and Development
20 Permit (Development Permit Application No. P20-04211) to allow for the construction of an

21 approximately 477,470-square-foot, two-story food production facility with an approximately 470,730-

22 square-foot ground floor for the processing, warehousing, and distribution of Italian-style specialty

23 meats manufactured and marketed by Busseto Foods, Inc., an approximately 6,740-square foot second
24 floor for administrative activities, and two 121-square foot security kiosks located at 2325 South West

25 Avenue and 995 West Church Avenue on the southeast corner of South West Avenue and West Church

26 Avenue in Fresno, California. The project site consists of two vacant, undeveloped parcels of land

27 located approximately two miles west of State Route-41 (SR-41) and State Route-99 (SR-99) and two

28 miles south of State Route-180 (SR-180), and requires a plan amendment and rezone to allow industrial

7
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

uses. The stated purpose of the Project is to allow Busseto Foods, Inc. to consolidate the company's four

2 Fresno based facilities and operations "under one roof."

3 27. On March 4, 2021, the City released an initial study and negative declaration that

4 purported to analyze the potential environmental impacts. The IS/ND included many mitigation

5 measures that it labeled project design features, rather than mitigation measures. A mitigation

6 monitoring and reporting program was also adopted for the Project, even though mitigation measures

7 were not a made a condition of the approval of the Project. The City adopted the October 15, 2021

8 Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program that was certified as part of the Fresno City Council's

approval of the Environmental Impact Report for the Southwest Fresno Specific Plan, SCH No.

10 201731012.

11 28. The City scheduled a Planning Commission hearing for May 18, 2022 to consider the
12 proposed Busseto Foods Project and the IS/ND prepared for the Project pursuant to CEQA.

13 29. On April 4, 2022 and May 18, 2022, before the time of the scheduled Planning

14 Commission hearing, Petitioner submitted comments to the Planning Commission regarding the Project

15 (*April 4, 2022 Comment" and "May 18, 2022 Comment," respectively) stating, inter alia, that the

16 IS/ND failed as an informational document, and that there was a fair argument that the Project may have

17 significant adverse air quality, biological resources, energy, and greenhouse gas impacts.

18 30. Petitioner's April 4, 2022 Comment and May 18, 2022 Comment noted that the Project

19 required the City to prepare an Environmental Impact Report, or at least a Mitigated Negative
20 Declaration, to analyze and reduce adverse environmental impacts to a less than significant level.

21 31. Petitioner's April 4, 2022 Comment included written expert comments from wildlife
22 biologist, Dr. Shawn Smallwood, Ph.D. ("April 1, 2022 Comment"). Dr. Smallwood's expert comments

23 concluded that the Project would result in potentially significant adverse biological impacts, even with

24 the implementation of the recommended mitigation measures related to biological resources identified in

25 the Southwest Fresno Specific Plan EIR Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program dated October

26 15, 2021. He concluded that the IS/ND fails as an informational document because of its (1) inadequate
27 characterization of the environmental setting as it relates to wildlife, (2) improper reliance on pre-
28 construction, burrowing owl, Swainson's hawk, and botanical surveys that are insufficient to mitigate

8
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

potential significant impacts to birds on the Project site, (3) failure to analyze potential impacts of

2 habitat loss on the Project site, (4) flawed analysis of the Project's interference with wildlife movement,

3 (5) failure to analyze increased traffic and associated vehicle collision mortalities on wildlife in the area,

4 and (7) flawed analysis of potential cumulative impacts of past, ongoing, and future projects on wildlife.

5 32. Dr. Smallwood's April 1, 2022 Comment noted that the IS/ND does not include an

6 adequate description of the Project site's existing environmental setting. Instead, Dr. Smallwood's

7 review of the IS/ND found that it relied on baseline wildlife conditions that are inadequate, incomplete,

8 and that understate the biological value of the Project site.

9 33. The IS/ND reported that "[n]o special-status species were observed on [the Project] site.

10 (IS/ND, p. 94.) The IS/ND's biological impact analysis is based on the Habitat Assessment prepared by

11 Precision Civil Engineering, Inc. To determine existing environmental conditions of the Project site, the

12 a IS/ND and Habitat Assessment relied heavily on a single reconnaissance-level survey performed by

13 Precision Civil Engineering on December 17, 2020. According to the IS/ND and Habitat Assessment, a

14 biologist "conducted a Habitat Assessment/reconnaissance-level survey…for the Project site…in order

15 to assess the biological resources located on and adjacent to the site," (IS/ND, p. 93), "to search for

16 special status species, and to determine the potential presence of suitable habitat for these species,"

17 (IS/ND, Appendix B, Habitat Assessment, p. 6). The Precision Civil Engineering survey detected 7

18 species of vertebrate wildlife, including a special-status bird species, the American white pelican. While

19 the Habitat Assessment reported that the biologist surveyed the "project area,' it provided no

20 explanation of what composes this area-i.e., the spatial scope of the survey remained undefined. Nor

21 did it report the weather and temperature during the survey, the time of day when the survey began, or
22 how long the biologist surveyed the site. "These unreported elements of the survey," as Dr. Smallwood's

23 expert comments point out, are "essential for interpretation of the [survey's] reported findings," such as

24 "whether the survey was performed a at a time when wildlife [species] are more or less active and
25 detectable, and whether observations from the adjacent stormwater retention basin were included." In

26 fact, in Dr. Smallwood's expert opinion "[k]nowing how long the biologist was at the project area would
27 have informed of the likelihoods of species detections, and probably would have informed of why so

28 few species of vertebrate wildlife were detected."

9
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

34. Petitioner's April 4, 2022 Comment noted that Dr. Smallwood's April 1, 2022 Comment

2 provided substantial evidence that the IS/ND improperly characterized the environmental setting and

3 baseline conditions of the Project site.

4 35. Dr. Smallwood's comments were informed by his survey of the Project site during the

5 late afternoon and the early evening of March 29, 2022. Dr. Smallwood visited the Project site for a little

6 over two hours from 15:42 to 17:52 hours. He observed 38 species of vertebrate wildlife, which included

7 three special-status bird species, California gull, merlin, and red-tailed hawk. During the site visit, he

8 also saw and photographed American crows, Canada goose, Mallard, great egret, cattle egret, great blue

9 heron, black-crowned night heron, killdeer, savannah sparrows, mourning dove, American pipit, and

10 California ground squirrel. Dr. Smallwood's April 1, 2022 Comment noted that the occurrence of

11 California ground squirrels in the project area is significant and warrants detection surveys for multiple
12 special-status species because many protected species are found in association with ground squirrels and
13 their burrow complexes, including as prey for large raptors such as the Swainson's hawk. California

14 ground squirrel also construct subterranean habitat used by many species such as burrowing owl. In

15 addition, Dr. Smallwood identified through the use of publicly available databases 82 special-status

16 species of vertebrate wildlife as having a potential to occur on the Project site. Based on this
17 information, Dr. Smallwood's April 1, 2022 Comment concluded that: "A fair argument can be made for

18 the need to prepare an EIR that is better informed by biological resources surveys and by appropriate

19 interpretation of survey outcomes for the purpose of characterizing the wildlife community as part of the
20 current environmental setting."

21 36. The site survey is supposed to inform of the existing environmental setting, which itself

22 is supposed to serve as the baseline against which potential impacts are analyzed. But the IS/ND

23 reported that "the Project would not have a substantial adverse effect…on any special-status species or

24 their habitat," because "the site could not support wildlife species in nesting, foraging, or escaping from
25 predators as a result of the site's heavy alteration and lack of cover." (IS/ND, p. 94.) Dr. Smallwood's

26 expert comments explained that "[l]isted species likely use the site, but documenting their use would

27 take more survey effort to achieve a reasonable likelihood of detecting them." He also explained that

28 "[n]o reconnaissance-level survey is capable of detecting enough of the wildlife species that occur at a

10
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

site to realistically characterize the site's wildlife community." Accordingly, Dr. Smallwood concluded

2 that the IS/ND should not have treated Precision Civil Engineering's survey as representative of existing

3 environmental conditions. Dr. Smallwood recommended that the City implement detection surveys for

4 multiple special-status species to inform an EIR, including especially for burrowing owl and Swainson's

5 hawk. The City and IS/ND did not conduct the investigations identified by Dr. Smallwood.

6 37. In addition, Dr. Smallwood's expert comments found that the measures included in the
7 Southwest Fresno Specific Plan EIR Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program are inadequate to

mitigate the Project's biological resources impacts to less than significant. Because the Project site
already serves as habitat for several special-status species, including merlin, California gull, red-tailed

10 hawk, and American white pelican, and is likely to serve as habitat for multiple additional special-status

11 species, including Swainson's hawk and loggerhead shrike, Dr. Smallwood concluded that the pre-
12 construction, burrowing owl, Swainson's hawk, and botanical surveys included in the Mitigation

13 Monitoring and Reporting Program will come too late either to disclose the Project's anticipated impacts

14 or to fully mitigate impacts to birds, including burrowing owls and Swainson's hawk. In addition, Dr.

15 Smallwood found that the burrowing owl survey measures included in the Mitigation Monitoring and

16 Reporting Program rely on now obsolete guidelines from 1997 -i.e., the California Burrowing Owl

17 Consortium's Survey Protocol and Mitigation Guidelines. Dr. Smallwood also noted that no Swainson's

18 hawk surveys have been conducted for the Project site. Accordingly, Dr. Smallwood commented that

19 burring owl and Swainson's hawk surveys should be conducted prior to project approval and

20 construction and circulated for public review in an EIR.

21 38. Petitioner's April 4, 2022 Comment also noted that the IS/ND failed to analyze the

22 degree of habitat loss on the Project site. In particular, the IS/ND did not assess the Project's potential

23 significant impact of the loss of breeding capacity. Dr. Smallwood's April 1, 2022 Comment mentioned

24 that the IS/ND did not evaluate the lost breeding capacity of birds that would result from the Project.

25 Instead, the City ignored Dr. Smallwood's comments regarding habitat loss to breeding birds, including

26 his expert prediction that the Project would result in the "denial to California of 215 birds per year."

27 Petitioner and Dr. Smallwood's comments noted that this potential loss of birds every year following
28 construction of the Project qualifies as a significant, unmitigated impact that has not been analyzed.

11
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

Petitioner also commented that Dr. Smallwood's expert calculation of the potential loss of birds per year

2 if the Project were to be built is substantial evidence of a fair argument that the Project involves

3 significant impacts to wildlife that the IS/ND failed to adequately disclose, analyze, and mitigate.

4 39. Petitioner's April 4, 2022 Comment also raised concerns about the IS/ND including a

5 flawed analysis of the Project's interference with wildlife movement. Petitioner pointed to Dr.

6 Smallwood's comments which explained that the IS/ND applied a false CEQA standard centered on

7 whether the site is part of a wildlife movement corridor. Dr. Smallwood stated that wildlife movement

8 does not require impacts to a wildlife corridor because impacts to wildlife movement may occur with or
without the presence of a wildlife corridor. In Dr. Smallwood's expert opinion, "[a] site such as the

10 proposed project site is critically important for wildlife movement because it composes an increasingly

11 diminishing area of open space within a growing expanse of anthropogenic uses, forcing more species of

12 volant wildlife to use the site for stopover and staging during migration, dispersal, and home range
13 patrol." Dr. Smallwood concluded that the Project would cut wildlife off from stopover, roosting, and

14 staging opportunities, which would force wildlife to travel even farther between remaining stopover

15 areas. Based on this information, Petitioner's April 4, 2022 Comment noted that the IS/ND improperly

16 dismissed the Project's potential to significantly impact wildlife movement.
17 40. In addition, Dr. Smallwood found that the IS/ND incorrectly claimed that the Project

18 would not interfere with wildlife movement based on the misconception that the Project site provides no

19 habitat to wildlife. Dr. Smallwood noted that the Project site does provide habitat for wildlife, as Dr.
20 Smallwood amply demonstrated through his survey results and the photographs he collected of wildlife

21 on the site. He also commented that "[b]irds nest on the site, and nesting birds in habitat surrounding the

22 site are foraging on the site to support their nest-attempts," and that "[h]erons are routinely flying

23 through that portion of the aerosphere over the project site to get to and from one or more rookeries."

24 Based on this information, Dr. Smallwood concluded that the Project would interfere with wildlife

25 movement in the region. He further commented that: "A fair argument can be made for the need to

26 prepare an EIR to appropriately analyze the project's impacts to wildlife caused by the project's

27 l interference with wildlife movement in the region."

28 41. Dr. Smallwood's April 1, 2022 Comment also identified the serious impacts that the

12
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

Project's increased traffic will have on wildlife in and around the project area. In Dr. Smallwood's

2 expert comments, he indicated that the traffic associated with the Project will have significant impacts

3 on wildlife from collisions with vehicles traveling to and from the Project site. Dr. Smallwood submitted

4 comments indicating that vehicle collisions have accounted for the deaths of many thousands of reptile,

5 amphibian, mammal, bird, and arthropod fauna, and the impacts have often been found to be significant

6 at the population level. Dr. Smallwood concluded that project-generated traffic impacts, as a result of the

7 increase in the number of daily vehicle trips to and from the Project site, would cause a substantial, a

8 significant direct and cumulative impact to wildlife through collisions with wildlife and by running over
wildlife. The IS/ND did not address this potential significant impact, nor did it analyze or impose

10 mitigation measures on the Project to reduce impacts to less than significant. Instead, as Petitioner's

11 April 4, 2022 Comment noted, the IS/ND did not evaluate mortality caused by project-generated traffic,

12 which Dr. Smallwood's expert prediction found that the Project's traffic "would accumulate 198,100

13 wildlife fatalities" over 50 years of operations. Based on Dr. Smallwood's expert calculations, he

14 concluded that "the project-generated traffic would cause substantial, significant impacts to wildlife,"

15 and therefore, "[t]here is at least a fair argument that can be made for the need to prepare an EIR to

16 analyze this impact."

17 42. Petitioner's April 4, 2022 Comment also raised concerns related to Dr. Smallwood's

18 findings that the IS/ND applied a flawed CEQA standard for determining whether the Project would

19 contribute cumulatively to impacts to wildlife and as a result failed to perform an adequate analysis of
20 the Project's potential to significant cumulative impacts. Dr. Smallwood's expert comments noted that

21 the IS/ND failed to complete a full analysis of the cumulative impacts to wildlife from habitat loss

22 related to the Project and its implications on bird capacity.

23 43. Based on this information, Dr. Smallwood's April 1, 2022 Comment concluded that the

24 site of the proposed Project continues to serve as valuable habitat for at least 38 species of wildlife, and

25 likely serves as habitat for many more species. Therefore, Dr. Smallwood concluded that a fair argument

26 can be made for the need to more rigorously survey the site for wildlife, and for the need to prepare an

27 EIR to appropriately analyze the proposed Project's potential impacts to wildlife. Dr. Smallwood's

28 expert comments included several feasible mitigation measures to reduce the potential significant

13
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

adverse impacts to wildlife as a result of the Project. Therefore, Dr. Smallwood concluded that a fair

2 argument can be made for the need to more rigorously survey the site for wildlife, and for the need to

3 prepare an EIR to appropriately analyze the proposed Project's potential impacts to wildlife. Dr.

4 Smallwood's expert comments included several feasible mitigation measures to reduce the potential

5 significant adverse impacts to wildlife as a result of the Project.

6 44. In addition, Petitioner's April 1, 2021 Comment noted that the IS/ND failed to
7 demonstrate that the Project would not cause wasteful, inefficient, or unnecessary consumption of

8 natural gas, and noted that the City was required to analyze the feasibility of using renewable energy.

9 Instead, the IS/ND improperly relied on the fact that the Project would be within the gas provider's

10 capacity, and that the Project would comply with Title 24 Energy Code, as sufficient analysis of energy

11 impacts.

12 45. Petitioner's May 18, 2022 Comment also included expert comments from Matt
13 Hagemann, P.G., C.Hg., and Dr. Paul E. Rosenfeld, Ph.D., of the environmental consulting firm

14 Soil/Water/Air Protection Enterprise ("SWAPE"). After reviewing the IS/ND and related documents,

15 SWAPE determined that the IS/ND's analysis and model of the Project's air emissions were based on

16 input parameters that could not be substantiated, or were based on mitigation measures that were not

17 actually included as mitigation measures. As a result of these errors, SWAPE concluded that the

18 Project's air quality emissions and GHG emissions were underestimated.

19 46. On May 18, 2022, the City of Fresno Planning Commission approved the Project, and

20 adopted the IS/ND and the October 15, 2021 Southwest Fresno Specific Plan EIR Mitigation Monitoring

21 and Reporting Program for the Project.

22 47. On October 13, 2022, the Fresno City Council approved the Project and adopted the

23 IS/ND and the October 15, 2021 Southwest Fresno Specific Plan EIR Mitigation Monitoring and

24 Reporting Program for the Project.

25 48. On October 19, 2022, the City filed a Notice of Determination with the Fresno County

26 Clerk.

LEGAL BACKGROUND

2 The California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA")

49. CEQA is an integral part of every public agency's decision-making process. (Pub. Res.

4 Code § 21006.) CEQA was enacted to protect the environment by the establishment of administrative

5 procedures to ensure that long-term protection of the environment shall be the guiding criterion in public

6 decisions.

7 50. The purpose of an EIR is to provide public agencies and the public with "detailed

8 information" about the likely significant environmental effect of a proposed project and ways in which

9 the significant effects might be minimized. (Pub. Res. Code § 21061; see § 21002.1(a).) An EIR serves

10 not only to protect the environment but also to demonstrate to an apprehensive public that it is being

11 protected. (CEQA Guideline § 15003(b).)

12 51. All public agencies must prepare, or cause to be prepared, and certify the completion of

13 an EIR on any project which they propose to carry out that may have significant effect on the
14| environment. (Pub. Res. Code §§ 21100(a), 21151(a).) A significant effect is a "potentially substantial,

15 adverse change." (Pub. Res. Code § 21068.) This means that an activity has a significant effect if it "has

16 the potential to degrade the quality of the environment." (Pub. Res. Code § 21083; 14 CCR § 15065.)
17 52. An EIR must be prepared where "there is substantial evidence, in light of the whole

18 record before the agency, that the project may have a significant effect on the environment." (Pub. Res.

19 Code § 21080(d).) If there is substantial evidence supporting a "fair argument" that project "may"

20 have a significant environmental effect, the agency "shall" prepare an EIR. (CEQA Guideline

21 15064(a)(1).) The fair argument standard provides a "low threshold" for requiring the preparation of an

22 EIR, with a preference for resolving doubts in favor of an EIR.

23 53. "Substantial evidence" is "enough relevant information and reasonable inferences from

24 this information that a fair argument can be made to support a conclusion, even though other

25 conclusions might also be reached." (CEQA Guideline § 15384(a).) Substantial evidence includes fact, a

26 reasonable assumption predicated upon fact, or expert opinion supported by fact. (Pub. Res. Code §
27 21080(e)(1).) Where some experts conclude there may be a potentially adverse impact, and other experts

28 disagree, an EIR must still be prepared. (CEQA Guidelines § 15064(g).)

15
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

54. All phases of project planning, implementation, and operation must be considered in an

2 Initial Study. (CEQA § Guideline § 15063(a)(1).)

3 55. To identify potentially significant adverse environmental effects of a project, an initial

4 study must delineate environmental conditions prevailing absent the project, defining baseline of

5 existing physical conditions in the affected area.

6 56. A mitigation monitoring plan must be adopted by the lead agency when an initial study

7 identifies potentially significant effects, but revisions in the project which would avoid such effects are

8 adopted before the negative declaration and initial study are released for public review. (Pub. Res. Code

9 § 21081.6.)

10 57. Mitigation measures may not be construed as project design elements or features in an

11 environmental document under CEQA if such a mischaracterization is significant. (Lotus V. Department
12 of Transportation (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 645.) A "mitigation measure" is a measure designed to

13 minimize a project's significant environmental impacts, (Pub. Res. Code 21002.1(a)), while a

14 "project" is defined as including "the whole of an action, which has a potential for resulting in either a

15 direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the

16 environment.' (CEQA Guidelines 15378(a).) Unlike mitigation measures, project elements are

17 considered prior to making a significance determination. Measures are not technically "mitigation"

18 under CEQA unless they are incorporated to avoid or minimize "significant" impacts. (Pub. Res. Code cop
19 21100(b)(3).)

20 58. To ensure that a project's potential environmental impacts are fully analyzed and

21 disclosed, and that the adequacy of proposed mitigation measures is considered in depth, mitigation

22 measures a that are not included in a project's design are not to be treated as part of the project

23 description. (Lotus, 223 Cal.App.4th at 654 -55, 656 fn.8.) Mischaracterization of a mitigation measure

24 as a project design element or feature is "significant," and therefore amounts to a material error, when

25 "it precludes or obfuscates required disclosure of the project's environmental impacts and analysis of

26 potential mitigation measures." (Mission Bay Alliance v. Office of Community Investment &
27 Infrastructure (2016) 6 Cal.App.5th 160, 185.)

28 59. Where an initial study shows that the project may have a significant effect on the

16
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

environment, a mitigated negative declaration may be appropriate. However, a mitigated negative

2 declaration is proper only if the project revisions would avoid or mitigate the potentially significant

3 effects identified in the initial study "to a point where clearly no significant effect on the environment

4 would occur, and…there is no substantial evidence in light of the whole record before the public agency

5 that the project, as revised, may have a significant effect on the environment." (Pub. Res. Code §§

6 21064.5; 21080(c)(2); Mejia v. City of San José (2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 322, 331.) In that context,

7 "may" means a reasonable possibility of a significant effect on the environment. (Pub. Res. Code §§

8 21082.2(a), 21100, 21151(a); Pocket Protectors v. City of Sacramento (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 903, 927;

9 League for Protection of Oakland's etc. Historic Res. v. City of Oakland (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 896,

10 904-05.) Otherwise, an agency must prepare an EIR. (14 CCR § 15064(f)(1); Pocket Protectors, 124

11 Cal.App.4th at 931; Stanislaus Audubon Society v. County of Stanislaus (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 144,

12 150-51; Quail Botanical Gardens Found., Inc. V. City of Encinitas (1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 1597, 1602.)

13 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

14 Violation of CEQA - Failure to Prepare an Environmental Impact Report
15 (Public Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.)
16 (Code of Civil Procedure § 1085 or in the alternative § 1094.5)

17 60. Petitioner hereby realleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs, in

18 their entirety, as if fully set forth herein.

19 61. Respondents failed to comply with CEQA by failing to prepare an EIR for the Project

20 despite substantial evidence in the record of a fair argument that the Project may have one or more

21 significant environmental impacts, including, but not limited to, the following:

22 a. The City's conclusion that the Project's construction and operation will not have a

23 significant impact on ildlife species on and in the vicinity of the Project site, including,

24 significant impacts to, inter alia, special-status species, nesting birds, burrowing owls,

25 and Swainson's hawk is not supported by substantial evidence and a fair argument a exists

26 that the Project may have significant wildlife impacts.

27 b. There is a fair argument that the Project may have a significant impact on the productive

28 capacity of bird species likely to nest on the ground and in shrubs and trees on the Project

17
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

2 site due to habitat loss, habitat fragmentation, and habitat degradation. Substantial

O u A w evidence demonstrates that the Project's construction and operation may result in a
significant loss of California birds per year over the next century.

C. The City's conclusion that the Project's construction and operation will not have a
significant impact on wildlife movement is not supported by substantial evidence and a

7 fair argument exists that the Project may have significant impacts on wildlife movement
in the project area.

8

9 d. There is a fair argument that the traffic associated with the Project may have significant

10 direct and cumulative impacts on wildlife from collisions with vehicles traveling to and

11 from the Project site. Substantial evidence demonstrates that project-generated traffic

12 impacts, as a result of the increase in the number of daily vehicle trips to and from the

13 Project site, may cause a significant impact to wildlife due to increased mortalities caused

14 by vehicle collisions with wildlife and by running over wildlife.

e.

15 The City's conclusion that the Project will not have a significant cumulative impact to

16 wildlife on and in the vicinity of the Project site is not supported by substantial evidence

17 and a fair argument exists that the Project may have a significant cumulative impact on

wildlife.

18 f.

19 There is a fair argument that the Project may have significant impacts due to the wasteful,

20 inefficient, or unnecessary consumption of energy resources. The IS/ND's reliance on

21 Title 24 compliance does not satisfy the requirements for an adequate discussion of the

22 Project's energy impacts. Because the IS/ND failed to demonstrate that the Project would

23 not cause wasteful, inefficient, or unnecessary consumption of energy resources, and

24 failed to analyze the feasibility of using renewable energy, a fair argument exists that the

25 Project may have a significant impact on energy resources.

g.

26 There is a fair argument that the Project may have significant impacts on air pollution and

27 GHG emissions because the City underestimated air pollution from the Project. The

28 City's conclusion that the Project will not have a significant impact on air pollution and
GHG emissions is not supported by substantial evidence and a fair argument exists that

18
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

the Project may have significant air quality and GHG emission impacts.

2 62. The City further violated CEQA in the following ways:

a. The IS/ND fails to disclose the Project's environmental setting and baseline conditions
† u for wildlife, including baseline conditions for special-status species, in violation of
CEQA. Respondents abused their discretion and failed to act in a manner required by law
O by approving the Project without a CEQA analysis containing a proper baseline within
7 the meaning of CEQA.

8 b. The IS/ND fails to determine the actual baseline of bird reliance on the site for roosting,

9 nesting, and foraging and instead defers determination of what roosts, nests, and birds
10 may suffer impacts from the Project, in violation of CEQA. The IS/ND failed to

11 adequately analyze and mitigate the Project's potential significant impacts to nesting

12 birds. Respondents abused their discretion and failed to act in a manner required by law

13 by approving the Project without a CEQA analysis containing a proper baseline within

14 the meaning of CEQA.

15 63. Because a fair argument exists that the Project may have one or more significant

16 environmental impacts, the City must prepare an EIR for the Project to analyze all environmental

17 impacts and to propose all feasible mitigation measures and alternatives to reduce those impacts.

18 64. Alternatively, Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by adopting an IS/ND,

19 the environmental impact analysis for which is not supported by substantial evidence.

20 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

21 WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests the following relief and entry of judgment as

22 follows:

23 1. For a peremptory writ of mandate directing Respondents to set aside the approval of the

24 Project, the Plan Amendment and Rezone Application No. P20-04209 and the Development Permit

25 Application No. P20-04211, the IS/ND prepared for the Project pursuant to CEQA, and the October 15,

26 2021 Southwest Fresno Specific Plan EIR Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program for the

27 Project, unless and until Respondents have prepared, circulated, and considered a legally adequate EIR

28 prior to any subsequent approval action;

19
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

2. For peremptory writ of mandate directing Respondents and Real Parties in Interest to

2 suspend all activities in furtherance of the Project unless and until Respondents take all necessary steps

3 to bring their actions into compliance with CEQA.

4 3. For a preliminary and permanent injunction staying the effect of Respondents' approval

5 of the Project.

6 4. For a declaratory judgment declaring Respondent's approval of the Project to be null and

7 void and contrary to law;

8 5. For an award of Petitioner's attorneys' fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §

9 1021.5, and any other applicable authority;

10 6. For an award of costs of suit; and

11 7. For such other and further relief as the court deems just and proper.
