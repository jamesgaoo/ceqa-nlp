15 Defendants from causing and maintaining a continuing public nuisance on East Mountain Drive.

13 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
14 PUBLIC NUISANCE - Sts. & Hy. Code, § 1484
15 (By County of Santa Barbra by and through the County Road Commissioner Against All
16 Cross-Defendants)
17 17. The County hereby incorporates by reference each and every allegation set forth
18 in paragraphs 1 through 16, inclusive, of this Cross-Complaint, and realleges them as if they were
19 fully set forth herein.
20 18. Maintaining an encroachment without a permit is a public nuisance per se pursuant
21 to Sts. & Hy. Code, § 1484 and common law, which can be enjoined in a civil action without
22 further proof of injury or effect.
23 19. The County Road Commissioner, by notice, required the removal of Cross-
24 Defendants' unpermitted encroachments from East Mountain Drive.
25 20. Cross-Defendants have not removed the unpermitted encroachments, removal has
26 not been commenced or diligently prosecuted, and Cross-Defendants have refused to either
27 remove the unpermitted encroachments or allow their removal.
28
SANTA BARBARA 21. The County Road Commissioner has therefore commenced this action in the name
COUNTY COUNSEL 105 E. Anapami Street, #201 - 4 -
Santa Barbara, CA 93101 (805) 568-2950 CROSS-COMPLAINT FOR ABATEMENT OF PUBLIC NUISANCE AND TRESPASS

1 of the County to abate the unpermitted encroachments as a public nuisance, as provided for in Sts.

2 & Hy. Code, § 1484 and the common law.

3 22. The County is informed and believes and, thereon, alleges that Cross-Defendants

4 have maintained, are currently maintaining, and will continue to maintain the public nuisance and

5 will continue the acts complained of herein in violation of the Streets and Highways Code and

6 common law unless enjoined by this Court.

7 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
8 PUBLIC NUISANCE - Civ. Code, § 3479 et seq.
9 (By County of Santa Barbara and The People of the State of California Against All Cross-
10 Defendants)
11 23. Cross-Complainants hereby incorporate by reference each and every allegation set
12 forth in paragraphs 1 through 22, inclusive, of this Cross-Complaint, and reallege them as if they
13 were fully set forth herein.
14 24. Cross-Defendants, and each of them, by engaging in the conduct alleged herein
15 have unlawfully obstructed the free passage or use, in the customary manner, of East Mountain
16 Drive, affecting the entire community of Santa Barbara as well as visitors to Santa Barbara County
17 who come to enjoy the County's many trails and outdoor recreation opportunities. Cross-
18 Defendants, and each of them, by engaging in the conduct alleged herein have also obstructed the
19 free use of property, so as to interfere with the comfortable enjoyment of life or property, namely,
20 hiking at the Hot Springs Trail by residents of Santa Barbara and visitors.
21 25. Residents and visitors have been unable to use the right of way for parking, biking,
22 horseback riding, and walking and have been unable to visit the Hot Springs Trail or have been
23 forced to park in unsafe locations due to Cross-Defendants' conduct, endangering themselves and
24 other users of the road including motorists, pedestrians, equestrians, and bikers.
25 26. The seriousness of this harm outweighs the social utility of Cross-Defendants'
26 conduct, as there is no social utility to such conduct. Cross-Defendants could have placed their
27 encroachments on their own properties rather than the public right of way.
28
SANTA BARBARA 27. Cross-Complainants did not consent to Cross-Defendants' conduct.

2 to the general health, safety, and welfare of Santa Barbara County, its residents, and visitors who

3 come to recreate or hike the Hot Springs Trail, and their peaceable and safe enjoyment of the trail
and surrounding neighborhood.

5 29. Cross-Defendants' maintenance of the encroachments as alleged herein constitutes

6 a continuing nuisance that can be substantially abated in a reasonably feasible manner and at a

7 reasonable cost.

8 30. Cross-Complainants have been and continue to be harmed by Cross-Defendants'
conduct, which, among other things, deprived the County of the possession, use, and enjoyment

11 have been forced to park blocking the travel way on East Mountain Drive due to the objects placed
