1 INTRODUCTION

2 1. STOP THE PACHECO DAM PROJECT COALITION ("Petitioner" or

3 "Coalition") petitions this Court for a Writ of Mandate ("Petition"), directed to Respondent

4 SANTA CLARA VALLEY WATER DISTRICT (District" or "Respondent"). Petitioner

5 challenges the District's approval of the Phase 2 Geotechnical Investigations for the Pacheco

6 Reservoir Expansion Project (*Investigation Project"), which relies on a categorical exemption

7 from the California Environmental Quality Act (Pub. Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.
8 ["CEQA"]; see also Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15000 et seq. ["CEQA Guidelines"].)

9 2. The proposed Investigation Project would conduct extensive operations over the
10 course of eight to seventeen months. During that time, the District proposes to conduct 226

11 borings and dig 57 test pits that would disturb more than 2,500 cubic yards of earth and

12 vegetation. To complete these borings and test pits, the Investigation Project would require
13 contractors to drive trucks, trailers and tracked rigs through the Investigation Project area, and
14 when unable to access the most remote sections of the site, fly helicopters to drop off the
15 materials and equipment needed to conduct geotechnical investigations.
16 3. The Investigation Project area contains numerous special status plants and wildlife
17 species, as well as various cultural resources. Although the Investigation Project would require

18 hundreds of off-road trips, drilling and excavating in an area documented to contain rare plant
19 communities and wildlife, the Notice of Exemption (*NOE") claims no "serious or major
20 disturbance to an environmental resource." This is false.

21 4. The major soil and vegetation disturbance and low-flying helicopters, among other

22 activities, would impact plants, wildlife and cultural resources. These impacts must be analyzed
23 and mitigated through the applicable CEQA procedures, not an exemption intended for

24 situations when there is no possibility of a significant environmental effect.
25 5. The District approved the Investigation Project under Public Resources Code
26 sections 15304 (Class 4, "Minor Alterations to Land") and 15306 (Class 6, "Information

27 Collection"), however, the Investigation Project does not fall within the regulatory language of

28 these exemptions.

MESERVE 2

1 6. While the District determined that there was no reasonable possibility of

2 significant effect on the environment, the Investigation Project would, in fact, result in

3 potentially significant impacts on the environment and is otherwise not eligible for a categorical

4 exemption from CEQA. Thus, the District erred in relying on exemptions from CEQA to forego

5 the required CEQA review.

6 7. Petitioner seeks a peremptory writ of mandate invalidating the District's approval

7 of the Investigation Project since, as more fully set forth below, the District's decision to adopt a

8 NOE approving an Investigation Project that would result in multiple environmental impacts
9 violates CEQA.

10 PARTIES

11 8. STOP THE PACHECO DAM PROJECT COALITION is an unincorporated
12 association formed to protect Santa Clara County's ratepayers and the environment, as well as
13 working ranchlands, from the environmentally destructive, high-cost and high-risk Pacheco
14 Reservoir Expansion Project ("Dam Project"). In collaboration with environmental groups,
15 including Sierra Club Loma Prieta Chapter and Friends of the River, the Coalition has

16 spearheaded the movement to stop the destructive Dam Project and protect the areas' unique
17 biological, cultural and other resources. The Coalition and its supporters include persons and

18 groups whose members live in Santa Clara County and the Bay Area and appreciate the

19 biological diversity and other values of the Diablo Range and Henry Coe State Park. These
20 resources and interests would be severely injured if the Investigation Project and the Dam
21 Project it supports, move forward.

22 9. Among the Coalition members is the Pacheco Land and Cattle Co., which owns

23 the 6,230-acre Lawler Ranch in southeastern Santa Clara County; the Lawler family has used
24 the ranch for recreational, grazing and other conservation-compatible activities for nearly 60
25 years. A large portion of the ranch, including the historic O'Connor Ranch structures, would be

26 completely destroyed by the Dam Project. The family is committed to conserving the rich
27 historic, agricultural, biological and cultural resources of this unique part of rural California.

3 Appen. (1999 ed. & 2012 supp.) ch. 60, p. 354 et seq.). As the CEQA "lead agency" for the

4 Investigation Project, the District is responsible for preparation of an environmental document

5 that describes the Investigation Project and its impacts and, if necessary, evaluates mitigation

6 measures and/or alternatives to lessen or avoid any significant environmental impacts.
7 11. Petitioner is unaware of the true names and capacities of Respondents DOES -

8 through 20 and sue such respondents by fictitious names. Petitioner is informed and believes,

9 and on the basis of such information and belief alleges, that the fictitiously named respondents
10 are also responsible for the actions described in this Petition. When the true identities and

11 capacities of these respondents have been determined, Petitioner will amend this Petition, with
12 leave of Court if necessary, to insert such identities and capacities.

13 BACKGROUND FACTS

14 12. The District is in the process of planning for a Dam a Project costing nearly $3
15 billion, which would be located near the site of the existing Pacheco Reservoir on Pacheco
16 Creek. The Pacheco Reservoir is currently operated by the Pacheco Pass Water District; the
17 current dam is in poor condition and state dam regulators have ordered that due to seismic and
18 other dangers, the outlet gates must remain open. The proposed new reservoir would be
19 roughly 25 times larger than the existing reservoir, and the new dam would be located more
20 than a mile upstream from the current dam. The Dam Project would flood about 1,500 acres of
21 important plant and wildlife habitat, cultural sites over 3,000 years old, as well as more recent
22 yet historic Diablo Range ranching operations dating back to the 1800's.

23 13. In November 2021, the District circulated the Dam Project Draft Environmental
24 Impact Report ("DEIR") analyzing the impacts of constructing a new dam on Pacheco Creek.

25 A Final EIR has not yet been released.

26 14. The January 26, 2022, AECOM Phase 2 Investigation Work Plan ("Work Plan"),
27 provides details regarding the current geotechnical investigations proposed by the District in
28 furtherance of Dam Project.

CORPORATION Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 15. On April 28, 2022, the District filed a NOE for the Investigation Project with the

2 Santa Clara County Clerk's office.

3 16. In support of the new Dam Project located near the existing Pacheco Reservoir,

4 the District proposes to conduct extensive geotechnical investigations to include geotechnical

5 borings, test pits, potholes, electrical resistivity surveys, and seismic refraction surveys.

6 17. The Investigation Project would include investigations at nearly 200 different

7 locations in the general vicinity of and within Pacheco Creek and Pacheco Reservoir, and in

8 areas to the east along the proposed transmission line alignment that would provide power to the

9 proposed Dam Project. The majority of these locations are on privately owned land.

10 18. Approximately 226 borings (including rock core drilling, hollow stem auger
11 drilling, and auger/rotary wash drilling) would be drilled within and close to the footprint of the
12 proposed dam; at upstream and downstream borrow areas; on landslides upstream of the
13 proposed dam site; along the conveyance pipeline alignment and pumpstation footprint; on the
14 crest road of the North Fork Dam; along the access road and at the bridge crossing over North
15 Fork Pacheco Creek; along the proposed SR-152 interchange and frontage road; within the

16 proposed North Fork Pacheco Creek restoration area; and along the proposed new transmission
17 line alignment.

18 19. A total of 57 test pits are planned. Test pits would be 10 to 20 feet long, 3 feet
19 wide, and up to 20 feet deep. Following completion of logging and sampling, each test
20 pit/pothole would be backfilled, the site restored to original grade, and seeded with an

21 "appropriate" seed mix. Test pits excavated below the full pool line of the existing reservoir

22 would place side cast material into a dump truck to reduce impacts to the reservoir bottom.

23 20. Drill rigs would access the site either with a truck and trailer, via tracked rig, or
24 via helicopter. A helicopter would be used to transport timbers for constructing temporary

25 drilling platforms, drilling equipment and supplies, and drilling water to approximately 48

26 proposed investigation locations in instances where access cannot be completed by conventional

27 means.

1 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

2 21. This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this Petition pursuant to

3 Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5 and Public Resources Code sections 21168

4 and 21168.5.

5 22. Venue for this action properly lies in the Superior Court for the County of Santa

6 Clara pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 394.

7 23. This Petition is timely filed in accordance with Public Resources Code section
8 21167, subdivision (d). The District filed its NOE for the Investigation Project on April 28,

9 2022, thereby triggering a 35-day statute of limitations.
10 STANDING

11 24. Petitioner has standing to assert the claims alleged in this Petition because

12 Petitioner is beneficially interested in this matter, as required by Code of Civil Procedure
13 section 1086. Petitioner has standing to assert the claims raised in this Petition because its
14 members include residents, business owners and property owners within Santa Clara County
15 and the Bay Area and have personal and community interests that are directly and adversely
16 affected by the District's approval of the Investigation Project and the new Dam Project it
17 informs. Petitioner is within the class of persons beneficially interested in, and aggrieved by,
18 the acts of Respondent as alleged below. Petitioner and its members have a beneficial interest
19 in challenging the District's unlawful approval of the Investigation Project that will negatively
20 impact the environmental and public health in Santa Clara County.
21 25. The District's approval of the Investigation Project is also a matter of public

22 interest. To the extent such processes occurred, Petitioner and its members participated in the
23 administrative processes herein, and exhausted available remedies.

24 IRREPARABLE HARM

25 26. The District's failures, set forth in this Petition, constitute a prejudicial abuse of
26 discretion within the meaning of the Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5 and
27 CEQA. (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1085, 1094.5; Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21168, 21168.5.)

27. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.

2 If the District's actions regarding the Investigation Project are effectuated, Petitioner and the
community will be irreparably harmed. No money damages could adequately compensate for

4 that harm.

5 PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL DOCTRINE

6 28. Petitioner brings this action as a private attorney general pursuant to Code of Civil

7 Procedure section 1021.5, and any other applicable legal theory, to enforce important rights

8 affecting the public interest.

9 29. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will confer a significant benefit on
10 the general public by requiring the District to comply with CEQA when making decisions
11 regarding the natural environment and water supplies.
12 30. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will also result in the enforcement
13 of important rights affecting the public interest by requiring the District to comply with CEQA
14 and thereby protect the environment in the Pacheco Pass area of the Diablo Range.

15 NOTICE OF CEQA SUIT

16 31. Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code section 21 167.5 in serving
17 notice of this action to the District on June 2, 2022. (See Exhibit A, Notice of Commencement

18 of Action against the District.)

19 ELECTION TO PREPARE ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD

20 32. Pursuant to Public Resources Code, section 21167.6, subdivision (b)(2), and any
21 other applicable authority, Petitioner elects to prepare the record of proceedings in this action.
22 33. Pursuant to this election, Petitioner requests that Respondent, upon service of this

23 election, gather and transmit its administrative files to Petitioner for preparation of the
24 administrative record. Respondent is required to provide its administrative files free of charge.

28 Paragraphs 1 through 33 as though fully set forth herein.

A LAW
CORPORATION Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 35. The District did not perform environmental review for the Investigation Project
2 pursuant to CEQA. Instead, the District found the Investigation Project exempt from CEQA

3 review pursuant to categorical exemptions found in CEQA Guidelines sections 15304 (Class 4,

4 "Minor Alterations to Land") and 15306 (Class 6, "Information Collection"). By relying on

5 these exemptions, the District failed to proceed in a manner required by law.

6 36. The District's reliance on CEQA exemptions is misplaced because a Class 4

7 exemption allows only a minor alteration to the condition of land, which would not include "the

8 removal of healthy, mature scenic trees." (CEQA Guidelines, § 15304.) The Work Plan states

9 that "where possible" relocation of test pit and boring sites would be required "to minimize the

10 need to trim branches or cut down trees." Thus, the District admits that trees may be removed.
11 Additionally, several of the test pit sites, which would require excavation holes of 20-foot long
12 and 20-feet deep, are located in heavily wooded areas. The District's assertion that no healthy,
13 mature trees would be removed is contradicted by conditions in the Investigation Project area.
14 Thus, CEQA Guidelines Class 4 exemption cannot be relied upon to circumvent appropriate
15 CEQA analysis.

16 37. The Class 6 exemption allows for agencies to conduct "basic data collection,
17 research, experimental management, and resource evaluation activities which do not result in a

18 serious or major disturbance to an environmental resource." (CEQA Guidelines, § 15306

19 [bold added].) Under the Investigation Project, low-flying helicopters would deliver drilling
20 equipment to remote areas of the Investigation Project site. These areas contain special status
21 species and helicopter operations are likely to result in major disturbances to surrounding

22 wildlife in this remote area. Additionally, the Investigation Project would require extensive use
23 of wheeled and tracked vehicles to traverse the expansive project area. These vehicles may
24 crush or destroy burrows, or otherwise damage special status plant and wildlife habitat or result
25 in take. Thus, the Investigation Project would result in a serious or major disturbance to an
26 environmental resource.

27 38. Furthermore, the District has also ignored the second element of the Class 6
28 exemption which specifies that the exempted activities "may be strictly for information

SOLURI
MESERVE 8
A LAW Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate CORPORATION

1 gathering purposes, or as part of a study leading to an action which a public agency has not yet
2 approved, adopted, or funded." (CEQA Guidelines, § 15306.) The § Investigation Project is not
3 for the sole purpose of information gathering; the purpose of the Investigation Project is to guide

4 the design and development of the new Dam Project. The Dam Project has already been

5 included in the District's Capital Improvement Plan, and as of June 2022, the District has spent

6 over $80 million pursuing the new dam. Thus, reliance on the Class 6 exemption is unfounded.

7 39. Assuming either CEQA exemption applies, categorical exemptions are subject to

8 exceptions under which reliance on an exemption is improper. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15300.2.)
9 40. Under CEQA Guidelines, section 15300.2, subdivision (b), an agency may not
10 rely on an exemption "when the cumulative impact of successive projects of the same type in the
11 same place, over time is significant." The District has already commenced the first round of

12 geotechnical investigations it calls "Phase 1.33 Those investigations are ongoing and create
13 similar impacts to the activities proposed by Phase 2, resulting in piecemealing that CEQA
14 Guidelines, section 15300.2, subdivision (b) prohibits. The two phases of geotechnical
15 investigations would combine to create cumulative impacts. Therefore, the cumulative impact
16 exception is applicable and CEQA exemptions cannot be relied upon.
17 41. An exemption may not be relied on when there is a "reasonable possibility that the
18 activity will have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances."

19 (CEQA Guidelines, § 15300.2, subd. (c); see, e.g., Voices for Rural Living v. El Dorado
20 Irrigation District (2012) 209 Cal.App.4th 1096, 1107 [due to the "unusual circumstance" of
21 greatly increasing demand for public water services through an existing pipeline the project had
22 a potentially significant effect, thereby precluding reliance on an exemption].) The
23 circumstances under which the Investigation Project would occur are unusual, creating a

24 reasonable possibility of one or more significant effects to resources listed in CEQA Guidelines

25 Appendix G.

26 42. The Investigation Project area is a particularly sensitive environment containing
27 rare plant and wildlife habitat unique to the area. The Dam Project DEIR provided descriptions
28 of the occurrences of and habitat suitable for bald and golden eagles, California tiger

SOLURI
MESERVE 9

CORPORATION Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 salamander, California red-legged frog and numerous other special status species in the area.

2 Additionally, hundreds of acres of sensitive natural communities in the area would likely be
3 impacted by the activities proposed by the Investigation Project. The Investigation Project

4 would require trucks, and tracked vehicles to traverse through this habitat, along with low flying

5 helicopters, disturbing the wildlife and vegetation. The boring sites and test pits would also

6 create ground disturbances and noise that would also disturb rare plants and wildlife.

7 43. The Investigation Project area contains several culturally important sites. The

8 Dam Project DEIR documented over 30 cultural sites in the area. Some of these sites are over
9 3,000 years old. With respect to cultural and historical resources, the Work Plan states that

10 previous surveys were conducted "to identify and avoid biological and cultural resources to the
11 maximum extent practicable." The Work Plan also states that boring and test pit locations
12 will be "relocated where possible to avoid potential impacts to sensitive species and cultural
13 resources." The Pacheco Reservoir Expansion Project DEIR identified numerous cultural
14 resources throughout the new dam site. The Investigation Project includes test pits that are 20
15 feet deep and borings as deep as 300 feet. These activities will likely result in a significant
16 impact to cultural resources, and the District acknowledges that the Project does not avoid all
17 impacts to sensitive species and cultural resources.

18 44. Furthermore, the Investigation Project would require the use of low-flying
19 helicopters and off-road vehicles to access and deliver equipment to remote areas of the
20 Investigation Project site. Low-flying helicopters would create significant impacts to wildlife

21 throughout the area with noise and ground disturbance.

22 45. An exception to CEQA exemptions applies if the project "may cause a substantial

23 adverse change in the significance of t historical resource." (CEQA Guidelines, § 15300.2,

24 subd. (f).) The Investigation Project area contains numerous cultural and historical sites and

25 resources, and the Investigation Project would cause an adverse change in the significance of a
26 historical resources.

27 46. A lead agency may not rely on mitigation to qualify for a categorical exemption.

CORPORATION Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 County of Marin (2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 1098.) Yet the Work Plan indicates that the

2 Investigation Project relies on de facto mitigation to attempt to address project impacts. For

3 instance, the NOE states that Best Management Practices and "additional project features"

4 would be incorporated into the Project. The Work Plan also refers to the NOE "include[ing]

5 Best Management Practices for impact avoidance and minimization." To the extent the

6 District attempts to rely on Best Management Practices and unidentified "additional project

7 features" to reduce the significant impacts of the Investigation Project, those conditions are akin

8 to mitigation.

9 47. The NOE states that the purpose of the Investigation Project is to investigate
10 seismic risks, baseline conditions and obtain geological data in order to prepare design plans for
11 the Dam Project. Additional detailed information on the underlying soil conditions from the
12 Investigation Project would facilitate design and construction of the Dam Project. The instant

13 Investigation Project is an essential component of the Dam Project and "step" towards the
14 construction and implementation of the Dam Project. Accordingly, the Investigation Project
15 must be analyzed together with the Dam Project. The District's review of the Investigation
16 Project, separate from the Dam Project, is impermissible piecemealing of the "whole of the
17 action."

18 48. Even if the Investigation Project was not part of the whole of the action that makes

19 up the Dam Project, CEQA nevertheless requires the instant geotechnical investigations to be
20 analyzed together with the Dam Project in a single environmental document because the new
21 dam is a "reasonably foreseeable consequence of the [geotechnical investigations]" and when

22 added to the geotechnical investigations "the [new dam] will be significant in that it will likely
23 change the scope or nature of the initial project or its environmental effects." (Laurel Heights
24 Improvement Association v. Regents of Univ. of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 395.)
