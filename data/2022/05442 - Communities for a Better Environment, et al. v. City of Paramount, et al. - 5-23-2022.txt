VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

2 Petitioners Communities for a Better Environment, East Yard Communities for

3 Environmental Justice, and Center for Biological Diversity (collectively, Petitioners) bring this

4 action on their own behalf, on behalf of their members, on behalf of the general public, and in
the public interest and allege as follows:

5 I. INTRODUCTION

6 1.

7 The City of Paramount is 4.85 square miles with a population of nearly 54,000 mostly

8 Latino residents. Despite its small size, the City hosts large number of polluting

o industries, including medical waste facilities, transportation fuel refining operations, and

10 metal forging facilities. Because of these industrial operations, along with socio-

11 economic conditions, the City is one of the most polluted cities in California and its

12 residents experience increased health risks, including asthma and cardiovascular disease.

13 Residents in the City also experience the highest levels of hexavalent chromium

14 (chromium-6), a cancer-inducing air toxin, in Los Angeles County.
2. On April 11, 2022, the Paramount City Council voted 3 to
15 to worsen these

16 environmental conditions and residents' quality of life when it issued approvals and

17 certified a final subsequent environmental impact report (SEIR) for the Paramount AltAir

18 Renewable Fuels Conversion Project (Biofuels Project or Project) at the Paramount

19 Refinery. The Biofuels Project would increase throughput of fats, oils, and/or greases at

20 the Refinery to 25,000 barrels per day to produce biofuels; construct a fossil gas (gray)

21 hydrogen generation unit to produce over 75 million standard cubic feet of hydrogen per

22 day; and install a fossil gas pipeline through residential neighborhoods, among other

23 significant modifications. The Project would subject residents and surrounding

24 communities to health harms from increased air pollution and safety hazards from
explosions and flaring.

25

26 3. The Biofuels Project is an attempt to squeeze profits out of the Refinery's nearly century-

27 old infrastructure at the expense of public health and safety. As Councilmember

28 Guillen-the only dissenting vote-put it: "[y]ou can take the jalopy and add parts to it,

- 3 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

you can shine it up, you can coat it, you can do all kinds of things to it but at the end of

2 the day it is not going to run like a Tesla-it's still an old Il jalopy." It is a matter of
cA 7 1n when, not if, a malfunction will occur at this inherently dangerous operation that will
threaten the lives and health of children at adjacent schools and families in residential

areas.

4. Under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), the City conducted an initial

7 environmental assessment and determined the Project would cause significant

8 environmental impacts. CEQA aims to ensure that decisionmakers and the public have
6o complete information about a proposed project's foresecable environmental impacts and
10 to identify ways to minimize the significant effects before its approval. The City,
11 however, prepared an SEIR that misinforms the public of the Project's severe
12 consequences. Rather than disclosing, analyzing, and mitigating the Project's significant
13 environmental impacts, the SEIR systematically disregards, underestimates, and ignores
14 them.

15 5. The SEIR fails to disclose and analyze various foreseeable environmental impacts and

16 hazards from initiating construction, processing low-quality feedstock, and increasing

17 hydrogen use at the Refinery, such as toxic dust migration, and flaring and explosion

18 hazards. The SEIR also fails to consider feasible mitigation measures to reduce

19 significant impacts, including use of zero-emissions technologies; dismisses feasible

20 alternatives that would reduce environmental impacts, including an alternative that

21 reduces throughput; and uses a misleading and inflated 2011 baseline rather than existing

22 conditions to measure the severity of the Project's environmental impacts.

23 6. The City either dismissed or ignored comments from the community highlighting these

24 concerns. As a result of these deficiencies, the SEIR fails to fully inform the public and

25 decisionmakers of the Project's significant health, safety, and environmental impacts, and

26 fails to analyze and mitigate these impacts as CEQA requires.

2 most vulnerable to its effects, based on socioeconomic factors and underlying health

U status. Based on these factors, census tracts are assigned a percentile score from 1 to 100.

4 The higher the census tract's percentile score, the greater the pollution burdens and

5 population vulnerabilities of residents in that tract as compared to other residents in the

state.

6

7 30. According to CalEnviroScreen, residents in the census tract around the Refinery

8 experience a pollution burden and population vulnerability worse than 85 percent of the

O state. Most census tracts in the City have a CalEnviroScreen score in the 90th percentile.

10 The City is among the most over-polluted areas in the state. These communities

11 experience an increased risk of asthma and cardiovascular disease, and newborns in these

12 areas have an increased risk of having low birthweight, developing asthma or other

13 chronic diseases later in life.

14 B. Biofuel Trends in the United States and California

15 31. The United States is the largest biofuel producers in the world and is expected to

16 significantly increase production capacity over the next few years.8 As of 2021, almost

17 20 biofuel projects have been proposed or are already under construction across the
United States.

18

19 32. In California alone, several petroleum refinery conversions are currently taking place to

20 process non-crude oil feedstocks. In Northern California, the Phillips 66 Refinery in

21 Rodeo plans to convert into an 80,000 barrel per day (bpd) biorefinery, and the Marathon

22 Refinery in Martinez aims to convert its shuttered refinery into a 48,000 bpd biorefinery.9

33. Biofuels are fuels generated from plant or animal oil feedstock. There are several
categories of biofuels, including biodiesel, renewable diesel, and alternative jet fuel. 12
7 Biodiesel is petroleum diesel blended with animal fats, vegetable oils and/or cooking

8 greases. Renewable diesel can be produced from any feedstock and does not require
9 2 = blending. Alternative jet fuel (or sustainable aviation fuel) is petroleum jet fuel blended
with some percent of non-crude oil feedstock.
34. Because many biofuel feedstocks require significant land and other resources, land use
emissions. 12 changes to produce feedstock for biofuels can increase greenhouse gas
13 Increased biofuel production can also result in shifting the net environmental and

14 ecological impacts toward increased nutrient pollution, pesticide contamination, and

15 water scarcity.13

16 35. As more biofuel refinery conversion or expansion projects are constructed, heightened

will cause environmental and climate impacts.14 Biofuels such as biodiesel, renewable
2 diesel, and alternative jet fuel draw from the same feedstock pool; therefore, each
u biorefinery competes in the same markets for limited quantities of feedstock, 15 Increased
4 demand for crops for use as biofuel feedstocks and the associated changes to landscapes
5 will exacerbate environmental harm to ground and surface waters, soil resources, and

6 other ecosystem components. According to some estimates, by 2024, there will be a 13-

7 billion pound feedstock deficit as more processing capacity comes online. 16

8 C. Refinery Background and 2013 Renewable Fuels Conversion Project
c 36. The Paramount Refinery operates on a 66-acre parcel at 14700 Downey Avenue. The
10 Refinery sits in the middle of a residential area and is adjacent to Paramount High
11 School, Harry Wirtz Elementary School, and Albert Baxter Elementary School.
12 37. The Refinery started operations in the 1930s and historically refined crude oil into
13 various petroleum products, including gasoline, jet fuel, diesel, and asphalt.
14 38. In 2011, the Refinery idled operations and ceased processing crude oil.
15 39. In 2013, AltAir and the Refinery partnered to form AltAir Paramount, LLC, to produce
16 biofuels at the Refinery. Under this partnership, AltAir proposed modifications to the
17 Refinery to process up to 3,500 bpd of technical grade vegetable oils and beef tallow into
18 renewable fuels. These modifications repurposed or changed existing equipment,
19 including converting several reactors and the Isomerization Unit into Renewable Fuels

20 Unit A to pre-treat feedstock and hydrocrack green paraffinic diesel into biofuels;
21 modifying the Amine Scrubber to remove carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide from
22 refinery fuel gas; and amending storage tank permits to authorize the storage of

alternative feedstocks and products.

2 40. The City approved these modifications under a CEQA Mitigated Negative Declaration
c2 7 4 0 (MND) on December 30, 2013, rather than conducting a more thorough investigation of
impacts and alternatives in an EIR. Additionally, the City amended Conditional Use
Permit No. 757 to allow for the conversion of the Refinery into a biofuels facility and
issued a zone variance.

7 41.AltAir completed these modifications to produce biofuels between 2014 and 2015. The

8 Refinery began producing up to 50 million gallons per year of biofuels in 2016 and has

59 been in continuous full capacity production since January 2016.
42. As of September 2017, crude oil refining shut down permanently at the Refinery after
11 being idled since 2011.
12 D. The Proposed Biofuels Project and its Environmental Impacts

13 43. In 2018, World Energy, LLC, purchased AltAir Paramount, LLC, including the Refinery.
AltAir became a wholly owned subsidiary of World Energy. That same year, under 14

15 World Energy, AltAir proposed the Biofuels Project and applied for a modification to

16 Conditional Use Permit No. 757 and for a variance to exceed height limits.

17 44. Under the Project, AltAir would make several modifications to increase throughput from

18 3,500 bpd to 25,000 bpd of vegetable oil and tallow to make more biofuels above the

19 current 50 million gallons produced per year. Among the proposed changes, AltAir

20 would modify the current Renewable Fuels Unit A and install a new unit a (Renewable

21 Fuels Unit B); expand feedstock options to process low-grade oils, fats, and/or greases in

22 addition to technical grade materials; construct gray hydrogen generation and recovery

23 units; erect a new flare; and install 3.7 miles of fossil gas pipeline through residential

24 areas to tanks in the City of Lakewood.

25 45. In addition to subjecting community members to increased safety risks, the Project's

26 proposed increase in throughput at the Refinery will result in significant environmental

27 and health impacts. When finished, the Project would release 1,743 pounds of VOCs and

28

INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

2 2,133 pounds of NOx emissions per day from the increased operations at the Refinery,

c + including the daily 50 railcars and 540 diesel truck trips. Due to these significant
environmental impacts, and the location of high-density communities of color and high

Ut poverty areas near the Refinery and along the pipeline route, the Biofuels Project would

6 disproportionately impact communities of color and low-income populations in the City
and the surrounding areas.

7

8 E. Environmental Review and the Proposed Biofuels Project Approval Process

o 46. The City of Paramount, as the public agency, has principal responsibility for approving

10 the Project under CEQA. The City conducted an initial study to determine if the Project

11 would have significant environmental impacts requiring an environmental impact report.

12 47. After conducting the initial study, on June 4, 2020, the City determined that the Biofuels

13 Project could have significant environmental impacts. As a result, the City posted :

14 notice of preparation indicating that it would prepare an SEIR under CEQA to evaluate

15 the Project's foreseeable significant environmental impacts, including air quality, climate,
transportation, and hazards.

16

17 48. On December 6, 2021, the City released a Draft SEIR for public review. The public

18 comment period on the Draft SEIR ran through February 3, 2022.

19 49. Petitioners submitted comments highlighting numerous flaws in the Draft SEIR,

20 including its cumulative impacts analysis, selected baseline, consideration of alternatives,

21 and adequacy of mitigation measures, among other deficiencies.

22 50. After concluding public comment on February 3, 2022, the City issued a Final SEIR

23 shortly thereafter. The Final SEIR provided responses to comments but did not

24 incorporate changes necessary to address the deficiencies of the Final SEIR.

25 51. The City's Planning Commission voted on March 14, 2022, to recommend that the City

26 Council approve the Biofuels Project. On April 11, 2022, the City Council held a public

27 hearing to consider the environmental review and approvals for the Project.

28 52. During the public hearing, multiple community members spoke in opposition to the

- 13 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Project, raising concerns about the increased pollution, health and cancer risks, and lack

2 of adequate public notice. Additionally, Councilmember Laurie Guillen highlighted
w A U concerns about the dangers of transporting hydrogen and fuel in residential
neighborhoods, the health impacts to children and families in the area, and the increased
financial burdens on residents near the Refinery.

6 53. Despite the concerns raised about the sufficiency of the SEIR as an informational

7 document and significant impacts that would be caused by the Project, the City Council,

8 in a 3-1 vote, certified the Final SEIR and approved the Project. Councilmember Guillen
5o cast the dissenting vote.
10 54. On April 18, 2022, the Los Angeles County Clerk posted the Notice of Determination
11 providing notice of the City's final decision triggering the 30-day statutory deadline
12 under CEQA to challenge the approval of the SEIR. CEQA Guidelines, § 15112(c)(I). §
13

14 V. CEQA LEGAL BACKGROUND

15 55. The California Environmental Quality Act is a comprehensive statute designed to provide

16 for long-term protection of the environment. Cal. Pub. Res. Code, §§ 21000-21189. It

17 accomplishes this in two ways. First, CEQA review informs decisionmakers and the

18 public about the potential significant environmental effects of a project. CEQA

19 Guidelines, § 15002(a)(1). Such disclosure ensures that "long term protection of the

20 environment . .. shall be the guiding criterion in public decisions." Cal. Pub. Resources

21 Code § 21001(d). The EIR is the "heart" of this requirement. See No Oil, Inc. V. City of

22 Los Angeles, 13 Cal.3d 68, 84 (1974). The EIR has been described as "an environmental

23 'alarm bell' whose purpose it is to alert it the public and its responsible officials to

24 environmental changes before they have reached ecological points of no return." County

25 of Inyo v. Yorty, 32 Cal.App.3d 795, 810 (1973).

26 56. Second, CEQA requires public agencies to avoid or reduce environmental damage

27 whenever feasible by considering changes in projects through project alternatives or

28
- 14 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

2 enforceable mitigation measures. See CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15002(a)(2)-(3),

3 15126.4(a)(2); see also Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Board of Supervisors 52 Cal.3d 553,

4 564 (1990). To measure the environmental damages of a project and provide adequate

5 mitigation, CEQA and its implementing guidelines require that an EIR "include a

6 description of the physical environmental conditions in the vicinity of the project .. as

7 they exist at the time the notice of preparation is published." CEQA Guidelines, §

8 15125(a). This baseline is a key component in identifying and quantifying a project's

o environmental effects and the starting point from which a lead agency measures whether

10 an impact may be environmentally significant. Id. Without an adequate baseline

11 description, "analysis of impacts, mitigation measures and project alternatives becomes

12 impossible." Save our Peninsula Comm. v. Monterey Cnty. Bd. of Supervisors, 87 Cal.

13 App 4th 99, 124 (2001) [quoting County of Amador v. El Dorado Cnty. Water Agency, 76
Cal. App 4th 931, 953 (1999)].

14

15 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

16 (Violations of CEQA - Public Resources Section 21000, et seq.)

17

18 57. Petitioners incorporate herein by reference the allegations contained in the foregoing
paragraphs.

19

20 58. The City violated CEQA by certifying a legally deficient Final SEIR and by approving

21 the Project without adequate environmental review. The City's CEQA violations include
the following:
22
23 a. The City failed to require that the Final SEIR base its environmental review and

24 analyses on an accurate, stable, and finite description of the Biofuels Project that

25 fully discloses and fairly evaluates the nature and objectives of the Project. The

26 description of the Project failed to provide decisionmakers and the public with

27 enough information to understand the Project's environmental impacts,

28 appropriate mitigation, and potential alternatives. For instance, the description of

- 15 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

2 the Project is inaccurate and incomplete in the following way:

A i. The Final SEIR confirms the gray Hydrogen Generation Unit would be
larger than what may be needed to supply the Refinery, The Final SEIR

5 fails to describe the foreseeable future generation, export, transport, and

6 use of hydrogen for non-Project specific purposes and environmental

7 impacts. Because of this omission, the SEIR gave conflicting signals about

8 the Project's nature and scope.

E50 b. The City failed to measure the impacts of the Biofuels Project using an accurate
or realistic baseline that reflects existing physical environmental conditions at the

12 time the City published the notice of preparation. The City published the notice of

13 preparation on June 4, 2020. The Final SEIR, however, used a 2011 baseline that

14 reflects the last time the Refinery was refining crude oil before idling and

15 permanently shutting down crude oil refining in September 2017. The Final SEIR
lacks substantial evidence supporting its use of this baseline or how it provides a

moré accurate or

16

17 realistic measurement of the Project's impacts. The Final SEIR's
baseline is misleading and prevented decisionmakers and the public from

18 C. understanding the Project's likely environmental impacts.

19 The City failed to adequately evaluate the Biofuels Project's environmental

20 impacts, and failed to respond to public comments concerning a varietÿ of

21 significant environmental effects of the Project, including the following:

22 i. The Final SEIR uses an overly narrow two-mile geographic area to

23

24 evaluate cumulative impacts, fails to disclose and analyze the potential
cumulative impacts from refinery conversions in the area, and fails to

25

26 disclose and analyze the environmental and climate impacts that will result
from competition for limited quantities of feedstock and increases in oil

27 crop production or foreign imports that are associated with current biofuel

trends.

28
16 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 ii. The Final SEIR fails to disclose and analyze pipeline fugitive emissions,

2 including the quantities and types of air contaminants. Fugitive emissions

3 are likely to occur from necessary pipeline maintenance operations and
4 routine inspections to detect corrosion or damage, but the Final SEIR

5 failed to account for these emissions.

6 iii. The Final SEIR fails to disclose and analyze potential process hazards that

7 could result from lower-grade feedstock. There are significant hazards

8 related to the use of lower-grade feedstocks, including potential plugging
9 and gumming in pipes between ships or trucks and tanks, or from
10 pretreatment units that could result in process upsets.
iv. The Final SEIR fails to disclose and analyze the potential for runaway
12 reactions and flaring from the Project. The Biofuels Project will process
13 lower-grade oils, fats, and/or greases that require significantly more
14 hydrogen and that elevate the risk of flaring and explosions from runaway
15 process reactions that generate high heat.
16 V. The Final SEIR fails to disclose and analyze hazards associated with the
17 storage, transportation, and disposal of spent catalysts. A catalyst is toxic
18 and pyrophoric, meaning that it can spontaneously ignite when exposed to
19 air. The Project will increase the amount of spent catalyst by several
20 hundred tons per year.
21 vi. The Final SEIR fails to disclose and analyze hazards from toxic dust that
22 could migrate during construction. The Final SEIR does not disclose the
23 types of soil contaminants and potential environmental and health risks.
24 The Final SEIR relies solely on regulatory compliance to conclude
25 impacts would be less than significant.
26 vii. The Final SEIR fails to disclose and analyze the Project's climate change
27 impacts. The Final SEIR analyzes the Project's climate change impacts
28
- 17 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 using a 2008 interim threshold developed by the South Coast Air Quality

2 Management District, despite evidence in the record confirming that since
007 10 2008 climate conditions are deteriorating more rapidly than predicted and
require more drastic emissions reductions than the interim threshold
envisioned.

viii. The Final SEIR fails to describe the range of materials that could be
7 processed and their differing environmental impacts. The Final SEIR

8 detailed that the Project would allow the Refinery to process lower-grade
02=0 oils, fats, and/or greases, but these categories are overbroad and could
include a range of feedstocks.
d. The City failed to consider, discuss, or adopt adequate mitigation measures to
minimize the Biofuels Project's significant and detrimental impacts, or otherwise

13 improperly deferred mitigation necessary to minimize the Project's impacts,
14 including the following:

15 i. The Final SEIR fails to describe and consider feasible mitigation measures

16 to address significant air pollution impacts from the Project's construction

17 and operation, including use of zero emissions trucks and construction

18 equipment, electric boilers and heaters, and leakless valves to control

19 fugitive VOC emissions. The City approved the Project without ensuring

20 that it implemented all feasible mitigation measures.

21 ii. The Final SEIR defers developing the details of Mitigation Measure AQ-

22 2b (NOx Reduction Program), including reduction measures, potential
23 reductions, performance criteria, and amount of funding necessary. The

24 Final SEIR fails to explain why it would be impractical or infeasible to

25 formulate the details of this mitigation measure.

26 iii. The Final SEIR fails to support its decision to limit indoor air filter

27 distribution to residences and schools between 200 to 1,000 feet of the

28
- 18 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1

2 Refinery under Mitigation Measure AQ-2b. The Final SEIR based this

3 filter distribution on localized modeling of NOx emissions during

4 construction only and ignored significant NOx emissions that would occur

5 during both construction and operation where NOx and VOC pollution is
expected to be significant.

6

7 iv. The Final SEIR fails to support its decision to limit Mitigation Measure

8 AQ-2b to NOx emissions, despite the potential for significant VOC

vO emissions during construction and operation overlap. The Final SEIR
ignored the potential for VOCs to travel long distances and the longer

11 atmospheric lifetimes of these pollutants.

12 V. The Final SEIR incorporates unlawful compliance exemptions to

13 Mitigation Measure AQ-1a. which creates on and off-road construction

14 vehicle requirements to reduce NOx emissions. The Final SEIR allows the

15 Refinery to use higher-polluting equipment after "good faith" efforts to

16 comply, rendering the measure optional and ineffective.

17 vi. The Final SEIR fails to adequately mitigate the Project's climate change

18 impacts from significant greenhouse gas emissions during construction

19 and operations. The Final SEIR relies on California's temporary cap-and-

20 trade program to mitigate the Project's greenhouse gas emission even after

21 2030 when the program is set to expire.

22 vii. The Final SEIR fails to provide adequate mitigation for construction

23 traffic impacts. The Final SEIR estimates about 1,312 construction

24 workers would visit the refinery each day but asserts that offsite parking
and shuttles would be available to reduce traffic

25 impacts. The Final SEIR,

26 however, does not make use of this offsite parking mandatory for the
Refinery and contractors.
27

28 e. The City failed to adequately analyze a reasonable range of alternatives and

- 19 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

rejected feasible alternatives that would substantially lessen the Biofuels Project's
2 significant environmental effects. The Final SEIR created narrow objectives to
0t n ensure the Project would be approved as proposed and to dismiss from
consideration other feasible alternatives with less significant environmental
impacts, including a reduced throughput alternative or an alternative that does not
6 require additional production of hydrogen on site.

7 59. If the City, Real Parties in Interest, and DOES 1 to 40 are 1 not enjoined from moving

8 forward with permitting, constructing and operating the Biofuels Project without
60 adequate environmental analysis and mitigation, and without complying with CEQA's

10 environmental review and evidentiary requirements, Petitioners will suffer irreparable

11 harm from which there is no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law unless this Court

12 grants the requested writ of mandate.
13 60. By certifying the Final SEIR and by approving the Biofuels Project, the City committed a

14 prejudicial abuse of discretion, failed to proceed in the manner required by law, and acted

15 without substantial evidentiary support.

16 VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

17 WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for judgment as set forth below:

18 A. For a writ of mandate or peremptory writ issued under the seal of this Court pursuant to

19 Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5, or in the alternative section 1085, directing the

20 City to:

21 1. Set aside and withdraw its certification of the Final SEIR and approval of the

22 statement of overriding considerations;

23 2. Set aside and withdraw all approvals for the Biofuels Project, including the

24 amendment to Conditional Use Permit No. 757 and Zone Variance No. 409; and

25 3. Refrain from granting any further approvals for the Project unless and until the

26 City complies fully with the requirements of CEQA.

27

28
- 20 -

B. For entry of injunctive relief prohibiting the City and the Real Party in Interest from

2 constructing and operating the Project until the City complies fully with the requirements
3 of CEQA by voiding the approved Final SEIR, setting aside and withdrawing all
approvals issued in reliance on the Final SEIR, and conducting a new environmental
review process that complies with CEQA's requirements as set forth herein.

6 C. For a declaratory judgment stating that the City violated CEQA by approving the

7 Biofuels Project.

8 D. For a declaratory judgment that the City's failure to prepare, consider, and approve or
9 certify an adequate environmental analysis under CEQA is a prejudicial abuse of
10 discretion.

11 E. For Petitioners' fees and costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, as
12 authorized by Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5 and any other applicable
13 provisions of law.
14 F. For such other legal and equitable relief as this Court deems appropriate and just.
