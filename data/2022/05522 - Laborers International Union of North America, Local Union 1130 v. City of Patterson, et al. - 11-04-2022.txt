Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

INTRODUCTION

2 1. Petitioner LABORERS' INTERNATIONAL UNION OF NORTH AMERICA, LOCAL

3 UNION 1130 ("Petitioner" or "LIUNA") brings this action to challenge the unlawful actions of

4 Respondents CITY OF PATTERSON and CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF PATTERSON

5 (collectively, "City") in approving the Zacharias and Baldwin Ranch Master Plans (Project") and

6 certifying an Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") for the Project because the EIR fails to satisfy the

7 requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code §§ 21000

8 et seq., and the CEQA Guidelines, title 14, California Code of Regulations, §§ 15000 et seq. The Project
consists of two separate Master Plans (Baldwin and Zacharias) that together involve the annexation of

10 1,297 acres into the City of Patterson, both of which were approved by Respondents along with a

11 General Plan amendment, various Conditions of Approval, and an Ordinance requiring that the

12 properties located within the Master Plan boundaries be "prezoned" to be consistent with the land use

13 designations of the Master Plans (collectively, the "Approvals").

14 2. Jointly proposed by five property ownership groupsidentified as Zacharias Ranch, TFP

15 Development, Lakeside Hills, Keystone Ranch, and Baldwin Ranch-which collectively own 1,160

16 acres, the Project contemplates the development of residential, mixed use, commercial, industrial,

17 school, parks, and open space uses. Each of the two Master Plans is composed of smaller "development

18 areas" that are designated for a variety of land uses. The Zacharias Master Plan includes five

19 development areas while the Baldwin Master Plan includes only one. This Petition is solely concerned

20 with Respondents' violation of CEQA as pertains to the approval of light industrial uses within the

21 Zacharias Ranch Development Area.

22 3. By far the Project's most significant environmental impact, the Zacharias Ranch

23 Development Area would include the development of approximately 6,910,000 square feet zoned for

24 light industrial uses. The Zacharias Ranch Development Area is located east of Rogers Road, south of
25 Zacharias Road, and west of Baldwin Road, and is composed of approximately 478.7 acres. The

26 proposed land uses within it include 125.3 acres for medium-density residential use; 22.2 acres for
27 community commercial use; 10 acres for park use; 3.7 acres for trail use; and a sprawling 317.5 acres for

28 light industrial use. In total, the planned industrial use constitutes roughly two-thirds of the area's total

Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

acreage.

2 4. The Project will be developed in phases, beginning with those areas located closest to

3 existing development. The industrial portions of the Zacharias Ranch Development Area would be

4 developed during phases 1C and 2A, the third and fourth phases, respectively, of seven phases of

5 development for the five planning areas which collectively constitute the Zacharias Master Plan.

6 5. The Project site currently consists of largely undeveloped land, rich in biological

7 resources, including hundreds of acres of critical habitat for dozens of wildlife species, at least six of

8 which are designated special-status species.

9 6. In certifying the EIR, Respondents failed to comply with CEQA. More specifically,

10 Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion and failed to proceed in the manner required by law

11 by certifying an EIR that does not adequately analyze or mitigate the significant environmental impacts

12 that will result from the planned industrial land uses within the Zacharias Ranch Development Area.

13 The EIR also fails to adopt all feasible mitigation measures, fails to provide an adequate response to

14 comments, and presents an insufficient statement of overriding considerations. As a result of these and

15 other deficiencies, the EIR fails as an informational document.

16 7. Because the EIR violates CEQA, all Approvals related to industrial land uses within the

17 Zacharias Ranch Development Area must be overturned. Petitioner respectfully requests that the Court

18 direct Respondents to prepare a supplemental EIR to address the specific CEQA violations related to

19 these planned industrial uses.

20 PARTIES

21 8. Petitioner LABORERS' INTERNATIONAL UNION OF NORTH AMERICA, LOCAL

22 UNION 1130 ("LIUNA") is a labor organization a made up of members who reside throughout Merced

23 and Stanislaus Counties, including in the City of Patterson. LIUNA's purposes include advocating on

24 behalf of its members to ensure safe workplace environments; working to protect recreational

25 opportunities for its members to improve its members' quality of life when off the job; advocating to

26 assure its members access to safe, healthful, productive, and aesthetically and culturally pleasing

27 surroundings on and off the job; promoting environmentally sustainable businesses and development

28 projects on behalf of its members, including providing comments raising environmental concerns and

2
Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

benefits on proposed development projects; advocating for changes to proposed development projects

2 that will help to achieve a balance between employment, the human population, and resource use to

3 permit high standards of living and a wide sharing of life's amenities by its members as well as the

4 general public; advocating for steps to preserve important historic, cultural, and natural aspects of our

5 national heritage, and maintain, wherever possible, an environment that supports diversity and variety of

6 individual choice; advocating on behalf of its members for programs, policies, and development projects

7 that promote not only good jobs but also a healthy natural environment and working environment,

8 including advocating for changes to proposed projects and policies that, if adopted, would reduce air,

9 soil, and water pollution, minimize harm to wildlife, conserve wild places, reduce traffic congestion,

10 reduce global warming impacts, and assure compliance with applicable land use ordinances; and

11 working to attain the widest range of beneficial uses of the environment without degradation, risk to
health or safety, or other undesirable or unintended consequences.
12 9. LIUNA and its members have a direct and beneficial interest in Respondents' compliance
13 with laws bearing upon approval of the Project. These interests will be directly and adversely affected
14 by the Project, which violates the law as set forth in this Petition. The maintenance and prosecution of
15 this action will confer a substantial benefit on the public by protecting the public from the environmental
16 and other harms alleged below and others that may exist but are unknown due to the lack of a full
17 environmental analysis. LIUNA and its members submitted comments to the City's Planning

18 Commission and the City Council objecting to and commenting on the Project and its unsupported and

19 inadequate environmental review pursuant to CEQA.

20 10. Respondent CITY OF PATTERSON ("City") is a municipal body in whose jurisdiction

21 the Project will be located. Respondent CITY OF PATTERSON is the "lead agency" for the Project for

22 purposes of Public Resources Code 21067, and has principal responsibility for conducting

23 environmental review for the Project and taking other actions necessary to comply with CEQA.

24 11. Respondent CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF PATTERSON ("City Council") serves

25 as the elected governing body of the City of Patterson. The City Council is vested with all the powers of

26 the City, including reviewing and approving certain development plans and complying with the

27 requirements of state laws. Respondent CITY COUNCIL is ultimately responsible for reviewing and

28 approving or denying the Project. The CITY COUNCIL voted on August 16, 2022, to approve the

3

Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

Project, including certification of the EIR.

2 12. Real Party in Interest KEYSTONE CORPORATION dba KEYSTONE (NC)
3 CORPORATION is a North Carolina corporation doing business in California and is listed as the

4 Project applicant on the Notice of Determination (NOD"), which the City filed with the Stanislaus

5 County Clerk-Recorder on August 18, 2022.

6 13. Real Party in Interest BALDWIN RANCH DEVELOPMENT LLC is not listed on the

7 NOD. However, its designated agent for service of process, Mr. Joseph B. Hollowell III, is listed in the

8 EIR as the property owner and representative for the Baldwin Ranch and Zacharias Ranch development
areas. Petitioner therefore believes that BALDWIN RANCH DEVELOPMENT LLC is the entity

10 responsible for development of the Zacharias Ranch Development Area.

11 14. Real Parties in Interest KEYSTONE CORPORATION and BALDWIN RANCH

12 DEVELOPMENT LLC may collectively be referred to hereafter as "Applicants" or "Real Parties."

13 15. The true names and capacities of Real Parties in Interest 1 ROES 1 through 10 are not

14 presently known to Petitioner. Petitioner may amend this Petition to add the true names and capacities of

15 said Roes at such time as they are discovered.

16 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

17 16. This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this Petition pursuant to Code of

18 Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5, and Public Resources Code sections 21167, 21168 and

19 21168.5.

20 17. Venue is proper in Stanislaus County Superior Court in accordance with Code of Civil

21 Procedure section 395 because the Project at issue is located in the County of Stanislaus.

22 18. Venue is proper in this Court under California Code of Civil Procedure §§ 394 (actions

23 against a city, county, or local agency) and 395 (actions generally) because Respondents include a City

24 and local agencies based in the County of Stanislaus and because the cause of action alleged in this

25 Petition arose in the County of Stanislaus and the Project will occur within the County of Stanislaus.

26 19. This action was timely filed. Petitioner has filed this Petition prior to the expiration of

27 any applicable statute of limitations.

28 STANDING

4

Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

20. Petitioner has standing to assert the claims alleged in this Petition because they are

2 beneficially interested in this matter, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 1086. Petitioner has

3 direct and beneficial interests in Respondents' compliance with laws bearing upon approval of the

4 Project. These interests will be directly and adversely affected by the Project, which violates the law as

5 set forth in this Petition and would cause substantial harm to the natural environment and the quality of

6 life in the surrounding community. In addition, unless the relief requested herein is granted, the

7 environment will be adversely affected and injured by Respondents' failure to comply with CEQA when

8 certifying the EIR and approving the Project.

9 21. Petitioner actively participated in the Project's administrative approval process in an

10 attempt to ensure Respondents complied with CEQA and all other applicable laws.

11 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

12 22. Petitioner has performed or will perform all conditions precedent to the filing of this

13 Petition. Petitioner has actively participated in the administrative and environmental review process

14 prior to close of the public hearings on the Project and before the issuance of the notice of

15 determination. Petitioner has fully exhausted administrative remedies to the extent required by law.

16 (Pub. Resources Code, § 21177, subd. (a).)

17 23. CEQA allows a petitioner who objected to a project to allege in a writ petition all

18 deficiencies asserted by others. (Citizens for Clean Energy v. City of Woodland (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th

19 173, 191.) Petitioner, other agencies, interested groups, and individuals made oral and written commentsl
20 on the Project, and raised each of the legal deficiencies asserted in this Petition.

21 24. Respondents have taken final agency actions certifying the EIR and adopting the related

22 Project approvals. Respondents had a mandatory duty to comply with all applicable laws, including, but

23 not limited to CEQA, prior to undertaking the discretionary approvals at issue in this lawsuit. Petitioners

24 possess no effective remedy to challenge the Project approvals at issue in this action other than by

25 means of this lawsuit.

26 NOTICE OF CEOA SUIT

27 25. On August 30, 2022, Petitioner served a notice of its intent to file this lawsuit, in

28 accordance with Public Resources Code section 21167.5. (See Exhibit 1: Notice of Intent to File Petition

5

Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

Pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act.)

2 PREPARATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD

26. Pursuant to Public Resources Code, section 21167.6, subdivision (b)(2), Petitioner elects

4 to prepare the record of proceedings in this action. (See Exhibit 2: Petitioner's Notice of Intent to

5 Prepare Record.)

6 PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL DOCTRINE

7 27. Petitioners bring this action as private attorneys general pursuant to Code of Civil

8 Procedure section 1021.5, and any other applicable legal theory, to enforce important rights affecting

9 the public interest.

10 28. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will confer a significant benefit on the

11 general public by requiring Respondents to carry out their duties under CEQA and other applicable

12 laws before approving the Project.

13 29. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will also result in the enforcement of

14 important rights affecting the public interest by compelling Respondents to engage in a legally adequate

15 analysis of the Project, and to ensure that the public has meaningful opportunity to review and

16 comment on the impacts and mitigation measures for the Project.
17 30. The necessity and financial burden of enforcement make an award of attorneys' fees

18 appropriate in this case. Without this Petition, Respondents and Real Party will proceed with a plan and

19 development that will cause significant, unmitigated environmental impacts that might otherwise have

20 been reduced or avoided through legally adequate environmental review and the adoption of feasible

21 mitigation measures.

22 IRREPARABLE HARM

23 31. Petitioner and its members live, work, and/or recreate near the Project site and in the

24 City of Patterson. They have been and will continue to be harmed by Respondents' failure to provide

25 environmental documents that accurately and fully inform interested persons of the Project's true

26 impacts, and mitigate those impacts. Such documents would lead to better environmental decision-

27 making regarding the Project, and would enable all residents, land owners, and business owners in the

28 affected region to better understand the true environmental impacts of the Project.

6

Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

32. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law unless

2 this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to set aside their approval of the

3 Project. In the absence of such remedies, Respondents' decisions will remain in effect in violation of

4 State law and Petitioner will be irreparably harmed. No monetary damages or legal remedy could fully

5 and adequately compensate Petitioner for that harm.

6 PROCEDURAL ALLEGATIONS

7 33. On December 3, 2020, the City released a Draft EIR (DEIR") for public review and

8 comment on the Project.

9 34. Several parties provided written comments on the DEIR, including organizations, public

10 agencies, and individual members of the public.

11 35. Petitioner submitted written comments to Respondents on the DEIR on April 14, 2021.

12 36. On July 1, 2021, the City released a Final EIR ("FEIR") for the Project.

13 37. On August 12, 2021, the City Planning Commission held a hearing to consider the Project

14 and the FEIR.

15 38. At the August 12, 2021 hearing, the Planning Commission voted to recommend approval

16 of the Project and certification of the FEIR.

17 39. Petitioner submitted written comments to Respondents on the FEIR on August 16, 2022.

18 40. On August 16, 2022, following a hearing, the City Council approved the Project, certified

19 the EIR, and adopted Findings, a Statement of Overriding Considerations, and a Mitigation Monitoring

20 and Reporting Program. At this meeting, the City Council adopted a Motion to Approve a First Reading

21 and Introduction of Ordinance No. 862, reading by title only and waiving further reading. Once adopted,

22 Ordinance No. 862 would prezone the properties located within the Baldwin and Zacharias Master Plan

23 Areas to be consistent with the land use designations of the City's Master Plan. On August 18, 2022, the

24 City a filed a Notice of Determination regarding the City Council's approvals for the Project with the

25 Stanislaus County Clerk-Recorder.

26 41. On October 4, 2022, following a hearing, the City Council adopted a Motion to Approve

27 a Second Reading of Ordinance No. 862, reading by title only and waiving further reading, and a Motion

28 to Adopt Ordinance No. 862, reading by title only and waiving further reading. Ordinance No. 862 was

7
Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

thereupon formally adopted by the City Council, thus prezoning the properties located within the Baldwin

2 and Zacharias Master Plan Areas.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

4 THE PROJECT AND PROJECT SITE:

5 42. The Project consists of two separate Master Plans (Baldwin and Zacharias) that together

6 involve the annexation of 1,297 acres into the City of Patterson.

7 43. The Project contemplates the development of residential, mixed use, commercial,

8 industrial, school, parks, and open space uses.

9 44. The Zacharias Ranch Development Area (*Development Area") is one of five

10 development areas proposed under the Zacharias Master Plan. By far the Project's most significant

11 environmental impact, it involves the development of approximately 6,910,000 square feet for light
12 industrial uses. The Development Area is the only segment of the Project which contemplates industrial

13 development.

14 45. The Development Area is located east of Rogers Road, south of Zacharias Road, west of

15 Baldwin Road, and is composed of approximately 478.7 acres. The proposed land uses within the
16 Development Area include 125.3 acres for medium-density residential use; 22.2 acres for community

17 commercial use; 10 acres for park use; 3.7 acres for trail use; and a massive 317.5 acres for light

18 industrial use. In total, the planned industrial use constitutes roughly two-thirds of the Development

19 Area's total land area.

20 46. Currently, the Development Area is largely undeveloped, consisting mainly of open

21 space and agricultural land. The Project site contains hundreds of acres of open land which provide

22 critical habitat for dozens of wildlife species, including at least six special-status species.

23 IMPACTS ON BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES:

24 47. Petitioner submitted written comments to Respondents, on April 14, 2021, describing

25 numerous ways in which the DEIR's analysis and mitigation of Project impacts on biological resources

26 failed to comply with CEQA. These comments included an expert analysis prepared by wildlife

27 biologist Dr. Shawn Smallwood, Ph.D.

28 48. Dr. Smallwood found that the DEIR's discussion of wildlife impacts was insufficient

8
Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

because it: (1) mischaracterized the environmental setting and abundance of species occurring or likely

2 to occur on the Project site; (2) failed to account for habitat loss; (3) mischaracterized the CEQA

3 standard for assessing impacts to wildlife movement; (4) failed to assess the impacts on wildlife from

4 traffic, window collisions, and house cats; (5) failed to assess the Project's impact on wildlife resulting

5 from future energy demands; and (6) failed to assess the Project's cumulative impacts on wildlife. The

6 FEIR does not respond to any of Dr. Smallwood's comments or address these impacts to wildlife.

7 49. Dr. Smallwood determined that at least six special-status species occur on or near the

8 Project site. Among other findings, Dr. Smallwood reported four sightings of Loggerhead shrike
(Lanius ludovicianus) throughout the Project site. Loggerhead shrike is designated by the U.S. Fish and

10 Wildlife Service as a Bird Species of Conservation Concern ("BCC") and is classified as a California

11 Species of Special Concern, Priority Level 2. In one instance, Dr. Smallwood viewed Loggerhead

12 shrike from a vantage point near Rogers Road, approximately 900 meters south of Zacharias Road, a

13 location squarely within the Zacharias Ranch Development Area. The FEIR includes no reference

14 whatsoever to the presence of Loggerhead shrike on the Project site.
15 50. Dr. Smallwood additionally observed that the DEIR presented "flawed and misleading

16 conclusions" regarding the likely presence of Swainson's hawk (Buteo swainsoni) on the Project site

17 and surrounding areas. For instance, the DEIR stated that no Swainson's hawks were observed on the

18 Project site -without disclosing that the birds are in fact widely known to seasonally migrate to Mexico

19 at the time of year during which the wildlife survey was conducted. The California Department of Fish

20 and Wildlife ("CDFW") raised similar concerns regarding the EIR's failure to provide sufficient

21 mitigation to compensate for the Project's likely significant impacts to Swainson's hawk. In response,

22 the FEIR asserts, without evidence, that "compensatory mitigation for Swainson's hawk ...] is not

23 necessary nor recommended."

24 AIR QUALITY IMPACTS:

25 51. Petitioner submitted written comments to Respondents, on April 14, 2021, describing

26 various ways in which the DEIR's analysis of air quality impacts failed to comply with CEQA. These

27 comments included expert written analysis prepared by Matt Hagemann, P.G., C.Hg., and Dr. Paul E.

28 Rosenfeld, Ph.D., of the environmental consulting firm Soil/Water/Air Protection Enterprise

9

Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

("SWAPE").

2 52. SWAPE found that the DEIR severely underestimated the Project's construction and

3 operational emissions, and that it failed to implement all feasible mitigation measures to reduce the

4 Project's significant emissions of criteria air pollutants, including reactive organic gases ("ROG"),

5 nitrogen oxides ("NOx"), carbon monoxide ("CO"), and particulate matter ("PM10"and "PM2.5"). The

6 FEIR does not respond to these comments or discuss in any detail the Project's air quality impacts.

7 53. Petitioner submitted additional written comments to Respondents, on August 16, 2021,

8 regarding the FEIR's failure to include feasible mitigation measures addressing the Project's significant
and unavoidable air quality impacts. The FEIR asserted, without evidence, that the only feasible

10 mitigation measure available to address these impacts is the EIR's proposed measure, MM AIR-3, which

11 would require that the Project's future construction contractors demonstrate to the City that "a good faith
12 effort was made to obtain off-road equipment meeting Tier 4 standards."

13 54. Tier 4 is an emissions standard for nonroad diesel engines established by the U.S.
14 Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") and enforced by the California Air Resources Board
15 ("CARB"). CARB is currently drafting a rulemaking that would require more stringent emissions

16 reductions for future production and sales of new off-road diesel engine equipment within California.

17 55. The EIR fails to provide substantial evidence in support of Respondents' decision to

18 approve the Project without adopting all feasible mitigation measures to reduce air quality impacts. For

19 instance, Respondents offer no evidence to support the EIR's claim that it would be infeasible to require

20 that industrial projects within the Zacharias Ranch Development Area utilize only Tier 4 or higher-level

21 equipment to minimize future construction emissions.

22 GREENHOUSE GAS IMPACTS:

23 56. Petitioner submitted written comments to Respondents, on April 14, 2021, describing

24 various ways in which the DEIR's analysis of greenhouse gas ("GHG") impacts failed to comply with
25 CEQA. These comments included SWAPE's expert analysis on the subject.

26 57. SWAPE found that the DEIR failed to adequately evaluate the Project's GHG emissions

27 and failed to implement all feasible mitigation measures to reduce the Project's GHG emissions.

28 58. Petitioner submitted additional written comments to Respondents, on August 16, 2021,

10
Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

regarding the FEIR's failure to include feasible mitigation measures that would address the Project's

2 significant and unavoidable GHG impacts.

3 59. The EIR fails to provide any evidence in support of Respondents' decision to not require

4 the installation of solar panels on all industrial buildings within the Zacharias Ranch Development Area.

5 Solar panels are widely used throughout the State and, if utilized here, would provide a sufficient energy

6 supply to meet all projected energy demand from the Project's industrial buildings while significantly

7 reducing the Project's reliance on GHGs.

8 HUMAN HEALTH IMPACTS:

9 60. Petitioner submitted written comments to Respondents, on April 14, 2021, describing the

10 DEIR's failure to quantify the risk to human health from the Project's emissions of diesel particulate

11 matter ("DPM"). These comments were presented together with SWAPE's expert analysis on this issue.

12 61. An overwhelming majority of the Project's DPM emissions will be generated by the daily

13 operation of heavy-duty diesel-powered trucks operating in and around the industrial buildings located

14 within the Zacharias Ranch Development Area.

15 62. The DEIR did not contain a quantified health risk assessment ("HRA") to evaluate the

16 Project's impact on human health from DPM emissions. The failure to provide a quantified HRA is
17 inconsistent with the most recent guidance of the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment

18 ("OEHHA"). OEHHA recommends that all short-term projects lasting at least two months be evaluated

19 for cancer risks to nearby sensitive receptors. OEHHA also recommends that exposure from projects
20 lasting more than 6 months be evaluated for the duration of the project and recommends that an

21 exposure duration of 30 years be used to estimate individual cancer risk for the maximally exposed

22 individual resident ("MEIR").

23 63. In response to the DEIR's failure to consider human health impacts, SWAPE prepared a

24 screening-level HRA to evaluate potential DPM impacts resulting from the Project's construction and

25 future operation. SWAPE found that the Project would produce elevated cancer risks in infants,

26 children, and lifetime residents, all in excess of the applicable significance threshold established by the

27 San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District ("SJVAPCD"). The FEIR provides no response to

28 these comments and fails to address the Project's human health impacts.

11
Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

64. The EIR's air quality analysis further violates CEQA by failing to properly analyze the

2 correlation between adverse air quality impacts and resultant negative health impacts. A failure to

3 correlate a project's adverse air quality impacts to increased incidents of health ailments constitutes a

4 prejudicial abuse of discretion under CEQA. Instead, an EIR must "correlate the identified adverse air

5 quality impacts to resultant adverse health effects." Bakersfield Citizens. for Local Control v. City of

6 Bakersfield (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1184, 1219. The City has violated CEQA by failing to disclose or

7 evaluate these significant health impacts in the EIR.

8 ENERGY IMPACTS:

9
65.
10 Petitioner submitted written comments to Respondents, on August 16, 2022, detailing the

11 EIR's failure to adequately address the Project's energy impacts and proposing implementation of

12 feasible renewable energy options.

66.
13 CEQA provides that all Projects must include mitigation measures "to reduce the

14 wasteful, inefficient, and unnecessary consumption of energy." (PRC § 21100(b)(3).) Energy

15 conservation under CEQA is defined as the "wise and efficient use of energy." (CEQA Guidelines, app.

16 F, § I.) The "wise and efficient use of energy" is achieved by "(1) decreasing overall per capita energy

17 consumption, (2) decreasing reliance on fossil fuels such as coal, natural gas and oil, and (3) increasing

18 reliance on renewable energy resources." (Id.)

67.
19 Mere compliance with the California Building Energy Efficiency Standards (Cal. Code

20 Regs., tit. 24, part 6 ("Title 24") does not constitute an adequate analysis of energy. League to Save Lake

21 Tahoe, 75 Cal. App. 5th at 165; Ukiah Citizens for Safety First v. City of Ukiah (2016) 248 Cal. App. 4th

22 256, 264-65. Notably, in California Clean Energy V. City of Woodland, the court held unlawful an EIR's

23 energy analysis which relied solely upon compliance with Title 24 to conclude that energy impacts

24 would be less than significant. California Clean Energy Committee v. City of Woodland (2014) 225 Cal.

25 App. 4th 173, 209-13 (City of Woodland).

68.
26 The courts have since affirmed City of Woodland, explaining that even where "[an] EIR

27 [has] determined the project's impacts on energy resources would be less than significant," a lead

28 agency must still analyze implementation of all "renewable energy options that might have been
available or appropriate for [a] project." (League to Save Lake Tahoe Mountain Area Preservation

12
Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

Foundation v. County of Placer (2022) 75 Cal.App.5th 63, 167.) Furthermore, the court explained, a

2 lead agency's failure to consider implementation of all feasible renewable energy proposals raised

3 during the environmental review process constitutes a "prejudicial error." (Id. at 168.) Therefore, it is

4 clear that the EIR violates CEQA due to its failure to consider implementation of feasible renewable

5 energy options which were proposed during the Project's environmental review process.

6 WATER IMPACTS:

7 69. The Patterson Irrigation District and West Stanislaus Irrigation District (*Water

8 Districts") submitted written comments on the EIR during the administrative process ("Water Districts'
|Comments"). As the Water Districts' Comments noted, the EIR fails to accurately describe, analyze, and

10 adequately mitigate the Project's water impacts due to inaccurate project descriptions relating to the

11 planned use of groundwater and surface water.

12 70. Respondents failed to adequately respond to the Water Districts' Comments in the FEIR

13 and failed to revise the EIR to accurately describe, analyze, and adequately mitigate the Project's water

14 impacts.

15 71. In 2019, Respondent City of Patterson elected to become a groundwater sustainability

16 agency ("GSA") and, in this capacity, jointly entered into a groundwater sustainability plan ("GSP")

17 with the Water Districts. The GSP governs the groundwater use actions of all member GSAs. The GSP

18 was revised and approved once again by all GSA members in 2022.

19 72. The EIR is inconsistent with the City's existing commitments under the GSP. The

20 Project's future water consumption will substantially exceed the City's water consumption limits which

21 the City voluntarily adopted pursuant to the GSP prior to its certification of the EIR.

22 IAGRICULTURAL IMPACTS:

23 73. Respondents have failed to present substantial evidence showing that the Project's

24 impacts on agricultural land within the surrounding areas will be adequately mitigated. The EIR states

25 the Project will convert 1,034.23 acres of Prime Farmland, 60.40 acres of Unique Farmland, and 151.75

26 acres of Farmland of Statewide Importance to non-agricultural uses.

27 74. The EIR's proposed mitigation measures fail to adequately address these impacts.
28 Specifically, mitigation measure AG-1 states the applicant shall "preserve Important Farmland acreage

13
Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

within Stanislaus County, but outside of the Patterson Planning Area at a ratio of no less than 1:1 for

2 each acre of Important Farmland converted to non-agricultural use by the proposed project." However,

3 the Court of Appeal for the Fifth District has expressly held that the use of "1:1 mitigation ratios [….]

4 does not provide effective mitigation for the conversion of agricultural land" under CEQA. CEQA. King

5 & Gardiner Farms, LLC v. County of Kern (2020) 45 Cal.App.5th 814, 873-876.

6 MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS OF CEOA

7 75. CEQA has two primary purposes. First, it is designed to inform decision makers and the

8 public about a project's environmental effects. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15002(a)(1).) "The EIR
process protects not only the environment but also informed self-government." (Laurel Heights

10 Improvement Ass'n v. Regents of the University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 392.)

11 76. CEQA's second purpose is to require public agencies to identify ways to avoid or reduce
12 environmental damage caused by a project by requiring changes to the project, when feasible. (Cal.

13 Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15002(a)(2), (3).) A project cannot be approved if its significant impacts can be

14 feasibly reduced to insignificance through project alternatives or mitigation measures. (Pub. Res. Code
15 §§ 21002, 21021.)

16 77. To achieve these goals, CEQA contains a number of substantive and procedural
17 requirements, including, the following.

18 78. CEQA generally requires that a lead agency prepare and certify an EIR for any project

19 that may have a significant effect on the environment. The EIR must analyze and disclose the project's

20 significant environmental impacts, and must analyze feasible mitigation measures and project

21 alternatives that would reduce or avoid those significant impacts.

22 79. The EIR must contain an accurate, stable, and finite project description. (County of Inyo

23 V. City of Los Angeles (1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 185, 192.)

24 80. In addition to project-specific impacts, the EIR must also evaluate any impacts of the

25 project that may be "cumulatively considerable," and address the project's incremental effects when

26 combined with the effects of past, current, and probable future projects. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, §§

27 15064, subd. (h)(1), 15130, subd. (a), 15355.)

28 81. The EIR must include sufficient information to allow the public and decision makers to

14
Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

intelligently and fully consider the environmental consequences of approving a project. This includes

2 not just a disclosure that a project will have a specific impact, but also a discussion of the magnitude of

3 the impact.

4 82. A lead agency must respond to comments received on a draft EIR. Responses to

5 comments must be detailed and must provide a reasoned, good faith analysis. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14,

6 co. 15088(c).) Responses to comments on a draft EIR must state reasons for rejecting suggested

7 mitigation measures and comments on significant environmental issues. "Conclusory statements

8 unsupported by factual information" are not an adequate response. (Id. at § 15088(b), (c).)

9 83. A lead agency cannot certify an EIR and approve a project with significant
10 environmental effects unless the agency makes a series of detailed findings. These include findings that

11 changes or alterations have been required that mitigate or avoid the project's significant effects on the

12 environment, or that specific considerations render the mitigation measures or alternatives "infeasible"

13 but that the benefits of the project nonetheless outweigh the project's significant environmental effects.

14 Additionally, a lead agency may not approve a Project that would result in environmental impacts that

15 would conflict with a local a agency's existing conservation plans or policies. North Coast Rivers

16 Alliance V. Marin Municipal Water Dist. Bd. of Directors (2013) 216 Cal.App.4th 614, 631. Lastly, the

17 lead agency's findings must be supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record. (Pub.

18 Resources Code, § 21081; Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15091-15093.)

19 84. Substantial evidence in the administrative record must support every one of a lead
20 agency's findings and conclusions, including those findings and conclusions contained in the EIR. The

21 administrative record must also contain an explanation for the analytical route the lead agency followed

22 from evidence to conclusion.

23 85. Noncompliance with the requirements outlined above constitutes a prejudicial abuse of

24 discretion under Public Resources Code sections 21168 and 21168.5, regardless of whether a different

25 outcome would have resulted if the lead agency had complied with those requirements in the first place.

26 (Pub. Res. Code, § 21005.) Abuse of discretion is established if the agency has not proceeded in a

27 manner required by law or if the agency's determination or decision is not supported by substantial

28 evidence in the administrative record. (Pub. Res. Code, §§ 21168, 21168.5.)

15
Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

86. A court may limit the scope of its orders made pursuant to a finding of noncompliance

2 under CEQA by ruling only on "that portion of a determination, finding, or decision or the specific

3 project activity or activities found to be in noncompliance." (Pub. Res. Code. § 21168.9(b).) To do so,

4 the court must find that "(1) the portion or specific project activity or activities are severable, (2)

5 severance will not prejudice complete and full compliance with this division, and (3) the court has not

6 found the remainder of the project to be in noncompliance with this division." (Id.)

7 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

8 Violation of CEQA
9 (Public Resources Code § 21000 et seq.)

10 87. Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference the paragraphs set forth above.

11 88. Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by failing to proceed in a manner

12 required by law by certifying an EIR that does not comply with CEQA and by approving the Project

13 based on the inadequate EIR.

14 89. Biological Resources. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze, and/or mitigate the

15 Project's significant direct and cumulative impacts to biological resources, including numerous special-

16 status wildlife species. Those wildlife species include, but are not limited to: Red-tailed hawk, Cooper's

17 hawk, Peregrine falcon, Nutall's woodpecker, Loggerhead shrike, and horned lark. The EIR's

18 biological resources analysis is inadequate because, inter alia, the EIR:

19 a. fails to include and fully analyze all biological resources impacts resulting from the Project;

20 b. relies on mitigation measures that are vague, ineffective, deferred, and/or unenforceable;

21 c. fails to incorporate all feasible mitigation or avoidance measures; and

22 d. fails to adequately disclose, analyze and/or mitigate the direct, indirect, and cumulative

23 impacts of the Project on other biological resources, including cumulative impacts to wildlifel

24 movement.

25 90. Greenhouse Gases. The EIR fails to disclose analyze and/or mitigate the Project's

26 significant direct, indirect, and cumulative greenhouse gas impacts. The EIR's analysis of greenhouse

27 gas impacts is inadequate because, inter alia, the EIR:

28 a. fails to include and fully analyze all greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the Project;

16
Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

b. fails to support its selection of thresholds of significance with substantial evidence in the

2 record;

C. relies on greenhouse gas mitigation measures that are vague, ineffective, deferred, and/or

4 unenforceable; and

5 d. fails to incorporate all feasible mitigation and avoidance measures.

6 91. Energy. The EIR fails to adequately analyze the Project's energy impacts or consider
7 implementation of feasible renewable energy options. Instead, it merely points to planned compliance

8 with Title 24. The EIR violates CEQA because it fails to analyze and consider the use of available
renewable energy sources to supply power to the Project.

10 92. Human Health. The EIR fails to quantify or mitigate the risk to human health from

11 the Project's DPM emissions. The EIR violates CEQA by failing to disclose or analyze the

12 correlation between the Project's significant adverse air quality impacts and the resulting

13 adverse health impacts that will follow--and by failing to offer any mitigation measures to

14 reduce the extent of such impacts.

15 93. Water Resources. The EIR fails to accurately describe the Project's future water use and

16 provides inadequate mitigation of significant adverse impacts to the local and regional water supply. The

17 EIR's assertion that the Project will not negatively impact water resources is not supported by

18 substantial evidence. Additionally, the EIR violates CEQA because it impermissibly permits

19 Respondents to plan future water uses that would conflict with the City's existing commitments under
20 the regional Groundwater Sustainability Plan.

21 94. Agricultural Resources. The EIR fails to adequately address the Project's significant

22 adverse impacts on agricultural resources. The EIR's proposed mitigation to reduce these impacts has

23 been expressly disapproved by the Courts as inadequate under CEQA. Furthermore, the EIR's assertion

24 that the Project's agricultural impacts will be less than significant with mitigation is not supported by

25 substantial evidence.

26 95. Responses to Comments. The responses to comments in the Final EIR fail to adequately

27 respond to comments from the public, experts, and agencies. The Final EIR's responses to comments

28 violates CEQA because the responses do not specifically explain the reasons for rejecting suggestions

17
Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

received in comments, supported with specific references to empirical information, scientific authority,

2 and/or explanatory information.

3 96. Failure to Adopt Feasible Mitigation Measures. The EIR fails to implement all

4 feasible mitigation measures to reduce the Project's significant and unavoidable air quality and

5 greenhouse gas impacts. The EIR's explanation for its decision to not adopt all feasible mitigation

6 measures related to these impacts lacks any substantial evidence.

7 97. Inadequate Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations. Respondents

8 failed to adopt legally adequate Findings of Fact and Statement of Overriding Considerations. The
Findings of Fact are not each supported by substantial evidence, they do not explain the analytic route

10 taken by Respondents from facts to conclusions. The Statement of Overriding Considerations is also not

11 supported by substantial evidence, and the Project benefits listed in the Statement of Considerations are

12 not outweighed by the Project's significant impacts.

13 98. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion and

14 adoption of the EIR and associated approvals should be set aside.

15 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

16 WHEREFORE, Petitioners respectfully request the following relief and entry of judgment as

17 follows:

18 1. For a stay of Respondents' decisions approving industrial land uses within the Zacharias

19 Ranch Development Area pending trial;

20 2. For a peremptory writ of mandate directing:

21 a. Respondents to prepare, circulate, and consider a supplemental EIR to address all
22 CEQA violations related to the approval of industrial land uses within the

23 Zacharias Ranch Development Area; and

24 b. Respondents and Real Party in Interest to suspend all construction activity

25 related to industrial development within the Zacharias Ranch Development Area;

26 3. For a declaration that Respondents' actions certifying those portions of the EIR which

27 pertain to industrial development within the Zacharias Ranch Development Area

28 violated CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines; and declaring invalid any sections of the

18
Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

2 certified EIR, as well as any related Project approvals, related to industrial development
within the Zacharias Ranch Development Area.

4.

p For an order awarding Petitioner's attorneys' fees under Code of Civil Procedure section

5. 1021.5, Government Code section 800, and other applicable authority;
For costs of suit; and

6 6.

7 For such other and further relief as the court deems just and proper.
