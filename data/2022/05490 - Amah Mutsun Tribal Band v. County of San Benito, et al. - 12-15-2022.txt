1 INTRODUCTION

2 1. This action challenges the November 8, 2022 decision of the County of San Benito and
3 its Board of Supervisors (collectively, "County" or "Respondents") to approve the Betabel Commercial

4 Development Conditional Use Permit Project ("Project" or "Betabel Project") proposed by Real Parties
5 in Interest, the Thomas John McDowell and Victoria McDowell Charitable Remainder Unitrust, Henry
6 Ruhnke, Thomas John McDowell, and Victoria Knight McDowell (in their capacity as Trustees and/or
7 representatives of the Trust) (*McDowell Charitable Trust" or "Real Party"). The Project, as approved
8 by the County, authorizes the development of a 108,425 square-foot commercial roadside attraction at
9 9644 Betabel Road, in unincorporated San Benito County. The Project is located on the ancestral lands
10 of Petitioner, the Amah Mutsun Tribal Band ("Amah Mutsun" or "Tribe"). These lands hold tremendous
11 cultural, spiritual, and historical significance to the Amah Mutsun and contain invaluable tribal cultural
12 resources that will be irreparably harmed by the Project.

13 2. In approving the Project, the County violated numerous state and local laws, including

14 the California Environmental Quality Act (*CEQA"), Public Resources Code sections 21000 et seq.
15 (including its provisions intended to protect tribal cultural resources, known collectively as "AB 52"),

16 the CEQA Guidelines, title 14 California Code of Regulations section 15000 et seq., State Planning and
17 Zoning Law, Government Code section 65000 et seq., and the County's planning requirements. For
18 example, the County's Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") failed to consider the Project's impacts on
19 all of the individual tribal cultural resources located in the Project area. In doing so, the County ignored
20 the unique value and distinct mitigation needs of each of these resources.

21 3. Much of the EIR's inadequacy stems from the County's rushed and incomplete approach,
22  highlighted by its decision to release the Draft EIR before an ethnographie study had properly
23 documented tribal cultural resources at the site. Rather than revising and recirculating the Draft EIR to
24 incorporate new information from the Betabel Ethnographic Study once it was completed, the County
25 continued to rush forward, producing a Final EIR that failed to resolve the Draft EIR's deficiencies.
26 Further, the County failed to engage the Tribe in the kind of meaningful and timely consultation
27 required under CEQA and AB 52. For instance, despite the Tribe's repeated explanations that additional
28 study of tribal cultural resources was necessary before consultation regarding appropriate mitigation
2

Case No.

'1 could take place, the County refused to allow time for this process, instead rigidly adhering to the Real
2 Party's desired timeline. In the end, the County approved a Project that would involve the mass grading

3 and development of areas containing sensitive tribal cultural resources, without considering ways to
4 avoid or mitigate these specific resources.

5 4. The County's failures were not limited, however, to its treatment of tribal cultural

6 resources. Indeed, the EIR contains numerous additional inadequacies. It fails to consider how the
7 Project might impact a critical wildlife corridor connecting the Santa Cruz Mountains, Diablo Range,
8 and Gabilan Range, despite significant efforts of the conservation community to draw attention to these

9 connections. The Project significantly increases vehicle miles traveled and related pollution, while
10 relying on a carbon offset scheme that has been struck down by the California Courts of Appeal to
11 allegedly absolve itself of these impacts. And the County turns a blind eye to both the Project's
12 inconsistency with the County's foundational documents, and those documents' internal inconsistencies.
13 5. For all of these reasons, the County's approval of the Project and certification of the EIR
14 constituted an abuse of discretion and blatant disregard for tribal cultural values, and must be

15 overturned.

16 PARTIES

17 6. Petitioner Amah Mutsun Tribal Band is a legally recognized California Native American
18 Tribe composed of members whose ancestors have lived in the vicinity of the Project since timè
19 immemorial. The Amah Mutsun Tribal Band is comprised of descendants of the Indigenous peoples
20: taken to the missions at San Juan Bautista and Santa Cruz during Spanish colonization of California's

21 Central Coast. The traditional territory of the Amah Mutsun encompasses all or portions of the modern

22 counties of San Benito, Santa Clara, Monterey, and Santa Cruz. Today's Tribe represents the surviving
23 descendant families of 20 distinct historic tribal groups.

24 7. The Tribe and its members have a direct and beneficial interest in Respondents'
25 compliance with laws bearing upon approval of the Project. The Amah Mutsun's belief system and
26 culture are deeply intertwined with the landscape in the Project area. These interests will be directly and
27 adversely affected by the Project, which violates provisions of law as set forth in this Petition, and which
28 would cause substantial harm to the natural environment and the tribal cultural resources located in the

3
Verified Petition For Writ Of Mandate And Complaint For Declaratory And Injunctive Relief
Case No.

vicinity. The maintenance and prosecution of this action will confer a substantial benefit on the public
2 by protecting the public from environmental and other harms alleged herein and by ensuring that the

3 County abides by the procedures required by law in its review of the Project. The Amah Mutsun raised
4 numerous objections during AB 52 consultation and submitted extensive written and oral comments to
5 the County objecting to approval of the Project and certification of the EIR.

6 8. Respondent County of San Benito is, at and at all times herein mentioned was, a political
7 subdivision of the State of California responsible for regulating and controlling land use within the
8 County, including but not limited to implementing and complying with the provisions of State Planning
9 and Zoning Law, the County's General Plan and ordinances, CEQA, and AB 52. The County is the
10 "lead agency" for the purposes of Public Resources Code section 21067, with principal responsibility for

11 conducting environmental review of proposed actions. The County has a duty to comply with CEQA

12 and state law.

13 9. Respondent Board of Supervisors of the County of San Benito is, and at all times herein
14 mentioned was, the duly elected decisionmaking body of Respondent County. As the decisionmaking
15 body, the Board of Supervisors was chargo with responsibilities under CEQA for conducting a proper
16 review of the proposed action's environmental impacts, conducting government-to-government
17 consultation, and granting the various approvals necessary for the Project. The Board also is, and was,
18 responsible for implementing and complying with the provisions of State Planning and Zoning Law, and
19 the County's General Plan and zoning ordinances. The Board and its members are sued here in their

20 official capacities.

21 10. Respondents San Benito County and the San Benito County Board of Supervisors are
22 referred to herein as "County or Respondents.

23 11. The Notice of Determination filed for the Project identifies the Project applicant as Henry
24 Ruhnke/Thomas John McDowell and Victoria Knight McDowell. Trustees. Petitioner thus names
25 Thomas John McDowell and Victoria Knight McDowell as Real Parties in Interest, pursuant to Public
26 Resources Code section 21167.6.5, in their official capacity as Trustees of the Thomas John McDowell

27 and Victoria McDowell Charitable Remainder Unitrust (*McDowell Charitable Trust"). It is unclear
28 from the Notice what Mr. Ruhnke's status is in relation to the Mr. and Ms. McDowell, or to the

4

Case No.

*1 McDowell Charitable Trust. In an abundance of caution, Petitioner therefore names Henry Ruhnke as a

2 Real Party in Interest in his capacity as a representative and/or Trustee of the McDowell Charitable
3 Trust. Petitioner also names the McDowell Charitable Trust as a Real Party in Interest.

4 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

5 12. Pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5 and Public

6 Resources Code sections 21168 and 21168.9, this Court has jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandate to set
7 aside Respondents' decision to certify the Final EIR and approve the Project.

8 13. Venue is proper in this Court because this action challenges acts done by public officers,
9 or failures of those officers, by virtue of their offices, and the causes of action alleged in this petition
10 arose in the County of San Benito.

11 14. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section 21167.5
12 by serving a written notice of Petitioner's intention to commence this action on the County on December
13 8, 2022. A true and correct copy of the written notice and proof of service is attached hereto as Exhibit
14 A.

15 15, Petitioner will comply with the requirements of Public Resources Code section 21167.6
16 by concurrently filing a notice of its election to prepare the record of administrative proceedings related
17 to this action.

18 16. Petitioner will comply with the requirements of Public Resources Code section 21167.7
19 and Code of Civil Procedure section 388 by sending a copy of this Petition to the California Attorney
20 General. A true and correct copy of the letter that will transmit this Petition is attached hereto as Exhibit
21 B.

22 17. Petitioner has performed any and all conditions precedent to filing the instant action and
23 has exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent possible and required by law.
24 Petitioner submitted numerous objections to approval of the Project, the County's inadequate analysis
25 and mitigation of the Project's impacts in the EIR prepared for the Project, and the County's handling of
26 the AB 52 consultation process.

27 18. Respondents have taken final agency actions with respect to adopting the EIR and
28 approving the Project. Respondents have duty to comply with applicable state laws, including but not

5

Case No.

limited to CEQA and AB 52, prior to undertaking the discretionary approvals at issue in this lawsuit.:

2 Petitioner possesses no effective remedy to challenge the approvals at issue in this action other than by

3 means of this lawsuit.

4 19. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law unless

5 this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require the County to set aside its approval of the
6 Project. In the absence of such remedies, the County's approval will remain in effect in violation of state

7 law.

8 20. This Petition is timely filed.
STATEMENT OF FACTS
10 The Project Site

11 21. The Project site is located within the aboriginal homeland of the Mutsun people, who are
12 recognized as being Ohlone people. The descendants of these tribes now make up the Amah Mutsun
13 Tribal Band, whose connection to the Project area has existed since time immemorial. The Tribe's
14 historical connection to the land was disrupted, however, after the arrival of Spanish explorers in the
15 1770's, through genocide, forced displacement, land theft, and the loss of access to important cultural
16 and spiritual sites. Over the course of several decades. the Mutsun-speaking Ohlone people were
17 forcibly incorporated into missions, primarily Mission San Juan Bautista, which was founded in 1797.
18 Amah Mutsun tribal members are lineal descendants of Indigenous people who survived internment at
19 Mission San Juan Bautista and/or Mission Santa Cruz.

20 22. Beginning in the early 1820's, Mexican authority over California resulted in the
21 secularization and privatization of Mission lands. Many Mutsun people returned to their ancestral home
22 during this time, some settling in villages in the vicinity of the Project area. The Amah Mutsun
23 continued to frequent the Project area, particularly the Pajaro River corridor, well into the twentieth
24 century. The landscape, known to the Tribe as Juristac, and the specific and unique tribal cultural
25 resources located therein, continue to play a significant role in Amah Mutsun beliefs and culture.

26 23. Beginning in the mid-19th century, non-Native settlers began utilizing the Project area as
27 an agricultural region populated by farms, dairy and cheese-making operations, and orchards. Betabel
28 Road and the Project take their name from Betabel Station, a railroad station and shipping hub built to

*1 serve the region's agricultural activity, especially sugar beets. U.S. Highway 101 was built just east of
2 the Project site in the early 20th century.

3 24. Despite this development, the Project site has continued to play a critical role in a
4 connecting protected wildlife habitat in the adjacent mountain ranges. The Pajaro and San Benito River
5 corridors are particularly important in allowing movement of mountain lions, bobcats and other

6 mammals from the Santa Cruz Mountains to the Diablo and Gabilan Ranges.

7 The 2035 General Plan Process

8 25. In 2013, during the County's 2035 General Plan development process, representatives

9 from the Tribe met with the County Planning Department and informed the County of the tribal and
10 cultural significance of the area. The Tribe provided County staff with documentation and extensive
11 information, including maps, about culturally significant landscapes and resources within the County,
12 including Juristac, but the County never incorporated this input into the final General Plan or responded
13 to the Tribe's request for additional meetings. It also violated its obligation under SB 18, which requires
14 local governments to engage in formal tribal consultation before adopting or amending a general plan.
15 The County never initiated this SB 18 consultation with the Tribe in its 2035 General Plan process.
16 26. County staff are unable to answer for this failure, asserting that while some documents
17 related to those meetings have been recovered, most of the staff members who were involved no longer
18 work for the County.

19 27. These events, which occurred nearly a decade before the Betabel Project was permitted,
20 paved the way for the Project's current threat to tribal cultural resources. Had the Tribe's concerns been
21 heeded in 2013 and the Juristac landscape properly been placed in a protective land designation in the
22 General Plan, the Project applicant would have been adequately warned of the potential impacts from
23 commercial development. Instead, the site remained unprotected because of the County's failure to
24 incorporate Tribal cultural resource knowledge into its foundational planning documents.

25 The Betabel Produce Stand

26 28. In 2020, the McDowell Charitable Trust sought a building permit for the Betabel
27 Seasonal Produce Stand Project ("Produce Stand") in order to construct a 7,130-square foot
28 development at the Project site that it characterized as a "seasonal farm stand."
7
Verified Petition For Writ Of Mandate And Complaint For Declaratory And Injunctive Relief
Case No.

1 29. Concerned with the significant impact that construction of a building this size would have

2 on this unprotected sacred site. the Tribe first submitted a letter to the County on March 23, 2020,
3 requesting government-to-government consultation regarding the Produce Stand. After months without :

4 response from the County, the Tribe requested the issuance of a stop work order for the Produce Stand

5 on August 17, 2021. The Tribe reiterated the cultural and spiritual significance of the Juristac landscape
6 to the Amah Mutsun and reminded the County of its legal obligations under the County municipal code

7 and General Plan to engage in Tribal consultation and conduct an archacological survey before issuing
8 the permit.

30. In an August 23, 2021 response letter, Assistant County Counsel asserted the County's

10 position that the issuance of a building permit for the Produce Stand Project was a ministerial act, and no
11 survey or consultation was required. Instead, the County assured the Tribe that such activities would be
12 given ample attention once the Real Party submitted an application for the entire Project. Accordingly,
13 the Tribe formally requested in September 2021 that it be authorized to conduct an Integrative Cultural it
14 Resource Survey ("ICRS") at the Project site. The survey, led by a professional archaeologist, would
15 gather data on archaeological resources, traditional cultural places, ethnobiologically significant natural
16 resources, and culturally significant landscape features. Such a survey would help guide needed
17 environmental review and ensure the proper management and protection of cultural resources in the

18 area.

19 31. Despite the Tribe's objections, the Real Party moved forward with construction activities

20 under the Produce Stand permit, including much of the grading that would be necessary for the later
21 Project. After four months without a response from the County or the Real Party regarding the Tribe's
22 request to conduct the ICRS, the Tribe rearticulated its concerns in a January 24, 2022 letter.
23 Meanwhile, the County still had not initiated formal tribal consultation regarding the Betabel site. as
24 requested by the Tribe nearly a year prior.
25 Betabel Project: Environmental Review and Tribal Consultation

26 32. On January 11, 2022, Real Party filed an application for a use permit to develop a
27 108,425 square-foot commercial space, the "Betabel Project." The roadside attraction, which would
28 incorporate the previously permitted Produce Stand and build off its site improvements, would also

$1 include a large gas station, restaurant, convenience store, amusement and "curio" buildings, outdoor

2 event centers, and a three-story motel and banquet hall.

3 33. Representatives from the County, Real Party, and Tribe toured the Project site on April
4 29, 2022. At the tour, the Tribe explained the specific cultural and spiritual significance of the site, and
5 explained the need for an integrative cultural resources survey and ethnographic study to properly

6 document tribal cultural resources and the Project's potential impacts.

7 34. Pursuant to CEQA and AB 52, the County conducted its first consultation meeting with
8 Amah Mutsun on May 31, 2022. At this meeting, the Tribe expressed its concerns about the timing of
9 the Draft EIR and the necessary studies. As the Tribe explained, these studies were necessary to

10 understand and analyze the full scope of the Project's tribal cultural resource impacts and develop
11 possible mitigation measures, and thus would need to be completed before development of the Draft

12 EIR.

13 35. The County and Real Party belatedly agreed to the Tribe's outstanding request for the
14 Tribe to conduct an Integrative Cultural Resource Survey to systematically study areas with potential for
15 indigenous archaeological sites, record culturally significant landscape features, and produce resource
16 maps of the surveyed areas. The Tribe's archaeologist and multiple Amah Mutsun Tribal Stewards
17 conducted the survey in May and June 2022.

18 36. Despite commencement of the ICRS, the County and Real Party also informed the Tribe
19 that they were proceeding with a quick timetable on the Draft EIR. The Tribe asked for a reasonable
20 delay to ensure that information from the ICRS could be included in the Administrative Draft EIR, and
21 reiterated that an ethnographic study was also needed to place the Project site in its cultural and
22 historical context.

23 37. The ICRS uncovered individual artifacts, identified ethnobotanical resources such as
24 plants traditionally used by the Mutsun-speaking Ohlone for a variety of food, medicinal, and
25 ceremonial purposes, and identified the likely location of numerous tribal cultural resources. The survey
26 also offered a number of recommendations to avoid or reduce impacts to Indigenous cultural resources

27 at the site. The Amah Mutsun shared the results of the ICRS with the County and Real Party in a
28 confidential 75-page report on July 8, 2022.

,
Verified Petition For Writ Of Mandate And Complaint For Declaratory And Injunctive Relief
Case No.

1 38. The Tribe also provided feedback on the County's Administrative Draft EIR prior to its
2 public release, pointing out specific information from the draft ICRS Report that needed to be
3 incorporated into the EIR, while noting that the report should not be treated as replacement for an

4 ethnographic study. The Amah Mutsun also expressed concern about the County's approach to tribal

5 cultural resources, which focused only on landscape-level resources. The Tribe reiterated that delaying
6 release of the Draft EIR until after an ethnographic study was necessary to allow the County to identify
7 and analyze the Project's full impacts on tribal cultural resources at the site. The County, however,
8 provided only minimal responsive edits to its Administrative Draft EIR and failed to analyze the
9 Project's impacts to the individual tribal cultural resources identified in the ICRS Report. The County
10 also agreed to conduct an ethnographic study, but refused to delay public release of the Draft EIR to
11 allow time to consider and incorporate the results of that study.

12 39. In subsequent consultation meetings, the Amah Mutsun repeatedly urged the County to
13 delay release of the Draft EIR until after the ethnographic study had been completed and its results
14 incorporated into the DEIR. The Tribe fully cooperated throughout the ethnographic study preparation
15 process, even offering expedited ethnographic interviews.

16 40. The County's accelerated timeline was adhered to in deference to the Real Parties' goal
17 of securing Project approval before the November 8, 2022 election. Contemporaneous with the Betabel
18 environmental review, San Benito voters were considering a local ballot measure, Measure Q, which
19 would have required voter approval for certain rezonings of agricultural, rangeland, or rural land.
20 Concerned that the Project could potentially be affected by Measure Q, if approved, Real Party urged the
21 County to release the Draft EIR in the summer to ensure the public comment period, Final EIR, and
22 County consideration could all occur before the November elections. When the Tribe asked for more
23 time for consultation, the County informed the Tribe that it would instead adhere to the timeline
24 requested by the Real Party.
25 41. On July 22, 2022, the County released the Draft EIR for public comment. As the Tribe
26 had warned. the EIR failed to properly identify and assess the Project's impacts on all of the tribal
27 cultural resources in its vicinity. The DEIR provided equally inadequate mitigation measures. The DEIR
28 focused narrowly on the Juristac Tribal Cultural Landscape (*JTCL"), which had previously been
10
Verified Petition For Writ Of Mandate And Complaint For Declaratory And Injunctive Relief
Case No.

•1  recommended to be listed on the California Register of Historical Resources ("CRHR") and met the
2 definition of a Tribal Cultural Resource ("TCR") for purposes of CEQA. The JTCL spans over 20,000
3 acres, contains the entire Project area, and features numerous individual sites or features. It failed,

4 however, to consider or identify impacts to any individual tribal cultural resources that had been
5 identified in the ICRS Report or during consultation, and subsequently within the Ethnographic Study.

6 42. The Tribe objected to these and numerous other inadequacies in extensive comments on
7 the Draft EIR, submitted September 6, 2022. Specifically, the Tribe provided critical comments on the

8 Draft EIR's treatment of the Project's impacts to biological resources, greenhouse gas emissions, visual

9 resources, noise, water quality and floodplain, as well as on cumulative impacts, alternatives, and the
10 project description and project objectives. The Tribe also explained how the Draft EIR failed to provide
11 adequate mitigation for a number of the significant impacts it identified, including those to tribal cultural
12 resources and biological resources. The Draft EIR further neglected to address the Project's significant
13 conflicts with the County's General Plan's provisions, including those related to floodplains, adequate
14 mitigation for projects on environmentally sensitive lands, renewable solar energy, design review for
15 projects in scenic corridors, and scenic viewsheds.

16 43. Despite the Draft EIR's inadequacies, the Tribe attempted to continued consultation with
17 the County over two additional meetings before Final EIR was released. One topic of discussion was
18 Mitigation Measure 3.15-1d, which proposed the establishment of a tribal cultural resource conservation
19 easement ("Tribal Cultural Easement") to purportedly address impacts to the Juristac Tribal Cultural
20 Landscape. The Tribe, though generally supportive of the use of cultural access easements, found the
21 proposed measure to be vague, underdeveloped, and unduly restrictive. While the easement purported to
22 allow access for stewardship and ceremony, it also prohibited the Tribe from activities necessary to use

23 the site in such a manner, such as ceremonial fire, vehicular access, overnight use, and development of
24| basic potable water infrastructure.

25 44. The Betabel Ethnographic Study ("Ethnographic Study") was finalized in August 2022,
26 just prior to the end of the Draft EIR public comment period. As expected, it confirmed the cultural
27 significance of the Juristac Tribal Cultural Landscape and provided detailed information about the
28 individual cultural sites located within and near the Project site. It determined that five new tribal
11

1 resources, previously identified by the Amah Mutsun in the ICRS Report, were indecd Tribal Culturál

2 Resources eligible for listing in the CRHR and warranting examination under CEQA. These included
c0 Ascensión Solórsano's Historical Period Traditional Plant Gathering Area, the Juristac and Isleta/Islita
4 Village Area, the Sanchez Adobe, the Medicine Man Hill and Layaani Medicine Man Pole Viewshed,
5 and the Mount Pajaro and Sargent Hills viewsheds.

6 45. Collectively, these resources comprise the homes of spiritual figures (including Kuksui, a
7 powerful spiritual leader), sites of important ceremonies (such as the Big Head Dance), and places
8 associated with important Tribal figures such as the culture bearer Ascensión Solórsano. They include
9 the locations of several villages, ceremonial grounds, sacred pools, cultural viewsheds, and riparian
10 areas where traditional food and medicinal plants were gathered. The Ethnographic Study warned that
11 the Projectincluding its grading, excavation, and development of leach fields and fuel tanks-would
12 have direct and adverse impacts to these resources.

13 46. The Ethnographic Study's identification of new Tribal Cultural Resources had legal
14 significance. Sites, features, places, cultural landscapes, and sacred places that are determined eligible

15 for inclusion in the CRHR are Tribal Cultural Resources (*TCRs") under CEQA and must be analyzed.

16 a Pub. Res. Code. § 21074 (a)(1)(A)-(B). As a result of the Ethnographic Study's conclusions regarding

17 the resources' CRHR eligibility, the County was required to consider the Project's potential impacts on
18 each individual Tribal Cultural Resource, rather than just the JTCL in its entirety. To properly address
19 the volume and significance of the new information produced by the Study, the Tribe warned that the
20 County would have had to revise and recirculate the Draft EIR.

21 47. Instead, the County released the Final EIR on September 30, 2022. The Final EIR did not

22  remedy many of the flaws identitied in the Draft ElR and failed to adequately respond to comments on

23 the Draft EIR. As a result, it failed to adequately analyze or mitigate the Project's impacts. It
24 superficially mentioned the Ethnographic Study and listed some of the individual Tribal Cultural
25 Resources as part of the JCTL discussion, but failed to adequately analyze the Project's impacts on each
26 of the newly identified TCRs or to propose mitigation measures or alternatives to address those specific
27 impacts.

28 48. The County nevertheless set the Project for hearing. The Tribe provided additional
12
Verified Petition For Writ Of Mandate And Complaint For Declaratory And Injunctive Relief
Case No.

1 comments, including about the need for recirculation and the inadequacy of the FEIR and the County's
2 proposed findings and statement of overriding consideration. The comments specifically noted that the
3 Final EIR's failure to identify the individual Tribal Cultural Resources as independent resources and to
4 identify the Project's effects on them prevented the public from understanding or commenting on the
5 full extent of the Project's impacts. The related failure to provide mitigation for these impacts to
6 individual TCRs also limited the public's ability to review and comment on the adequacy of this
7 mitigation.

8 49. Despite the Final EIR's glaring inadequacies, on October 12, 2022, the San Benito

9 County Planning Commission certified the Final EIR, adopted the Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting
10 Program, and made findings for the approval of the Betabel Project's conditional use permit. The Tribe

11 filed an appeal on October 24, 2022. Protect San Benito County and the Center for Biological Diversity
12 also filed an appeal, focused on the EIR's inadequate consideration of biological resource impacts.

13 50. Prior to the appeal, the Tribe provided additional comments to the Board, reiterating
14 many of the comments raised in its Draft EIR comment letter. The Tribe explained that, due to the
15 County's inadequate responses to public comments and limited revision to the EIR, nearly all of the
16 document's analytical and procedural flaws were still present in the Final EIR, including the inadequate
17 analysis and mitigation of impacts to Tribal Cultural Resources. The Tribe also documented the
18 inadequacies of the County's consultation efforts, including its expedited timeline, failure to respond to
19 or incorporate critical information, and failure to communicate the results of consultation from County
20 staff to decisionmakers.

21 51. On November 8. the Board of Supervisors denied the appeal, affirmed the Planning
22 Commission's actions, and approved a conditional use permit for the Betabel Project. November 8, 2022
23 was also election day, meaning the County met the Real Party's goal of having the Project approved
24 before Measure Q.

25 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

26 Violation of CEQA

27 Public Resources Code § 21000 et seq.; CEQA Guidelines
28 52. Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in their
13
/erified Petition For Writ Of Mandate And Complaint For Declaratory And Injunctive Relief
Case No.

1 entirety.

2 53. CEQA requires the lead agency for a project with the potential to cause significant
3 environmental impacts to prepare an EIR that complies with the requirements of the statute, including,
4 but not limited to, the requirement to analyze the project's potentially significant environmental impacts.

5 The EIR must provide sufficient environmental analysis such that the decision makers can intelligently
6 consider environmental consequences when acting on the proposed project. Additionally, the EIR must
7 identify feasible mitigation measures to reduce or avoid the project's significant environmental impacts,

8 as well as analyze a reasonable range of alternatives to the project.

9 54. CEQA also mandates that the lead agency adopt all feasible mitigation measures that
10 would reduce or avoid any of the project's significant environmental impacts. If any of the project's
11 significant environmental impacts cannot be mitigated to a less than significant level, then CEQA bars

12 the lead agency from approving a project if a feasible alternative is available that would meet the
13 project's objectives while avoiding or reducing its significant environmental impacts.

14 55. CEQA requires public agencies to analyze the impact of a project on Tribal Cultural
15 Resources. Pub. Res. Code § 21084.2. Tribal Cultural Resources are defined as "[s]ites, features, places,
16 cultural landscapes, sacred places, and objects with cultural value to a California Native American tribe**
17 determined eligible for inclusion in the California Register of Historical Resources or a local register of
18 historical resources. Pub. Res. Code. § 21074 (a)(1)(A)-(B). A § lead agency also has the discretion to
19 identify tribal cultural resources as significant based on their criteria under Section 5024.1(c). Adequate
20 analysis of these resources must incorporate Tribal knowledge.

21 56. CEQA further mandates that a lead agency may approve a project that would have

22  significant, unavoidable environmental impacts only if the agency finds that the project 's benefits

23 outweigh its unavoidable impacts.

24 57. Under CEQA, all the findings required for an agency's approval of a project must be
25 legally adequate and supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record, and CEQA further
26 requires that an agency provide an explanation of how the evidence in the record supports the
27 conclusions the agency has reached.

28 58. CEQA Guidelines require an agency to "recirculate an EIR when significant new
14
Verified Petition For Writ Of Mandate And Complaint For Declaratory And Injunctive Relief
Case No.

1 information is added to the EIR after public notice is given of the availability of the draft EIR for public
2 review." CEQA Guidelines § 15088.5.

3 59. Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law and violated CEQA by
4 certifying an EIR that is inadequate and fails to comply with the requirements of CEQA and the CEQA
5 Guidelines. The inadequacies in the County's analysis include, but are not limited to, the following:

a. Failure to consider the Project's impacts on individual sites or features, within or
near the Project site, that have cultural or archacological significance. The Draft EIR's analysis grouped
individual resources under the umbrella of the Juristac Tribal Cultural Landscape, ignoring the unique
9 value and conditions of at least five other individual sites or features in the Project vicinity. It also failed
10 to consider Tribal Cultural Resource impacts on Sanchez Adobe, a significant archaeological resource
11 dually identified as both a cultural resource and a tribal cultural resource. Remedying this failure would
12 have required revising relevant portions of the EIR to incorporate new information, and recirculating the
13 revised Draft EIR. The County's failure to do so violated CEQA's mandate to analyze all of the
14 Project's impacts.

15 b. Failure to recirculate a revised Draft EIR following the addition of other
16 significant new information, including information about biological resource impacts.

17 C. Failure to incorporate and utilize the Betabel Ethnographic Study in its analysis of
18 Tribal Cultural Resource impacts in a timely and adequate manner.

19 d. Failure to adequately consider impacts to biological resources, climate change,

20 visual resources, noise, water quality, floodplains, land use, and cumulative resources.

21 e, Failure to provide appropriate project objectives that allowed for an adequate
22 consideration of Project alternatives.

23 60. Respondents violated CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines because they did not identify and
24 adopt feasible mitigation measures that would adequately reduce or avoid the Project's significant
25| environmental impacts including, but not limited to, the following:

26 a. Failure to consider mitigation for individual Tribal Cultural Resources.

27 b. Failure to provide adequate mitigation measures for the Sanchez Adobe in
28 recognition of its dual identification as both a cultural resource and a tribal cultural resource.
15
Verified Petition For Writ Of Mandate And Complaint For Declaratory And Injunctive Relief
Case No.

C. Failure to provide adequate mitigation for the Project's impacts to greenhouse' gas
2 emissions, biological resources, cultural resources, and water quality.

3 61. Respondents violated CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines because they failed to follow the
4 statute's procedural requirements, including by failing to adequately support CEQA findings with

5 substantial evidence and to respond to comments.

6 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

7 Violation of AB 52

8 62. Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in their

9 entirety.

10 63. In addition to requiring public agencies to analyze a project's impacts on such Tribal
11 Cultural Resources, AB 52 also mandates that lead agencies undertaking CEQA review consult with
12 California Native American Tribes possessing a traditional and cultural connection to the geographic
13 area of a proposed project. The County failed to comply with AB 52's requirements.

14 64. AB 52 expressly calls for the inclusion of "tribal knowledge about the land and tribal

15 cultural resources at issue" in environmental assessments of projects. AB 52, Section I(5). It also
16 requires that the tribal consultation process be meaningful and timely. Pub. Res. Code § 21080.3.1. In
17 practice, this means that consultation should begin well in advance of an EIR's release and Tribal
18 requests for consultation regarding alternatives to the recommended mitigation measures, significant
19 effects, or the project itself must be honored. Pub. Res. Code § 21080.3.2.

20 65. Furthermore, AB 52 makes specific recommendations for how to best mitigate project

21 impacts and protect tribal cultural resources. Specifically, it requires agencies to avoid damaging
I Impacts to tribal cuitural resources when possible. Pub. Res. Code § 21084.3(b).

23 66. The County failed to take tribal knowledge into consideration in identifying Tribal
24| Cultural Resources in the vicinity of the Project. Evidence such as oral history, elder testimony, and
25 testimony from Tribally-certified archaeologists and experts can support an agency's designation of a
26 resource as a Tribal Cultural Resource. The Amah Mutsun shared such evidence in the Tribally-led
27 ICRS. which included a list of Tribal Cultural Resources, and described them with specificity. The
28 County failed to give this information proper consideration under AB 52 and CEQA. This resulted in the
16
Verified Petition For Writ Of Mandate And Complaint For Declaratory And Injunctive Relief Case No.

1 Draft EIR's failure to analyze and avoid or mitigate for impacts to multiple Tribal Cultural Resources,
2 each with its own distinct resource value.

3 67. The County failed to engage in tribal consultation in meaningful and timely manner. As
4 the Tribe pointed out repeatedly, consultation regarding mitigation measures should have been preceded

5 by the County's identification of Tribal Cultural Resources in and around the Project site. The
6 Ethnographic Study and Integrative Iltural Resource Survey were critical to this identification process,
7 yet the County completed the Draft EIR's Tribal Cultural Resource analysis before the completion of
8 either study. Indeed, the County released the Draft EIR before the Ethnographic Study was complete,

9 and, despite assurances that it would incorporate the results of this study in the Final EIR, it did so only
10 superficially.

11 68. The County violated its mitigatory duties under AB 52 by failing to analyze the Project's
12 impacts on al/ Tribal Cultural Resources. Instead, Respondent's mitigation measures focused on the
13 Juristic Tribal Cultural Landscape as a whole and overly-relied on a tribal cultural easement as a catch-
14 all mitigation measure, despite the distinct impacts and mitigation needs of the individual Tribal Cultural
15 Resources and the inability of the proffered cultural conservation easement to address these issues.
16 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

17 Violation of State Planning and Zoning Laws

18 (Gov. Code § 65000 et seq.)

19 69. Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in their

20  entirety.

21 70. Government Code section 65300 requires the legislative body of each county to adopt a
22 general plan for the physical development of the county. The general plan serves as a charter for future
23 development to which all other land use decisions must conform. DeVita v. County of Napa (1995) 9
24 Cal.4th 763, 773:

25 71. Government Code section 65030.1 directs that decisions about growth "should be guided

26 by an effective planning process, including the local general plan." Government Code section 65300.5
27 requires that the local general plan be "integrated, internally consistent and compatible."

28 72. Because the general plan is the constitution for all future development in a city, any
17
Verified Petition For Writ Of Mandate And Complaint For Declaratory And Injunctive Relief Case No.

1 decision of the city affecting land use and development must be consistent with the general plan.
2 Resource Defense Fund v. County of Santa Cruz (1982) 133 Cal.App.3d 800, 806; Families Unafraid to

3 Uphold Rural El Dorado County v. Board of Supervisors (1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 1332, 1336. It is an
4 abuse of discretion to approve a project that "frustrate[s] the General Plan's goals and policies." Napa

5 Citizens for Honest Gov. v. Napa County (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 342, 379. A project need not present an
6 "outright conflict" with a general plan provision to be considered inconsistent; the determining question
7 is instead whether the project "is compatible with and will not frustrate the General Plan's goals and
8 policies." Napa Citizens, 91 Cal.App.4th at 379.

73. The County violated the requirements of state law by approving a Project that is
10 inconsistent with the requirements of the County's General Plan, Zoning Code, and other planning laws.
11 For example, the Project is inconsistent with policies intended to protect floodplains, environmentally
12 sensitive lands, scenic corridors, and riparian habitat and to encourage energy efficiency.

13 74. The Project also demonstrates that the General Plan is internally inconsistent. The Project
14 is located on property that had been designated "Agricultural Rangeland" under the General Plan, a
15 designation intended to preserve open space and grazing lands, particularly in areas without sewer,
16 water, or drainage. The Project proposes to convert large swaths of agricultural land in an area without
17 municipal sewer or water services and proposes uses that exceed the permitted uses in the Rangeland
18 designation. The site's dual designation as both Rangeland and Commercial Regional also demonstrates
19 internal inconsistency; the two designations serve radically different functions. Finally, the Project is

20 also inconsistent with the Agricultural Rangeland Zoning District. Several of the Project's uses (such as

21 the gas station, restaurant, and commercial shops) are not included in the Zoning District's list of
ionally allowed uses. The County has failed to make the necessary findings to demonstrate that
23 these uses are similar to those already allowed in the designated zoning district.

24 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

25 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for judgment as follows:

26 75. Alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing the County to vacate and set aside
27 its certification of the EIR and Project Approvals;

28 76. Alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing the County to comply with the
18
Verified Petition For Writ Of Mandate And Complaint For Declaratory And Injunctive Relief Case No.

1 requirements of CEQA, AB 52, State Planning and Zoning Law, and the County's General Plan and
2 Zoning Code, and to take any other action as required by Public Resources Code Section 21168.9;

3 77. For a temporary stay, temporary restraining order, and preliminary and permanent
4 injunctions restraining the County and Real Party in Interest and their agents, servants, and employees,

5 and all others acting in concert with the County on their behalf, from taking any action to implement the

6 Project, pending full compliance with the requirements of CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines, State Planning

7 and Zoning Law, and the County General Plan and Zoning Code;

8 78. For a declaration that the County violated its duties under CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines,
.9AB 52, and State Planning and Zoning Law, and the County General Plan and Zoning Code.

10 79. For costs of the suit;

11 80. An order awarding Petitioner its attorneys' fees under Code of Civil Procedure section
12 1021.5, Government Code section 800, and other applicable authority; and

13 81. For such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

Re: Notice of Commencement of CEQA Litigation

Dear Ms. Delgado:
This letter is to notify you that the Amah Mutsun Tribal Band will file suit against the County of San Benito and its Board of Supervisors for failure to observe the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code

15000 et seq., State Planning and Zoning Law, the County's General Plan, and AB 52 (Gatto) in approving the Betabel Commercial Conditional Use Permit PLN 210054 proposed by The Thomas John McDowell and Victoria McDowell Charitable Unitrust, Henry Ruhnke, in his capacity as Representative and/or Trustee of the Thomas John McDowell and Victoria McDowell Charitable Remainder Unitrust; Thomas John
McDowell, in his capacity as Trustee of the Thomas John McDowell and Victoria
McDowell Charitable Remainder Unitrust; and Victoria McDowell, in her capacity as Trustee of the Thomas John McDowell and Victoria McDowell Charitable Remainder
Unitrust.

Pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.6, the record of
proceedings for the County's actions includes, among other items, all "internal agency communications, including staff notes and memoranda related to the project or to compliance with [CEQA]." Because all e-mails and other internal communications related to the Project are part of the administrative record for the lawsuit to be filed by the Amah Mutsun Tribal Band, the County may not destroy or delete such documents prior to preparation of the record in this case.
