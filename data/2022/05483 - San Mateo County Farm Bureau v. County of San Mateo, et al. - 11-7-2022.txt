RE: Notice to Attorney General of Commencement of Action against the
County of San Mateo

To the Attorney General of the State of California:
Please take notice, under Public Resources Code section 21167.7 and Code of
Civil Procedure section 388, that on October 27, 2022, San Mateo County Farm Bureau (*Petitioner") filed a petition for writ of mandate under the provisions of the California
Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code section 21000 et seq. ("CEQA"),
against the County of San Mateo ("County"). The petition challenges the County's September 13, 2022, approval of a Coastal Development Permit, Planned Agricultural District Permit, Certificates of Compliance (Type B), Lot Line Adjustment, and the rescission and replacement of Williamson Act contracts at the Johnston Ranch property ("Project"). The Notice of Exemption on the Project was filed on September 23, 2022. The lawsuit is based on violations of CEQA, the San Mateo County General Plan, and the California Coastal Act, as discussed more fully in the Project's administrative and environmental review proceedings. The exact nature of the allegations and relief sought is described in the Petition and is attached to this notice as Exhibit 1.

Very truly yours,

INTRODUCTION

2 1. SAN MATEO COUNTY FARM BUREAU ("Farm Bureau" or "Petitioner")

3 petitions this Court for a Writ of Mandate (*Petition"), directed to COUNTY OF SAN MATEO

4 (the "County" or "Respondent") and Real Parties in Interest MIDPENINSULA REGIONAL

5 OPEN SPACE DISTRICT ("MidPen") and PENINSULA OPEN SPACE TRUST ("POST")

6 (collectively "Real Parties"). Petitioner challenges the County's September 13, 2022, approval
7 of a Coastal Development Permit, Planned Agricultural District Permit, Certificates of

8 Compliance (Type B), Lot Line Adjustment, and the rescission and replacement of Williamson
9 Act contracts at the Johnston Ranch property (collectively "Johnston Ranch Project" or

10 "project").

11 2. In approving these entitlements, the County prejudicially abused its discretion and
12 failed to proceed in a manner required by law, including but not limited to its failure to comply

13 with the substantive and procedural mandates of the California Environmental Quality Act (Pub.
14 Resources Code, § 21000 et seq. ["CEQA"]; see also Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15000 et seq.
15 ['CEQA Guidelines"]), the San Mateo County General Plan, the Coastal Act (Pub. Resources
16 Code, § 30000 et seq.) and other applicable regulations and policies.

17 3. The County avoided proper environmental review in its approval of the Johnston
18 Ranch Project. In approving this project, the County, acting as the lead agency, relied on
19 categorical exemptions from CEQA. However, these exemptions are either inapplicable, do not
20 cover the entire project, or cannot be relied upon due to unusual circumstances that could create
21 environmental impacts.

22 4. Because the County's approval of the project violates the requirements of CEQA,
23 the San Mateo County General Plan, and the Coastal Act, the approvals must be overturned.
24 Therefore, Petitioner request that the Court direct the County to set aside all project approvals,
25 including the September 23, 2022, Notice of Exemption (NOE").
26 PARTIES

27 5. Petitioner SAN MATEO COUNTY FARM BUREAU is a non-profit organization
28 dedicated to promoting and preserving farming in San Mateo County. Its membership consists

3 BACKGROUND FACTS

4 11.

5 Johnston Ranch is an 868-acre property and is owned by POST. Johnston Ranch is

6 located east of the town of Half Moon Bay in San Mateo County, within the Coastside
Protection Area. Currently, there are eight parcels within the 868-acre area.

7 12.

8 The project would merge two of these parcels resulting in a total of six parcels
spanning the 868 acres. Additionally, there was a request to reconfigure, via a Lot Line a
9 Adjustment ("LLA"), four of the six newly merged parcels, which would result in POST owning
10 approximately 224 acres of "agricultural property" and MidPen owning 644 acres of "upland
11 property."

12 13.

13 The Johnston Ranch Project includes the legalization of three parcels, the

14 reconfiguration of four parcels, and the rescission of Williamson Act contracts and replacement
with Farm Land Security Zone contracts and Open Space Easements.
15 14.

16 This complete reconfiguration of parcels was approved under the guise of an LLA,

17 however, the reconfiguration results in large changes to all of the parcels within the ranch. (See

18 Exhibit A [maps depicting changes in parcels].) The proposed reconfiguration is as follows:
15. Parcel 1 would change from 48.8 acres to 93 acres.

19 16. Parcel 2 would change from 250.55 acres to 434 acres.
20 17.

21 Parcel 3 would change from 183.39 acres to 7 acres. 7
18. Parcel 4 would change from 161.26 acres to 110 acres.

22 19.

23 The fifth and sixth parcels are not included in the reconfiguration but account for
the remaining 224 acres.

24 20.

25 All of the parcels are covered by either an Agricultural Land Conservation Act

26 Williamson Act contract ('Land Conservation contract") or a Farmland Security Zone

27 Williamson Act contract ("FSZ contract"). In total, 434 acres of land currently under some type

28 of Williamson Act contract would be replaced with either a 10- or 20-year Open Space
Easement ("OSE"). The other 210 acres would be placed into two separate FSZ contracts.

21. On May 25, 2022, the San Mateo County Planning Commission approved the

2 Johnston Ranch Project.

3 22. On June 8, 2022, the Farm Bureau appealed this decision to the San Mateo County

4 Board of Supervisors (*Board"). The Board heard the item at its September 13, 2022 meeting.

5 The Board denied the Farm Bureau's appeal and approved the Johnston Ranch Project.

6 23. On September 28, 2022, the County notified the California Coastal Commission of

7 its approval. On October 12, 2022, within the statutory timeframe, the Farm Bureau submitted

8 an appeal to the California Coastal Commission regarding the Board's approval of the Johnston

9 Ranch Project.

10 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

11 24. This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this Petition pursuant to
12 Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5, and Public Resources Code sections 21168

13 and 21168.5.

14 25. Venue for this action properly lies in the Superior Court for the County of San
15 Mateo pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 394.

16 26. The Petition was timely filed in accordance with Public Resources Code section
17 21167, subdivision (d). The County filed its NOE for the Johnston Ranch Project on September
18 23, 2022, thereby commencing a 35-day statute of limitations.

19 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

20 27. Petitioner has exhausted administrative remedies to the extent required by law.
21 Petitioner has performed all conditions precedent to this filing and participated in the
22 administrative process. Petitioner's members actively participated in the administrative process
23 leading up to the County's approval of the project and stated their objections to the County's
24 actions. (See Pub. Resources Code, § 21177, subd. (b).)

25 28. Respondent has taken final agency actions with respect to approving the project.
26 The County has a mandatory duty to comply with all state and federal laws, including but not
27 limited to CEQA, the San Mateo County General Plan, and the Coastal Act, prior to undertaking
28 the discretionary actions at issue in this lawsuit.

MESERVE 5

CORPORATION Petition for Writ of Mandate; Election to Prepare Record of Proceedings

STANDING

2 29. Petitioner has standing to assert the claims raised in this Petition because its

3 members include residents of the County of San Mateo and have personal, health, safety,

4 community, and environmental interests that are directly and adversely affected by the County's

5 approval of the project. As an association composed of people who live and work within the

6 County, Petitioner is within the class of persons beneficially interested in, and aggrieved by, the

7 acts of Respondent as alleged below. Petitioner has personal, health, safety, and property

8 interests that will be adversely affected if the project is implemented based on unlawful

9 considerations and without proper analysis and mitigation of its environmental impacts.
10 30. Petitioner has a substantial interest in ensuring the Project's impacts are fully
11 mitigated. Unless the relief requested herein is granted, Petitioner members' health and safety,
12 environmental, and community interests will be adversely affected and injured by Respondent's
13 failure to comply with CEQA and other applicable laws in approving the project. The County's
14 approval of the Lot Line Adjustment is also a matter of public interest.
15 31. Petitioner is an "aggrieved person" within the meaning of Public Resources Code
16 sections 21177 and 30801. Petitioner participated by submitting comments on and objections to
17 the Johnston Ranch Project.

18 IRREPARABLE HARM

19 32. The County's failures, set forth in this Petition, constitute a prejudicial abuse of
20 discretion within the meaning of the Code of Civil Procedure and CEQA. (See Code Civ. Proc.,

21 §§ 1085, 1094.5; Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21168, 21168.5.)

22 33. Petitioner possesses no other remedy than to challenge the County's abuse of
23 discretion other than by means of this lawsuit. If the County's actions concerning the project are
24 effectuated, Petitioner, its members and their health, the residents of the County, and the
25 environment will be irreparably harmed. No money damages could adequately compensate for

26 that harm.

1 NOTICE OF CEQA SUIT

2 34. Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.5 in serving

3 notice of this action to the County on October 27, 2022. (See Exhibit B, Notice of

4 Commencement of Action against the County.)

5 ELECTION TO PREPARE RECORD

6 35. Petitioner elects to prepare the administrative record in this proceeding pursuant to
7 Public Resources Code section 21167.5, subdivision (b)(2), and any other applicable laws.

8 PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL DOCTRINE

9 36. Petitioner brings this action as a private attorney general pursuant to California
10 Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5. and any other applicable legal theory, to enforce

11 important rights affecting the public interest.

12 37. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will confer significant benefits on

13 the general public by enforcing the environmentally protective mandates of CEQA, which are

14 important rights affecting the public interest. The necessity and financial burden of enforcement
15 are such as to make an award of attorneys' fees appropriate in this proceeding. Petitioner will
16 serve a copy of the Petition on the Attorney General's office to give notice of Petitioner's intent
17 to bring this proceeding as a private attorney a general under Code of Civil Procedure section

18 1021.5.

19 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

20 Violation of CEQA (Pub. Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.)
21 38. Petitioner incorporates by reference each and every allegation contained in

22 Paragraphs 1 through 37 as though fully set forth herein.
23 39. CEQA applies to "discretionary projects proposed to be carried out or approved"
24 by public agencies, such as Respondent. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21080, subd. (a).) A CEQA §

25 "project" means "the whole of an action, which has a potential for resulting in either a direct

26 physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change" in the
27 environment. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15378, subd. (a).) The term "project" refers to "the activity

28

SOLURI
MESERVE 7
A LAW
CORPORATION Petition for Writ of Mandate; Election to Prepare Record of Proceedings

-

2 which is being approved and which may be subject to several discretionary approvals by
governmental agencies." (CEQA § Guidelines, § 15378, subd. (d).)

3 40.

4 A public agency renders an "approval" under CEQA when it "commits the agency

5 to a definite course of action in regard to a project intended to be carried out by any person."

6 (CEQA Guidelines, § 15352.) Environmental review must occur "before a project is approved,"

7 because CEQA eschews "postapproval environmental review" and does not allow for "post hoc

8 rationalizations" to support action already taken." (Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. V. Regents
of Univ. of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 395.)

9 41.

10 The County's filing of the NOE for the Johnston Ranch Project indicates that the

11 County considered it a discretionary project requiring prior CEQA review in the absence of an

12 applicable exemption. In the NOE, the County identified and described the Johnston Ranch

13 Project, and listed itself as the agency approving the project. However, the County did not

14 perform environmental review for the Johnston Ranch Project pursuant to CEQA. Instead, the

15 County found the Johnston Ranch Project exempt from CEQA review pursuant to categorical

16 exemptions found in CEQA Guidelines sections 15305 (Class 5, "Minor Alterations to Land

17 Use Limitations") and 15317 (Class 17, "Open Space Contracts or Easements"). By relying on

18 these exemptions, the County failed to proceed in a manner required by law.

42.

19 The County's reliance on a Class 5 CEQA exemption is misplaced. "Class 5
consists of minor alterations in land use limitations in areas with an average slope of less than
20 |20%, which do not result in any changes in land use or density, including but not limited to: (a)
21

22 Minor lot line adjustments, side yard, and set back variances not resulting in the creation of any

23 new parcel." (CEQA Guidelines, § 15305 [italics added].) Several aspects of the project conflict
with this exemption.

24 43.

25 The Class 5 exemption cannot be used if there are any changes in land use. One of

26 the purposes of the project is to encourage low-intensity recreation. (See Exhibit A [map

27 depicting potential trail routes].) This is a change in land use from agriculture to recreation.

28 Further, much of the land will be shifted from agriculture to open space. These changes in land
use make the exemption inapplicable.

SOLURI
MESERVE
A LAW 8

CORPORATION Petition for Writ of Mandate; Election to Prepare Record of Proceedings

1 44. Similarly, the Class 5 exemption cannot be relied upon if there are any changes in

2 density. Here, Parcel 1 has one density credit, however, after the LLA, Parcel 1 would have two

3 density credits. Parcel 3 currently has two density credits but would be reduced to one after the

4 reconfiguration. Thus, there are multiple changes in density. For this reason, the County cannot

5 rely on this exemption.

6 45. Additionally, the average slope across all the parcels combined is 18.5 percent,

7 however, Parcel 2, which makes up two-thirds of the project's acreage has an average slope of

8 24.5 percent. To the extent the parcels meet the other requirements in CEQA Guidelines section

9 15305, the reconfiguration of Parcel 2 cannot rely on the Class 5 exemption due to its excessive
10 slope. Similar to the shortcomings of the Class 17 exemption, this exemption would not cover

11 all parcels, therefore the entire project cannot rely on this exemption.

12 46. The County also relied on a Class 17 categorical exemption. This is a categorical

13 exemption for "the establishment of agricultural preserves, the making and renewing of open
14 space contracts under the Williamson Act, or the acceptance of easements or fee interests in
15 order to maintain the open space character of the area. The cancellation of such preserves,
16 contracts interests, or easements is not included and will normally be an action subject to the
17 CEQA process." (CEQA Guidelines, § 15317.)

18 47. The project includes several rescissions of Williamson Act contracts and

19 replacement with 10- or 20-year Open Space Easements. Further, one Williamson Act contract

20 is not being renewed. This is not the type of activity covered by the Class 17 exemption.
21 48. Last, there are important exceptions to reliance on categorical exemptions. "A
22 categorical exemption shall not be used for an activity where there is a reasonable possibility
23 that the activity will have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances."
24 (CEQA Guidelines, § 15300.2, subd. (c).) "A party invoking the exception to categorical
25 exemptions may establish unusual circumstance without evidence of an environmental effect, by

26 showing that the project has some feature that distinguishes it from others in the exempt class,
27 such as its size or location. In such a case, to render the exception applicable, the party need
28

SOLURI
MESERVE 9
A LAW
CORPORATION Petition for Writ of Mandate; Election to Prepare Record of Proceedings

p only show a reasonable possibility of a significant effect due to that unusual circumstance."

2 (Berkeley Hillside Preservation v. City of Berkeley (2015) 60 Cal.4th 1086, 1105.)

3 49. Here, both the size and location make this project unusual compared to others in

4 the exempt class. The reconfiguration of this area is not a "minor lot line adjustment, side yard,

5 and set back variances[.]" (CEQA Guidelines, § 15305, subd. (a).) The project results in

6 hundreds of acres of rearranged parcel boundaries in a coastal area that contains prime

7 agricultural land. This reconfiguration cuts off areas of prime agricultural land from adjacent

8 prime agricultural lands and replaces lands currently covered by Williamson Act contracts with

9 10- or 20-year Open Space Easements. Further, these large changes in acreage create parcels

10 that are completely different in size and shape. (See Exhibit A.)

11 50. These unusual circumstances also apply to the Class 17 exemption. Importantly,

12 the land is already subject to Williamson Act contracts and its agricultural uses are already

13 protected. These are unusual circumstances compared to the types of projects listed as examples
14 in CEQA Guidelines section 15317, which exempts certain projects establishing or renewing
15 Williamson Act contracts. Notably, the project does not include imposition of permanent
16 conservation easements to protect agriculture. Instead, the County staff report refers to an
17 unenforceable intent of POST to eventually place permanent easements on the land once the

18 land is sold.

19 51. The changes to land use, boundaries, and legal protections on these parcels
20 without any permanent protection of agricultural uses would result in both direct and cumulative
21 impacts to agriculture. It is reasonably foreseeable that the conversion of agricultural land to

22 low-intensity recreation land would negatively impact agriculture at the Johnston Ranch.
23 Further, considering these impacts alongside other regional projects, the cumulative impacts to

24 agriculture are significant.

25 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
Violation of San Mateo County General Plan 26 (Code Civ. Proc., § 1094.5; Gov. Code, § 65000 et seq.)
27 52. Petitioner incorporates by reference each and every allegation contained in
28 Paragraphs 1 through 51 as though fully set forth herein.

SOLURI 10 MESERVE
A LAW
CORPORATION Petition for Writ of Mandate; Election to Prepare Record of Proceedings

1 53. A Court's inquiry into the validity of an administrative decision extends to

2 whether there was a prejudicial abuse of discretion and whether the agency committed any

3 errors of law. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1094.5, subd. (b).)

4 54. Consistency with the County's General Plan relies on proper implementation of

5 the County's Zoning Code. (See Gov. Code, § 65860.)

6 55. An agency fails to a proceed in a manner required by law when it relies on incorrect

7 legal information and misapplies governing legal authority for a land use decision. (William S.

8 Hart Union High School Dist. v. Regional Planning Com. (1991) 226 Cal.App.3d 1612, 1627.)

9 56. The project site is designated Agricultural on the County's General Plan Land Use
10 designation and is zoned Planned Agricultural District (*PAD")/Coastal Development District.

11 57. The County abused its discretion in finding that the project conformed with the
12 County's adopted General Plan and Zoning Code.

13 58. The project is inconsistent with the County's General Plan goals and policies,
14 including but not limited to, protecting and enhancing productive soil resources for agriculture,
15 buffer existing agricultural activities from adjacent recreational use, creating or maintaining
16 agricultural parcels to ensure existing agricultural productivity is not diminished, and apply
17 methods such as easements, contracts, and deed restriction to assist in the retention and

18 expansion of agricultural activities. (See San Mateo County General Plan Policies 9.4, 9.23(b),
19 9.29, 9.31.) The project does not provide protections for sustained or expanded agricultural
20 operations at the Johnston Ranch property.
21 59. The project also conflicts with the PAD zoning regulations. An applicant must
22 obtain a Planned Agricultural Permit, to pursue uses other than agricultural. (San Mateo County
23 Zoning Code, § 6353.) In order to obtain a permit an applicant must "provide factual evidence
24 which demonstrates that any proposed land division or conversion of land from an agricultural
25 use will result in uses which are consistent with the purpose of the [PAD], as set forth in Section

26 6350." (Id. at § 6355.) The first purpose of PAD is to "preserve and foster existing and potential
27 agricultural operations in San Mateo County in order to keep the maximum amount of prime
28 agricultural land and all other lands suitable for agriculture in agricultural production." (Id. at §

SOLURI
MESERVE 11
4 LAW
CORPORATION Petition for Writ of Mandate; Election to Prepare Record of Proceedings

1 6350.) This requisite factual evidence was not provided in support of the project. In fact, the
2 evidence provided shows that the permit would not preserve and foster agriculture and would

3 not keep the maximum amount of prime agricultural land in production. Therefore, the County's
4 approval of the permit was an abuse of discretion.

5 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

6 (Violation of the Coastal Act, Pub. Resources Code, § 30000 et seq.)
7 60. Petitioners incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained in
8 Paragraphs 1 through 59 as though fully set forth herein.
9 61. The County failed to proceed in a manner required by the Coastal Act when it
10 improperly approved the Coastal Development Permit ("CDP") for the legalization of parcels.
11 The County failed to consider or mitigate the CDP's impacts on agricultural lands in the County.
12 62. The County found that the legalization would not have any substantial adverse
13 impacts on coastal resources; however, the legalization of parcels allowed the County to also
14 approve the reconfiguration of the parcels. These actions conflict with Public Resources Code

15 section 30241, which states, "the maximum amount of prime agricultural land shall be
16 maintained in agricultural production to assure the protection of the areas' agricultural economy,
17 and conflicts shall be minimized between agricultural and urban land uses[.]" Yet, the project
18 fails to protect the "maximum amount of prime agriculture" in the area.
19 PRAYER

RE: Notice of Commencement of Action against the
County of San Mateo

Dear Mr. Church:

Please take notice, under Public Resources Code section 21167.5, that Petitioner San Mateo County Farm Bureau intends to file a petition for writ of mandate under the provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code section 21000 et seq. ("CEQA"), against the County of San Mateo ("County"). The petition challenges the County's September 13, 2022, approval of a Coastal Development Permit, Planned Agricultural District Permit, Certificates of Compliance (Type B), Lot Line Adjustment, and the rescission and replacement of Williamson Act contracts at the Johnston Ranch property (*Project"). The Notice of Exemption on the Project was filed on September 23, 2022. The lawsuit will be based on violations of CEQA, the San Mateo County General Plan, and the California Coastal Act, as discussed more fully in the Project's administrative and environmental review proceedings. The exact nature of
the allegations and relief sought is described in the Petition for Writ of Mandate that Petitioner plans to file on October 27, 2022.

Very truly yours,
