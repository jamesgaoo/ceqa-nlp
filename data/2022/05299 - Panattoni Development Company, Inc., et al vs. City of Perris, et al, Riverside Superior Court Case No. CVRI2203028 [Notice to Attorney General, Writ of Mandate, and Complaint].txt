Exhibit "A," Page 4

1 INTRODUCTION

2 1. Petitioners bring this action, on their own behalf and on behalf of the general public
3 and in the public interest, for judicial review and invalidation of the unlawful actions,
4 determinations, decisions, and approvals made by the Respondents, including the Respondents'

5 determinations on or about June 14, 2022, relating to the removal, diversion, and alteration of several
6 truck routes within the southern portion of the City of Perris, and along the border of the City of
7 Menifee, including (but not limited to) the de-designation of a portion of Ethanac Road as a
8 previously-designated truck route.

9 2. Respondents' arbitrary and unauthorized actions, and deliberate disregard of the
10 applicable requirements of the California Constitution, California Environmental Quality Act
11 ("CEQA"), the California Vehicle Code, the California Planning and Zoning Law, and other
12 applicable state and local laws and policies, result in significant changes to regional transportation
13 and logistics, traffic circulation, regional land use and transportation planning and public
14 infrastructure investments, vehicular emissions, vehicle miles traveled, supply-chain efficiency,
15 regional air quality, public health, safety, and welfare of the City of Perris and the surrounding
16 communities, as well as significant harm to Petitioners and others and adverse environmental
17 impacts and other harm to the environment and regional welfare.

18 3. The disputed actions and approvals include the Respondents' approval of General
19 Plan Amendment No. GPA 22-05068 and Ordinance Amendment No. OA22-05069, which were
20 approved, on or about June 14, 2022, by Respondents' adoption of Resolution No. 6008 and
21 Ordinance No. 1418, respectively, as well as Respondents' adoption of a "naked negative
22 declaration" ostensibly under CEQA (collectively the "Approvals"), which include Respondents'
23 unjustified determination that those actions could not have an impact on the environment, and the
24 adoption of a negative declaration under CEQA. Through these amendments and Approvals, the
25 Respondents purported to re-arrange the established system of designated truck routes throughout
26 the City of Perris, and along the border with the City of Menifee, and the surrounding region, in a
27 transparent attempt to divert and displace truck traffic and the resulting impacts to other areas within
28 the City and the surrounding communities, without regard to the rights and interests of the

attorneys at law 2545/020858-0062 -2-

18016368.9 a07/15/22 COMPLAINT

Exhibit "A," Page 5

1 Petitioners, and many others in the neighboring communities or the public at large. The Approvals
2 and the resulting amendments along with the resulting modifications to the truck routes are
3 hereinafter referred to as the "Project".

4 4. Petitioners seek relief from Respondents' hasty, ill-considered, and unlawful actions,

5 including the Respondents' failure to comply with the California Constitution, the State Vehicle

6 Code and CEQA, and request that the Approvals be declared void and invalid, and that Respondents

7 be mandated to set aside the Approvals and be permanently enjoined from taking any further action

8 in furtherance of, or in implementation of, the Approvals.

9 5. Petitioners also seek immediate issuance of temporary and preliminary injunctive
10 relief and an alternative writ of mandate enjoining Respondents from taking any further action in
11 furtherance of, or in implementation of, the Approvals unless and until the Respondents first rescind
12 their unlawful actions and approvals, and fully comply with the applicable requirements of state and
13 local law, including but not limited to, CEQA, and comply with the writs or orders of this Court.

14 6. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereon allege, that the disputed Approvals
15 create inconsistencies and conflicts with the City's General Plan and other land use and
16 transportation plans, and were adopted hastily, arbitrarily, without adequate analysis, public notice
17 or public review, and without any effort at compliance with the requirements of CEQA.
18 Respondents failed to provide consideration of adverse impacts on the environment or the regional
19 welfare, or probable impairment of public health and safety, failed to consider the objections and
20 comments of Petitioners and many others, failed to conduct adequate consultation with other local

21 and regional planning and transportation agencies, or to provide adequate consideration of the
22 harmful impacts of the Approvals on Petitioners and many others.

23 7. In adopting the Approvals, Respondents improperly and unlawfully relied on a
24 "naked" negative declaration in finding that the Project would not result in any significant impacts.
25 Respondents' conclusions are not supported by substantial evidence in the record, or actually any
26 evidence or analysis, and are contrary to evidence in the record raising at least a fair argument that
27 the Approvals would result in significant adverse environmental impacts, precluding reliance upon

28 a negative declaration and requiring further public environmental review and analysis.

18016368.9 a07/15/22 COMPLAINT

Exhibit "A," Page 6

1 Respondents' actions also violated CEQA's prohibitions against piecemeal review of public
2 projects, considering only a portion of the City's recent attempts to rearrange and reorganize the
3 truck routes within the City, in order to minimize or avoid public review and analysis of the potential
4 impacts of the larger project, i.e., the City's wholesale rearrangement of truck routes diverting traffic
5 outward onto its regional neighbors, all to "protect" its own residents from the purported adverse

6 effects of that truck traffic. As result, the Respondents failed to consider significant adverse
7 impacts of the Project, including impacts to the environment, public health and regional welfare,

8 and to communities that are located outside of the City's limits, and improperly failed to consider
9 possible mitigation measures or feasible alternatives to the proposed Project as required by CEQA.

10 8. In addition, Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereon allege, Respondents'
11 actions and Approvals were in conflict with the California Constitution, the California Vehicle
12 Code, Planning and Zoning Law, as well as the City's own General Plan and Municipal Code, as
13 further explained below.

14 9. Petitioners, and other interested parties, duly raised these issues and objections,
15 verbally and in writing, at appropriate times during the administrative process leading up to
16 Respondents' disputed Approvals before both the Planning Commission and City Council.
17 Petitioners have exhausted all available administrative remedies, but Respondents have persisted in
18 acting in derogation of their obligations under the California Constitution, CEQA, the Vehicle Code,
19 the Planning and Zoning Law, and in derogation of the public's rights and interests in compliance
20 with those laws.

21 10. Petitioners now bring this action in the public interest, for enforcement of the
22 important public rights and environmental interests intended to be protected by CEQA and for the
23 enforcement of the Vehicle Code, the State Planning and Zoning Law, and the City's own General
24 Plan and policies, as well as statutory and constitutional rights to adequate notice, fair public
25 hearings, due process and equal protection of the laws.

Exhibit "A," Page 8

1 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

2 18. This Court has jurisdiction over this proceeding pursuant to California Code of Civil
3 Procedure sections 1085, 1094.5, and 1060, and CEQA, including but not limited to Public
4 Resources Code ("PRC") sections 21168 and 21168.5.

5 19. Venue in this Court is proper pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 394, in
6 that Respondents are located within the County of Riverside.

7 FACTUAL BACKGROUND

8 20. Through their recent myopic and arbitrary actions and Approvals to rush to adopt the
9 Project, Respondents ostensibly seek to remove truck routes from areas of the City of Perris that
10 Respondents have stated on the record they wish to protect from the asserted impacts of such uses.
11 However, in doing so, the Respondents failed, and in some instances refused, to acknowledge the
12 harmful impacts that are likely to result from displacing and removing those designated truck routes,
13 thereby intentionally redistributing that truck traffic into surrounding jurisdictions and through
14 neighboring communities without adequate analysis, public review, or consideration for the regional
15 welfare.

16 21. The City's policies and decisions were, on their face, intended to displace and shift
17 the impacts that could result from these truck routes to new areas, or the surrounding environment
18 and communities, and yet, the City steadfastly refused to consider or quantify what those impacts
19 could be and failed to balance regional needs it has historically acknowledged as substantial.
20 Instead, the City improperly curtailed its purported "analysis" of impacts to those impacts that were
21 anticipated to result strictly within the jurisdictional limits of the City, in disregard of the express
22 written objections of Petitioners and many others pointing out the need for consideration of impacts
23 on neighboring communities and the region under both the California Constitution and CEQA.
24 Accordingly, Petitioners seek relief from the City's arbitrary and unlawful actions.

25 22. Petitioners are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that Ethanac Road is

26 and has been recognized as an important regional route, part of a significant regional transportation
27 corridor between I-15 and I-215. The Riverside County Transportation Commission recently issued

28 a publication confirming that "It)he Ethanac Road/HWY 74/Nichols Road Corridor is a critically

1 important intra-county route." Since at least 2017, the Riverside County Transportation
2 | Commission, the Riverside County Transportation Department, the Cities of Menifee, Lake
3 Elsinore, and Perris have jointly funded and commissioned studies to create an improved east-west

4 vehicular corridor between I-15 and I-215, incorporating Ethanac Road and expanding it up to four
5 travel lanes in each direction as part of the "Ethanac Expressway Project." Those approved plans
6 provide for extending Ethanac Road to Highway 74 to the west, creating what the regional agencies,
7 including Respondent City of Perris, refer to as "the Ethanac Corridor."

8 23. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereon allege, that Ethanac Road is and
9 has been included in the planning and financing of significant regional roadways and truck routes
10 conducted by the regional planning agency, Western Riverside Council of Governments

11 (*WRCOG"). Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereon allege, that fees and assessments
12 collected by WRCOG from developers and property owners, including Petitioners, have been
13 justified and calculated on the basis that portion of such fees have been or will be used to improve
14 Ethanac Road as a recognized significant regional transportation corridor.

15 24. Petitioners are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that the City of Perris
16 first prohibited trucks throughout the City in 1972, but also designated certain truck routes through
17 the adoption of Perris Municipal Code ("PMC") Ch. 10.40 pursuant to its authority under California
18 Vehicle Code § 35701. Chapter 10.40 was then subsequently updated in 1992.

19 25. Petitioners are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that since Chapter
20 10.40's initial adoption, Ethanac Road has been designated as a truck route within the City of Perris.

21 26. Petitioners are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that many local
22 governments, public agencies, property owners, businesses, and members of the public have
23 reasonably and justifiably relied upon that designation of Ethanac Road as a truck route, and have
24 made investments, expenditures, plans and permanent improvements in such reliance.

25 27. Petitioners allege that the segment of Ethanac Road west of Barnett Road that was
26 recently de-designated a as a truck route by the unilateral actions of Respondents is on the boundary
27 between the City of Perris and City of Menifee, and is subject to the jurisdiction of both the City of
28 Perris and the City of Menifee.

18016368.9 a07/15/22 COMPLAINT

Exhibit "A," Page 10

1 28. Petitioners are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that in October 2021,
2 the City drafted an Initial Study and Negative Declaration under CEQA, entitled "Negative
3 Declaration for the City of Perris Proposed Truck Routes" (Neg. Dec. No. 2364) (hereafter referred
4 to as the "Northern Negative Declaration"), to review the possible impacts of a proposed project
5 which was defined in that negative declaration as certain amendments to the "Perris Municipal Code,

6 Circulation Element of the City of Perris Comprehensive General Plan 2030, and the Perris Valley

7 Commerce Center Specific Plan in order to identify a consistent list of adopted truck routes within
8 the northern portion of the City and extending south along Perris Boulevard to Case Road."
9 (Emphasis added.)

10 29. On November 17, 2021, the City's Planning Commission held a public hearing to
11 consider proposed amendments to the City's Municipal Code and the applicable Perris Valley
12 Commerce Center ("PVCC') Specific Plan to alter the truck routes within the northern portion of
13 the City of Perris. Most relevant here, the City purported to add some truck routes, and to eliminate
14 the following truck routes:

15 a. Eliminate the truck route on Perris Blvd from Harley Knox Blvd to Case
16 Road;

17 b. Eliminate the truck route on Ramona Expressway from the I-215 to the
18 eastern city limits; and

19 C. Eliminate the truck route on Evans Road from Ramona Expressway to
20 Placentia Avenue.

21 30. Following a hearing, the Planning Commission recommended that the City Council

22 approve those proposed modifications to the City's designated truck routes.

23 31. On December 14, 2021, the City Council conducted a public hearing, adopted the
24 Northern Negative Declaration for that project, and ultimately approved the proposed modifications
25 to truck routes within the City.

26 32. Petitioners are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that during the City
27 Council's December 14, 2021 public hearing, various Councilmembers made statements that
28 indicated that they were seeking to prevent allowing truck traffic that originated from outside the

1 City to come through the City, and further indicated an unwillingness to consider the impacts of
2 such a prohibition on the neighboring communities, including those communities that share
3 jurisdiction over existing truck routes.

4 33. The City staff subsequently prepared materials for consideration of possible
5 additional substantial changes to the established truck routes in southern and central areas of the

6 City

7 34. Petitioners are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that in or about May
8 2022, the City hired a consultant to prepare a new a Initial study and Negative Declaration under
9 CEQA, entitled "Negative Declaration for the City of Perris Proposed Truck Routes 2 (GPA22-
10 05068 and OA22-05069), ND No. 2372" (referred to herein as the "Southern Negative
11 Declaration"), to review the possible impacts of a new proposed project, which was defined as
12 "amendments to the Perris Municipal Code and the Circulation Element of the City of Perris
13 Comprehensive General Plan 2030 in order to identify a consistent list of adopted truck routes
14 primarily within the southern and central portions of the City." (Emphasis added).

15 35. That Southern Negative Declaration was purportedly created to analyze the impacts
16 arising from a distinct proposal to substantially change, de-designate, and reconfigure the truck
17 routes in the remainder of the City that had not been considered in the Northern Negative
18 Declaration. Indeed, this second negative declaration, the Southern Negative Declaration, was even
19 entitled as the "City of Perris Proposed Truck Routes 2."

20 36. The authors of the Southern Negative Declaration asserted that the Project "does not
21 have the potential to significantly impact the local environment. Therefore, in accordance with
22 CEQA, this Negative Declaration has been prepared." Those assertions were not supported by
23 substantial evidence in the public record.

24 37. Petitioners are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that the City made the
25 Southern Negative Declaration available for public review and comment but only for a 20-day
26 period between May 11, 2022 and May 31, 2022.

27 38. The City staff prepared a proposed General Plan Amendment, GPA No. GPA22-
28 05068, which proposed to amend the General Plan's Circulation Element to remove the following

2 segments of existing roadway from the General Plan's Circulation Element Truck Routes Map:

a. Evans Road: from its northerly city limits at the extension of Orange Street
3 to its intersection with the extension of Nuevo Road.

4 b. Goetz Road - from Case Road to Ellis Avenue.

Un C.

6 Goetz Road - from the San Jacinto River to Ethanac Road.

d. Case Road - from Goetz Road to Perris Boulevard.

7 e.

8 39. Ethanac Road - from the Western City Limits to Barnett Road.
The General Plan Amendment, GPA 22-05068, will also add the following road
9 segment to the map:

10 40. Case Road - from "G" Street to the I-215 Freeway (Bonnie Drive)
The City staff also prepared a proposed Ordinance Amendment, OA No. OA 22-
11 05069, which purports to make revisions to the City's Municipal Code to reflect the alterations to
12 the City's General Plan's Circulation Element, including the removal of the segment of Ethanac
13 Road as a truck route from the western limits of the City of Perris to Barnett Road. The foregoing
14 items are referred to collectively as "the Project."

15 41. Petitioners are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that sometime in March
16 or April of 2022, and before the Respondents published or released any information to the general
17 public on this Project, the City staff had informed at least one government agency of their intent to
18 substantially change the truck routes in the remainder of the City (i.e. the southern half, including
19 Ethanac Road). Other public records indicate that City staff began seeking to consult with relevant
20 Native American tribes on this Project in early March 2022.

21 42. Shortly after releasing the Southern Negative Declaration, towards the end of May
22 2022, the City released a new a Staff Report and hearing item for consideration by the Planning
23 Commission, wherein City staff asked that the Commission recommend approval of the Project.

24 43. On June 1, 2022, the Planning Commission conducted a public hearing a for this
25 Project. Despite the numerous and well-founded objections that were timely raised by Petitioners,
26 the City of Menifee, and other interested parties, the Planning Commission ignored all objections
27 and recommended that the City Council approve the Project.

2 quality, noise, traffic, and quality of life from potential impacts resulting from activities, including
3 truck corridors that would impact residential neighborhoods on the north side of Ethanac Road,"
4 and ultimately voted to recommend approval of the Project, and adoption of the Southern Negative
5 Declaration. (Staff Report, p. 2.)

6 45. Less than two weeks later, the Project was hastily set for public hearing before the

7 City Council on June 14, 2022. The City Council approved Resolution No. 6008, which adopted
8 the Southern Negative Declaration, and approved the General Plan Amendment. At that same time,

9 the City Council approved, on first reading, Ordinance No. 1418, which approved the Ordinance
10 Amendment, and also adopted the Southern Negative Declaration.

11 46. Respondent's actions improperly subject Petitioners, and the public generally, to
12 irreparable harm or the imminent risk of irreparable harm. Petitioners have no plain, speedy and
13 adequate remedy at law to set aside and correct Respondents' arbitrary actions, or to prevent or
14 mitigate such harm other than the relief sought in this action, including the issuance of immediate
15 temporary and preliminary injunctive relief.

16 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

17 [Petition for Writ of Mandate • Against All Respondents - Multiple Violations of CEQA]

18 47. Petitioners hereby incorporate the allegations of the foregoing paragraphs as though
19 set forth in full herein by this reference.

20 48. Pursuant to CEQA, before a public agency approves any discretionary project or
21 action, the agency must first identify, assess and publicly disclose the project's potential
22 environmental effects. An agency may not approve a discretionary action that has the potential to
23 have significant environmental impacts if there are feasible alternatives or mitigation measures that
24 would avoid or substantially lessen the adverse environmental impacts.

25 49. In doing the things herein alleged, Respondents failed to comply with their
26 mandatory duties under CEQA in several substantial and prejudicial respects, including without
27 limitation, the following:

28 a. Respondents erroneously and unlawfully asserted that the Approvals would

1 not have the potential to significantly impact the environment, and therefore wrongfully adopted the
2 proposed Southern Negative Declaration; and

3 b. Respondents willfully ignored the impacts of the Project on the surrounding
4 environment, including (without limitation) the City of Menifee, or persons, businesses, or other
5 public agencies in that City or any other neighboring community, while admitting on the record,
6 both orally and in writing, that the intended effect of the Project was to divert and redirect allegedly
7 "harmful" truck traffic into the neighboring City of Menifee; and

8 C. Respondents erroneously failed to consider and evaluate the regional impacts
9 of the Project on the surrounding environment, including the City of Menifee, or any other

10 neighboring community;

11 d. Respondents erroneously failed to consider and evaluate the cumulative
12 impacts of this Project and other similar projects in the same area, CEQA Guideline 15330; and

13 e. Respondents erroneously and unlawfully failed to accurately describe or
14 disclose the full scope of the Project to the public; and

15 f. The disputed Project was presented as one component of the City's larger
16 project as a whole, which includes both the modification to the truck routes in the northern portion
17 of the City (which was approved in late 2021/early 2022) with no mention of the impacts of the
18 southern truck route deletions, as well as this Project's alteration to the truck routes in the remaining
19 southern and central portions of the City, but Respondents erroneously and unlawfully chopped the
20 larger project (modifying all of the truck routes in the City) into small components for piecemeal
21 assessment, so as to minimize or avoid the Respondents' obligations under CEQA to provide
22 meaningful and comprehensive environmental analysis of the "project as a whole" in violation of
23 CEQA (e.g., CEQA Guidelines 15069, and Laurel Heights Impr. Ass'n v. Regents of the Univ. of
24 California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 396) when it was not only foreseeable but a virtual certainty that
25 the truck routes in the southern portion of the City would be eliminated immediately after the
26 northern routes had been deleted;

27 g. Respondents failed to timely and fairly disclose or consider reasonable
28 alternatives to the Project, or to consider feasible mitigation measures to the impacts of the proposed

1 Approvals for the Project; and

2 h. Respondents failed to comply with its mandatory duties under CEQA in
3 numerous other respects, as detailed in the objections previously submitted on behalf of Petitioners

4 and by others, which are a part of this record.

5 50. Respondents failed to adequately investigate the probability of significant adverse

6 impacts and failed to provide substantial evidence and analysis to support the Respondents' assertion
7 that the Approvals will not have significant adverse impacts.

8 51. Respondents failed to make required findings when acting on the Approvals and/or
9 any findings made were not supported by substantial evidence in light of the whole record.

10 52. Respondents' actions in approving the Project were not in compliance with

11 procedures required by law, were not supported by substantial evidence in the public record, were
12 not reflected in legally adequate findings, and were arbitrary, capricious, and reflected a prejudicial
13 abuse of discretion.

14 53. Respondents became committed to, and unlawfully approved, the Project before
15 having conducted and completed the necessary environmental analysis under CEQA.

16 54. Petitioners are further informed and believe, and thereon alleges, that the Project as
17 approved will have significant adverse impacts on the environment, including, but not limited to,
18 the issues raised in Petitioners' comment letters and other interested parties' comment letters, and
19 other issues that were identified at the time of the hearing.

20 55. Petitioners have beneficial interest in the issues raised in this action and will be

21 directly and significantly impacted by the arbitrary and unreasonable actions of Respondents.

22 56. Petitioners have performed any and all conditions precedent to filing this action and
23 has exhausted any and all available and feasible administrative remedies to the extent required by
24 law by, inter alia, timely submitting written and oral comments objecting to the Respondents'
25 threatened actions, proceedings, and Approvals at each stage of the City's administrative process.
26 Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereon allege, that to the extent any matter raised in this
27 Petition was not addressed in Petitioners' comments, such matters were raised by other persons or
28 entities who objected to the Project, or that Petitioners had no effective opportunity to raise such

comments before the complained of actions were taken, or that Petitioners were otherwise excused
2 from or not obligated to raise such issues before pursuing them in this action.

3 57. Pursuant to PRC section 21167.5, Petitioners have provided written notice of the
4 commencement of this action to Respondents.

5 58. Pursuant to PRC section 21167.7, and CCP section 388, Petitioners have or will
6 provide written notice of this action, including a copy of this Petition, to the State Attorney General.

7 59. Petitioners bring this action pursuant to PRC sections 21168 and 21168.5 and Code
8 of Civil Procedure sections 1085, 1088.5 and 1094.5, which require that an agency's approval of a

9 project be set aside where, as here. the agency's actions and decisions are not supported by
10 substantial evidence in the record, or the agency has failed to proceed in the manner required by
11 law, or has prejudicially abused its discretion, or has acted arbitrarily and capriciously.

12 60. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 and/or 1085, a writ of mandate

13 should issue directing Respondents to rescind the Approvals, and prohibiting Respondents from
14 taking any subsequent action to implement or enforce the Approvals, unless and until they have
15 complied with CEQA, including, but not limited to, by preparing and properly certifying an
16 environmental impact report analyzing the impacts of the Project, and the whole effort to re-organize
17 the truck routes throughout the City, including this disputed Project, and feasible alternatives and
18 mitigation measures to avoid the impacts of the Project.

19 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

20 [Petition for Writ of Mandate - Against All Respondents -

21 Violation of Pub. Res. Code § 21091 - Failure to Provide Sufficient Public Review Period]

22 61. Petitioners hereby incorporate the allegations of the foregoing paragraphs as though
23 set forth in full herein by this reference.

24 62. Public Resources Code 21092 requires that a lead agency must provide public
25 notice of its preparation of a negative declaration for a reasonable period of time prior to its adoption
26 of the negative declaration and Public Resources Code § 21091 requires that the lead agency must
27 provide an adequate period for public review of and comment on a proposed negative a declaration.
28 In the case of a negative declaration that addresses the impacts of a project that can have a "regional"

Rutan & Tucker, LLP
attorneys at law 2545/020858-0062 -14-

18016368.9 a07/15/22 COMPLAINT

Exhibit "A," Page 17

1 or "area wide significance," as in this case, that the review period must be at least thirty (30) days.
2 (PRC § 21091(b).)

3 63. Here, Petitioners are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that the Project

4 a would have a regional and/or area-wide significance. Ethanac Road is, and has for years, been

5 recognized by relevant regional transportation planning agencies and the Respondents and local
6 governments as a route of substantial "regional significance," as described in the Factual

7 Background, above. E.g., "The Ethanac Road/HWY 74/Nichols Road Corridor is a critically
8 important intra-county route." (Riverside County Transportation Commission, "Ethanac

9 Expressway Project Description" Brochure.)

10 64. In addition, the record shows that even the Staff of the Respondent City
11 acknowledged that the Project may require modifications to the I-215 freeway, and/or modifications
12 to infrastructure within the City of Menifee or otherwise outside the jurisdiction of the City of Perris.
13 Further, by purporting to remove Ethanac Road as a designated roadway, Respondents admit that
14 they are altering a portion of a roadway that is operated by two separate jurisdictions, the City of
15 Menifee and the City of Perris. Accordingly, it is clear that the Project is of "area-wide
16 significance."

17 65. Despite the Project being of regional significance, Petitioners are informed and
18 believe, and on that basis allege, that the Southern Negative Declaration was only circulated for a
19 20-day period, in violation of the plain requirements of PRC § 21091. The Petitioners and other
20 members of the public were harmed and prejudiced by Respondents' haste and failure to provide
21 the required time for public review and comment before acting on the Approvals.

22 66. Petitioners bring this action pursuant to PRC sections 21168 and 21168.5 and Code
23 of Civil Procedure sections 1085, 1088.5 and 1094.5, which require that an agency's approval of a
24 project be set aside if the agency has prejudicially abused its discretion, or has acted arbitrarily and

25 capriciously. Pursuant to CCP § 1094.5(b), an agency abuses its discretion where, as here, an agency
26 has not proceeded in the manner required by law.

27 67. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 and/or 1085, a writ of mandate

28 should issue directing Respondents to rescind the Approvals, and prohibiting Respondents from

1 taking any subsequent action to implement or enforce the Approvals, unless and until they have
2 complied with CEQA's notice and comment period, and provided the requisite 30-day notice period
3 found in PRC § 21091.

4 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

5 [Petition for Writ of Mandate - Against All Respondents -

6 Ultra Vires Action in Violation of Vehicle Code § 35702]

7 68. Petitioners hereby incorporate the allegations of the foregoing paragraphs as though
8 set forth in full herein by this reference.

9 69. As the California Supreme Court has stated:

10 The streets of a city belong to the people of the state, and every citizen of the state

11 has a right to the use thereof, subject to legislative control .. . . The right of control over street traffic is an exercise of 1S part of the sovereign power of the state

12 Ex parte Daniels (1920) 183 Cal. 636, 639.) The use of highways for purposes of travel and transportation is not a mere privilege, but a common and fundamental right, of which the public and individuals cannot rightfully be deprived .. . '[All]
13 persons have an equal right to use them for purposes of travel by proper means,

14 and with due regard for the corresponding rights of others.' ( Escobedo v. State of California (1950) 35 Cal.2d 870, 875-876 [italics added.) (Rumford v. City of

15 Berkeley (1982) 31 Cal.3d 545, 550.)

16 70. As recognized by the Southern Negative Declaration, under Vehicle Code § 35701,
17 cities have limited authority to "prohibit the use of a street by any commercial vehicle except for
18 public utility vehicles or any commercial vehicle on a direct route from an unrestricted street for the
19| purpose of making pickups or deliveries." (Southern Negative Declaration, p. 5.) Further, "[i]n
20 response to this authority, the City of Perris has over the years established approved truck routes on
21 select roadway segments within and around its jurisdiction."

22 71. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereon allege, that Respondents approved
23 the Project, and removed the impacted streets as designated truck routes pursuant to Vehicle Code
24 § 35701.

25 72. Indeed, even the recently-amended Municipal Code, reflects that the truck routes are
26 being prohibited pursuant to Vehicle Code § 35701. (See Perris Municipal Code, Ch. 10.40, n.1.)

27 73. However, the authority granted by Vehicle Code § 35701 is circumscribed by
28 Vehicle Code § 35702, which provides, in part: "No ordinance proposed under Section 35701 is

attorneys at law 2545/020858-0062 -16-

18016368.9 a07/15/22 COMPLAINT

Exhibit "A," Page 19

1 effective with respect to any highway which is not under the exclusive jurisdiction of the local
2 authority enacting the ordinance .. (Veh. Code § 35702, emphasis added.)

3 74. Petitioner alleges that Ethanac Road is a highway that is not under the exclusive
4 authority of the Respondent City, but rather is within the jurisdiction of both the City of Menifee
5 and City of Perris. As such, the City of Perris had no legal authority to unilaterally de-designate

6 Ethanac Road as a designated truck route. (See Skyline Materials, Inc. v. City of Belmont (1961)
7 198 Cal.App.2d 449, p. 458 ["It is not a boundary street separating one city from another or from
8 unincorporated territory and lying partially in each. Such a boundary street doubtless would be
9 within the prohibition [of § 35702]."].)

10 75. The prohibition of Vehicle Code , 35702 was directly raised by Petitioners and
11 others before the City Council acted, but the Council ignored the clear statutory prohibition against

12 their action.

13 76. Accordingly, the disputed actions of the Respondents, purporting to de-designate the
14 portions of Ethanac Road that are shared with the City of Menifee as a truck route were and are

15 ultra-vires action which is void.

16 77. The Court is therefore requested to issue its alternative Writ of Mandate,
17 commanding the Respondents to immediately rescind and permanently set aside such action, or in
18 the alternative to Show Cause based on applicable law and substantial and admissible evidence, in

19 a prompt and timely manner as to why they should not be so mandated.

20 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

21 [Petition for Writ of Mandate - • Against All Respondents - To Set Aside Ordinance That

22 Unreasonably Disregards Regional Welfare In Violation of California Constitution]

23 78. Petitioners hereby incorporate the allegations of the foregoing paragraphs as though
24 set forth in full herein by this reference.

25 79. As the California Supreme Court has declared:

26 [MJunicipalities are not isolated islands remote from the needs and

27 problems of the area in which they are located; thus an ordinance, superficially reasonable from the limited viewpoint of the [enacting] municipality, may be

28 disclosed as unreasonable when viewed from a larger perspective. .*.

These considerations impel us to the conclusion that the proper constitutional

2 test is one which inquires whether the ordinance reasonably relates to the welfare of

w those whom it significantly affects. If its impact is limited to the city boundaries, the

influence inquiry may be limited accordingly; if, as alleged here, the ordinance may strongly

L 582, 607.) an entire metropolitan region, judicial inquiry must consider the welfare of that region. (Associated Home Builders v. City of Livermore (1976) 18 Cal.3d

n 80.

6 The actions of the Respondents as alleged in detail above, including the actions and
Approvals resulting in the de-designation of critical portions of Ethanac Road for truck use, were
7 unreasonable and arbitrary, in conscious disregard of the public health, safety, and welfare of
8 adjoining communities and the region around the City of Perris impacted and influenced by the
9 Respondents' unilateral and exclusionary actions, and in excess of Respondents' statutory authority
10 or police power authority. Indeed, Respondents expressly acknowledged on the record that their
11 actions were intended to prohibit and exclude truck traffic that originated from outside the City of
12 Perris from coming through the City, and further indicated an unwillingness to consider the impacts
13 of such prohibition on the neighboring communities.

14 81. Respondents' actions and Approvals in unreasonable and conscious disregard of the
15 regional welfare were in excess of their police power authority, and unconstitutional. Respondents
16 should therefore be mandated to immediately rescind such void actions.

17

18 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

[Against All Defendants

19 For Declaratory And Injunctive Relief Pursuant to

20 82. Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1060, 526, and 527]

22 Petitioners hereby incorporate the allegations of the foregoing paragraphs as though
21 set forth in full herein by this reference.

83. An actual controversy exists between Petitioners and Respondents, involving the
23 invalidity and legal effect of the Project and resulting Approvals as described above.

24 84. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereon allege, that Respondents contend
25 that the Approvals were properly and lawfully adopted, in full compliance with all state and local
26 laws, and result in a prohibition of any vehicle over five tons from using Ethanac Road, and that any
27 property located directly to the south of the recently de-designated portion of Ethanac Road may not
28 lawfully be accessed from Ethanac Road by any vehicle over five tons, and will instead be required

Exhibit "A," Page 21

1 to have any truck traffic use different streets in light of this prohibition.

2 85. Petitioners dispute such contentions.

3 86. Conversely, Petitioners contend that the Respondents did not proceed in the manner
4 required by law, that Respondents' actions were not supported by substantial evidence, that
5 Respondents' actions unlawfully disregard and impair the vested rights of Petitioners and others in
6 the lawful use of Ethanac Road as designated truck route.

7 87. Petitioners also contend that, even assuming, arguendo, the City could legally de-
8 designate Ethanac Road under Vehicle Code § 35701, Vehicle Code § 35703 would specifically

9 allow any property located against Ethanac Road to continue to accommodate truck traffic for the
10 purposes of "making pickups or deliveries of goods, wares, and merchandise from or to any building
11 or structure located on the restricted street. . .." (See Vehicle Code § 35703.)

12 88. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereon allege, that Respondents dispute
13 the foregoing contentions and maintain the contrary, such that an actual controversy now exists
14 between the parties.

15 89. Accordingly, declaratory relief is appropriate as provided by Code of Civil Procedure
16 section 1060, and necessary to determine the controversies, to judicially declare that the
17 Respondents' attempts to de-designate Ethanac Road as a truck route are unlawful and void, a and
18 that the property located along the restricted portions Ethanac Road both to the north and south, will
19 be allowed to continue to be accessed by vehicles in excess of five tons, and receive pickups or
20 deliveries of goods, wares and merchandise from or to any building or structure located, and to
21 provide appropriate declaratory and injunctive relief.

22 90. To remedy Respondents' violations of their obligations, as described above,
23 Petitioners seek equitable relief, including a judicial declaration of the limitations of the
24 Respondents' Approvals.

25 SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION

26 [Against All Defendants - For Declaratory And Injunctive Relief - Violations of

27 Commitments for Regional Transportation Planning and Improvements]

28 91. Petitioners hereby incorporate the allegations of the foregoing paragraphs as though

1 set forth in full herein by this reference.

2 92. Petitioners are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that Ethanac Road is
3 and has been recognized as an important route, part of a significant regional transportation network

4 between I-15 and I-215, for which plans, commitments, and funds have been devoted for many
5 years, including funding from jurisdictions other than the Respondent City of Perris.

6 93. For example, in 2014, the Riverside County Transportation Commission committed

7 $2 million of "2009 Measure A Western Riverside County New Corridors Program" funds to fund

8 i multi-jurisdictional study and planning for an improved east-west vehicular corridor between I-15
9 and I-215, incorporating Ethanac Road.

10 94. In or about February 2017, the Riverside County Transportation Commission, the
11 Riverside County Transportation Department, the Cities of Menifee, Lake Elsinore, and Perris
12 entered into a formal written agreement (RCTC Agreement No. 16-31-102-00) providing for joint
13 funding and cooperation among those agencies in conducting the study and planning for the
14 improved "Ethanac Corridor." Petitioners are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that
15 those jurisdictions have subsequently made plans to create an improved east-west vehicular corridor
16 between I-15 and I-215, incorporating Ethanac Road, expanding it up to four travel lanes in each
17 direction, and extending Ethanac Road to Highway 74 to the west as part of the "Ethanac
18 Expressway Project."

19 95. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereon allege, that Ethanac Road has also
20 been included in the planning and financing of significant regional roadways and truck routes
21 conducted by the regional planning agency, Western Riverside Council of Governments, Petitioners

22 are informed and believe, and thereon allege, that fees and assessments collected by WRCOG from
23 developers and property owners, including Petitioners, have been justified and calculated on the
24 basis that portion of such fees have been or will be used to improve Ethanac Road as a recognized
25 significant regional transportation corridor.

26 96. Respondents' actions and unilateral Approvals, as alleged above, are inconsistent
27 with, frustrate the purpose of, and violate such regional transportation commitments and agreements.

28 97. An actual controversy exists between Petitioners and Respondents, involving the

2 obligations to make restitution or otherwise remedy the harms caused by their unilateral actions.

3 98. Petitioners seek equitable relief, including a judicial declaration of the rights and
4 obligations of the parties under such regional transportation commitments and funding agreements,

6 SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION

7 [Against All Respondents/Defendants - For Violation of Constitutional and Civil Rights -

8 42 U.S.C. §g 1981 et seq-J

9 99. Petitioners hereby incorporate the allegations of the foregoing paragraphs as though

10 set forth in full herein by this reference.

11 100. In doing the things herein alleged, the Respondents and each of them were acting or
12 purporting to act within the course and scope of their official positions and under the color of state
13 law, and violated Petitioners' rights protected by the Constitution or laws of the United States,
14 including (without limitation):

15 a. constitutional rights to Equal Protection of the laws;

16 b. constitutional rights to Due Process of law;

17 C. protections against the uncompensated taking of property or property rights;

18 d. rights to benefit from use of public roads and streets in the course of lawful
19 interstate commerce and travel, and intrastate travel and commerce, free from unreasonable and

20 arbitrary constraints.

21 101. The Respondents are subject to the Constitution of the United States and the
22 California Constitution, which guarantee certain rights, including rights to due process and equal
23 protection of the law, and prohibit governmental action which impairs such rights, or which take or
24 damage property without payment of just compensation.

25 102. Respondents, and each of them, have nevertheless acted arbitrarily and unreasonably,
26 in violation of Plaintiffs' rights under the federal and state constitutions to substantive and
27 procedural due process, and rights to equal protection of the laws, and rights against uncompensated
28 taking or damaging of property, by arbitrarily subjecting them to unreasonable and discriminatory

3 businesses have relied and which are necessary to provide reasonable access to locations outside the
4 parochial jurisdiction of the City of Perris.

5 103. Respondents' actions are in conflict with and preempted by rights to interstate and

6 intrastate commerce and rights to travel embodied in the federal and state constitutions.

7 104. In doing the things herein alleged, the Respondents have harmed and impaired

8 Petitioners' rights and interests and the Petitioners' constitutional rights. (U.S. Constitution, 5th and

9 14th Amendment; Cal. Constitution Article I, § 17.)

10 105. The Federal Civil Rights Act (42 USC 1981 et seq.) provides remedies for violations
11 of rights protected under the Constitution or laws of the United States.

12 106. As proximate result of Respondents' actions as alleged herein, the Petitioners have
13 suffered, and continue to suffer, irreparable harm as set forth above and are thereby entitled to
14 injunctive relief under 42 USC § 1981 et seq., and have been damaged in an amount according to
15 proof.

16 107. As a result of Respondents' actions, Petitioners have also been required to incur

16 In the course of my employment with Rutan & Tucker, LLP. have, through first-hand personal observation, become readily familiar with Rutan & Tucker, LLP's practice of collection 17 and processing correspondence for mailing with the United States Postal Service. Under that practice, deposited such envelope(s) in an out-box for collection by other personnel of Rutan & 18 Tucker, LLP, and for ultimate posting and placement with the U.S. Postal Service on that same day in the ordinary course of business. If the customary business practices of Rutan & Tucker, 19 LLP with regard to collection and processing of correspondence and mailing were followed, and I am confident that they were, such envelope(s) were posted and placed in the United States mail at 20 Irvine, California, that same date. I am aware that on motion of party served, service is presumed
21 invalid if postal cancellation date or postage meter date is more than one day after date of deposit for mailing in affidavit.
