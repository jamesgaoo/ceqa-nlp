22 SUMMARY OF PETITION AND RELIEF SOUGHT

23 1. Petitioner/plaintiff North Coast Rivers Alliance ("petitioner") brings this action
24 to secure required environmental review and protect the Sacramento and San Joaquin River

25 Delta ("Delta") and other potentially impacted watersheds including those of the Eel River and
26 the Russian River from needlèss, unstudied and unlawful environmental harm resulting from an

27 ill-informed decision by the Board of Directors ("Board") of respondent Marin Municipal Water
28 District ("respondent" or "Marin Water") to precipitously approve construction of a permanent

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIBF, ATTORNEYS' FEES AND COSTS -1-

1 transbay potable water pipeline across San Francisco Bay (the "Project") without first

2 conducting detailed environmental review. The Project's transbay pipeline would extend

3 roughly eight miles across the bay between the City of Richmond, Contra Costa County and the

4 City of San Rafael, Marin County, and be attached to the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge. It could

5 be used to transport water in either direction.
O 2. According to Marin Water, initially the transbay pipeline would transport potable
water to Marin County that has been diverted from the drought-stricken, highly impacted and

8 over-allocated Delta. The water would be diverted from the Delta by real party in interest

Q Contra Costa Water District ("CCWD") via storage in its Los Vaqueros Reservoir, which is

10 located in Contra Costa County. Marin Water and CCWD propose to obtain the appropriative

11 right to divert this Delta water from the Yuba County Water Agency, a procedure that would

12 require approval by the State Water Resources Control Board under applicable provisions of the

13 Water Code.

14 3. The diversion of this water from the Delta would cause harm to the Delta

15 because unlike Marin Water, the Delta is suffering a severe water shortage. The Delta's

16 tributary reservoirs, including Shasta, Oroville and Folsom reservoirs, are currently at record-

17 low levels that are far lower, as a percentage of storage, than are the seven reservoirs from

18 which Marin Water draws its water. As of October 27, 2021, the total active reservoir storage in

19 Marin Water's reservoirs was 40,418 acre-feet, or about 76 percent of Marin Water's average

20 storage for this date, and more than 50 percent of its total storage capacity of about 79,500 acre-

21 feet. According to the California Department of Water Resources, the storage in Shasta,

22 Oroville and Folsom reservoirs, by contrast, as of the date of this Verified Petition and

23 Complaint, is about 24, 30 and 36 percent, respectively of their capacities. According to Marin

24 Water's public records, as of the date of this Verified Petition and Complaint, Marin Water's

25 seven reservoirs - Alpine, Bon Tempe, Kent, Lagunitas, Nicasio, Phoenix and Soulajule

26 reservoirs - contain about 57.55 percent of their storage capacity.

27 4. Several endangered and threatened species that inhabit the Delta, including the

28 winter- and spring-runs of Chinook salmon, the Central Valley steelhead, and a distinct

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, ATTORI * FEES AND COSTS -2-

1 population segment of the North American green sturgeon, are on the brink of extinction due•

2 primarily to excessive water diversions from the Delta and its tributaries similar to the

3 additional diversion the Project would create.

4 5. Over the long-term, the transbay pipeline could be used in reverse. It could be

5 used to transport water from the Russian and Eel rivers in Sonoma and Mendocino counties

6 north of Marin County - harming those over-allocated rivers. south and east across the bay for

7 use in Central and Southern California. Marin Water has signed an agreement, known as the

8 Bay Area Regional Reliability (or "BARR") water supply program, which obligates the Bay

0 Area's eight water agency members to share their water transport facilities. The 2017 BARR
10 Drought Contingency Plan ("DCP") included the construction of a transbay intertie over the
11 Richmond-San Rafael Bridge, connecting Marin Water with the East Bay Municipal Utility
12 District ("EBMUD") water distribution system and ultimately, with the State Water Project and
13 the federal Central Valley Project. While that agreement allows the transport of water from the
14 Sacramento-San Joaquin rivers and the Delta formed at their confluence, it also provides that:
15 waters may be transported in the opposite direction across the Bay. Thus, the transbay pipeline
16 approved by Marin Water as part of the Project and challenged in this action could also be used
17 in the future to transport water from the Russian-River/Eel River complex - which currently
18 provides about 25 percent of Marin Water's supply, south and east from those rivers to urban
19 and agricultural users in Cental and southern California.
20 6. The BARR's DCP confirms that Marin Water was aware that compliance with
21 CEQA was required before the transbay pipeline could be approved. The DCP includes
22

23 numerous intertie, pipeline, and facility projects as "drought mitigation measures [that] reflect
strategies that would have alleviated individual agencies' supply shortage issues and
24

25 strengthened regional resilience if the measures had been implemented before [a] drought."

26 DCP at 6-3. Mitigation Measure 6 foretells the Project. It is an intertie connecting Marin Water

27 with the East Bay "either with a pipeline across the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge or across the

28 Bay's bottom, providing potential water sharing and transfer opportunities." DCP at 6-6.
Mitigation Measure 6 specifically states that "[c]onstructing the intertie pipeline in an urban

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, ATTORNEYS' FEES AND COSTS -3-

area necessitates complying with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA)." DCP

2 Appendix C, Drought Mitigation Measure 6 (emphasis added); see also DSC 6-6 ("Pipeline

3 construction in an urban area would necessitate CEQA compliance").

4 7. BARR's DCP also acknowledges "[c]onstruction of this major infrastructure

5 project will likely require mitigation of environmental impacts and community impacts (e.g.,

6 disruptive traffic conditions)." DCP Appendix C, Mitigation Measure 6; see also DCP 6-6.

7 The DCP further acknowledges that "[c]onstruction across the bridge could be challenging and

8 disruptive to traffic flow" and that the Project would require "coordination with many

9 jurisdictions, property owners, and permitting agencies." DCP 6-6. The DCP expressly -calls for-
10 CEQA compliance for the Marin Water intertie in its Permitting and Environmental
11 Documentation Table. DCP 7-7. Yet Marin Water ignored these significant impacts and
12 express recognition of the need for an EIR, and erroneously issued a Notice of Exemption for
13 the Project.
14 8. According to Marin Water's staff report recommending approval of the Project,
15 the Project would involve the purchase and delivery of an estimated 15,000 acre-feet annually
16 :: from CCWD. Öne acre foot is about 326,000 gallons. This quantity is sufficient to supply*
17 water for a typical household for both indoor and outdoor use for one to two years. Thus, the
18 quantity of water to be diverted and delivered by the Project is sufficient to support between
19 15,000 and 30,000 new households on an annual basis.
20 9. Marin Water's ostensible justification for exempting the Project from CEQA is
21 that it is experiencing an "emergency" drought. However, the current drought is not an
22

23 "emergency" as defined by CEQA. CEQA defines "emergency" in full as follows:

24 "Emergency' means a sudden, unexpected occurrence, involving a clear and imminent danger, demanding immediate action to prevent or mitigate loss of, or damage to life,

25 health, property or essential public services. Emergency includes such occurrences as fire, flood, earthquake, or other soil or geologic movements, as well as such occurrences

26 as riot, accident, or sabotage.'

27 Public Resources Code ("PRC") § 15359.

28 10. The current long-term drought in Marin County is neither "sudden" nor

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, ATTORNEYS' FEES AND COSTS -4-

1 "unexpected." Id. It poses no "immediate" danger to "life, health, property or essential public

2 services." Id. It is not sudden, life-threatening event comparable to a "fire, flood, earthquake,

3 or other soil or geologic movement," nor is it an "unexpected" event comparable to a "riot,

4 accident, or sabotage." Id. It is, to the contrary, both an eminently foreseeable, and a long-

5 foreseen event. It is a recurring, long-term, and potentially permanent consequence of global

6 warming that has been building for several decades. It has been preceded by other, similar long-

7 term droughts, such as the critically dry years of 1976 and 1977, that alerted Marin Water to the
8 need for greater water conservation and examination of alternate sources of water and water

storage.
10 11. The Project is a "project" within the meaning of CEQA. Public Resources Code
11 section 21065 defines "project" to include "an activity which may cause either a direct physical
12 change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the
13 environment, and which is any of the following: (a) An activity directly undertaken by any
14 .public agency." The Project is also a "discretionary project" within the meaning of CEQA under
15 the regulations adopted to implement this statute. Title 14, sections 15000 et seq. of the
16 1

17 California Code of Regulations, commonly known as the CEQA Guidelines, provide in section
15357 that "[d]iscretionary project' means a project which requires the exercise of judgment or
18 deliberation when the public agency of body decides to approve or disapprove a particular
19 activity." Marin Water's approval of the Project was discretionary and the Project may cause a
20 direct physical change in the environment. Therefore, under PRC sections 21102, 21102.1, and
21 is 21151, among other provisions, the Project is a CEQA project for which an environmental
22 impact report, or EIR, must be prepared and certified before it may be approved.
23
12.
24 No statute or regulation exempts the Project from CEQA's requirement that Marin

25 Water first prepare and circulate an EIR to identify and analyze the Project's potentially

26 significant impacts, and discuss and evaluate alternatives and mitigation measures that would

27 avoid or reduce those impacts to insignificance. As noted, the "emergency" exemption invoked

28 by Marin Water to avoid preparing an EIR is inapplicable.

13. The Project is also a "covered action" within the meaning of the Delta Reform

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, ATTORNEYS' FEES AND COSTS -5-

Act, Water Code section 85057.5, because it involves the diversion of water by a local public
2 agency that will occur, in whole or in part, within the boundaries of the Delta, that is covered by

3 one or more provisions of the Delta Plan, and that will have a significant impact on achievement

4 of one or both of the coequal goals of the Delta Reform Act.

5 14. The Project will have a significant impact on achievement of the Delta Reform

6 Act's coequal goal of "protecting, restoring and enhancing the Delta ecosystem." Water Code

7 section 85054. As noted, the Project will divert water that is needed to sustain and prevent

8 extirpation of the Delta's imperiled fisheries, and to protect, restore and enhance the Delta's

O many public trust resources, including its habitat for fish and wildlife.
10 15. Because the Project is a "covered action" within the meaning of the Delta Reform
11 Act, its approval must be preceded by determination, based on "detailed findings," as to
12 whether the Project is consistent with the Delta Stewardship Council's Delta Plan. Water Code §
13 85225.
14 16. .The Project is not consistent with the Delta Plan and the Delta Reform Act
15 because it would harm rather than protect and restore the Delta's natural flows and the fish and
16 wildlife dependent on them, contrary to Delta Plan requirements for the protection and
17 restoration of those public trust resources, and because it would increase rather than reduce
18 reliance on the Delta for regional water supplies, contrary to Water Code sections 85021.
19 17. According to Marin Water's internal records, its seven reservoirs are currently at
20 more than 50 percent of storage capacity. This is only slightly less than the typical storage in its
21 reservoirs at this time of year, which is about 56 percent of capacity. Marin Water projects that it
22 would end 2022 with about 20,000 acre-feet of storage, or about 25 percent of capacity, in case
23 of a dry 2021-2022 winter that produces only 25 percent of average runoff into its seven
24
reservoirs.
25
18.
26 Marin Water therefore has ample time to follow the law and prepare the

27 environmental impact report that is required by CEQA, and to determine the Project's

28 consistency (or not) with the Delta Stewardship Council's Delta Plan based on detailed findings
as required by the Delta Reform Act.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, ATTORNEYS' FEES AND COSTS -6-

19. Marin Water's approval of the Project also violates the Public Trust Doctrine in

2 that its diversions of water from the Delta unreasonably and avoidably harm the Delta's public

3 trust resources and uses, including its fish and wildlife and public recreational, aesthetic,

4 scientific and related uses of the Delta's public waters. Marin Water failed to recognize and

5 perform its affirmative duty to consider the effects of the Project on public trust resources, and,

6 SO far as feasible, to avoid or minimize any harm to those interests. It also failed to evince its

7 required consideration and affirmative performance of its public trust obligations by adopting
8 findings documenting its compliance with this doctrine.

20. Petitioner therefore requests a writ-of mandate from this Court pursuant to
10 California Code of Civil Procedure ("CCP") sections 1085 and 1094.5 setting aside the adoption,
11 issuance or certification by Marin Water of the following approvals for the Project:
12 (1) Resolution Approving the Emergency Intertie Project, and authorizing the General
13 Manager to Execute a Cooperative Agreement with Contra Costa Water District ("CCWD") for
14 Water Transfers and to carry out the. Pre-Purchasing of Materials. for Project Construction
15 adopted on or about October 19, 2021;
:16 (2) - Notice of Exemption, dated on or about October 20, 2021, certifying the
17 exemption of the Project from CEQA and purporting to find that the Project is exempt under
18 PRC sections 21060.3 (definition of "emergency") and 21080, subd. (b)(4) (specific actions
19 necessary to prevent or mitigate an emergency) and CEQA Guidelines section 15269(c) (listing
20 "emergency projects" exempt from the requirements of CEQA); and
21
(3) Other related approvals of various components of and requirements for the
22 Project, including but not limited to Marin Water's approval on or about November 2, 2021 of an
23 expenditure of $180,000 for a permit from the San Francisco Bay Conservation and
24
Development Commission for the Project.
25
21.
26 The grounds for the requested writ relief are that Marin Water's approval of the

27 project violates CEQA, the Delta Reform Act, the Public Trust Doctrine, and related procedural

28 requirements of the Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5 as detailed below.

22. Petitioner also seeks declaratory relief declaring unlawful, and injunctive relief

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, ATTORNEYS' FEES AND COSTS -7-

1 enjoining the Board from permitting or taking any actions that implement, the Project without

2 full compliance with CEQA, the Delta Reform Act, the Public Trust Doctrine and CCP sections

3 1085 and 1094.5.

4 PARTIES

5 23. Petitioner NORTH COAST RIVERS ALLIANCE ("NCRA") is a non-profit

6 unincorporated association whose members reside, work, or recreate in Northern California.

7 NCRA was formed for the purpose of protecting the rivers of California's North Coast and their
8 watersheds from excessive diversion of water for consumptive uses, watershed pollution and
degradation. Its members use and enjoy the natural resources of California's-North Coast and
10 their watersheds for recreational, aesthetic, scientific study, and related non-consumptive uses.
11 NCRA has urged the Marin Municipal Water District Board of Directors to disapprove the
12 Project, and to affirmatively take action to continue water conservation efforts. The interests of
13 NCRA and its members have been, are being, and unless the relief requested herein is granted,
14 will be adversely affected and injured by respondent's' approval of the Project and by the
15 consequent ill-designed and excessive resource extraction, and impairment of the natural
16 : environment that will result from the Project.
17 24. Petitioner has exhausted its administrative remedies by objecting to the Board's
18 approval of the Project prior to the close of the Board's public proceedings thereon. The
19 violations of CEQA, the Delta Reform Act, the Public Trust Doctrine and other violations
20 alleged herein were presented to the Board orally or in writing during the public comment
21 periods on the Project. Petitioner gave prior notice of this proceeding to the Board and to the
22 California Attorney General in accordance with applicable law, as documented herein and in
23 Petitioners' Proof of Service of Petitioner's Notice of Intent to File CEQA Action and Notice to
24 California Attorney General filed concurrently herewith.
25
25.
26 Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law

27 within the meaning of CCP section 1086, in that the Board's approvals of the Project are not

28 otherwise reviewable in a manner that provides an adequate remedy.

26. The Board's approvals of the Project challenged herein will result in irreparable

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, ATTORNEYS' FEES AND COSTS -8-

1 harm to petitioner because the Project and related activities that implement the Project will cause

2 significant adverse environmental impacts on aesthetics, air quality, global warming,

3 contamination and disruption of ocean waters, harm to aquatic animals and plants, geologic

4 impacts, public utilities, recreation and numerous cumulative impacts. The Project will also be

5 inconsistent with the Delta Plan. Such impacts will harm petitioner's use and enjoyment of the

6 environmental resources upon which they depend for recreation, relaxation and study. Such

7 environmental harm is unlawful and irreparable. Therefore petitioner is entitled to this Court's

8 injunctive relief.

27. Petitioner contends that the Board's-approvals of the Project violate CEQA, the
10 Delta Reform Act, the Public Trust Doctrine, and other applicable laws in the respects alleged
11 herein. Petitioner is informed and believes that the Board disputes this contention. Therefore
12 petitioner is entitled to this Court's declaration resolving such dispute.
13 28. Respondent MARIN MUNICIPAL WATER DISTRICT is a Municipal Water
14 District organized and existing under the Municipal Water District Law of 1911 (codified in
15 Division 20 of the Water Code) and formed pursuant to Water Code section 71000 et seq. and
16- 72750 el a seq. It is governed by a Board of Directors ("Board") comprising five elected members.
17 The Board is responsible for establishing policy and representing the general public in deciding
:18 issues related to water supply with the district. The Board has the authority to adopt resolutions,
19 enter into contracts, and take other actions as necessary to carry out the lawful functions of the
20 district. The Board is charged by law with responsibility for administering and assuring
21 compliance with the requirements of CEQA, the Delta Reform Act, the Public Trust Doctrine,
22

23 and CCP sections 1085 and 1094.5 with respect to approval of the Project. On or about October

24 19, 2021, Marin Water through action of its Board purported to approve the Project by adopting a
resolution based on the erroneous premise that the Project was exempt from compliance with
25

26 CEQA, and without regard to the requirements of the Delta Reform Act, the Public Trust

27 Doctrine, and related laws and implementing regulations. On or about October 20, 2021, Marin

28 Water staff completed, signed and submitted for filing with the State Office of Planning and
Research a Notice of Exemption purporting to certify the Project's claimed, but non-existent,

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, ATTORNEYS' FEES AND COSTS -9-

CEQA exemption. On or about November 2, 2021, Marin Water approved the expenditure of

2 $180,000 to pay for a permit for the Project from the Bay Conservation and Development

3 Commission. In purporting to approve and implement the Project by these and other actions,

4 Marin Water failed to comply with these laws.

5 29. Petitioner is unaware of the true names and capacities of respondents Does I-XX,

6 and therefore sues such respondents herein by fictitious names. Petitioner is informed and

7 believes, and based on such information and belief alleges, that the fictitiously named

8 respondents are also responsible for approval of the Project and its threatened injury to
9 petitioners. When the true identities and capacities of these respondents have been determined,
10 petitioner will, with leave of the Court if necessary, amend this Verified Petition to insert such
11 identities and capacities.
12 30. Real parties in interest CONTRA COSTA WATER DISTRICT ("CCWD"),
13 EAST BAY MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT ("EBMUD"), and YUBA COUNTY WATER
14
15 AGENCY ("Yuba Water") are public agencies with a contractual, financial, or other tangible
interest in Marin Water's approval and implementation of the Project, and are therefore named as
-16 real parties in interest in this procceding. CCWD is a County Water District organized and
17 existing under the County Water District Law (codified in Division 12 of the Water Code) that
18 approved entry into a Cooperative Agreement for Water Transfer Project with Marin Water on or
19 about November 3, 2021 that provides for the delivery of 15,000 acre feet annually of water
20 diverted from the Delta, stored in CCWD's Los Vaqueros Reservoir and transported via existing
21 and future EBMUD pipelines and related facilities to Richmond, California and thence across the

27 FACTUAL BACKGROUND

28 36. "[T]he Sacramento-San Joaquin [River] Delta is a natural resource of statewide,
national, and international significance, containing irreplaceable resources." PRC § 29701. The

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, ATTORNEYS' FEES AND COSTS -11-

Delta is the largest and most productive estuarine system on the West Coast of North and South

2 America, but its future is in peril. It is the State of California's avowed policy "to recognize,

3 preserve, and protect those resources of the delta for the use and enjoyment of current and future

4 generations." PRC § 29701.

5 37. Yet, the Delta's ecologic collapse is well-recognized and indisputable ongoing

6 crisis with two principal causes. First, an unsustainable portion of the Delta's freshwater flows

7 has been diverted for decades by the SWP and CVP. Second, for too long, agricultural diverters

8 have discharged subsurface drainage and surface run-off contaminated with salt, selenium, and
other toxic substances into groundwater and the rivers that are tributary to the Delta. -This one-
10 two punch of diminished freshwater flows and increased temperature, salinity, herbicides,
11 pesticides, and heavy metals has pushed the Delta to the brink.
12 38. Many species of fish endemic to the Delta have been extirpated, including the
13 Sacramento perch, formerly one of the most abundant fishes of the Delta, which disappeared in
14 the 1970s. Those indigenous species that remain are in grave danger. Since the SWP and CVP
15 began operation, the Sacramento River winter and spring run Chinook salmon, Central Valley
16 steelhead, North American green sturgeon and Delta smelt have been driven perilously close-to
17 extirpation.
18 39. Winter run Chinook salmon were declared threatened under the federal
19 Endangered Species Act ("ESA") in 1990 (55 Fed.Reg. 46515), and then due to continuing
20 population declines, declared endangered in 2005 (70 Fed.Reg. 37160). Their critical habitat in
21 the Sacramento River and its tributaries was designated in 1993. 58 Fed.Reg. 33212. Spring run
22 Chinook salmon were declared threatened, and their critical habitat designated under the ESA, in
23 2005. 70 Fed.Reg. 37160, 52488. Central Valley steelhead were declared threatened in 2000 (65
24
Fed.Reg. 52084) and their critical habitat was designated in 2005 (70 Fed.Reg. 52488). The
25

26 Southern distinct population segment ("DPS") of North American green sturgeon was declared

27 threatened in 2006 (71 Fed.Reg. 17757) and its critical habitat was designated in 2009 (74

28 Fed.Reg 52299). Delta smelt were declared endangered in 1993 (58 Fed.Reg. 12854) and their
critical habitat was designated in 1994 (59 Fed.Reg. 65256).

1 40. In 1976 and 1977, Marin County, along with the rest of California, experienced a

2 drought. Ultimately, it caused Marin Water's reservoir storage levels to drop below 25 percent

3 of capacity. This dry period alerted Marin Water to the need to study improvements in its water

4 conservation, storage and supplies. During the subsequent four decades, Marin Water has

5 experienced other dry periods which likewise alerted it to the need to study improvements in its

6 water conservation, storage and supplies. The current drought is neither sudden nor unexpected.

7 41. In 1990 Marin Water began performing studies to develop possible plans for

8 sources of potable water to meet future, increased water demand. Two options were analyzed in

0 an EIR certified by Marin Water in 1991: The first option was a desalination plant with the
10 capacity to create 10,000 acre feet per year ("AFY") of potable water. The second option
11 proposed installing an eight mile pipeline to convey water from the Russian River purchased
12 from the Sonoma County Water Agency. The Board chose the pipeline option, and put an $80
13 million bond measure on the ballot (Measure W) in November 1991. That ballot measure failed.
14 The following year, $37.5 million bond (Measure V) to fund conservation efforts, was placed
15 on the ballot, and was successful. Marin Water's customers have thus shown a preference for
16 conservation to reduce water demand and thereby increase the resiliency of Marin Water's
17 reservoirs to long-term droughts.
18 42. Notwithstanding Marin Water's decades of familiarity with the ongoing and
19 recurring tension between its conservation programs, reservoir storage and development of
20 increased or alternative water supplies, and its understanding that droughts are part and parcel of
21 the "new normal" in water supplies due to global warming, on April 20, 2021, its Board declared
22

23 a "water shortage emergency" and on October 19, 2021 its Board approved the Project based on a

24 a purported Notice of Exemption from CEQA likewise asserting that the Project was an

25 "Emergency Project" under PRC section 21080, subdivision (b)(4) and CEQA Guidelines section
15269(b),(c).
26
43. At all material times Marin Water has had the ability to prepare, circulate for
27

28 public review, and consider an environmental impact report addressing the potential

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, ATTORNEYS' FEES AND COSTS -13-

1 environmental impacts of the Project, and alternatives and mitigation measures that would avoid

2 or reduce those impacts to insignificance.

3 44. The proposed Project consists of a water diversion, storage and transport facilities

4 in at least two counties, Contra Costa County and Marin County, and possibly other counties as

5 yet unidentified. It will, upon completion, have the capacity to divert, store, transport and deliver

6 approximately 15,000 acre-feet of water annually. Its facilities will include existing and future

7 permanent improvements that will continue to pose potential environmental impacts on the
8 Delta, Contra Costa County, and Marin County, and potentially on sonoma and Mendocino

9 counties should Marin Water commence exporting water from the Russian-and Eel rivers via the
10 Project's transbay pipeline to Central and Southern California.
11 45. The Project will directly and adversely impact residents of the City of Richmond,
12 whose neighborhoods will be used to develop additional pumping and pipeline facilities to
13 enable the trasport of water across the transbay pipeline.
14 46. The Project will also directly impact motorists, pedestrians and bicyclists whose
15 use of the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge will be curtailed and degraded due to construction and
1* 16 maintenance of the Project's transbay pipeline.
17 47. The Project will degrade the Delta by diverting substantial quantities of water
18 from it and thereby impairing public trust resources including fish and wildlife habitat and public
19 trust uses of the Delta including boating, fishing, wildlife viewing and study, and related public
20 recreation.
21
48. The Project will be a significant consumer of electricity in Contra Costa County
22 and potentially other counties.
23
49. Despite the Project's known and foreseeable direct and indirect significant
24 impacts on the environment, and Marin Water's continuing ability at all material times to prepare 25
an environmental impact report addressing the Project's impacts and alternatives and mitigation 26

27 measures to avoid or reduce them, to prepare a written determination of the Project's consistency

28 with the Delta Plan based on detailed findings, and to affirmatively consider the Project's

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, ATTORNEYS' FEES AND COSTS -14-

1 impacts on public trust resources and to avoid or reduce those impacts where feasible, and to

2 documents each of these environmental reviews as required by CEQA, the Delta Reform Act,

3 and the Public Trust Doctrine, Marin Water failed to perform any of these actions required by

4 law before approving the Project.

5 LEGAL BACKGROUND

6 CEQA

7 50. CEQA is California's primary statutory mandate for environmental protection. It
8 applies to all state and local agencies, and requires them to "first identify the [significant]
Ov environmental effects of projects, and then to mitigate those adverse effects through the
10 imposition of feasible mitigation measures or through the selection of feasible alternatives."
11 Sierra Club v. State Board of Forestry (1994) 7 Cal.4th-1215, 1233. Its most important
12 substantive imperative requires "public agencies to deny approval of a project with significant
13 adverse effects when feasible alternatives or feasible mitigation measures can substantially lessen
14 such effects." Sierra Club v. Gilroy City Council (1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 30, 41.
15 51. CEQA's mandate for detailed environmental review "ensures that members of
16
17 the [governmental decision-making body] will fully consider the information necessary to render
decisions that intelligently take into account the environmental consequences" of their proposed
18 action. Mountain Lion Foundätion v. Fish and Game Commission (1997) 16 Cal.4th 105, 133;
19 PRC §§ 21080.5(d)(2)(D), 21091(d)(2); Guidelines 15088. The CEQA process thus "protects
20 not only the environment but also informed self-government." Citizens of Goleta Valley v.
21 Board of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 564.
22
52. All California "public agencies" must comply with CEQA when they approve
23 discretionary projects. PRC § 21080(a). a Marin Water is a "public agency" as defined in CEQA.
24
PRC § 21063. Therefore, its discretionary approvals of the Project are subject to CEQA. 25
53. A proposed governmental action requires environmental review under CEQA if 26

27 (1) the agency is contemplating an "approva]" of an action as defined by Guidelines section

28 15352, (2) the subject matter of the contemplated approval constitutes a "project" under PRC

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, ATTORNEYS' FEES AND COSTS -15-

1 section 21065 and Guidelines section 15378(a), and (3) the project to be approved does not fall

2 within a statutory exemption created by the Legislature under PRC section 21080(b) and

3 recognized under Guidelines sections 15260-15285, or a categorical exemption in the Guidelines

4 as promulgated by the California Resources Agency pursuant to PRC section 21084(a) and

5 Guidelines sections 15061(b)(2), 15300-15333 and 15354.

6 54. The lead agency must prepare an environmental impact report (*EIR") if it

7 determines that a project may have significant adverse environmental impacts. The EIR must

8 analyze those effects and suggest feasible means, if any, of mitigating or avoiding them including
alternatives that would achieve most of the basic objectives of the project without causing
10 significant environmental effects. PRC §§ 21002, 21002.1, 21061; Guidelines §§ 15080-15096,
11 15120-15132, 15160-15170.
12 55. In applying these CEQA procedures, an agency may not segment a project to
13 avoid preparing an EIR on the entirety, or whole, of the project. Guidelines § 15378(a), (c), (d).
14
15 CEQA's "requirements cannot be avoided by chopping up proposed projects into bite-size pieces
which, individually considered, might be found to have no significant effect on the environment
16 or to be only ministerial.". Plan for Arcadia, Inc. v. City Council of Arcadia (1974) 42 17. Cal.App.3d 712, 726.
18 The Delta Reform Act
19 56. To address the indisputably perilous state of the Delta, in 2009 the California
20 Legislature enacted the Delta Reform Act, declaring that "[t]he Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta
21 watershed and California's water infrastructure are in crisis and existing Delta policies are not
22 sustainable." Water Code § 85001(a), emphasis added. The Legislature found that ***the Delta'
23 is a critically important natural resource for California and the nation. It serves Californians
24
concurrently as both the hub of the California water system and the most valuable estuary and
25

26 wetland ecosystem on the west coast of North and South America." Water Code § 85002.

27 "Resolving the crisis requires fundamental reorganization of the state's management of Delta

28 watershed resources." Water Code 85001(a), emphasis added. Therefore, the Legislature

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, ATTORNEYS' FEES AND COSTS -16-

1 resolved "to provide for the sustainable management of the [Delta] ecosystem, to provide for a

2 more reliable water supply for the state, to protect and enhance the quality of water supply from

3

4 the Delta, and to establish a governance structure that will direct efforts across state agencies to
develop a legally enforceable Delta Plan." Water Code § 85001(c), emphasis added.

5 57. The Delta Reform Act was meant to advance the "coequal goals" of restoring the

6

7 Delta ecosystem and ensuring water supply reliability. Water Code § 85054. The Legislature
found that eight "objectives" were inherent in those coequal goals:

8 (a)
o Manage the Delta's water and environmental resources and the water resources of the state over the long term.

10 (b) Protect and enhance the unique cultural, recreational, and agricultural values of

11 the California Delta as an evolving place.

(c)
12 Restore the Delta ecosystem, including its fisheries and wildlife, as the heart of a healthy estuary and wetland ecosystem.

13 (d) Promote statewide water conservation, water use efficiency, and sustainable water
use.

14 (e)
15 Improve water quality to protect human health and the environment consistent with achieving water quality objectives in the Delta.

16 (f) Improve the water conveyance system and expand statewide water storage.

17 (g) *
Reduce risks to people, property, and state interests in the Delta by effective

18 emergency preparedness, appropriate land uses, and investments in flood protection.

19 (h) Establish a new governance structure with the authority, responsibility,

20 accountability, scientific support, and adequate and secure funding to achieve these objectives.

21 Water Code § 85020, emphasis added.

22 58. The Legislature also declared that:

23 The policy of the State of California is to reduce reliance on the Delta in meeting

24 California's future water supply needs through a statewide strategy of investing in improved regional supplies, conservation, and water use efficiency. Each region

25 that depends on water from the Delta watershed shall improve its regional self- reliance for water through investment in water use efficiency, water recycling,

26 advanced water technologies, local and regional water supply projects, and improved regional coordination of local and regional water supply efforts.

27 Water Code 85021, emphasis added.

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, ATTORNEYS' FEES AND COSTS -17-

1 The Public Trust Doctrine

2 59. Water Code section 85023 states, "the longstanding constitutional principle of

3 reasonable use and the Public Trust Doctrine shall be the foundation of state water management

4 policy and are particularly important and applicable to the Delta."

5 60. In National Audubon Society v. Superior Court ("National Audubon") (1983) 33

6 Cal.3d 419, 426, the court noted that the public trust doctrine mandates that "before state courts

7 and agencies approve water diversions they . . . consider the effect of such diversions upon

8 interests protected by the public trust, and attempt, so far as feasible, to avoid or minimize any
9 harm to those interests." The National Audubon Society Court went on to explain:
10 Just as the history of this state shows that appropriation may be necessary for
11 efficient use of water despite unavoidable harm to public trust values, it demonstrates that an appropriative water rights system administered without consideration of the
12 public trust may cause unnecessary and unjustified harm to trust interests. As a matter of practical necessity the state may have to approve appropriations despite
13 foreseeable harm to public trust uses. In so doing, however, the state must bear in mind its duty as trustee to consider the effect of the taking on the public trust, and to
14 preserve, so far as consistent with the public interest, the uses protected by the trust.

15 Id., citations omitted.

16 61. "Public trust easements are traditionally defined in terms of navigation, commerce.

17 and fisheries. They have been held to include the right to fish, hunt, bathe, swim, to use for
18 boating and general recreation purposes the navigable waters of the state, and to use the bottom

19 of the navigable waters for anchoring, standing, or other purposes." Marks v. Whitney (1971) 6

20 Cal.3d 251, 259. For nearly 50 years it has been settled law in California that public trust values

21 also "encompass[] . . . the preservation of those lands in their natural state, so that they may serve

22 as ecological units for scientific study, as open space, and as environments which provide food

23 and habitat for birds and marine life, and which favorably affect the scenery and climate of the
24 area."

25 62. Although compliance with CEQA "may assist an agency in complying with its

26 duties under the public trust doctrine . . . . L] CEQA review of a project does not necessarily or

27 automatically satisfy the agency's affirmative duties to take the trust into account and protect

28 public trust uses whenever feasible." San Francisco Baykeeper, Inc. v. State Lands Com. (2018)

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, ATTORNEYS' FEES AND COSTS -18-

29 Cal.App.5th 562, 571. "[A] public trust use is not any use that may confer a public benefit,

2 but rather a use that facilitates public access, public enjoyment, or public use of trust land." Id. at

3 570.

4 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

5 (Writ of Mandate to Set Aside Project Approval as Contrary to California Environmental

6 Quality Act and Declaratory and Injunctive Relief to Declare Unlawful and Restrain Project Approval and Implementation)

7 (Alleged by All Petitioner Against All Respondents and Real Parties in Interest)

8 63. The paragraphs set forth above are realleged and incorporated herein by reference.

0
+ 64: In approving the Project and certifying its Notice of Exemption, and taking other
10 actions to approve and implement the Project, Marin Water failed to proceed in the manner
11 required by law and thereby abused its discretion in violation of CEQA. Contrary to CEQA,
12 Marin Water erroneously invoked and relied upon an inapplicable exemption from CEQA, and
13 consequently failed to prepare an initial study and based thereon, an environmental impact report
14 addressing the Project's direct and indirect impacts on the environment, and alternatives and
15 mitigation measures including enhanced conservation measures and enhanced storage, that would
'16 potentially avoid or reduce those impacts to insignificance.
17 65. For the foregoing reasons, among others, Marin Water's approval of the Project
18 violates the requirements of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines, constitutes a prejudicial abuse of
19 discretion, and is contrary to the procedure required by law. Accordingly, Marin Water's
20 approval of the Project is invalid and must be set aside.
21 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
22
(Writ of Mandate, Declaratory and Injunctive Relief to Set Aside Project Approval as
23 Contrary to the Delta Reform Act)

24 (Alleged by Petitioner Against All Respondents and Real Parties in Interest)

25 66. The paragraphs set forth above are realleged and incorporated herein by reference.

26 67. In adopting the Delta Reform Act, the Legislature found that 'the Delta' .. . is a

27 critically important natural resource for California and the nation. It serves Californians

28 concurrently as both the hub of the California water system and the most valuable estuary and

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, ATTORNEYS' FEES AND COSTS -19-

1 wetland ecosystem on the west coast of North and South America." Water Code § 85002. The

2 Act declares that "[t]he Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta watershed and California's water

3 infrastructure are in crisis and existing Delta policies are not sustainable. Resolving the crisis

4 requires fundamental reorganization of the state's management of Delta watershed resources."

5 Water Code § 85001, subd. (a).

6 68. The Legislature declared that "existing Delta policies are not sustainable." Water

7 Code § 85001(a), emphasis added. To reform the Delta's mismanagement, the Act declared the

8 Legislature's "coequal goals" of restoring the Delta ecosystem and ensuring water supply
o' reliability. Water Code § 85054. The Legislature found that eight "objectives" were inherent in
10 those coequal goals, including several that require public agencies whose actions impact the
11 Delta to "[r]estore the Delta ecosystem, including its fisheries and wildlife, as the heart of a
12 healthy estuary and wetland ecosystem, " "[p]romote statewide water conservation, water use
13 efficiency, and sustainable water use," and "[i]mprove water quality to protect human health and
14 the environment consistent with achieving water quality objectives in the Delta." Water Code §
15 85020, subds. (c), (d) and (e).
16 69.
17 The Legislature also declared that:
The policy of the State of California is to reduce rèliance on the Delta in meeting
18 California's future water supply needs through a statewide strategy of investing in improved regional supplies, conservation, and water use efficiency. Each region
19 that depends on water from the Delta watershed shall improve its regional self- reliance for water through investment in water use efficiency, water recycling,
20 advanced water technologies, local and regional water supply projects, and improved regional coordination of local and regional water supply efforts.
21 Water Code 85021 (emphasis added).
22
70. The Delta Reform Act requires any state agency "that proposes to undertake a
23

24 covered action" to "prepare a written certification of consistency with detailed findings as to
whether the covered action is consistent with the Delta Plan" and submit that written finding to
25

26 the Delta Stewardship Council. Water Code 85225.

71.
27 The Act defines "[c]overed action" as "a plan, program or project" as defined by

28 Public Resources Code section 21065 [of CEQA] that:

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, ATTORNEYS' FEES AND COSTS -20-

1 (1) Will occur, in whole or in part, within the boundaries of the Delta or Suisun
Marsh.
2 (2) Will be carried out, approved, or funded by the state or a local public agency. a

3 (3) Is covered by one or more provisions of the Delta Plan. (4) Will have a significant impact on achievement of one or both of the coequal

4 goals or the implementation of government-sponsored flood control programs to reduce risks to people, property, and state interests in the Delta.

5

6 Water Code con 85057.5, subd. (a).

72.
7 The Project is a "covered action" because it diverts water from the Delta and those

8 diversions will have a significant impact on achievement of the Act's co-equal goal of
"protecting, restoring, and enhancing the Delta ecosystem." Water Code § 85054.

10 73. Although the Project is a "covered action" as defined in Water Code section

11 85057.5 and does not qualify for an exemption therefrom, Marin Water failed to "prepare a

12 written certification of consistency with detailed findings as to whether the covered action is

13 consistent with the Delta Plan" and submit that written finding to the Delta Stewardship Council"

14 as required by Water Code section 85225.
15 74. • • •Should Marin Water belatedly make and submit this finding to the Delta
16 Stewardship-Council as required by Water Code sections 85225.10 et seq., petitioner would

-17 appeal such a finding, but are prevented from doing so by Marin Water's unlawful failure to

18 make this required finding in the first place. The Delta Reform Act forbids Marin Water from
19 approving the Project without first making a determination of consistency with the Delta Plan.

20 Water Code § 85225.

21 75. Marin Water's failure to prepare and submit this certification before Project

22 approval, as required by the Delta Reform Act, is directly contrary to the Act's mandates. Water

23 Code §85225. Therefore its Project approval must be set aside.

24 76. Marin Water's action in approving the Project in violation of the Delta Reform

25 Act constitutes a failure to proceed in the manner required by law and therefore constitutes a
26 prejudicial abuse of discretion. Accordingly, Marin Water's approval of the Project is contrary to

27 law and invalid and must be set aside.

28

1 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (Writ of Mandate, Declaratory and Injunctive Relief to Set Aside
Project Approvals as Public Trust Doctrine) 3

4 (Alleged by All Petitioner Against All Respondents)

77.
5 The paragraphs set forth above are realleged and incorporated herein by reference.

6 78. Marin Water failed to proceed in the manner required by law and abused its

7 discretion in purporting to approve the Project because such approvals violate the Public Trust

8 Doctrine in the following respects, among others.

79. The Public Trust Doctrine protects the Delta's imperiled fish and wildlife and

10 other public trust resources and uses from avoidable harm whenever it is feasible to do so.

11 National Audubon, supra, 33 Cal.3d at 426. In adopting the Delta Reform Act, the Legislature

12 directed that "the public trust doctrine shall be the foundation of state water management policy

13 and [is] particularly important and applicable to the Delta.3 Water Code § 85023.

14 80. Contrary to this mandate, Marin Water has taken no steps to reduce or avoid the
15 Project's foresecable harms to the Delta's imperiled public trust resources before approving the
16 Project. Instead, the Project would exacerbate the existing unsustainable levels of Delta exports

17 that will needlessly harm public trust resources.

18 81. Marin Water's approval of the Project evinces no consideration of feasible

19 alternatives and mitigation measures that would protect and restore the Delta's ecological

20 functions. Because the Project harms rather than protects the Delta's fish and wildlife, without

21 taking feasible measures to avoid or reduce those harms to insignificance, it violates the Public

22 Trust Doctrine.

23 82. In summary, Marin Water's approval of the Project violates the Public Trust

24 Doctrine because Marin Water failed to perform its affirmative duty to consider the Project's
25 impact "upon interests protected by the public trust, and attempt, so far as feasible, to avoid or
26 minimize any harm to those interests." National Audubon,, supra, 33 Cal.3d at 426.
27 83. For each of these reasons, Marin Water failed to proceed in the manner required
28 by law and its approval of the Project is therefore an abuse of discretion. Accordingly, it must be

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAD • FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, ATTORNEYS' FEES AND COSTS -22-

1 declared invalid and set aside.

2 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION
(Writ of Mandate, Declaratory and Injunctive Relief to Set Aside
3 Project Approvals as CCP Sections 1085 and 1094.5)

4 (Alleged by All Petitioner Against All Respondents and Real Parties in Interest)
5 84. The paragraphs set forth above are realleged and incorporated herein by
vO reference.

85. Marin Water failed to proceed in the manner required by law and abused its
8 discretion in purporting to approve the Project, its Notice of Exemption from CEQA, and its
related approvals and actions implementing the Project because such approvals violate CCP
10 sections 1085 and 1094.5 in the following respects, among others:
11 such approvals were not granted in accordance with the procedures
12 required by law;
13 b. such approvals were not based on the findings required by law; and
14
C. such approvals were not based on, or were contrary to, the
15 evidence in the record before Marin Water's Board of Directors.
16
86::: Marin Water failed to proceed in the manner required by law in the following
17
respects, among others:
18
a. Marin Water violated CEQA as alleged above;
19
b. Marin Water violated the Delta Reform Act as alleged above,;
20
C. Marin Water violated the Public Trust Doctrine as alleged above;
21
87. Marin Water's actions in approving the Project without complying with the 22

23 procedures required by CCP sections 1085 and 1094.5 constitute a prejudicial abuse of

24 discretion, and therefore are invalid and must be set aside.
RELIEF REQUESTED 25

26 WHEREFORE, petitioner prays for judgment and further relief as follows:

1. 27 For a peremptory writ of mandate directing Marin Water to vacate and set aside its

28 approvals for the Project as alleged above because such approvals violate the California

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, ATTORNEYS' FEES AND COSTS -23-

Environmental Quality Act, the Delta Reform Act, the Public Trust Doctrine and Code of Civil

2 Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5 in the respects alleged hereinabove;

2. For declaratory relief declaring unlawful, and for interlocutory and permanent
injunctive relief restraining Marin Water from approving and implementing any actions to carry
out the Project pending, and following, the hearing of this matter;

6 3. For a peremptory writ of mandate directing Marin Water to suspend all activity
under its approvals for the Project that could result in any change or alteration in the physical

8 environment until Marin Water has taken all actions necessary to bring its approvals of the
9 Project into compliance with the laws whose violation is alleged-herein;
10 4. For an award to petitioner of its attorneys' fees and costs of suit (including all
11 necessary and reasonable litigation costs) as authorized by CCP sections 1021.5, 1032 and
12 1033.5; and
13 5. For such other equitable or legal relief as the Court deems just and appropriate.

ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION (ADR) INFORMATIONAL NOTICE (California Rule of Court 3:221)

The plaintiff must serve a copy of this notice with the complaint on all parties to this case.
Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) is a way of solving legal disputes without going to trial. Using ADR. may have a variety of benefits, depending on the type of ADR process used and the circumstances of
the particular case.

ADVANTAGES OF ADR

Save Time
A dispute often can be settled or decided much sooner with ADR; often in a matter of months, even weeks, while bringing a lawsuit to trial can take a year or more.
Save Money
When cases are resolved earlier through ADR, the parties may save some of the money they would have spent on attorney fees, court costs, experts' fees, and other litigation expenses.

Increase Control Over the Process and the Outcome
In ADR, parties typically play a greater role in shaping both the process and its outcome. In most ADR processes, parties have more opportunity to tell their side of the story than they do at trial. Some ADR processes, such as mediation, allow the parties to fashion creative resolutions that are not available in
a trial. Other ADR processes, such as arbitration, allow the parties to choose an expert in a particular
field to decide the dispute.

Preserve Relationships
ADR can be a less a adversarial way to resolve a dispute. For example, an experienced mediator can help the parties effectively communicate their needs and point of view to the other side. This can be an
important advantage where the parties have a relationship to preserve.

Increase Satisfaction
In a trial, there is typically a winner and a loser. a The loser is not likely to be happy, and even the winner
may not be completely satisfied with the outcome. ADR can help the parties find win-win solutions and
achieve their real goals. This, along with all of ADR's other potential advantages, may increase the
parties' overall satisfaction with both the dispute resolution process and the outcome.

CV006 (Rev. 7/9/15) ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION (ADR) INFORMATIONAL NOTICE Page 1 of 2

DISADVANTAGES OF ADR

If the case is resolved using ADR, the parties forgo their right to a public trial and they do not receive a decision by a judge or jury. If the case is not resolved using ADR and it proceeds to trial, the overall costs of the case may increase.

TYPES OF ADR

Mediation
In mediation, an impartial person called a "mediator" helps the parties try to reach a mutually acceptable resolution of the dispute. The mediator does not decide the dispute but helps the parties communicate so they can try to settle the dispute themselves. Mediation leaves control of the outcome
with the parties.

Settlement Conferences
Settlement conferences may be either mandatory or voluntary. In both types of settlement conferences, the parties and their attorneys meet with a judge or a neutral a person called a "settlement officer" to discuss possible settlement of their dispute. The judge or settlement officer does not make a •decision in the case but assists the parties in evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of the case and in negotiating a settlement. Settlement conferences are appropriate in any case where settlement is an option. Mandatory settlement conferences are often held close to the date a case is set for trial.

Arbitration
In arbitration, a neutral person called an "arbitrator" hears arguments and evidence from each side and
then decides the outcome of the dispute. Arbitration is less formal than a trial, and the rules of
evidence are often relaxed. Arbitration may be either. "binding" or "nonbinding." Binding arbitration
means that the parties waive their right to a trial and agree to accept the arbitrator's decision as final.
Generally, there is no right to appeal an arbitrator's decision. Nonbinding arbitration-means that the parties are free to request a trial if they do not accept the arbitrator's decision:

Neutral Evaluation
In neutral evaluation, each party gets a chance to present the case to a neutral person called an "evaluator." The evaluator then gives an opinion on the strengths and weaknesses of each party's evidence and arguments and about how the dispute could be resolved. The evaluator is often an expert in the subject matter of the dispute. Although the evaluator's opinion is not binding, the parties
typically use it as a basis for a trying to negotiate a resolution of the dispute.

STIPULATION TO USE ADR

If all parties in the action agree to participate in ADR, a Stipulation to Use Alternative Dispute
Resolution Process (CV002) may be filed with the court. This form is available at www.marincourt.org

24 SUMMARY OF PETITION AND RELIEF SOUGHT

25 1. Petitioner/plaintiff North Coast Rivers Alliance ("petitioner") brings this action
26 to secure required environmental review and protect the Sacramento and San Joaquin River

27 Delta ("Delta") and other potentially impacted watersheds including those of the Eel and

28 Russian rivers from needless, unstudied and unlawful environmental harm resulting from an
ill-informed decision by the Boards of Directors ("Boards") of respondents Marin Municipal

1 Water District ("Marin Water"), Yuba County Water Agency ("Yuba Water"), and Contra

2 Costa Water District ("CCWD") (collectively, "respondents") to precipitously approve

3 construction and operation of a permanent potable water pipeline across San Francisco Bay

4 (the "Project"). The Project would divert and transport water to be purchased, at least

5 initially, from Yuba Water and pumped by CCWD from the Delta for delivery to Marin

6 County without any environmental review. The Project's transbay pipeline would extend

7 roughly eight miles across the bay between the City of Richmond, Contra Costa County and

8 the City of San Rafael, Marin County, and be attached to the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge.

9 It could be used to transport water in either direction.

10 2. According to Marin Water, the transbay pipeline would transport water to
11 Marin County that has been exported from the drought-stricken, highly impacted and over-
12 allocated Delta. The water would be diverted from the Delta by CCWD utilizing its existing

13 export pumping plants on the Middle and Old Rivers within the Southern Delta near Clifton

14 Court Forebay in the vicinity of the even larger Delta pumping facilities operated by the
15 United States Bureau-of Reclamation's Central Valley Project ("CVP") and the California
16| Department of Water Resources' ("DWR's") State Water Project ("SWP"). After that, it

17 would be temporarily stored in CCWD's Los Vaqueros Reservoir for subsequent release into
18 CCWD's Contra Costa Canal for transport west and delivery to real party in interest East Bay
19 Municipal Utility District's ("EBMUD's") pipelines for transport to Marin Water's proposed
20 new pipeline across the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge. Marin Water and CCWD propose to

21 obtain the appropriative right to divert this Delta water from Yuba Water, a procedure a that

22 should require approval by the State Water Resources Control Board ("State Water Board")

23 under applicable provisions of the Water Code.

24 3. The diversion of this water from the Delta would cause environmental harm to

25 the Delta for several reasons. First, unlike Marin Water, the Delta is suffering a severe water

26 shortage. When Marin Water approved the Project on October 19, 2021, the Delta's tributary
27 reservoirs, including Shasta, Oroville and Folsom reservoirs, were at record-low levels that

28 were far lower, as a percentage of storage, than were the seven reservoirs from which Marin

FIRST AM. & SUPP. VER. PTN FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, ATTORNEYS' FEES AND COSTS -2-

1

2 Water draws its water. One week later, on October 27, 2021, the total active reservoir storage
in Marin Water's reservoirs was 40,418 acre-feet, or about 76 percent of Marin Water's
3 average storage for this date, and more than 50 percent of its total storage capacity of about
4 79,500 acre-feet. This disparity continued to grow during the balance of 2021. According to

5 DWR, the storage in Shasta, Oroville and Folsom reservoirs as of the date petitioners filed
6 their original Verified Petition and Complaint on November 24, 2021, averaged only 30
7 percent (specifically, 24, 30 and 36 percent, respectively) of their capacities. Marin Water's

8

9 seven reservoirs - Alpine, Bon Tempe, Kent, Lagunitas, Nicasio, Phoenix and Soulajule
reservoirs - by contrast, contained about 57.55 percent of their storage capacity - nearly.
10 double the 30 percent average storage of the Delta's principal reservoirs. During the next six

11

12 weeks this imbalance became worse, as Marin Water's seven reservoirs essentially filled, with
most of them now. spilling their excess water. As of the date of this FAC, Marin Water's slp*

13 seven reservoirs collectively store 75,565 acre feet, or about 95% of their capacity. Marin
14 Water, "Water Watch," published January 9, 2022. This stored volume is about 122.5% of
15 the average storage (61,691 acre-feet) for this time of year. Id. Current water year-to-date
16 rainfall in Marin Water's watershed is 43.16 inches, about 193% of its average rainfall (22:36

17 inches) for this date. Id.

18 4. Second, this Project's threatened environmental harm to the Delta would
19 exacerbate a long-standing and critical shortage of water desperately needed to restore
20 imperiled fish and wildlife in the Delta. For many decades operation of the CCWD's
21 diversion pumps on the Old and Middle Rivers has, together with operation of the nearby CVP

22 and SWP diversion pumps, contributed significantly to the ongoing collapse of the Delta's
23 fisheries. As the State Water Board reported in its seminal analysis - mandated by Water
24 Code section 85086, subdivision (c)(1) of the need to restore natural flows in the Delta to
25 prevent the extirpation of its fish and wildlife and related public trust resources, "[r]ecent
26 Delta flows are insufficient to support native Delta fishes for today's habitats." State Water
27 Board, "Development of Flow Criteria for the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Ecosystem,"
28 August 3, 2010 at 5. The State Water Board has identified many reasons for this, including

FIRST AM. & SUPP. VER. PIN FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, ATTORNEYS' FEES AND COSTS -3-

1 the fact these diversions are so great, they reverse the direction of flows in the South Delta
2 because more water is pumped out than is replenished by inflow from the Delta's tributary

1 3 rivers. Id. at 33. As pumping has increased during recent decades, reverse flows have
4 become more severe. Indeed, "between 1986-2005, net OMR [i.e., Old Middle River] reverse
5 flows had become more frequent than 90 percent of the time." Id. at 33-34 (emphasis added).
6 The State Water Board documented the fact that "[h]igh net OMR reverse flows have several af*

7  negative ecological consequences" (id. at 34) as follows:
8 a. "First, net reverse OMR flows draw fish, especially the weaker

10 swimming larval and juvenile forms, into the SWP and CVP export facilities. The expört*

11 facilities have been documented to entrain most species of fish present in the upper estuary.

12 [Citation omitted.] Approximately 110 million fish were salvaged at the SWP pumping

13 facilities and returned to the Delta over a 15 year period. [Citation omitted.] However, this

14 number underestimates the actual number of fish entrained, as it does not.include losses at the

15 CVP. nor does it account for fish less than 20 mm in length which are not collected and
counted at the fish collection facilities.". Id. (emphasis added). t

16 : :*

*,: b.
17 *Second, net OMR reverse flows reduce spawning and réaring habitat

18 for native species, like delta smelt. Any fish that enters the Central or Southern Delta has a

19 high probability of being entrained and lost at the pumps. [Citation omitted.] This has

20 restricted their habitat to the western Delta and Suisun and Grizzly bays." Id. (emphasis
added).
21
C.
22 "Third, net OMR reverse flows have led a to a confusing environment for

23 migrating juvenile salmon leaving the San Joaquin Basin. Through-Delta exports reduce

24 salinity in the central and southern Delta and as a result juvenile salmon migrate from higher

25 salinity in the San Joaquin River to lower salinity in the southern Delta, contrary to the natural

26 historical conditions and their inherited migration cues." Id. (emphasis added).

27 d. "Finally, net OMR reverse flows reduce the natural variability in the

28 Delta by drawing Sacramento River water across and into the Central Delta. ... The ...
through-Delta exports are at odds with the water quality and variability needs of

•IP=

1 desirable Delta species." Id. (emphasis added).

2 5.

3 Capitalizing on its failure to conduct required environmental review, Marin

4 Water has misled the public by suggesting that the Project would have no environmental

5 impacts because it would divert excess flows in the Yuba River. In fact, the Project would

6 instead divert water critically needed by Delta species at a location where decades of excessive

7 diversions häve created highly damaging reverse flows "more . . . than 90 percent of the

8 time." State Water Board Delta Flow Report at 33-34 (emphasis added). Because of those

9 harmful diversions, " any fish that enters the Central or Southern Delta has a high probability

10 of being entrained and lost at the pumps." Id. at 34 (emphasis added).

6.
11 Third, the diversion of these critically needed flows poses a particularly

12 pernicious impact because several endangered and threatened species that inhabit the Delta,

13 including the winter- and. spring-runs of Chinook salmon, the Central Valley steelhead, and a

14 distinct population segment of the North American green sturgeon, are on the brink of

15 extinction due primarily to excessive water diversions from the Delta and its tributaries similar

16 to the additional diversion the Project would create. Winter run Chinook salmon were declared

17 threatened under the federal Endangered Species Act ("ESA") in 1990 (55 Fed.Reg. 46515), and

18 then due to continuing population declines, declared endangered in 2005 (70 Fed.Reg. 37160).

19 Spring run Chinook salmon were declared threatened, and their critical habitat designated under

20 the ESA, in 2005. 70 Fed.Reg. 37160, 52488. Central Valley steelhead were declared threatened

21 in 2000 (65 Fed.Reg. 52084) and their critical habitat was designated in 2005 (70 Fed.Reg.

22 52488). The Southern distinct population segment ("DPS") of North American green sturgeon

23 was declared threatened in 2006 (71 Fed.Reg. 17757) and its critical habitat was designated in

24 2009 (74 Fed.Reg 52299). Delta smelt were declared endangered in 1993 (58 Fed.Reg. 12854)

25 and their critical habitat was designated in 1994 (59 Fed.Reg. 65256).

26 7. Fourth, the Project's threatened environmental harm is not confined to its

27 impacts on the Delta and its beleaguered fish and wildlife. Over the long term, the transbay

28 pipeline could be used in reverse. It could be used to transport water from the Russian and
Eel rivers in Sonoma and Mendocino counties north of Marin County - harming those over-

2 Before approving the Project, in 2015 Marin Water had signed a Memorandum of Agreement
3 ("MOA") to join with seven other Bay Area water agencies in the Bay Area Regional
4 Reliability (or. "BARR") water supply program, which obligates the Bay Area's eight water
5 agency members to share their water transport facilities. In 2017 the BARR water supply
6 program added a Drought Contingency Plan ("DCP") that included the construction of a
7 transbay intertie over the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge, connecting Marin Water with the
8 EBMUD water distribution system and thereby, with the State Water Project and the federal
Central Valley Project. In 2018• Marin Water executed a First Amendment to the MOA that
10 extended its terms through December 31, 2021. Thus, the MOA was in effect at the time
11 Marin Water approved the Project. While that agreement allows the transport of water from-
12 the Sacramento-San Joaquin rivers and the Delta formed at their confluence, it also provides
13 that waters may be transported in the opposite direction across the Bay. Thus, the transbay
14 pipeline approved by Marin Water as part of the Project and challenged in this action could
15 also be used in the future to transport water from the Russian-River/Eel River complex -
16 which currently provides about 25 percent of Marin Water's supply, south and east from those
17 rivers to urban and agricultural users in Cental and Southern California.
18 8. The BARR's DCP confirms that Marin Water was aware that compliance with
19 CEQA was required before the transbay pipeline could be approved. The DCP includes 20

21 numerous intertie, pipeline, and facility projects as "drought mitigation measures [that] reflect

22 strategies that would have alleviated individual agencies' supply shortage issues and
strengthened regional resilience if the measures had been implemented before [a] drought." 23

24 DCP at 6-3. Mitigation Measure 6 foretells the Project. It is an intertie connecting Marin

25 Water with the East a Bay "either with a pipeline across the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge or

26 across the Bay's bottom, providing potential water sharing and transfer opportunities." DCP

27 at 6-6. Mitigation Measure 6 specifically states that "[c]onstructing the intertie pipeline in an

28 urban area necessitates complying with the California Environmental Quality Act
(CEQA)." DCP Appendix C, Drought Mitigation Measure 6 (emphasis added); see also DSC

FIRST AM. & SUPP. VER. PTN FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, ATTORNEYS' FEES AND COSTS -6-

1 6-6 ("Pipeline construction in an urban area would necessitate CEQA compliance").

2 9. BARR's DCP also acknowledges "[c]onstruction of this major infrastructure
3 project will likely require mitigation of environmental impacts and community impacts (e.g.,
4 disruptive traffic conditions)." DCP Appendix C, Mitigation Measure 6; see also DCP 6-6.
5 The DCP further acknowledges that "[c]onstruction across the bridge could be challenging and
6 disruptive to traffic flow" and that the Project would require "coordination with many
7 jurisdictions, property owners, and permitting agencies." DCP 6-6. The DCP expressly calls
8 for CEQA compliance for the Marin Water intertie in its Permitting and Environmental
9 Documentation Table. DCP 7-7. Yet Marin Water ignored these significant impacts and
10 express recognition of the need for an EIR, and erroneously issued a Notice of Exemption for
11 the Project.
12 10. According to Marin Water's staff report recommending approval of the Project,
13 the Project would involve the purchase and delivery of an estimated 15,000 acre-feet annually
14 from CCWD. One acre foot is about 326,000 gallons. This quantity is sufficient to supply
15 water for a typical household for both indoor and outdoor use for one to two years. Thus, the
16 quantity of water to be diverted and delivered by the Project is sufficient to support between
17 15,000 and 30,000 new households on an annual basis.
18 11. Marin Water's ostensible justification for exempting the Project from CEQA is
19 that it was experiencing an "emergency" drought. However, the rainfall shortfall that Marin
20 Water characterized as a "drought" was not an "emergency" as defined by CEQA. CEQA
21 recognizes a narrow exemption from normal environmental review for "[s]pecific actions 22
necessary to prevent or mitigate an emergency." Public Resources Code ("PRC") 23

24 §21080(b)(4); 14 California Code of Regulations ("CEQA Guidelines") §15269. However, to

25 invoke this exemption the agency must first demonstrate the existence of an "emergency.'

26 CEQA defines "emergency" in PRC section 21060.3 and also in the regulations adopted by

27 the California Resources Secretary to implement the statute. Both section 21060.3 and the

28 CEQA regulations, commonly known as the "CEQA Guidelines," define "emergency" in full

as follows:

FIRST AM. & SUPP. VER. PIN FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, ATTORNEYS' FEES AND COSTS -7-

1 "'Emergency' means a sudden, unexpected occurrence, involving a clear and imminent

2 danger, demanding immediate action to prevent or mitigate loss of, or damage to, life, health, property, or essential public services. 'Emergency' includes such occurrences
3 as fire, flood, earthquake, or other soil or geologic movements, as well as such occurrences as riot, accident, or sabotage.

4 PRC $21060.3 (emphasis added); CEQA Guidelines § 15359 (emphasis added). §
5 12. The downturn in rainfall that Marin Water cited as its sole justification for
6 asserting an exemption from CEQA was neither "sudden" nor "unexpected." Id. It posed no
7 Ilä immediate" danger to "life, health, property or essential public services." Id. It was never
8 lan abrupt, life-threatening event comparable to a "fire, flood, earthquake, or other soil or
9 geologic movement," nor was it ever an "unexpected" occurrence comparable to a "riot,
10 laccident, or sabotage." Id. It was, to the contrary, both an eminently foreseeable, and a long-
11 foreseen, event. It was a recurring, long-term (albeit intermittent), and potentially permanent
12 consequence of global warming that has been well documented for several decades. It has been
13

14 preceded by other, similar long-term periods of reduced rainfalt such as the critically dry years

15 of 1976 and 1977, that cumulatively alerted Marin Water to the need for greater long-term

16 water conservation, and examination of alternate sources of water and water storage, many

17 decades ago. Indeed, nearly 50 years ago Marin Water had erected a temporary water service

18 pipeline across the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge in response to the water shortage in 1976-

19 1977. Since then, it has had nearly fifty years in which to conduct a proper CEQA review to

20 lexamine long-term solutions to such water shortages, including alternatives such as the Project.

21 It failed to seize the opportunity thus provided to do so. Procrastination is the opposite of

22 emergency. There is no CEQA exemption for procrastination.

23 13. Moreover, at the time Marin Water approved the Project weather forecasters had

24 already announced that La Nina conditions existed off the coast of Marin County and

25 consequently it was more likely than not that rains would return during the fall of 2021, exactly

26 las they did. Three months before Marin Water approved the Project, forecasters at the federal

27 lagency with primary expertise in forecasting rainfall - the National Oceanic and Atmospheric

28 Administration's ("NOAA's") Climate Prediction Center - had issued a La Nina a Watch, which

FIRST AM & SUPP. VER. PIN FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR -8- DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, ATTORNEYS' FEES AND COSTS

/means they forecast that a La Nina was likely emerging during the September - November
2 period and lasting through the winter. NOAA did a so based on a strong computer consensus

4 Jamong the models from the North American Multi-Model Ensemble ("NMME") that predicted

5 transition to La Nina during the fall and into the winter due to the colder-than-average
temperatures in the Pacific Ocean off the Northern California coast. Weather forecasters
6 a consider the NMME to be a reliable predictor of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation ("ENSO"),
7

8 which is associated with the occurrence of both-La Nina and El Nino conditions. This evidence

was so strong that the Washington Post published a comprehensive account of this development

10 on October 14, 2021 - five days before Marin Water approved the Project on October 19, 2021

11 in which it reported that "the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced

12 Thursday [October 14, 2021] that La Nina has returned. It's expected to stick around in some

13 capacity through the winter relax toward the spring.
#Washingtonpost.com/weather/2021/10/14/la-nina-winter-forecast, p. 1.
14 *e*

14.
15 According to the Golden Gate Weather Services, La Nina conditions bring rain

16 to Northern California. "Since 1950, there have been 23 winters like this one with La Nina

17 conditions - when Pacific Ocean waters off Peru are cooler than normal.'
progers@bayareanewsgroup.com, November 22, 2021, at p. 2. The "[a]verage percent of
18

19 normal seasonal precipitation for all La Nina events from 1991-2020 by hydrological regions"

20 lin California are 103% for the Northern California coast north of Marin County, and 93 % of

21 normal for the Bay Area. Id. Either percentage of rainfall would end the recent period of dry

22 |weather, and remove the "drought emergency" excuse that Marin Water claimed to abruptly

23 approve the Project without CEQA compliance. Had Marin Water heeded the predictions of

24 the experts at this nation's own weather forecasting agency, NOAA, and simply waited three

25 days to witness the commencement of the predicted La Nina rainfall that promptly refilled its

26 seven reservoirs, it would have avoided wasting the public's time and money approving a $100

27 million dollar "drought emergency" Project - $90 million for the pipeline and $10 million for

28 the first year's water - based on a mistaken claim of CEQA exemption.

15. The Project is a "project" within the meaning of CEQA. Public Resources Code

FIRST AM. & SUPP. VER. PTN FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCIIVE RELIEF, ATTORNEYS' FEES / D COSTS -9-

1 ("PRC") section 21065 defines "project" to include "an activity which may cause either a
2 Hirect physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change
3 fin the environment, and which is any of the following: (a) An activity directly undertaken by

4 any public agency." The Project is also a "discretionary project" within the meaning of
5 CEQA under the regulations adopted to implement this statute. CEQA Guidelines section
6 15357 provides that "*[d]iscretionary project' means a project which requires the exercise of
7 lfudgment or deliberation when the public agency or body decides to approve or disapprove
8 barticular activity." Marin Water's approval of the Project was discretionary, and the Project
-9 (may cause a direct physical change in the environment. Therefore, under PRC sections 21102,
10 J21102.1, and 21151, among other provisions, the Project is CEQA project for which an
11 lenvironmental impact report, or EIR, must be prepared and certified before it may be
12 approved.
13 16. No. statute or regulation exempts the Project from CEQA's requirement that
14 Marin Water first prepare and circulate an EIR to identify and analyze the Project's potentially
15 significant impacts, and discuss and evaluate alternatives and mitigation measures that would
16 avoid or reduce those impacts to insignificance. As noted, the "emergency" exemption invoked
17 by Marin Water to avoid preparing an EIR is inapplicable.
18 17. The Project is also a "covered action" within the meaning of the Delta Reform
19 Act, Water Code sections 85000 et seq., it because it involves the diversion of water by local
20

21 public agency that will occur, in whole or in part, within the boundaries of the Delta, that is

22 covered by one or more provisions of the Delta Plan, and that will have a significant impact on
achievement of one or both of the coequal goals of the Delta Reform Act. Water Code section
23
85057.5.
24
18.
25 The Project will have a significant impact on achievement of the Delta Reform

26 /Act's coequal goal of "protecting, restoring and enhancing the Delta ecosystem." Water Code

27 section 85054. As noted, the Project will divert water that is needed to sustain and prevent

28 extirpation of the Delta's imperiled fisheries, and to protect, restore and enhance the Delta's
many public trust resources, including its habitat for fish and wildlife.

FIRST AM SUPP. VER. PTN FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCIIVE RELIEF, ATTORNEYS' FHES AND COSTS -10-

19. Because the Project is a "covered action" within the meaning of the Delta
2 Reform Act, its approval must be preceded by a written certification, based on "detailed
3 findings," as to whether the Project is consistent is with the Delta Stewardship Council's Delta .

4 Plan. Water Code § 85225.

5 20. The Project is not consistent with the Delta Plan and the Delta Reform Act
6 because it would harm rather than protect and restore the Delta's natural flows and the fish and
7

8 Iwildlife dependent on them, contrary to Delta Plan requirements for the protection and

9 restoration of those public trust resources, and because it would increase rather than reduce

10 reliance on the Delta for regional water supplies, contrary to Water Code section 85021.

21.

11 According to Marin Water's public records, at the time this action was filed

12 Marin Water's seven reservoirs were filled to-more than 50 percent of their storage capacity.

13 This was only slightly less than the typical storage in its reservoirs at that time of year, which

14 fis about 56 percent of capacity. Marin Water projected at that time that it might end.2022 with

15 labout 20,000 acre-feet of storage, or about 25 percent of capacity, in the case of a dry 2021-

16 2022 winter that produces only 25 percent of average runoff into its seven reservoirs. As

17 shown, however, Marin Water's projections ignored NOAA's authoritative forecast that La'

18 Nina conditions would return last fall and winter, and thus were wildly in error. Indeed, its

19 reservoirs are now nearly 100% full.

22.
20 But even had its projections been accurate, as of October 2021 Marin Water still

21 had ample time to follow the law and prepare the environmental impact report that is required

22 by CEQA, and to determine the Project's consistency (or not) with the Delta Stewardship

23 Council's Delta Plan based on detailed findings as required by the Delta Reform Act.

23.
24 Marin Water's approval of the Project also violates the Public Trust Doctrine in

25 that the Project's diversions from the Delta unreasonably and avoidably harm the Delta's public

26 trust resources and uses, including its fish and wildlife and public recreational, aesthetic,

27 scientific and related uses of the Delta's public waters. Marin Water failed to recognize and

28 perform its affirmative duty to consider the effects of the Project on public trust resources, and,
so far as feasible, to avoid or minimize any harm to those interests. It also failed to evince its

FIRST AM. & SUPP. VER. PTN FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, ATTORNEYS' FEES AND COSTS -11-

1 required consideration and affirmative performance of its public trust obligations by adopting
2 findings documenting its compliance with this doctrine. The law is now well settled that
3 where, as here, public trust resources might be harmed by proposed agency action, express,
4 written findings are required to document the agency's compliance with the Public Trust
5 Doctrine. San Francisco Baykeeper, Inc. V. State Lands Com. (2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 202 at
6 215, 232, 234; accord, San Francisco Baykeeper, Inc. V. State Lands Com. (2018) 29
7 Cal.App.5th 562, 570-571. Marin Water failed to adopt these required findings.
8 24. Following the filing and service of this lawsuit, on January 4, 2022 Marin
9 Water's Board voted to partially back away from its improvident and unlawfül approvals of the
10 Project. However, it failed to fully rescind its approvals of the Project, which accordingly
11 tremain subject to this Court's jurisdiction. Additionally, Marin Water's incomplete repudiation
12 of its unlawful conduct fails to address the faet that other agencies relied-on Marin Water's
13 lapprovals of the Project, resulting in their additional approvals of the. Project and consequent
14 linvestment in and bureaucratic and economic momentum favoring the Project. These
15 intertwined and cascading approvals. impermissibly bias Marin Water and the other respondents
16 and real parties in interest toward future post-hoc rationalizations and consequent reapproval of
17 the Project regardless of its belated environmental review and the impacts thereby revealed.
18 Marin Water's notable failure to fully rescind its Project approvals sends the wrong signal to
19 these agencies, encouraging them to simply bide their time while Marin Water goes through the 20 motions of CEQA review, in the full expectation that reapproval of the Project will follow as
21 hight follows day. Marin Water's failure to even acknowledge, let alone comply with, its 22 duties under the Delta Reform Act and the Public Trust Doctrine likewise tells these agencies .-..F.d f..
23
that they need not comply with these environmental mandates either.
24
25.
25 Petitioner therefore requests a writ of mandate from this Court pursuant to

26 California Code of Civil Procedure ("CCP") sections 1085 and 1094.5 setting aside the t-get

27 ladoption, issuance or certification by Marin Water of the following approvals for the Project:

7 15269(c) (listing "emergency projects" exempt from the requirements of CEQA); and-

9 requirements for the Project, including but not limited to Marin Water's authorization in or
10 labout October, 2021 of the expenditure of $23.2 million to purchase construction materials for
11 the transbay pipeline, pump stations and other facilities associated with the Project, approval on
12 or about November 2, 2021 of an expenditure of $180,000 for a permit from the San Francisco
13 Bay Conservation and Development Commission for the Project, authorization of its entry into
14 an agreement with Yuba Water to purchase approximately 10,000 acre-feet of water for
15 lapproximately $10 million, and authorization of its entry into an agreement with CCWD for its
16 storage of approximately 10,000 acre-feet of water in CCWD's Los Vaqueros Reservoir along
17 with additional charges for use of its pipelines and pumps, Yuba Water's approval of the
18 Project on or about December 7, 2021, and CCWD's approval of the Project on or about
19 November 3 and 17, 2021.
20 26. The grounds for the requested writ relief are that respondents' approvals of the
21 Project violate CEQA, the Delta Reform Act, the Public Trust Doctrine, and related procedural
22 requirements of the Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5 as detailed below.
23
27. Petitioner also seeks declaratory relief declaring unlawful, and injunctive relief

3 unincorporated association whose members reside, work, or recreate in Northern California.
4 NCRA was formed for the purpose of protecting the rivers of California's North Coast and
5 their watersheds from excessive diversion of water for consumptive uses, watershed pollution
6 land degradation. Its members use and enjoy the natural resources of California's North Coast

7 land their watersheds for recreational, aesthetic, scientific study, and related non-consumptive
8 uses. NCRA has urged Marin Water and Yuba Water to disapprove the Project, and to
9 affirmatively take action to continue water conservation efforts. The interests of NCRA and its
10 members have been, are being, and unless the relief requested herein is granted, will be
11 adversely affected and injured by respondents' approval of the Project and by the consequent
12 fill-designed and excessive resource extraction, and impairment of the natural environment, that
13 will result from the Project.
14 29. Petitioner has exhausted its administrative remedies by objecting to Marin
15 Water's and Yuba Water's approvals of the Project prior to the close of their public
16 proceedings thereon. The violations of CEQA, the Delta Reform Act, the Public Trust
17 Doctrine and other violations alleged herein were presented to respondents orally or in writing
18 during the public comment periods on the Project. Petitioner gave prior notice of this
19 proceeding to Marin Water and to the California Attorney General in accordance with
20 applicable law, as documented herein and in Petitioners' Proof of Service of Petitioner's Notice

1 capacities of these real parties in interest have been determined, petitioner will, with leave of
2 Ithe Court if necessary, amend this FAC to insert such identities and capacities.

3 EXHAUSTION OF REMEDIES

4 39. Petitioner has exhausted its administrative remedies by objecting to Marin
5 Water's and Yuba Water's approval of the Project prior to the close of their public proceedings

6 thereon. The violations of CEQA, the Delta Reform Act and the Public Trust Doctrine and
7 other laws alleged herein were presented to these respondents orally or in writing prior to
8 Marin Water's and Yuba Water's approvals of the Project challenged herein.
9. JURISDICTION AND VENUE
10 40. "This Court has jurisdiction of this proceeding pursuant to CCP sections 1085 and
11 1094.5, PRC sections 21168 and 21168.5, and articte VI, section 10 of the California
12 |Constitution.
13 41. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to CCP sections 393, 394 and 395.
14 42. This petition is timely filed within 35. days of Marin Water's and Yuba •Water's
15 filing and posting of their Notices of Exemption for the Project with the Governor's Office of
16 Planning and Research on or after October 20, 2021, and on or after December 7, 2021,
17 respectively, in accordance with PRC section 21167, subdivision (d).
18 FACTUAL BACKGROUND
19 43. "[T]he Sacramento-San Joaquin [River] Delta is a natural resource of statewide,
20 national, and international significance, containing irreplaceable resources." PRC § 29701.
21 The Delta is the largest and most productive estuarine system on the West Coast of North and
22 South America, but its future is in peril. It is the State of California's avowed policy "to 23 recognize, preserve, and protect those resources of the delta for the use and enjoyment of 24
current and future generations." PRC § 29701.
25
44.
26 Yet, the Delta's ecologic collapse is a well-recognized and indisputable ongoing

27 crisis with two principal causes. First, an unsustainable portion of the Delta's freshwater flows

28 nas been diverted for decades by the SWP and CVP. Second, for too long, agricultural

FIRST AM. & SUPP. VER. PIN FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR -18- DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, ATTORNEYS' FEES AND COSTS

diverters have discharged subsurface drainage and surface run-off contaminated with salt,
2 selenium, and other toxic substances into groundwater and the rivers that are tributary to the
3 Delta. This one-two punch of diminished freshwater flows and increased temperature, salinity,
4 herbicides, pesticides, and heavy metals has pushed the Delta to the brink.
5 45. Many species of fish endemic to the Delta have been extirpated, including the

6 Sacramento perch, formerly one of the most abundant fishes of the Delta, which disappeared in
7 the 1970s. Those indigenous species that remain are in grave danger. Since the SWP and CVP
8 began operation, the Sacramento River winter and spring run Chinook salmon, Central Valley
9 steelhead, North American green sturgeon and Delta smelt have been driven perilously close to
10 extirpation.
11 46. Winter run Chinook salmon were declared threatened under the federal
12 Endangered Species Act ("ESA") in 1990 (55 Fed.Reg. 46515), and then due to continuing
13 population declines, declared endangered in 2005 (70 Fed.Reg. 37160). Their critical habitat
14 in the Sacramento River and its tributaries was designated in 1993. 58 Fed.Reg. 33212.
15 Spring run Chinook salmon were declared threatened, and their critical habitat designated under
16 the ESA, in 2005. 70 Fed.Reg. 37160, 52488. Central Valley steelhead were declared
17 threatened in 2000 (65 Fed.Reg. 52084) and their critical habitat was designated in 2005 (70
18 Fed.Reg. 52488). The Southern distinct population segment ("DPS") of North American green
19 sturgeon was declared threatened in 2006 (71 Fed.Reg. 17757) and its critical habitat was
20 Idesignated in 2009 (74 Fed.Reg 52299). Delta smelt were declared endangered in 1993 (58
21 Fed.Reg. 12854) and their critical habitat was designated in 1994 (59 Fed.Reg. 65256).
22
47. In 1976 and 1977, Marin County, along with the rest of California, experienced
23

24 a drought. Ultimately, it caused Marin Water's reservoir storage levels to drop below 25

25 percent of capacity. This dry period alerted Marin Water to the need to study improvements in

26 lits water conservation, storage and supplies. During the subsequent four decades, Marin Water

27 has experienced other dry periods which likewise alerted it to the need to study improvements

28 in its water conservation, storage and supplies. The current drought is neither sudden nor

FIRST AM. & SUPP. VER. PTN FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, ATTORNEYS' FEES AND COSTS -19-

unexpected.

2 48. In 1990 Marin Water began performing studies to develop possible plans for
3 sources of potable water to meet future, increased water demand. Two options were analyzed
1n an EIR certified by Marin Water in 1991. The first option was a desalination plant with the
5 capacity to create 10,000 acre feet per year ("AFY") of potable water. The second option

6 proposed installing an eight mile pipeline to convey water from the Russian River purchased
7 from the Sonoma-County Water Agency. The Board chose the pipeline option, and put an $80
8 million bond measure on the ballot (Measure W) in November 1991. That ballot measure
9 failed. The following year, a $37.5 million bond (Measure V) to fund conservation efforts,
10 was placed on the ballot, and was successful. Marin Water's customers have thus shown a
11 preference for conservation to reduce water demand and thereby increase the resiliency of
12 Marin Water's reservoirs to long-term droughts.
13 49. Notwithstanding Marin Water's decades of familiarity with the ongoing and
14 recurring tension between its conservation programs, reservoir storage and development of
15 increased or alternative water supplies, and its understanding that droughts are part and parcel
16° bf the "new normal" in water supplies due to global warming, on April 20, 2021, its Board
17 Ideclared .a "water shortage emergency" and on October 19, 2021 its Board approved the
18

19 Project based on a purported Notice of Exemption from CEQA likewise asserting that the
Project was an "Emergency Project" under PRC sections 21060.3 and 21080, subdivision
20 (b)(4) and CEQA Guidelines section 15269(b), (c).
21
50.
22 At all material times Marin Water has had the ability to prepare, circulate for

23 public review, and consider an environmental impact report addressing the potential

24 environmental impacts of the Project, and alternatives and mitigation measures that would avoid

25 or reduce those impacts to insignificance.

51.
26 The proposed Project consists of a water diversion, storage and transport

27 facilities in at least two counties, Contra Costa County and Marin County, and possibly other

28 counties as yet unidentified. It will, upon completion, have the capacity to divert, store,

FIRST AM. & SUPP. VER. PIN FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, ATTORNEYS' FEES AND COSTS -20-

1 transport and deliver approximately 15,000 acre-feet of water annually. Its facilities will
2 linclude existing and future permanent improvements that will continue to pose potential
3 environmental impacts on the Delta, Contra Costa County, and Marin County, and potentially
4 on Sonoma and Mendocino counties should Marin Water commence exporting water from the

5 Russian and Eel rivers via the Project's transbay pipeline to Central and Southern California.

6 52. The Project will directly and adversely impact residents of the City of
7 Richmond, whose neighborhoods will be used to develop additional pumping and pipeline
8 |facilities to enable the transport of water across the transbay pipeline.
9 53: The Project will also directly impact motorists, pedestrians and bicyclists whose
10 luse of the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge will be curtailed and degraded-due to construction and
11 maintenance of the Project's transbay pipeline.
12 54. The Project will degrade the Delta by diverting substantial quantities of water
13 from it and thereby impairing public trust resources including fish and wildlife habitat and
14 public trust uses of the Delta including boating, fishing, wildlife viewing and study, and related
15 bublic recreation.
16 55: The Project will be a significant consumer of electricity in Contra Costa County
17 land potentially other counties.
18 56. Despite the Project's known and foreseeable direct and indirect significant
19 limpacts on the environment, and Marin Water's continuing ability at all material times to
20

21 prepare an environmental impact report addressing the Project's impacts and alternatives and

22 mitigation measures to avoid or reduce them, to prepare a written determination of the Project's
consistency with the Delta Plan based on detailed findings, and to affirmatively consider the 23

24 Project's impacts on public trust resources and to avoid or reduce those impacts where feasible,

25 and to documents each of these environmental reviews as required by CEQA, the Delta Reform

26 Act, and the Public Trust Doctrine, respondents failed to perform any of these actions required

27 by law before approving the Project.

1 LEGAL BACKGROUND

2 CEQA

3 57. CEQA is California's primary statutory mandate for environmental protection.

4 applies to all state and local agencies, and requires them to "first identify the [significant]
5 environmental effects of projects, and then to mitigate those adverse effects through the
6 imposition of feasible mitigation measures or through the selection of feasible alternatives."
7 Sierra Club v. State Board of Forestry (1994) 7 Cal.4th 1215, 1233. Its most important
8 substantive imperative requires "public agencies to deny approval of project with significant
9 ladverse effects when feasible alternatives or feasible mitigation measures can substantially
10 lessen such effects." Sierra Club v. Gilroy City Council (1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 30, 41.
11 58. CEQA's mandate for detailed environmental review "ensures that members of
12 the [governmental decision-making body] will fully consider the information necessary to
13 render decisions that intelligently take into account the environmental consequences" of their
14 proposed action. Mountain Lion Foundation v. Fish and Game Commission (1997) 16 Cal.4th
15 105, 133; PRC §§ 21080.5(d)(2)(D), 21091(d)(2); Guidelines § 15088. The CEQA process
16 thus "protects not only the environment but also informed self-government." Citizens of Goleta
17 Valley v. Board of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 564.
18 59. All California "public agencies" must comply with CEQA when they approve
19 kiscretionary projects. § PRC § 21080(a). Respondents are "public agencies" as defined in
20 CEQA. PRC § 21063. Therefore, their discretionary approvals of the Project are subject to
21 CEQA.
22
60. A proposed governmental action requires enyironmental review under CEQA if
23
(1) the agency is contemplating an "approval" of an action as defined by Guidelines section
24

25 15352, (2) the subject matter of the contemplated approval constitutes a "project" under PRC

26 section 21065 and Guidelines section 15378(a), and (3) the project to be approved does not fall

27 within statutory exemption created by the Legislature under PRC section 21080(b) and

28 lrecognized under Guidelines sections 15260-15285, or a categorical exemption in the

FIRST AM. & SUPP. VER. PTN FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, ATTORNEYS' FEES AND COSTS -22-

1 Guidelines as promulgated by the California Resources Secretary pursuant to PRC section
2 21084(a) and Guidelines sections 15061(b)(2), 15300-15333 and 15354.

3 61. The lead agency must prepare an environmental impact report ("EIR") if it
4 determines that a project may have significant adverse environmental impacts. The EIR must
5 Janalyze those effects and suggest feasible means, if any, of mitigating or avoiding them
6 lincluding alternatives that would achieve most of the basic objectives of the project without
7 eausing significant environmental effects. PRC §S 21002, 21002.1, 21061; Guidelines §§
8 15080-15096, 15120-15132, 15160-15170. Marin Water is. the lead agency for the Project.

62:: In applying these CEQA procedures, an agency may not segment a project to t

10 lavoid preparing an EIR on the entirety, or whole, of the project. Guidelines § 15378(a), (c),
11 (d). CEQA's "requirements cannot be avoided by chopping up proposed projects into bite-size
12 pieces which, individually considered, might be found to have no significant effect on the
13 Jenvironment or to be only ministeriat.» P.lan for Arcadia, Inc. v. City Council of Arcadia
14 (1974) 42:Cal.App.3d 712, 726.
15 The Delta Reform Act
16 -

,* 63. To address the indisputably perilous state of the Delta, in 2009 the California
17 Legislature enacted the Delta Reform Act, declaring that "[t]he Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta
18 watershed and California's water infrastructure are in crisis and existing Delta policies are not
19

20 Isustainable." Water Code § 85001(a), emphasis added. The Legislature found that "'the
Delta'
21 is a critically important natural resource for California and the nation. It serves
Californians concurrently as both the hub of the California water system and the most valuable
22 estuary and wetland ecosystem on the west coast of North and South America." Water Code §
23

24 85002. "Resolving the crisis requires fundamental reorganization of the state's management of

25 Delta watershed resources." Water Code § 85001(a), emphasis added. Therefore, the

26 Legislature resolved "to provide for the sustainable management of the [Delta] ecosystem, to

27 provide for a more reliable water supply for the state, to protect and enhance the quality of

28 water supply from the Delta, and to establish a governance structure that will direct efforts

FIRST AM. & SUPP. VER. PIN FOR WHIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR -23- DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, ATTORNEYS' FEES AND COSTS

1 across state agencies to develop a legally enforceable Delta Plan." Water Code § 85001(c), §
2 emphasis added.

3 64. The Delta Reform Act was meant to advance the "coequal goals" of restoring the

4 Delta ecosystem and ensuring water supply reliability. Water Code § 85054. The Legislature
5 found that eight "objectives" were inherent in those coequal goals:

6 (a) Manage the Delta's water and environmental resources and the water resources

7 of the state over the long term.

8 (b) Protect and enhance the unique cultural, recreational, and agricultural values of the California Delta as an evolving place.

9 (c) Restore the Delta ecosystem, including its fisheries and wildlife, as the heart of a
10 healthy estuary and wetland ecosystem.

11 (d) Promote statewide water conservation, water use efficiency, and sustainable water use.
12: (e) Improve water quality to protect human health and the environment consistent
13 with achieving water quality objectives in the Delta.

14 (f) Improve the water conveyance system and expand statewide water storage.
} 15. (g) Reduce risks to people, property, and state interests in the Delta by effective
16 emergency preparedness, appropriate land uses, and investments in flood protection.
17 (h) Establish a new governance structure with the authority, responsibility,
18 accountability, scientific support, and adequate and secure funding to achieve these objectives.
19 § Water Code § 85020, emphasis added.
20 65. The Legislature also declared that:
21 The policy of the State of California is to reduce reliance on the Delta in meeting
22 California's future water supply needs through a statewide strategy of investing

23 in improved regional supplies, conservation, and water use efficiency. Each region that depends on water from the Delta watershed shall improve its regional

24 self-reliance for water through investment in water use efficiency, water recycling, advanced water technologies, local and regional water supply projects,

25 and improved regional coordination of local and regional water supply efforts.

26 /Water Code § 85021, emphasis added.

The Public Trust Doctrine
27
66.
28 Water Code section 85023 states, "the longstanding constitutional principle of

FIRST AM. & SUPP. VER PTN FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, ATTORNEYS' FEES AND COSTS -24-

reasonable use and the Public Trust Doctrine shall be the foundation of state water management
2 policy and are particularly important and applicable to the Delta."

67. In National Audubon Society v. Superior Court (" National Audubon") (1983) 33
4 Cal.3d 419, 426, the court noted that the public trust doctrine mandates that "before state
5 courts and agencies approve water diversions they consider the effect of such diversions

6 upon interests protected by the public trust, and attempt, so far as feasible, to avoid or
7 minimize any harm to those interests." The National Audubon Court went on to explain:
8 Just as the history of this state shows that appropriation may be necessary for
9 efficient use of water despite unavoidable harm to public. trust values, it demonstrates that an appropriative water rights system administered without
10 consideration of the public trust may cause unnecessary and unjustified harm to trust interests. As a matter of practical necessity the state may have to approve
11 appropriations despite foresecable harm to public trust uses. In so doing, however, the state must bear in mind its duty as trustee to consider the effect f the taking on
12 the public trust, and to preserve, so far as consistent with the public interest, the uses protected by the trust.
13 Id., citations omitted.
14 68. "Public trust easements are traditionally defined in terms of navigation,
15 commerce and fisheries. They have been held to include the right to fish, hunt, bathe, swim, to
'16 fuse for boating and general: recreation purposes the navigable waters of the state, and to use the
17 bottom of the navigable waters for anchoring, standing, or other purposes." Marks v. Whitney
18 (1971) 6 Cal.3d 251, 259. For nearly 50 years it has been settled law in California that public
19 trust values also "encompass] the preservation of those lands in their natural state, so that
20

21 they may serve as ecological units for scientific study, as open space, and as environments
which provide food and habitat for birds and marine life, and which favorably affect the
22 scenery and climate of the area."
23
69.
24 Although compliance with CEQA "may assist an agency in complying with its

25 duties under the public trust doctrine . [,] CEQA review of a project does not necessarily

26 br automatically satisfy the agency's affirmative duties to take the trust into account and protect

27 public trust uses whenever feasible." San Francisco Baykeeper, Inc. v. State Lands Com.,

28 supra, 29 Cal.App.5th at 571. "[A] public trust use is not any use that may confer a public

FIRST AM. & SUPP. VER. PIN FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR -25- DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, ATTORNEYS' FEES AND COSTS

benefit, but rather a use that facilitates public access, public enjoyment, or public use of trust

11 In approving the Project and certifying its Notices of Exemption, and taking

12 lother actions to approve and implement the Project, respondents and each of them failed to

13 proceed in the manner required by law and thereby abused their discretion in violation of

14 CEQA. Contrary to CEQA, Marin Water erroneously invoked, and the other respondents

1 critically important natural resource for California and the nation. It serves Californians
2 Iconcurrently as both the hub of the California water system and the most valuable estuary and

4 Act declares that "[t]he Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta watershed and California's water
5 infrastructure are in crisis and existing Delta policies are not sustainable. Resolving the crisis

6 requires fundamental reorganization of the state's management of Delta watershed resources."

7 Water Code § 85001, subd. (a).
8 75.. The Legislature declared that "existing Delta policies are not sustainable."

-.. 9 Water Code § 85001(a), emphasis added. To reform the Delta's mismanagement, the Act
10 declared the Legislature's "coequal goals" of restoring the Delta ecosystem and ensuring water
11 supply reliability. Water Code § 85054. The § Legislature found that eight "objectives" were
12 linherent in those coequal goals, including several that require public agencies whose actions
13 impact the Delta to "[r]estore the Delta ecosystem, including its. fisheries and wildlife, as the
14 2 heart of a healthy estuary and wetland ecosystem, "[p]romote statewide water conservation,
15 water use efficiency, and sustainable water use," and "[i]mprove water quality to protect
16 human health and the environment consistent with achieving water quality objectives in the
17 Delta." Water Code § 85020, subds. (c), (d) and (e).
18 76. The Legislature also declared that:
19 The policy of the State of California is to reduce reliance on the Delta in meeting
20 California's future water supply needs through a statewide strategy of investing in improved regional supplies, conservation, and water use efficiency. Each
21 region that depends on water from the Delta watershed shall improve its regional self-reliance for water through investment in water use efficiency, water

23 and improved regional coordination of local and regional water supply efforts.
Water Code § 85021 (emphasis added).
24
77.
25 The Delta Reform Act requires any state agency "that proposes to undertake a

26 covered action" to "prepare a written certification of consistency with detailed findings as to

27 whether the covered action is consistent with the Delta Plan" and submit that written finding to

28 the Delta Stewardship Council. Water Code § 85225.

FIRST AM. & SUPP. VER. PIN FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR -27- DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, ATTORNEYS' FEES AND COSTS

1 78. The Act defines "[c]overed action" as "a plan, program or project" as defined
2 Jby Public Resources Code section 21065 [of CEQA] that:

3

4 (1) Will occur, in whole or in part, within the boundaries of the Delta or Suisun Marsh.

5 (2) Will be carried out, approved, or funded by the state or a local public
agency.
(3) Is covered by one or more provisions of the Delta Plan. P 890451 .,..

6 (4) Will have a significant impact on achievement of one or both of the coequal

7 goals or the implementation of government-sponsored flood control programs to reduce risks to people, property, and state interests in the Delta.

8 Water Code. § 85057.5, subd. (a).
9 79:

10 The Project is a "covered action" because it diverts water from the Delta and

11 those diversions will have a significant impact on achievement of the Act's co-equal goal of

12 "protecting, restoring, and enhancing the Delta ecosystem." Water Code § 85054.

80. •
13 Although the Project is a "covered action" as defined in Water Code section

14 85057.5 and does not qualify for an exemption therefrom, respondents and each of them failed

15 to "prepare a written certification of consistency with detailed findings as to whether the

16 covered action is consistent with the Delta Plan" and submit that written finding to the Delta.

17 Stewardship Council" as required by Water Code section 85225.

81.
18 Should respondents belatedly make and submit this finding to the Delta

19 /Stewardship Council as required by Water Code sections 85225.10 et seq., petitioner would

20 lappeal such a finding, but are prevented from doing so by respondents' unlawful failure to

21 make this required finding in the first place. The Delta Reform Act forbids respondents from

22 approving the Project without first making a determination of consistency with the Delta Plan.

23 Water Code § 85225.

82.
24 Respondents' failure to prepare and submit this certification before Project

8 Ireference. The paragraphs set forth above are realleged and incorporated herein by

85.

10 Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law and abused their *

11 Idiscretion in purporting to approve the Project because such approvals violate the Public Trust

12 Doctrine in the following respects, among others.

86.
13 The Public Trust Doctrine protects the Delta's imperiled fish and wildlife and

14 other public trust resources and uses from avoidable harm whenever it is feasible to do so.

15 National Audubon, supra, 33 Cal.3d at 426. In adopting the Delta Reform Act, the Legislature

16 directed that. "the public trust doctrine shall be the foundation of state water management policy

17 land [is] particularly important and applicable to the Delta." Water Code § 85023.

87.
18 Contrary to this mandate, respondents have taken no steps to reduce or avoid the

19 Project's foreseeable harms to the Delta's imperiled public trust resources before approving the

20 Project. Instead, the Project would exacerbate the existing unsustainable levels of Delta exports

21 that will needlessly harm public trust resources.

88.
22 Respondents' approval of the Project evinces no consideration of feasible

23 alternatives and mitigation measures that would protect and restore the Delta's ecological

24 functions. Because the Project harms rather than protects the Delta's fish and wildlife, without

25 taking feasible measures to avoid or reduce those harms to insignificance, it violates the Public

26 Trust Doctrine.

27 89. In summary, respondents' approvals of the Project violate the Public Trust

28 Doctrine because respondents failed to perform their affirmative duty to consider the Project's

FIRST AM. & SUPP. VER. PTN FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR

1 impact "upon interests protected by the public trust, and attempt, so far as feasible, to avoid or
2 minimize any harm to those interests." National Audubon,, supra, 33 Cal.3d at 426.

3 90. For each of these reasons, respondents failed to proceed in the manner required
4 by law and their approvals of the Project are therefore an abuse of discretion. Accordingly,

5 those approvals must be declared invalid and set aside.
