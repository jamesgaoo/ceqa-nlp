Petitioner, FRIENDS OF SOUTH CARTHAY ("Petitioner"), alleges through this Verified

4 Petition for Writ of Mandate ("Petition") as follows:

5
INTRODUCTION
6

7 1. Petitioner challenges the approval by Respondent City of Los Angeles ("City" or
"Respondent") of a Sustainable Communities Environmental Assessment ("SCEA") and related

© discretionary approvals including Transit Oriented Communities ("TOC") incentives and Site Plan

10 Review (together, the "Project Approvals") for the 1050 La Cienega Boulevard Project ("Project").

11 The City failed to follow the required procedures of the California Environmental Quality Act

12 ("CEQA") and violated Petitioner's due process rights when it adopted the SCEA for the Project.

13 2. The City failed to comply with CEQA's substantive and procedural requirements for the

14 adoption of the SCEA. In particular, the Project was not eligible for a SCEA; the Project is not

15 consistent with the applicable Regional Transportation Plan/Sustainable Communities Strategy

16 ("RTP/SCS"); the City failed to incorporate mitigation measures from prior EIRs; the City failed to

17 identify significant impacts; the City failed to adopt all feasible mitigation measures for significant

18 impacts; the City failed to comply with the notice and hearing procedures for a SCEA; and the City

19 violated Petitioner's due process rights by failing to give Petitioner adequate notice or an opportunity

20 to be heard and respond.

21 3. During the administrative review process, several interested parties including Petitioner

22 notified the City that the SCEA was deficient. Petitioner identified numerous violations of CEQA in

23 its objection letters and in testimony at City hearings. In spite of these reasoned comments in the

24 record, the City granted the Project approvals and approved the SCEA.

25 4. Petitioner requests that this Court vacate, set aside, rescind and void all of the Project

26 Approvals considered by Respondent, including rescinding any authorizations to proceed with

27 construction. The City failed to comply with the provisions of CEQA and therefore failed to proceed

28 in a manner required by law.
2
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

5. Petitioner seeks a Peremptory Writ of Mandate under California Code of Civil Procedure

2 section 1094.5, directing Respondent to vacate, rescind and set aside all Project Approvals and the

3 environmental determination because Respondent failed to comply with CEQA.

4 6. The City's approval of the Project will cause Petitioner irreparable injury for which

5 Petitioner has no adequate remedy at law. Petitioner and its members will be irreparably harmed by

0 the City's actions in approving the Project. Petitioner was harmed by, among other things, the failure

7 of the City to identify a proper Project description, to identify significant impacts, to mitigate

8 significant impacts, to develop in conformity with the RTP/SCS and to properly notice the hearing.

9 Petitioner and its members will also be irreparably harmed by the City's actions in granting the

10 Project Approvals including any authorization to proceed with construction based thereon.

11 7. The maintenance of this action is for the purpose of enforcing important public policies of

12 the State of California with respect to the protection of the environment under CEQA and
13 conformance with state law and local law. The maintenance and prosecution of this action will confer

14 a substantial benefit upon the public by protecting the public from environmental and other harms
15 alleged in this Petition. Petitioner is acting as a private attorney general to enforce these public

16 policies and prevent such harm.

17
PARTIES
18

19 8. Petitioner Friends of South Carthay is an unincorporated association composed of

20 individuals residing within the South Carthay neighborhood of the City of Los Angeles. Petitioner's

21 goals include protecting the South Carthay neighborhood from incompatible, out-of-scale

22 development, ensuring compliance with local development regulations and protecting the

23 environment for the enjoyment of its members and the public. Petitioner and its respective members

24 have a direct and substantial beneficial interest in ensuring that Respondent complies with laws

25 relating to environmental protection. Petitioner and its respective members are adversely affected by

26 Respondent's failure to comply with CEQA and violating Petitioner's due process rights. Petitioner

27

28

3
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 has standing to assert the claims raised in this Petition because Petitioner and its members' aesthetic

2 and environmental interests are directly and adversely affected by Respondent's approval of the

3 Project.

4 9. Respondent City of Los Angeles is a charter city and municipal corporation within the

5 State of California. The City is charged with the authority of regulating and administering local land

6 use and development within its territory in compliance with CEQA. The City is the lead agency under

7 CEQA.

8 10. Petitioner is informed and believes and based thereon alleges that Real Party in Interest

9 1050 LA CIENEGA, LLC, a California limited liability corporation, is the applicant for the Project.

10 11. Petitioner is informed and believes and based thereon alleges that Real Party in Interest CP

11 VIII LA CIENEGA, LLC, a California limited liability corporation, is the owner of the Project site.

12 12. Petitioner is ignorant of the true names and capacities of Real Parties sued herein as DOES

13 1-25, inclusive, and therefore sues these Real Parties by fictitious names. Petitioner will amend this

14 Petition to allege the true names and capacities of fictitiously named Real Parties in Interest.

15 Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that each Respondent designated herein as a

16 DOE has some responsibility for the events and happenings alleged in this Petition.

17 13. Members of Petitioner and other interested persons made oral and written comments on

18 the Project and raised many of the legal deficiencies asserted in this petition.

19 JURISDICTION AND VENUE
20

21 14. This Court has jurisdiction over the writ action under section 1094.5 of the Code of Civil

22 Procedure, and sections 21168 and 21168.5 of the Public Resources Code.

23 15. This Court also has jurisdiction over the writ action under section 1085 of the Code of

24 Civil Procedure.

25 16. Venue for this action properly lies in the Los Angeles County Superior Court because

26 Respondent and the Project are located in Los Angeles County. Further, Venue is proper in this Court

27 pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Sections 393 and 394 because the Project is located in, and the

28 relevant events occurred in Los Angeles County.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

SETTING AND PROJECT DESCRIPTION

2 17. The Project Site is located on the east side of La Cienega Boulevard, between Olympic

3 Boulevard and Whitworth Drive. The Site consists of 10 parcels zoned C2-1-O, located in the

4 Wilshire Community Plan. The Project Site is zoned C2-1-0 (Commercial zone in Height District 1,

5 Oil Drilling District) with a General Plan designation of General Commercial. The C2 zone allows for

6 Retail w/ Limited Manufacturing, Service Stations and Garages, Retail Contr. Business, Churches,

7 Schools, Auto Sales, and R4 Uses. Height District 1 allows for a Floor Area Ratio ("FAR") of 1.5:1.

8 18. The designated historic resource closest to the City is the South Carthay Historic

9 Preservation Overlay Zone ("HPOZ"), located directly east of the Site with the nearest contributors

10 consisting of the residential buildings along Alfred Street. The Project Site is not in the HPOZ.

11 19. The Project site is considered to be in both a High Quality Transit Area ("HQTA") and a

12 Transit Priority Area ("TPA"). The Project site is subject to ZI-2498 - Local Emergency Temporary
13 Regulations - Time Limits and Parking Relief. It is also located in a Methane Zone.

14 20. The Project entails the removal of a vacant lot and the construction of a new 332-foot in

15 height, 28-story, 297,690-square-foot, mixed-use building with 290 dwelling units, including 29

16 Extremely Low Income affordable housing units, and approximately 7,500 square feet of new
17 commercial restaurant use. The Project includes 426 vehicle parking spaces, 184 bicycle parking

18 spaces, and 54,540 square feet of open space.

19 21. The Project required the following approvals:

20 1. Pursuant to LAMC Section 12.22 A.31 and the Transit Oriented Communities
21 Affordable Housing Incentive Program Guidelines (TOC Guidelines), approval of a 290-unit Tier 3 TOC development that would set aside 10 percent (29 units) of the
22 Project's total number of units for Extremely Low Income households and would
utilize the following Base and Additional Incentives: Base Incentives:
23 a. Up to 70 percent increase in density (TOC Guidelines, Section VI.1.a.iii);

24 b. 0.5 minimum required parking spaces for residential units (TOC Guidelines, Section VI.2.a.i.4);
25 C. 30 percent parking reduction for nonresidential (TOC Guidelines, Section VI.2.e.iii);
26

27

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

d. FAR of a 3.75:1 in a commercial zone. (TOC Guidelines, Section VI.1.b.iii), Additional Incentives: e. Utilize any or all of the yard requirements for the RAS3 zone per LAMC 12.10.5 (TOC Guidelines, Section VII.1.a.i). 2
2. Pursuant to LAMC Sections 16.05.C and 16.05.D, site plan review for a project for
3 which by-right units minus existing units is greater than 50 units.

4

5 22. The Project building includes a 3-story podium to house vehicle parking, commercial

6 restaurant space, residential amenities, and an open space roof deck. The podium would have a

7 15-foot setback from the east property line, a 30-foot setback from the north property line, a 13-foot

8 setback from the sidewalk to the west, and a 5-foot setback from the south property line. The
requested incentives would thus allow for the podium to be constructed closer to the HPOZ which

10 abuts the east property line.

11 23. The Project's 3-story podium would thus be constructed just 15 feet from its property line

12 with the adjacent National Register-listed Carthay Neighborhoods Historic District and City-adopted

13 South Carthay HPOZ. The roof deck on the fourth floor would be landscaped and include a

14 swimming pool and would thus overlook the yards of houses along S. Alfred Street in the Historic

15 District and HPOZ.

16 PROJECT BACKGROUND, REVIEW AND APPROVAL
--e.. ........ 17

18 24. The City prepared a SCEA to complete the Project's required CEQA review after

19 determining that it qualified as a Transit Priority Project. The public comment period for the SCEA

20 was between September 8, 2022 and ended October 21, 2022. Dozens of members of the public

21 objected to the SCEA with many focusing on the inadequacy of the historic and aesthetic analysis.

22 25. On October 10 2022, Southwest Regional Council of Carpenter submitted an objection ***
23 letter noting deficiencies in the SCEA.

24 26. On October 21 2022, Petitioner submitted an objection letter noting numerous deficiencies

25 in the SCEA including the Project's ineligibility for the SCEA, the failure to adopt required mitigation

26 measures and the failure to identify significant impacts.

27 27. On November 1 2022, numerous objection letters were submitted to the Planning and Land
Use Management Committee of the City Council. The Southwest Regional Council of Carpenters 28

6
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

submitted an objection letter noting further deficiencies in the SCEA. Two objection letters from from

2 Walter Dominguez and from Petitioner specifically objected to historic and aesthetic analysis.

3 28. On November 1, 2022, the Planning and Land Use Management ("PLUM") Committee of

4 the City Council held a public hearing for the Project at which members of the public objected to the

5 Project approvals. The City failed to adopt additional requirements to mitigate public health risks

6 from the Project's construction activities, such as requiring safe on-site construction work practices as

7 well as training and certification for any construction workers on the Project Site.

8 29. On November 21, 2022, Petitioner submitted a supplemental objection letter including

9 allegations that the City failed to provide adequate notice and violated Petitioner's due process rights.

10 30. On November 22, 2022, the City adopted the recommendation of the PLUM committee

11 and adopted the SCEA.

12
CEQA'S SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS 13

14 31. CEQA's primary purposes are to: "inform governmental decisionmakers and the public of
15 a project's potential significant environmental effects before a project is approved and those effects

16 become irreversible, identify ways that environmental damage can be mitigated by requiring the

17 adoption of feasible alternatives or feasible mitigation measures and disclose to the public a

18 governmental agency's reasons for approving a project with significant environmental impacts."

19 CEQA Guidelines, § 15002, subd. (a). To achieve these goals, CEQA requires an Environmental

20 Impact Report (EIR) for any project that may have a significant effect on the environment. The

21 California Supreme Court described the EIR as the "heart of CEQA" and an "environmental 'alarm

22 bell' whose purpose it is to alert the public and its responsible officials to environmental changes

23 before they have reached ecological points of no return." (Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. V.

24 Regents of University of California (1988) 47 Cal. 3d 376, 392.)

25 32. The Sustainable Communities and Climate Protection Act, commonly known as SB 375,

26 sought to integrate transportation and land use planning to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. SB 375

27 directed the state Air Resources Board to develop regional emission reduction targets for automobiles

28 and light trucks. In turn, federally-designated metropolitan planning organizations that prepare
7
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1

2 regional transportation plans must include in those plans a "sustainable communities strategy" to
achieve the emission targets. Here the applicable plan is the Southern California Association of
3 Governments 2020-2024 RTP/SCS.

4

5 33. One type of development the Legislature determined can help reduce greenhouse gas

6 emissions from motor vehicles is a "transit priority project." A transit priority project is a

7 development project that contains at least 50 percent residential use, provides a minimum density of at

8 least 20 units per acre, and is located within one-half mile of a major transit stop or transit corridor.
(Pub. Resources Code, §21155, subd. (b).)

10 34. To encourage the development of transit priority projects, the Legislature in SB 375

11 limited the extent of environmental review that a local agency must perform under CEQA to approve

12 them. If a transit priority project (1) "js consistent with the general use designation, density, building

13 intensity, and applicable policies specified for the project area" in the strategy; and (2) incorporates all
feasible mitigation measures,

14 performance standards, and criteria set forth "in the prior applicable
environmental impact reports" and which

15 were adopted as findings, then the local agency may review

16 the project's environmental effects in a streamlined manner using an SCEA. (Pub. Resources Code,
§§21155, subd. (a), 21155.2, subds. (a), (b).)

17

18 35. Pursuant to Public Resources Code Section 21155.2, a SCEA may only be adopted for a
Transit Priority Project which has:

::t 19

20 incorporated all feasible mitigation measures, performance standards, or criteria set forth in applicable prior environmental impact reports;

21 prepared an initial study identifying all potentially significant environmental impacts
except for those identified in Public Resources Code section 21159.28;

22 mitigated to levels of insignificance potentially significant impacts identified in the initial study;
23

24 circulated a draft SCEA for public comment not less than 30 days;
conducted a public hearing before the legislative body.

25

26 36. The SCEA must include an accurate, stable, and consistent description of the proposed

27 project. The project description must contain sufficient specific information about the project to allow

28

8
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

a complete evaluation and review of its environmental impacts. 14 Cal Code Regs § 15124. A "finite

2 description is indispensable to an informative, legally adequate EIR." County of Inyo v. City of Los

3 Angeles (1977) 71 CA3d 185, 192, 199.

4 37. CEQA requires that all measures undertaken to reduce a project's significant

5 environmental effects be enforceable. Pub. Resource Code§ 221081; CEQA Guidelines§ 15126.4

6 (a)(2). This requirement is designed to ensure that mitigation will be implemented as a condition of

7 development, and not merely adopted and then neglected or disregarded. Federation of Hillside V.

8 Canyon Ass 'ns V. City of Los Angeles (2000) 83 Cal. App. 4th 1252, 12561. While the same

9 Guidelines section 15126.5(a)(1)(B) acknowledges an exception to the rule against deferrals, such

10 exception is narrowly proscribed to situations where it is impractical or infeasible to include those

11 details during the project's environmental review. Thus, mitigations measures adopted pursuant to an

12 SCEA to mitigate or avoid a project's significant impacts on the environment must be "fully

13 enforceable through permit conditions, agreements, or other measures." (Pub. Resource

14 Does, § 21081.6, subd. (b).)

15
EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES
16

17 38. During all phases of the Project's administrative review process, Petitioner commented to

18 the City that the Project would violate CEQA.

19 39. As: result of these comments in the record, Petitioner exhausted its administrative
20 remedies within the meaning of Cal. Public Resources Code § 21177.

21 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
22 (Violation of CEQA)
23
Inadequate Project Description and Setting 24

25 40. The SCEA provides an inadequate Project Description and an inaccurate Environmental

26 Setting in violation of CEQA Guidelines sections 15124 and 15125.

27

28

9
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

41. The Project Description fails to include a full description of the nature and design of the

2 Project's foundation system as this will affect noise and vibration impacts during construction and the

3 feasibility of the recommended mitigation measures.

4 42. The Project Description fails to disclose the nature and design of the methane mitigation

5 system for the Project.

6 43. The Project Description fails to include full disclosure of dewatering requirements for the

7 Project and whether dewatering is only required during construction or if it is required throughout the

8 life of the Project.
44. The Project Description fails to disclose required on-site well abandonment-related permits

10 required for the Project.

11 45. The Environmental Setting inaccurately show the garages for properties along Alfred

12 Street as set back from the shared property line, but this is not the case. Failure to accurately show the

13 proximity of historic structures to the proposed Project has resulted in a failure to identify significant

14 unmitigated Project impacts.

15 46. The Environmental Setting creates the false impression that there are similar tall buildings

16 in close proximity to the historic district and HPOZ abutting the Project site The SCEA needs to

17 include a map showing the location of these cited buildings in proximity to the Historic District and

18 the three HPOZs. All of these buildings are located on Wilshire Boulevard. Wilshire Boulevard abuts

19 only a very small portion of the Cathay Circle HPOZ. None of these taller buildings are located

20 anywhere near the South Carthay HPOZ which abuts the Project site. They are therefore irrelevant to

21 an analysis of the impact of the proposed Project on the South Carthay HPOZ. Furthermore, the

22 statement that all of these buildings are within 0.5-mile radius of the site is false. Two of the cited

23 buildings are located further than 2,640 feet (0.5 miles) of the Project site.

24

25 Ineligibility for a SCEA

26 47. The City erred and abused its discretion approving the SCEA because the Project is not

27 consistent with the RTP/SCS as required by Public Resources Code Section 21155.

28
10
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

48. The proposed Project is not eligible for a SCEA because the Project contains too many

2 residential units, is not 15 percent more energy efficient than required by Chapter 6 of Title 24 of the

3 California Code of Regulations and the buildings and landscaping are not designed to achieve 25

4 percent less water usage than the average household use in the region, and the hazardous materials

5 issues associated with the site have not been adequately mitigated. Therefore the Project is not eligible

6 for a SCEA per Public Resources Code Section 21155.1. An EIR is therefore required for the

7 proposed Project.

8 49. Given that the City's adopted Housing Element will result in growth in excess of that

Q analyzed in the RTP/SCS, further exacerbated by recent State legislation such as SB9, SB10 and

10 SB35, no project which results in additional density within the City of Los Angeles is consistent with

11 it the RTP/SCS, since it cannot be shown that the proposed Project in combination with the cumulative

12 development resulting from implementation of the Housing Element and recent State laws will not

13 exceed the SCS growth forecasts for the Project area. It therefore cannot be shown that the Project in

14 combination with cumulative development is consistent with the general use designations, density,

15 building intensity, and applicable policies specified for the project area in the strategy.

16 50. The SCEA fails to provide any specifics regarding the density and building intensity

17 included in the RTP/SCS for the claimed three Priority Growth Areas. Consistency with the density

18 and intensity assumed in the RTP/SCS for the Project area has therefore not been demonstrated or

19 supported by substantial evidence.

20 51. The RTP/SCS specifies that in High Quality Transit Areas (HQTAs): "Active

21 transportation and new developments should be context sensitive, responding to the existing physical

22 conditions of the surrounding area. Sensitively designed TODs can preserve existing development

23 patterns and neighborhood character while providing a balance of modal and housing choices."

24 52. The height and density of the proposed Project is not context-sensitive to the adjacent
25 National Register Historic District and HPOZ. The proposed Project would result in construction

26 within 15-feet of historic structures and a 28-story high density building adjacent to a low-density

27 historic neighborhood. The proposed Project is thus not consistent with the development objectives

28 for HQTA's in the RTP/SCS.

11
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

53. Similarly, the RTP/SCS specifies that Livable Corridors development result in context

2 sensitive density stating: "The Livable Corridors strategy is comprised of three components that will
encourage context sensitive density. .." In failing to provide context sensitive density, the proposed

4 Project is inconsistent with both the RTP/SCS's HQTA and Livable Corridors strategies.

5 54. RTP/SCS Goal 2 - "Improve mobility, accessibility, reliability, and travel safety for people

6 and goods." The proposed Project would increase bicycle use in an area with insufficient bicycle

7 infrastructure, exacerbating existing bicycle safety issues. In addition, the Project fails to provide

8 15-foot sidewalk along the Project frontage as required in the City's Mobility Element and will not
result in the target level of pedestrian safety. The Project is therefore not consistent with RTP/SCS

10 Goal 2.

11 55. RTP/SCS Goal 6 - "Support healthy and equitable communities." The proposed Project

12 would introduce a 28-story building immediately adjacent to an Historic District and HPOZ. The

13 Project would introduce a new source of light and glare and shade and shadows and would be visible

14 from within the Historic District and adjacent HPOZ. The Project will therefore have an aesthetic

15 impact on the historic community. The Project is therefore not consistent with RTP/SCS Goal 6.

16 56. Similarly, the Project is not consistent with RTP/SCS Guiding Principal 3 - "Assure that

17 land use and growth strategies recognize local input, promote sustainable transportation options, and

18 support equitable and adaptable communities."

19 57. The proposed Project is not consistent with the development objectives and definition of

20 High Quality Transit Areas (HQTAs) or the Livable Corridors in the RTP/SCS, due to its failure to

21 provide context sensitive density. Given the proposed Project's excessive height and density in

22 combination with its location immediately adjacent to an important single-family historic district, the

23 proposed Project is thus not consistent with the density assumptions in the RTP/SCS which are based

24 on context sensitive densities. Whether or not the project is consistent with some of the SCS policies

25 is immaterial given that the proposed Project fails to meet the definition of either High Quality Transit

26 Areas (HQTAs) or the Livable Corridors in the RTP/SCS.

27 58. The proposed Project is inconsistent with the RTP/SCS strategy of preserving and

28 rehabilitating affordable housing and preventing displacement. The proposed Project may result in the
12
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 displacement of residents of the Historic District and HPOZ who are bothered by the aesthetic and

2 light and glare impacts of the project. To the degree that the Project makes the HPOZ area less

3 desirable, it may hinder the rehabilitation and maintenance of these historic residences.

4 59. The Project is inconsistent with the RTP/SCS strategy of identifying ways to improve

5 access to public park space. Project open space and landscaped areas are primarily for use by the

6 tenants. Little public is open space is provided and what is provided may not be readily apparent to non-

7 residents of the Project.

8
Failure to Incorporate Mitigation Measures from Prior EIRs 9

10 60. Section 4 of the SCEA identifies all of the mitigation measures contained in the Mitigation

11 Monitoring and Reporting Program (MMRP) for SCAG's 2020-2045 RTP/SCS Program EIR and

12 provides a discussion of the applicability of the mitigation measures to the Project. However, this is
13 not sufficient to meet the requirements for use of an SCEA. PRC Section 211552(a) provides for use

14 of a SCEA for: "(a) A transit priority project that has incorporated all feasible mitigation measures,

15 performance standards, or criteria set forth in the prior applicable environmental impact reports

16 and adopted in findings made pursuant to Section 21081 . . ." (Emphasis added).
17 61. The SCEA fails to demonstrate that the project has incorporated all feasible mitigation

18 measures, performance standards, or criteria set forth in all of the prior applicable environmental

19 impact reports including but not limited to the EIR's for the:

20 • Wilshire Community Plan Update (SCH # 1997081033)
21 Mobility Plan 2035 (SCH#2013041012) - the City's Mobility Element Update

22 Housing Element 2021-2029 Update/Safety Element Update (SCH#20211010130)

23 62. The Project will result in aesthetic impacts on historic resources, and the City is required to

24 consider acsthetic impacts to historic resources. The SCEA has failed to require compliance with

25 RTP/SCS EIR Mitigation PMM AES-1, AES-2 and AES-3. The scale of the Project is clearly

26 inconsistent with PMM AES-2 which requires minimizing the contrasts in scale and massing between

27

28

13
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 projects and the surrounding development. In addition, given the Project's height and residential

2 nature, it will result in light impacts on the adjacent Historic District and HPOZ, yet the SCEA does

3 not require compliance with AES-3. The Project is thus not eligible for an SCEA.

4 63. There are a number of feasible mitigation measures from the RTP/SCS EIR which the

5 SCEA says do not apply to the Project due to a lack of Project-specific impacts for those issue areas,

6 however, that is not what is required by PRC Section 211552(a), which requires incorporation of all

7 feasible mitigation measures, performance standards, or criteria set forth in the prior applicable

8 environmental impact reports. The SCEA's failure to require compliance with all feasible RTP/SCS

9 mitigation measures invalidates the SCEA. This includes failure to require demonstrated compliance

10 with PMM AQ-1, BIO-1 to BIO-6, GEO-1, GHG-1, HAZ-1 to HAZ-7, HYD-1 to HYD-5, LU-2,

11 MIN-1, Noise-1 to Noise-2, PSP-1, PSS-1, PSL-1, TRA-2, USWW-I, USWS-1, etc., without

12 demonstrating that the Project will be required to comply with an equal or more effective measure that

13 addresses all of the components of the RTP/SCS mitigation measure. In the case of measures such as

14 biological resource mitigation measures where the resource of concern is not present on the Project

15 site, compliance should be demonstrated by documenting the lack of the resource as part of the

16 mitigation monitoring process, but the mitigation must still apply.

17 Failure to Identify Potentially Significant Impacts
18

19 64. The City erred and abused its discretion by finding that the SCEA identified all potentially

20 significant impacts as required by Public Resources Code Section 21155.2, subdivision (b)(5)(A).

21 65. Aesthetics. The SCEA erroneously asserts that the Project is immune from an analysis of

22 aesthetic resource impacts, since it is located in proximity to historic resources. Goal 5 of the Wilshire

23 Community Plan is to: provide sufficient open space is balance with development to serve the

24 recreational, environmental, health and safety needs of the Wilshire Community Plan, and protect

25 environmental and aesthetic resources. The Plan thus contains aesthetic resource goals.

26 66. The SCEA fails to characterize anticipated light spillage from all of the apartments in the

27 tower. The SCEA needs to fully disclose the likely light visibility of the Project.

28
14
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

67. Energy. With respect to energy impacts, CEQA Guidelines § 15126.2(b) requires that an

2 environmental review document consider "the project's energy use for all project phases and
components, including transportation-related energy, during construction and operation" to assess

4 whether a project will result in wasteful, inefficient, or unnecessary consumption of energy. As noted
in the SCEA, analysis to determine whether a project will result in wasteful, inefficient, or
6 unnecessary consumption of energy should include "[t]he project's energy requirements and it energy

7 use efficiencies by amount and fuel type for each stage of the project" (emphasis added). Similarly,

8 for utility impacts, the SCEA requires consideration of whether the Project will "result in the
relocation or construction of new or expanded. .. electrical power [and] natural gas" facilities.

10 68. Here, the SCEA does not even attempt to quantify the Project's estimated energy

11 consumption during its construction phase. This is particularly disconcerting given that the SCEA

12 estimates that the construction phase is expected to last about 32 months, i.e. over two years. Instead,

13 the SCEA blanketly asserts that "[o]verall, construction activities associated with the Project would

14 require limited electricity generation that would not be expected to have an adverse impact on

15 available electricity supplies." Thus, the SCEA places the cart before the horse in speculating that the

16 Project's energy and utility impacts will be less than significant without even assessing the Project's

17 anticipated construction related energy consumption. Without such analysis and information, the

18 SCEA's less than significant findings are no more than speculative.

19 69. Hazards. The SCEA failed to identify potentially significant public hazard impacts from
20 COVID-19 exposure. Construction work has been defined as a Lower to High-risk activity for

21 COVID-19 spread by the Occupations Safety and Health Administration. Recently, several

22 construction sites have been identified as sources of community spread of COVID-19.

23 70. Historic resources. The SCEA failed to adequately analyze cumulative impacts on climate

24 change other than from vehicles and cumulative impacts on transportation. The SCEA fails to analyze

25 the potential cumulative aesthetic impacts of the proposed Project and related Projects on the Historic

26 District and the HPOZs.

27 71. Cumulative impacts. The cumulative impacts analysis is inadequate. As explained in

28 SCEA Section 2.5, the analysis only addresses "reasonably foreseeable related projects within a
15
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

-

2 0.5-mile radius of the Project Site." The SCEA fails to provide a rationale for limiting the analysis to

3 only projects within a 0.5-mile radius of the Project Site, particularly given that one of the issues is

4 potential cumulative impacts to an Historic District. This does not comply with CEQA Guidelines
Section 15130 (b)(2) and (3) which specifies:

5

6 (2) When utilizing a list, as suggested in paragraph (1) of subdivision (b), factors to consider when determining whether to include related project should include the

7 nature of each environmental resource being examined, the location of the project and its type. Location may be important, for example, when water quality impacts are at

8 issue since projects outside the watershed would probably not contribute to: cumulative effect. Project type may be important, for example, when the impact is

9 specialized, such as a particular air pollutant or mode of traffic.

10 (3) Lead agencies should define the geographic scope of the area affected by the cumulative effect and provide a reasonable explanation for the geographic limitation used.

11
12 Failure to Mitigate Potentially Significant Impacts

13

14 72. The City erred and abused its discretion by finding that the SCEA adopted all feasible

15 mitigation measures for significant impacts as required by Public Resources Code Section 21155.2,
subdivision (b)(5)(B).

16

17 73. Historic Resources. The SCEA failed to adopt sufficient mitigation measures to reduce

18 significant impacts to historic resources to less-than-significant levels including reduction in mass and
additional setbacks.

19

20 74. Hazardous Materials. The SCEA improperly defers mitigation of TPH-gasoline and VOC

21 impacts. First, although the SCEA provides that "[bJased on the groundwater data, the groundwater at

22 the Site is impacted with constituents associated with gas stations (TPH-gasoline, benzene,

23 ethylbenzene)", it defers the measures it implements to mitigate such impacts. Specifically, the SCEA

24 implements mitigation measures such as requiring a soil management plan ("SMP") and retention of a

25 dewatering contractor. With regard to the SMP (MM-HAZ-1), the SCEA provides that it will be

26 prepared at some unspecified time in the future by an unspecified and yet to be determined

27 environmental consultant. Similarly, for the dewatering contractor (MM-HAZ-2), the SCEA confirms

28
16
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

that such contractor has yet to be retained, fails to provide required qualifications for the contractor,

2 and fails to provide design specifications. The SCEA does not specify why it is infeasible to prepare

3 these plans before Project approval.

4 75. Moreover methane mitigation has been improperly deferred and methane impacts

5 insufficiently analyzed.

6 76. In light of these deficiencies, the Project's hazardous material impacts are not truly

7 mitigated, rendering the Project ineligible for SCEA review in the first place. See PRC section
8 21155.1(a)(4)(B) [holding a that a project is only eligible for SCEA review if "a potential for exposure

9 to significant hazards from surrounding properties or activities. .. [is] mitigated to a level of a

10 insignificance"]. Thus, in addition to needing to rectify its mitigation measures, a full EIR should be

11 prepared for the Project since it does not comply with all of the SCEA eligibility requirements.

12 77. Noise/Vibration. The SCEA's noise mitigation measures, implemented to mitigate the

13 Project's significant noise levels on nearby sensitive receptors such as a temple, school, park, senior

14 living community, and residences, are ineffective and improperly deferred. For example, the SCEA

15 implements MM-NOI-1 to require sound barriers along the Project's eastern boundary which are "to

16 achieve a sound attenuation of at least 15 dBA" and which shall be "a minimum of 20 feet in height."

17 Similarly, the SCEA implements MM-NOI-3 to require sound barriers along the Project's western

18 boundary which are also "to achieve a sound attenuation of at least 15 dBA" and which shall be "a

19 minimum of 7 feet in height."

20 78. However, assuming the barriers sit on the ground at the perimeter of the Project, the

21 barriers would not adequately mitigate noise sources elevated above the ground level as construction

22 of the building progresses. The mitigation measures must be revised to fully explain how noise

23 barriers would be used to mitigate noise impacts at a minimum of 15 dBA for elevated sources during

24 construction of the twenty eight-story building. The SCEA does not specify why it is infeasible to

25 prepare these plans before Project approval.

26 79. To "ensure that the Project's construction does not expose South Alfred Street Residences

27 and a commercial building at 1080 La Cienega Boulevard to potentially damaging levels of

28 groundborne vibration", the SCEA implements a number of mitigation measures such as requiring a
17
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

#

pre-construction survey to be performed and implementation of a groundborne vibration and

2 structural/architectural monitoring program (MM-NOI-10). However, the SCEA notes that such pre-

3 construction surveys have yet to be prepared rendering it impossible to determine the feasibility of

4 mitigating vibration impacts to historic structures. The SCEA does not specify why it is infeasible to

5 prepare these plans before Project approval.

6 80. Public Health Hazards. The SCEA failed to require a local hire program to mitigate

7 greenhouse gas and air quality impacts as recommended by SWAPE report.

8 81. Transportation. The SCEA also improperly defers its transportation project design feature,
a mitigation measure in essence designed to "ensure that adequate emergency access exists during
10 construction." The SCEA provides that "[p]rior to the start of construction, the Project Applicant shall

11 prepare a detailed Construction Traffic Management Plan (CTMP), including street closure

12 information, detour plans, haul routes, and staging plans, and submit it to LADOT for review and

13 approval" (emphasis added). Thus, the SCEA's transportation mitigation measure is similarly deferred

14 as the plan has yet to be prepared nor circulated for public review and comment.

15

16 Failure to Properly Circulate SCEA

17 82. The City has failed to properly circulate the SCEA for a 30 a day public comment period.

18 Although the City did issue a notice for a public comments period starting on September 8, 2022 and

19 ending on October 21, 2022, the City failed to make the full document available on the City's website.

20 83. A member of the public seeking to access the SCEA on the City's website at the link

21 provided in the notice or from the City's SCEA webpage cannot access the actual SCEA and is

22 instead taken in a loop. A member of the public starting with the City's website for all the City

23 SCEAs,8 would find a link to what appears to be the SCEA document for the project, as shown in the

24 following screenshot. However, if one clicks on the link to the SCEA document, as late as October 18,

25 2022, one is taken back to the notice for the SCEA

26 84. And, the Notice for the SCEA contains a link taking one back to the City's page listing all

27 of the City's SCEAs shown in the proceeding screenshot. Here is the link that the Notice sends

28 members of the public to, to access the SCEA - it is the general SCEA list page.
18
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

85. Therefore, a member of the public seeking to read the SCEA cannot access it via the

2 instructions provided in the Notice of Availability. The City has, therefore, failed to properly Notice

3 and circulate the SCEA.

4 86. Furthermore, even if a member of the public is savvy enough to try to access the SCEA via

5 a search of the City's project records using the environmental case number, what they will ultimately

6 find is the body of the SCEA without any of the appendices. Thus, accessing the full SCEA requires

7 contacting planning staff and requesting that the document be sent specially to the desirous reader.

8 87. Public Resources Code ("PRC") Section 21155.2(3) requires the City to provide Notice of

0 an SCEA in a manner consistent with the requirements of PRC Section 21092. PRC Section

10 21092(b)(1) requires that the notice:

11 shall specify the period during which comments will be received on the draft
12 environmental impact report or negative declaration, and shall include the date, time, and place of any public meetings or hearings on the proposed project, a brief
13 description of the proposed project and its location, the significant effects on the environment, if any, anticipated as a result of the project, the address where copics of
14 the draft environmental impact report or negative declaration, and all documents referenced in the draft environmental impact report or negative declaration, are
15 available for review, and a description of how the draft environmental impact report or negative declaration can be provided in an electronic format. (Emphasis
16 added)

17 88. The City has therefore failed to comply with the Noticing requirements required by CEQA

18 for an SCEA, as the Notice fails to direct the public to an actual electronic copy of the document and

19 the full document is not available to the public anywhere on the City's website, even when members

20 of the public look on parts of the system not referenced in the Notice. The City has therefore failed to

21 comply with a requirement for use of an SCEA.

22
Failure to Hold Public Hearing Before the City Council
23

24 89. Public Resources Code Section 21155.2(b)(6) states that "[t]he legislative body of the lead

25 agency shall conduct the public hearing or a planning commission may conduct the public hearing .
26 Even if the City Council was allowed to approve the SCEA separate from and before the
27 approval of project entitlements (which they are not), it is the City Council itself that must conduct the

28 "public hearing." The City Council did not hold a public hearing. Rather, it was voted on as a consent
19
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 item as the agenda notes that the item has already had a public hearing before the Planning and Land

2 Use Management ("PLUM") Committee. The failure to conduct a "public hearing" before the

3 legislative body - the City Council - violates Public Resources Code Section 21155.2(b)(6). PLUM is

4 not the legislative body of the City of Los Angeles.

5 Failure to Provide Notice and Consider Comments
6

7 90. Public Resources Code Section 21155.2(b)(4) states as follows: "Prior to acting on the

8 sustainable communities environmental assessment, the lead agency shall consider all comments

9 received." Further, Public Resources Code Section 21155.2(b)(5) requires the lead agency to 'review'

10 the comments. The PLUM Committee failed to both "consider" and "review" the comments prior to

11 recommending approval to the City Council. The public comment period on the SCEA did not end

12 until Thursday, October 27, 2022 at 4 pm. These public comments were not populated to the Council

13 File Management System until November 1, 2022 - the day before the PLUM hearing. There is no

14 way that the PLUM Committee could have possibly reviewed and considered 429 pages of public

15 comments in such a short period of time. Moreover, in this case, staff did not even prepare a Staff

16 Report that summarized public comments received. The failure to notify most people that commented

17 on the SCEA of the public hearing before PLUM compounded the issue. Public hearings are a

18 primary means by which elected decisionmakers receive public comments on a project. A mere

19 recitation a in a PLUM report that such consideration occurred does not make it so.

20 91. The City Council thereafter approved the SCEA for the Project on November 22, 2022.

21 However, the actual project entitlements are still being processed by the Department of City Planning

22 ("DCP"). Approval of the SCEA by the City Council (separate from the project entitlements) violates

23 CEQA, CEQA is violated when the authority to approve or disapprove the project is separated from

24 the responsibility to complete the environmental review. Clews Land & Livestock, LLC v. City of San

25 Diego (2017) 19 Cal.App.5th 161, 188 ("for an environmental review document to serve CEQA's

26 basic purpose of informing governmental decision makers about environmental issues, that document

27 must be reviewed and considered by the same person of group of persons who make the decision to

28 approve or disapprove the project at issue"); Citizens for the Restoration of L Street v. City of Fresno
20
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

(2014) 229 Cal.App.4th 340, 360 (CEQA violated where the City Council did not make both

2 decisions. Rather, it considered only the mitigated negative declaration.) As explained in POET, LLC

3 V. State Air Resources Bd. (2013) 218 Cal.App.4th 681, 731: "[f]or an environmental review

4 document to serve CEQA's basic purpose of informing governmental decision makers about

5 environmental issues, that document must be reviewed and considered by the same person or group

6 of persons who make the decision to approve or disapprove the project at issue. In other words, the

7 separation of the approval function from the review and consideration of the environmental

8 assessment is inconsistent with the purpose served by an environmental assessment as it insulates the

9 person or group approving the project 'from public awareness and the possible reaction to the

10 individual members' environmental and economic values."

11 92. The project entitlements consist of both a Site Plan Review and TOC Approval. These

12 entitlements will be acted on by the Director of Planning and/or the City Planning Commission under

13 the Los Angeles Municipal Code. Both Site Plan Reviews and TOC Approvals are appealable to the

14 City Planning Commission. See LAMC Section 16.05(H). In order to comply with CEQA, the "same

15 person or group of persons who make the decision to approve or disapprove the project at issue" must

16 approve the SCEA. As noted in POET, LLC v. State Air Resources Bd., this is necessary for an

17 "environmental review document to serve CEQA's basic purpose of informing governmental decision

18 makers about environmental issues."

19 93. Public Resources Code Section 21155.2(b)(6) allows for the public hearing to be

20 conducted by the City Planning Commission. This section of the Code states as follows: "The

21 legislative body of the lead agency shall conduct the public hearing or a planning commission may

22 conduct the public hearing if local ordinances allow a direct appeal of approval of a document

23 prepared pursuant to this division to the legislative body subject to fee not to exceed five hundred

24 dollars ($500)." The City has a CEQA Appeal Ordinance that allows for an appeal of an

25 environmental clearance document to the City Council (Ordinance No. 186338). The City's CEQA

26 Appeal fee does not exceed $500. In sum, the approval of the SCEA by the City Council before any

27 entitlements had been processed violates CEQA.

SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (Violation of Due Process)

3 94. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in their

4 entirety, as though fully set forth herein.

5 95. Petitioner is entitled to procedural due process guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment

6 of the United States Constitution and Article 1, Section 7 of the California Constitution. Additionally,

7 California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1094.5 requires a fair hearing and a meaningful time and

8 opportunity to be heard and respond to evidence.

9 96. The City violated Petitioner's due process rights by failing to provide notice to Petitioner

10 of the PLUM Committee hearing or the City Council hearing. The City also violated Petitioner's due

11 process rights by not being given a meaningful opportunity to review a last minute letter submitted by

12 the applicant.

13 97. Despite the fact that Channel Law Group provided comments on the SCEA for the

14 proposed Project and specifically asked to be included on the interested parties list, the City did not

15 provide notice of either the Planning and Land Use Management Committee (PLUM) hearing on the

16 Project on November 1, 2022, or the City Council hearing on November 22, 2022.

17 98. Under state law, specifically California Code of Civil Procedure 1094.5, project opponents

18 must be given a fair hearing. This requires an opportunity to be heard "at a meaningful time and in a

19 meaningful manner." Further, one court has opined that due process "contemplates a meaningful

20 opportunity to present evidence contrary [to an application] and a meaningful consideration of

21 that evidence." Friends of South Carthay was not provided a meaningful opportunity to fully consider

22 the new evidence presented by the applicant's attorney and present contrary evidence. This letter was

23 not populated to and made publicly available on the Council File Management System until the

24 morning of November 22, 2022.

25 NOTICE OF COMMENCEMENT OF CEQA PROCEEDING
26

27 99. On December 21, 2022, prior to filing this Petition, Petitioner, through its counsel, served

28 the City with notice of Petitioner's intention to immediately commence a proceeding against
22

Respondent for violation of CEQA in connection with the Project. A copy of the letter providing such

2 notice is attached to this Petition as Exhibit A and is incorporated herein by this reference. This letter

3 satisfied Petitioner's duties under Public Resources Code section 21167.5.

4 100. On December 21, 2022, Petitioner, through its counsel, served the California Attorney

5 General with notice of the commencement of this lawsuit, together with a true and correct copy of this

6 Petition. A copy of such notice (without the copy of this Petition attached to such notice), together

7 with proof of service, is attached to this Petition as Exhibit B and is incorporated herein by this

12 101. Pursuant to Public Resources Code, section 21167.6(b)(2), Petitioner elects to prepare the

13 record of proceedings in this action. Concurrently with this Petition, Petitioner is filing a notice of its

14 election to prepare the administrative record. A copy of that election is attached as Exhibit C.

15 PRAYER FOR RELIEF
16 1. For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate, commanding Respondent:
17 a. to vacate and set aside approval of the Project, including, but not limited to, the
