PETITION AND COMPLAINT

F
INTRODUCTION.
2
1. This Petition and Complaint seeks to protect an area of known serious geologic instability and 3

4 limited means of ingress and egress from an ill-conceived public access trail into the George

5 Wolfberg Park at Potrero Canyon (the "Park"). The public access entrance is proposed to be off of

6 Friends Street (the "Friends Street Access" or "Project") in Pacific Palisades, located along the West
7 Rim of Potrero Canyon. The West Rim is an area of extraordinary hazard, located entirely within the
8
Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone, with known, substantial geologic instability and extremely

10 limited means of ingress and egress.

11 2. There are no public facilities on Friends Street or on any other streets in the West Rim

12 neighborhood. Implementation of the Friends Street Access will have direct, significant, and
13 foreseeable negative impacts on the entire West Rim neighborhood.
14
3. The development permit for the Project was approved by the California Coastal Commission 15

16 ("Commission") on behalf of the Project applicant, the City of Los Angeles ("City").

17 4. The Commission's approval violates the California Coastal Act, Public Resources Code

18 section 30000, et seq., and its provisions that seek to minimize risks to life and property in areas of
19 high geologic and fire hazard if less environmentally damaging alternatives exist. The Commission's
20

21 approval of the Project also violates the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public

22 Resources section 21000, et seq.

23 5. Numerous violations of both the Coastal Act and CEQA were noted by Petitioner and others

24 during the administrative process, but were not rectified by the Commission. This lawsuit therefore
25 seeks to enforce the Coastal Act and CEQA and to compel the examination of alternative solutions
26

27 that respect the sensitive nature of the West Rim while still achieving the Coastal Act's goals of

28 providing public recreation access within the coastal zone.

PETITION AND COMPLAINT

6. Compounding the Commission's abuse of discretion in approving the Project, the City began

2 work on the Project without first obtaining Coastal Development Permit ("CDP"). While the
3

4 Commission did act to conditionally approve the Project, Petitioner is informed and believes, and

5 upon such information and belief, alleges that the CDP has not yet issued due to the City's failure to

6 comply with certain conditions that must be met prior to permit issuance. Despite this, the City's

7 work on the Project remains ongoing as of the date this lawsuit was filed. The Commission has been

8 provided photographic and testimonial evidence of the City's ongoing work on the Project but has
9

10 failed to require that the City stop all work until the CDP issues. As such, private enforcement of the

11 Coastal Act under Public Resources Code sections 30803 and 30805 is necessary.

12 PARTIES.

13 7. Petitioner Richard Hart ("Petitioner") is an owner of real property on Friends Street in Pacific
14 Palisades. Petitioner's interests will be severely injured if the City is not required to stop all work on
15

16 the Project pending CDP issuance, and if the Commission's approvals of the Project are not set aside

17 pending full compliance with the Coastal Act, CEQA, and all other applicable laws. Petitioner brings

18 this petition and complaint on behalf of all others similarly situated who are too numerous to be

19 named and brought before this Court as petitioners. As a resident and property owner within the state,
20 Petitioner is within the class of persons beneficially interested in and aggrieved by the acts of
21

22 respondents as alleged herein. Petitioner participated in the administrative processes relative to this

23 Project and opposed the Project and environmental documents.

24 8. Respondent California Coastal Commission is a duly authorized agency of the State, with

25 authority and duties codified under the Coastal Act, with a regional office in Los Angeles County.
26 The Commission is tasked with complying with its state-law-mandated duties under the Coastal Act
27

28 and is authorized to, and did, make the decisions challenged by this lawsuit. In this petition, reference

PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 to any act of the Commission shall be deemed to include its commissioners, officers, directors,

2 agents, employees, or representatives who committed or authorized such acts, or failed to adequately
3

4 supervise or properly control or direct their employees while engaged in the management, direction,

5 operation, or control of the affairs of the Commission and did so while acting within the course and

6 scope of their employment or agency.

7 9. Respondent and Real Party in Interest City of Los Angeles is a duly authorized municipal

8 is corporation. The City is the applicant for the Project's development permit from the Commission and
9

10 the responsible owner and manager of the land that is the subject of that permit. In this petition,

11 reference to any act of the City shall be deemed to include its departments, agents, employees, or
12 representatives who committed or authorized such acts, or failed to adequately supervise or properly

13 control or direct their employees while engaged in the management, direction, operation, or control of
14 the affairs of the City and did so while acting within the course and scope of their employment or
15
agency.
16

17 10. Petitioner does not know the true names and capacities, whether individual, corporate,

18 associate, or otherwise, of Respondents DOE through DOE 10, inclusive, and therefore sues said

19 respondents under fictitious names. Petitioner will amend this petition to show their true names and

20 capacities when the same have been ascertained. Each of the respondents is the agent and/or
21 employee of the other, and each performed acts on which this action is based within the course and
22

23 scope of such respondent's agency and/or employment. Petitioner is informed and believes and

24 thereon alleges that each of the fictitiously named respondents is responsible in some manner for the

25 occurrences herein alleged, and that the damages as herein alleged were proximately caused by their
26 conduct.
27

28
3
PETITION AND COMPLAINT

F 11. Petitioner does not know the true names and capacities, whether individual, corporate,

2 associate, or otherwise, of Real Parties in Interest DOE 11 through DOE 20, inclusive, and therefore
3 sues said real parties under fictitious names. Petitioner will amend this petition to show their true
4

5 names and capacities when the same have been ascertained. Each of the real parties is the agent

6 and/or employee of each other real party in interest, and each performed acts on which this action is

7 based within the course and scope of such real party in interest's agency and/or employment.

8 JURISDICTION AND VENUE.

12. Pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 and/or section 1085 and Public
10

11 Resource Code sections 30801, 21168, 21168.5 and 21168.9, this Court has jurisdiction to issue a

12 writ of mandate to set aside Respondent's decision to grant a development permit and approve the

13 Project and environmental document.

14 13. Likewise, pursuant to Public Resources Code sections 30803 and 30805, this Court has
15 jurisdiction to enjoin the City from doing any further construction to complete the Project unless and
16
until a valid CDP issues. 17

18 14. Venue is proper in this court pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 393 and 394

19 because the acts complained of in this petition occurred in Los Angeles County.

20 15. This petition is timely filed in accordance with Public Resources Code section 30801.
21 16. Petitioner has performed any and all conditions precedent to filing this instant action and have 22

23 exhausted all administrative remedies to the extent required by law. Petitioner objected to the to

24 Commission's approval of the Project prior to the close of the public hearing on the Project and

25 before the issuance of a notice of determination. Petitioner and other agencies and individuals raised
26 each of the legal deficiencies asserted in this petition orally or in writing prior to the close of the final
27 public hearing on the Project.
28
4
PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 17. The violations by respondents as alleged herein have affected the beneficial interests of
2 Petitioner and those similarly situated. The relief sought by way of this petition will redress this
3

4 beneficial interest and the likelihood of future injury and interference with Petitioner's interests.

5 18. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law unless this

6 Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require the Commission to set aside its development

7 permit and approval of the Project, and enjoins the City from doing further construction work on the
8 Project unless and until a valid CDP issues. In the absence of such remedies, actions by both the
9

10 Commission and the City will remain in effect in violation of state law and injurious to the very

11 resources the Commission is mandated to protect.

12 STATEMENT OF FACTS.

13 Project Area

14 19. On February 2, 1987, the Commission approved a permit request by the City to fill a coastal
15

16 canyon in Pacific Palisades. The Commission approved the fill, after much debate, because landslides

17 on the canyon walls had destroyed 21 homes and were threatening additional houses. Construction

18 commenced in 1988, and over the years has cumulated in more than 3 million cubic yards of total fill.

19 20. Development in Potrero Canyon is inherently hazardous. Natural hazards common to this area
20 include fires, landslides, flooding, and erosion. In 1986, the City identified nine landslides along the
21 sides of the canyon and numerous smaller blowouts.
22

23 21. Under Section 30253 of the Coastal Act, new development in areas of high geologic, flood,

24 and fire hazard may occur so long as risks to life and property are minimized, other Chapter 3

25 policies of the Coastal Act are met, and there is no less risky alternative.
26

27

5
PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 Procedural History

2 22. The City sought an amendment to the original coastal development permit for the Potrero
3

4 Canyon Park Restoration Project to authorize after-the-fact construction of a public access path from

5 a gate at Friends Street downslope to connect with the interior park trails. The Friends Street Trail has

6 already been completely graded from the entrance to where it intersects with the main park access

7 trail. Excavation has taken place to grade the footprint of the trail on the west wall of the canyon,

8 curbs and footings have been poured, drainage elements have been incorporated and covered, and a
9

10 steel post and wire fence has been partially installed along the upper portion of the trail. Cable railing

11 in the lower portion of the trail has not yet been finished.

12 23. In addition to seeking after-the-fact approval of the above work, the City sought authorization

13 to also build an informational kiosk and interpretive sign panel at the trailhead on Friends Street,
14 conduct corrective grading to fully level the trail, and compact 4 inches of decomposed granite along
15

16 the trail surface. Upon completion, the path will be five feet wide, 1500 linear feet long, traverse 60

17 feet in elevation, and the adjacent areas will be planted with native landscaping. As proposed, the

18 path is for pedestrian use only, but the City has indicated interest in a potential future multi-modal

19 design that includes bicycle accessibility.

20 24. On July 14, 2022, the Commission conditionally approved the Project. Prior to permit
21

22 issuance, the Commission required that the City provide revised plans for the trail to the

23 Commission's Executive Director for review and approval due to the fact that "as currently

24 constructed and proposed, the trail is not in full compliance with requirements set forth in Coastal Act

25 Sections 30235 and 30251."

26

27

28
6
PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 25. As of the date this litigation was filed, Petitioner is informed and believes, and upon such

2 information and belief, alleges that no such plans have been submitted for review and approval by the
3 Commission, and the development permit for the Project has not yet issued. 4

5 26. Despite this, the City's work on the trail remains ongoing. The Commission has received

6 testimonial and photographic evidence of the continued unpermitted work by the City but has failed

7 and refused to require that the City stop all work.

8 Environmental Review
9

10 27. The Potrero Canyon fill Project has been through numerous iterations and has changed

11 significantly over time before the Friends Street Trail was proposed and approved by the

12 Commission.

13 28. The City of Los Angeles, Department of Recreation and Parks issued a Final Environmental
14 Impact Report ("FEIR") for the fill Project in June 1985. However, the fill Project did not include the
15

16 proposal for any specific trails within the proposed park, and as such, the environmental impact of

17 such trails were not studied at that time. Accordingly, the Commission's reliance on the FEIR in

18 approving the Friends Street Trail was clearly in error.

19 29. On June 30, 2022, the Commission issued a staff report for the Project. The staff report fails
20 to analyze any alternatives to the Project and instead only offers the bare conclusion that the proposed
21

22 trail "is the least environmentally damaging feasible alternative..."

23 30. Prior to the close of public comment Petitioner and other interested parties submitted

24 extensive written and oral comments and photographic evidence on the Commission's staff report

25 identifying the legal inadequacies of the documents, which comments are incorporated herein as if
26 fully set forth. These comments include, but are not limited to, the following:
27

28
7
PETITION AND COMPLAINT

UAWN a. The Commission failed to consider and adopt feasible alternatives to the Project
that would reduce risks resulting from natural hazards inherent to the West Rim of

the canyon; and

6 b. The Commission failed to adequately analyze the Project's environmental impacts,

7 including to public access and recreation given that Friends Street has limited

8 street parking and limited ingress and egress.

9 31. On July 14, 2022, the Commission held its only hearing on the Project. Petitioner and other

10 local residents testified or submitted written comments as to the environmental impacts from the

11

12 Project. Despite the overwhelming testimony in opposition to the Project, and limited testimony is

13 support, the Commission approved the development permit for the Project. The Commission's

14 conclusions and the staff report were conclusory and not supported by substantial evidence in the

record.
15

16 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

17 Violations of Coastal Act Against the Commission

18

19 Failure to Protect Hazards and Implement Less Damaging Alternatives

20 32. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through
31, inclusive.
21

22 33. Section 30253 of the Coastal Act states, in relevant part that new development shall "(a)

23

24 [m]inimize risks to life and property in areas of high geologic, flood, and fire hazard" and (b)

25 "[a]ssure stability and structural integrity, and neither create nor contribute significantly to erosion,

26 geologic instability, or destruction of the site or surrounding area or in any way require the

27 construction of protective devices that would substantially alter natural landforms along bluffs and

cliffs.'
28
8
PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 34. The entire Project will occur on exposed soils within a canyon area that is susceptible to
2 landslide and erosion activity. Additionally, stockpiling and placement of fill is proposed in a
3

4 location subject to erosion and dispersion via rain or wind, which could result in silt being transported

to the ocean. 5

6 35. Petitioner specifically requested that the Commission consider less damaging alternatives to

7 the Project as proposed that would be more ecologically sensitive, and to mitigate the remaining
8 adverse impacts of the Project, but the Commission failed to do so.
9

10 36. The failure of the Commission to consider alternatives to the Project, and feasible mitigation

11 measures, constitutes an abuse of discretion and is not supported by substantial evidence, in violation

12 of the Coastal Act.

13 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

14 Violations of Coastal Act Against the Commission
15

16 Failure to Protect Visual Resources and Implement Less Damaging Alternatives

17 37. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through

18 36, inclusive.

19 38. Section 30251 of the Coastal Act states in relevant part, "[t]he scenic and visual qualities of
20 coastal areas shall be considered a and protected as a resource of public importance. Permitted
21

22 development shall be sited and designed to protect views to and along the ocean and scenic coastal

23 areas, to minimize the alteration of natural landforms, to be visually compatible with the character of

24 surrounding areas, and, where feasible, to restore and enhance visual quality to visually degraded

25 areas."

26 39. The Project is located near the lower southern reaches of Potrero Canyon, near the mouth of
27

28 the canyon, where the canyon widens and provides sweeping vistas of the park's riparian habitat,

PETITION AND COMPLAINT

canyon rim and palisades, Pacific Coast Highway, and Will Rogers State Beach. Between 15215 and

2 15265 Friends Street, there is a distance of approximately 500 feet of uninterrupted views into and
3

4 across the canyon, due to no private development. The proposed trail, descending approximately 60

5 feet down the canyon's graded slope and connecting to the main park access trail, will be largely

6 visible from the street and other vantage points inside the canyon and along its rim.

7 40. Along the proposed trail, 10-inch retaining concrete curbs with 12-inch-wide footings have

8 been poured and additional cast-in-place concrete curbs and crossing caps have been placed where
9 the trail crosses existing terrace drains and benches. A steel post and wire fence measuring 4'-8" tall
10

11 has been partially installed along the upper portion of the trail, but cable railing in the lower portion

12 has not yet been finished.

13 41. As currently constructed and proposed, the trail is not in conformance with the requirements
14 set forth in Coastal Act sections 30235 and 30251 to be visually compatible or enhance views,
15 minimize alteration of natural landforms, and design canyon retention elements of the development to 16

17 primarily serve coastal-dependent uses.

18 42. While the Commission conditioned its approval of the Project on appropriately siting and
19 scaling the proposed informational kiosk and interpretive/directional signage, to minimize fencing as

20 much as possible, and to establish a service plan for refuse and debris pick up to reduce unsightly
21 littering, such revised plans have not been presented to the Commission nor made available for public
22

23 review.

24 43. Petitioner specifically requested that the Commission consider less damaging alternatives to
25 the Project as proposed that would be more sensitive to visual resources, and to mitigate the

26 remaining adverse impacts of the Project, but the Commission failed to do so.
27

28
10
PETITION AND COMPLAINT

T 44. The failure of the Commission to consider alternatives to the Project, and feasible mitigation
2 measures, constitutes an abuse of discretion and is not supported by substantial evidence, in violation
3 of the Coastal Act.
4
THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION 5

6 Violations of Coastal Act Against the Commission

7 Failure to Protect Public Safety and Implement Less Damaging Alternatives
8 45. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through
9 44. inclusive.
10

11 46. The Coastal Act is clear that the Act's public access policies must be implemented in a

12 manner that takes into account the need to regulate the time, place and manner of public access

13 depending on the facts and circumstances in each case including the proximity of the access area to
14 adjacent residential uses and the need to provide for the management of access areas so as to protect
15 the privacy of adjacent property owners. Pub. Res. Code § 30214.
16

17 47. While approval of the CDP Application was conditioned on signage showing the permitted

18 hours of recreational use of the park, correspondence was submitted to the Coastal Commission

19 detailing the failure of the City to enforce hours of operation and other safety rules and regulations in
20 other neighborhood parks in the vicinity. According to the letters submitted, the City's failure to
21 enforce hours of operation and other safety rules and regulations has resulted in nuisances to the 22

23 nearby residents as well as serious public safety risks. In addition, evidence including photographs of

24 the narrow, one lane streets and the fact that the outlet at the south end of Friends Street is onto Via

25 de las Olas, a street that has been removed from public use for geologic instability, was submitted.
26 Commenters also noted that the entire area is in a Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone.
27

28
11
PETITION AND COMPLAINT

F 48. The Staff Report for the CDP Application and the Addendum thereto utterly fail to address

2 the public safety risk that the Project poses.
3 49. Petitioner specifically requested that the Commission consider less damaging alternatives to 4

5 the Project as proposed that would protect the public safety, and to mitigate the remaining adverse

6 impacts of the Project, but the Commission failed to do so.

7 50. The failure of the Commission to consider alternatives to the Project, and feasible mitigation
8 measures, constitutes an abuse of discretion and is not supported by substantial evidence, in violation
9 of the Coastal Act.
10
FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION 11

12 Violations of the California Environmental Quality Act Against the Commission

13 51. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through
14 50. inclusive.
15 52. The Commission is subject to the requirements of CEQA, but as a regulatory agency the 16

17 Commission is entitled to rely upon the functional equivalent of an Environmental Impact Report

18 (EIR).

19 53. The Commission's staff report for the Project allegedly serves as the functional equivalent of
20 an EIR under Section 21080.5 of the Public Resources Code.
21 54. The Commission has certain independent duties under CEQA for conducting environmental 22

23 review of Projects it approves.

24 55. Although the City approved a FEIR for the Project in 1985, the Commission is required to

25 rely on the staff report, not the FEIR, in approving the Project.
26 56. The Commission violated CEQA in a number of ways by granting a development permit and
27 approving the Project, including but not limited to the following:
28
12
PETITION AND COMPLAINT

2 a. Relying on the City's FEIR despite the fact that the FEIR included no analysis of

u A w the environmental impacts of the proposed Friends Street Access;
b. Failing to adequately consider and adopt feasible mitigation measures for the

Project; and

C.

7 Failing to consider and analyze feasible alternatives to the Project.

8 57. As a result of the foregoing defects, the Commission prejudicially abused its discretion by

9 issuing a staff report that does not comply with the requirements of CEQA and approving the Project

10 in reliance thereon. The Commission also improperly approved the Project in the face of feasible

11

12 alternatives. Accordingly, the Commission's development permit for and approval of the Project

must be set aside.

13

14 58.On information and belief, the Commission relied on staff to review the staff report and failed

15 to perform its own independent review and consideration of the staff report. The record lacks

16 substantial evidence to support the findings that the Commission ultimately adopted.

17

18 59. The Commission's failure to perform its own independent review and consideration of the
environmental impacts as shown in the staff report before it approved the Project and development
19 permit therefore constituted a prejudicial abuse of discretion in that the Commission failed to proceed
20

21 In the manner required by CEQA, and in that the Commission's decision Is not supported by the

evidence
22

23 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

24

25 Violations of the Coastal Act - Request for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief Against the City

26 60. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs through
59, inclusive.
27

28
13
PETITION AND COMPLAINT

P 61. The Coastal Act requires that any person who seeks to undertake a "development" in the
2 coastal zone obtain a coastal development permit. Pub. Res. Code § 30600(a). Subdivision (a) of
3 Public Resources Code § 30600 § provides: "Except as [not relevant here], and in addition to obtaining 4

5 any other permit required by law from any local government or from any state, regional, or local

6 agency, any person, as defined in Section 21066, wishing to perform or undertake any development

7 in the coastal zone, other than a facility subject to Section 25500, shall obtain a coastal development

9 The Coastal Act clearly requires permit issuance in order to proceed with construction of the Project. 10

11 As of the date of filing this litigation, no CDP has issued.

12 62. An actual controversy exists between Petitioner and the City in that the City contends that

13 issuance of a valid CDP is not required to continue construction of the Project. Conversely, Petitioner
14 contends the City has a statutory duty under the Coastal Act to obtain an issued CDP to continue
15
construction of the Project.
16

17 63. Because a controversy exists among the parties, a declaration of the rights and responsibilities
necessary. Petitioner seeks a 18 of the parties with respect to compliance with the Coastal Act is

19 declaration from this Court that the City's continued construction of the Project without a validly
20 issued CDP constitutes impermissible development under the Coastal Act, and that the City be
21 enjoined from continuing construction unless and a until a valid CDP authorizing such development 22

23 has issued.

24 64. Petitioner has no adequate remedy at law to reverse the consequences of the City's unlawful

25 acts as alleged herein. Accordingly, Petitioner, and the public generally, will be irreparably harmed.
