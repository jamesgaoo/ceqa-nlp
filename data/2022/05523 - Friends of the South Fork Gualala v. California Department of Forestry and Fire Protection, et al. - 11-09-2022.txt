24 FORESTRY AND FIRE PROTECTION and DOES I-X, inclusive (collectively, the "Department"), and
25 by this verified petition alleges as follows:

26 INTRODUCTION

27 1. Petitioner brings this action to challenge the Department's approval of a timber harvesting
28 /project ("Project") proposed by real party in interest Richardson Ranch, LLC (*Richardson"). Richardson

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

H |proposes to log 276 of its redwood forest - an area that is adjacent to the South Fork of the Gualala River

2 in western Sonoma County pursuant to Timber Harvesting Plan ("THP") number 01-22-00041-SON.
3 Richardson is the only active timber operation in the watershed. (THP at pp. 8, [acreage], 49 [location of
4 |river].)

5 2. The watershed of the South Fork Gualala River, which is home to a variety of salmonids
6 and amphibians protected by the state and federal Endangered Species Acts, has been devastated by the
7 impacts of past timber harvesting operations. Timber harvesting has led to sedimentation and increased
8 |temperatures in the river by causing erosion and loss of forest cover. Such changes harm wildlife by
9 destroying essential habitat. They also prompt the formation of toxic harmful algal blooms. The
10 situation has deteriorated to such an extent that the Gualala River - of which the South Fork Gualala is

11 tributary - is listed as an impaired waterbody for sediment and temperature under section 303(d) of the
12 Clean Water Act. Downstream last October in the Gualala River, high water temperatures caused a toxic
13 algal bloom that injured someone.

14 3. Petitioner brings this action under the provisions of the California Environmental Quality
15 Act, Public Resources Code sections 21000 et seq. ("CEQA"); the CEQA Guidelines, 14 C.C.R. sections
16 15000 et seq. ("Guidelines"); the 1973 Z'Berg-Nejedly Forest Practice Act, Public Resources Code
17 sections 4511 et seq., and its implementing regulations, 14 C.C.R. sections 895 et seq. (collectively,
18 FPA"); and Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5.

19 CEQA and the FPA require the Department to fully disclose and mitigate the
20 environmental impacts of the Project, to analyze a range of alternatives to the Project, to explain whether
21 and how the Project's impacts will compound the impacts of similar nearby activities, and to provide for
22 and respond to 30 days of public comment on the Project, among other requirements. But the THP
23 satisfies none of these requirements.

24 5. As discussed more fully below, the THP also fails to provide sufficient information to
25 allow the public the meaningfully understand and participate in the environmental review process. Rather
26 than concrete information and detailed analysis, as required, the THP provides vague assumptions and
27 conclusory assurances to support its claims. Further, the public was not provided with a 30-day public
28 comment period, as required.

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 2 -

2 VENUE AND JURISDICTION

6. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections
3 526 (injunctive relief), 1060 (declaratory relief), 1085 (traditional mandate), and 1094.5 (administrative
4 |mandate); Civil Code section 3422 (injunctive relief); and article VI, section 10, of the California
5 Constitution (original jurisdiction of superior courts).

6 7. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 393, 1085, and
7 1094.5, in that the Department has an office in Sonoma County, the Project is located in Sonoma County,
8 land the Project's environmental impacts will be felt in Sonoma County.

9 8. This petition is timely filed within all applicable statutes of limitations, including Public
10 Resources Code section 21080.5(g).'

11 9. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 388, petitioner is serving the California
12 Attorney General with a copy of this Verified Petition and Complaint, and consistent with section
13 21167.5, petitioner has served respondent by mail with notice of this suit.

14 PARTIES

15 10. Petitioner FRIENDS OF THE SOUTH FORK GUALALA is an unincorporated
16 association whose mission is to conserve, protect, and restore the South Fork Gualala River watershed,
17 land the neighboring watersheds. Its members also promote science and fact-based solutions to limiting
18 the effects of climate change on the South Fork Gualala River and its watershed and endangered wildlife.
19 Petitioner and its members actively engage in many aspects of conservation, including establishing a
20 lhistorical record for the South Fork Gualala River; conducting data collection and public outreach;
21 providing and education; and advocating before state and local agencies. Petitioner's members use the
22 Gualala River, its tributaries including the South Fork Gualala, and the surrounding lands, for recreational
23 purposes and scientific purposes, and take pleasure in the peace and natural beauty of the area. The
24 Project will damage these environmental resources and harm the interests of petitioner and its members.

25 11. FOFSG has authorized its attorney to file this lawsuit on its behalf to vindicate its
26 Isubstantial beneficial interests and the substantial beneficial interests of its members - and in addition,

27

28 Undesignated references are to the Public Resources Code.

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 3 -

1 the substantial beneficial interests of the public generally - in securing the Department's compliance with
2 the laws whose violation is alleged herein.

3 12. The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (the "Department") is a state
4 /public agency headquartered in Sacramento. On September 30, 2022, the Department issued an Official
5 Notice of Conformance approving the Project and stating that THP 1-22-00041-SON was found by its
6 Director to be in conformance with the law.

7 13. The Department has a duty to administer and assure compliance with the law, including
8 the requirements of CEQA, the FPA, and Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5, before
9 approving the Project. In purporting to approve the Project, the Department failed to comply with these
10 laws.

11 14. The true names and capacities of respondents DOES I-X, inclusive, are unknown to
12 petitioner, who therefore sues said respondents by such fictitious names pursuant to Code of Civil
13 Procedure section 474. Petitioner will amend this Verified Petition when the true names and capacities of
14 said DOE respondents have been ascertained, with leave of court if necessary.

15 15. Real Party in Interest RICHARDSON RANCH LLC ("Richardson") is a Nevada
16 corporation, a logging company that is listed as the "Landowner and plan Submitter" in the Official
17 Notice of Conformance approved by the Department on September 30, 2022. Richardson is named as a
18 real party in interest pursuant to section 21167.6.5(a).

19 16. Petitioner is unaware of the true names and capacities of real parties in interest DOES XI-
20 XX, inclusive, and sues such real parties herein by fictitious names pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
21 section 474. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based on such information and belief alleges, that
22 the fictitiously named real parties are entities or individuals who have a direct and substantial economic
23 interest in, or are the recipients of, the Department's approval of the Project. When the true identities and
24 capacities of these DOE real parties have been determined, petitioner will amend this Verified Petition to
25 insert such identities and capacities, with leave of court if necessary.

26 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

27 17. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law,
28 within the meaning of Code of Civil Procedure section 1086. The environmental interests of petitioner

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 4-

- land the public will be substantially and irreparably harmed unless this a Court issues a writ of mandate that
2 both orders the Department to comply with the laws whose violation is alleged herein, and that sets aside
3 the Department's approval of the Project. No monetary damages or other legal remedy could adequately
4 compensate for the harms to petitioner and the environment that would arise if respondent's unlawful
5 conduct were allowed to stand.

6 18. Petitioner is also entitled to injunctive relief or an administrative stay under Code of Civil
7 Procedure sections 526 and 1094.5(g), and Civil Code section 3422, because the Project threatens
8 irreparable environmental harm. Unless enjoined, respondent and real party in interest will implement
9 the Project despite its lack of compliance with applicable environmental laws, causing substantial
10 environmental harm. Petitioner and the public will thereby suffer irreparable harm due to respondent's
11 failure to take the required steps to adequately protect the environment. To prevent this irreparable harm,
12 an administrative stay of the Department's approval - and injunctive relief against both the Department
13 and Richardson - is warranted under section 21168.9, Code of Civil Procedure sections 525 et seq. and
14 1094.5(g), and Civil Code section 3422.

15 19. Petitioner is also entitled to a temporary restraining order pursuant to Code of Civil
16 Procedure section 527 in that Richardson is currently conducting logging on the site of the Project that
17 will cause irreparable harm to the environment. Specifically, starting on October 4th, 2022, the
18 undersigned has heard multiple chainsaws coming from the vicinity of the Bootleg Two THP and heard
19 large trees falling daily from that timber harvest.

20 20. An actual controversy exists between petitioner and respondent under Code of Civil
21 Procedure section 1060. Petitioner contends that the Department has acted in violation of law as alleged
22 herein, and must therefore vacate and set aside its approval of the Project and THP. A judicial resolution
23 of this controversy is therefore necessary and appropriate.

24 21. Petitioner has performed any and all conditions precedent to the filing of this Verified
25 Petition and has exhausted all adequate and available administrative remedies to the extent required.

26 22. Petitioner objected to Project approval prior to the Department's approval of the Notice of

27 Conformance.

28 23. Pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.6(b)(2), and as stated in petitioners'

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 5 -

1 Notice of Preparation of CEQA Record of Proceedings, filed concurrently herewith, petitioners elect to
2 prepare the administrative record in this action.

3 STATEMENT OF FACTS

4 24. The Project proposes to harvest 276 acres of redwood forest adjacent to the South Fork of
5 the Gualala River on land owned by Richardson. (THP at pp. 8, 49.)

6 25. Daniel Falk, Richardson's owner and the owner of the site of the Project, also served as
7 the Registered Professional Forester ("RPF") that prepared the THP. Members of the public expressed
8 concern about a conflict on interest and questioned whether Mr. Falk could be impartial in his duties as
9 RPF of preparing the THP and conducting environmental surveys, given the financial incentives in favor
10 of nondisclosure and reduced oversight.

11 26. The Gualala River provides habitat to multiple fish species protected by the state and
12 federal Endangered Species Act, including coho salmon and steelhead trout. But the quality of that
13 habitat has deteriorated as the Gualala River and its tributaries have become heavily degraded by
14 [increased temperatures and sediment deposits. The THP states that these conditions have been primarily
15 caused by the area's long history of timber harvesting. Conditions in the Gualala River and its tributaries
16 have deteriorated to such an extent that the Gualala River is listed as is listed as an impaired waterbody
17 under section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act for sediment and temperature.

18 27. The THP admits that the watercourses without the Project area "could harbor" the
19 |California red-legged frog and number of other amphibians protected by the state and federal
20 Endangered Species Acts. (THP ยง 4 at 116.) The area also provides habitat for numerous other protected
21 |species, including the northern spotted owl, and marbled murrelet.

22 28. The watershed of the South Fork Gualala River encompasses only 7,904 acres.
23 Richardson is the only active landowner in the watershed and anticipates harvesting 41% of the watershed
24 between 2012-2026. (THP at p. 115, 116.1). If one excludes the roughly 20% of the watershed that is
25 non-harvestable open pastureland, over half of the forests in the South Fork Gualala River were approved
26 for harvesting in the past decade.

27 29. Petitioner and individual members of the public commented during the public comment
28 period, raising a variety of concerns about the Project's environmental impacts.

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 6 -

1 30. For example, commenters expressed concern about the Project's noise impacts and the
2 leffects of noise on wildlife, including the marbled murrelet.

3 31. Many comments also expressed concern about the lack of concrete information about the
4 Project's effects on water quality. Comments noted the Gualala River's listing as an impaired waterbody,
5 pointed out that logging has been primary contributor to sedimentation problems, questioned the

6 efficacy of mitigation measures, observed that the loss of tree cover from logging increases temperatures,
7 and stated that adding any sediment to an already impacted river is especially damaging.

8 32. Given this existing degradation, numerous members of the public expressed concern about
9 |the Project's potential cumulative impacts, especially with respect to effects on water quality and
10 salmonids. Many comments noted that the THP's analysis of cumulative impacts is vague and
11 conclusory, failing to include data or quantified information that supports its conclusions.

12 33. Members of the public expressed repeated concern with the THP's deferred mitigation of
13 numerous impacts until after the Project's approval, a post-hoc strategy that cuts the public out of the
14 CEQA process.

15 34. The public also expressed concern about the THP's analysis of alternatives. Commenters
16  noted that the THP's alternatives analysis relies almost exclusively on repeated conclusory assertions that
17 the landowner rejected a particular alternative as infeasible on financial grounds.? The THP also states
18 that there is no need to explore alternatives because the project's environmental impacts have been
19 |mitigated - but this turns the CEQA process on its head. (Friends of the Old Trees v. Department of
20 Forestry & Fire Protection (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 1383, 1404.) "The Supreme Court . . . has made it
21 abundantly clear that mitigation measures, even where they are expected to eliminate significant
22 environmental effects, still cannot substitute for a discussion of project alternatives." (Ibid.) Further, the
23 THP's truncated analysis of alternatives precluded informed public review, thereby violating CEQA as a
24 matter of law. (Laurel Heights Imp. Ass'n v. Regents of Univ. of Calif. (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 404-405.)

25 35. The public was provided with only 15 days to provide comment after the text of the THP
26 /was finalized at the Second Review Team Meeting. And CalFIRE's practices relating to public comment

27

28 2 As noted above, the THP was prepared by the landowner.

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 7 -

- |render it impractical to submit an effective public comment prior to the date of that meeting - CalFIRE
2 makes numerous modifications to the THP during its review without itemizing them for the public; and
3 those modifications may themselves raise new environmental concerns.

4 36. On September 30, 2022, CalFIRE issued a Notice of Conformance approving the THP and
5 its comment responses thereto.

6 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

7 (Writ of Mandate, Declaratory and Injunctive Relief to Set Aside Department's

8 Approval of the Project as Contrary to Requirements of CEQA and FPA)

9 37. The paragraphs set forth above and below this cause of action are realleged and
10 incorporated herein by reference.

11 38. Petitioners bring this First Cause of Action pursuant to sections on the grounds that the
12 Department committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion by failing to proceed in accordance with the law,
13 and in making findings that are not supported by substantial evidence. The Department considered and
14 approved the Project without adequately describing, analyzing and mitigating its potential environmental
15 impacts, and without complying with applicable public review requirements.

16 39. The Department is a "public agency" under CEQA, and its actions in approving and
17 carrying out the Project are subject to the requirements of CEQA. ยง 21063.

18 40. The Department's approval of THPs is part of a certified regulatory program under section
19 21080.5. Under that statute, the Department's approval of timber harvesting projects "is exempt only
20 from Chapters 3 and 4 of CEQA and from section 21167 of that act." Sierra Club v. State Board of
21 Forestry (1994) 7 Cal. 4th 1215, 1231. The Department's approval is still subject to CEQA's other
22 provisions, and is also subject to the additional requirements for certified regulatory programs listed in
23 section 21080.5. Id. Indeed, a THP must satisfy the requirements of both CEQA and the FPA. Ebbetts
24 Pass Forest Watch v. Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (2008) 43 Cal.4th 936, 943.

25 41. The Project is a "project" subject to CEQA. ยง 21065(c). "Project' means the whole of an
26 action, which has potential for resulting in either a direct physical change in the environment, or a
27 reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment," and refers to the "activity which is
28 being approved and which may be subject to several discretionary approvals by government agencies"

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 8 -

- rather than to the separate governmental approvals themselves. CEQA Guidelines [14 C.C.R.;
2 "Guidelines"] ยง 15378(a), (c).

3 42. CEQA requires public agencies to conduct environmental review before approving any
4 |project that a may have a significant impact on the environment. ยงยง 21002.1, 21061, 21100, 21151;
5 it Guidelines ยง 15004(a). A THP, like the EIR it substitutes for, is intended to provide agencies and the
6 public with information about a proposed project's potential environmental effects, ways to minimize
7 those effects, and potential alternatives to the project. ยงยง 21061, 21080.5(d)(3)(A).

8 43. An EIR, or its functionally equivalent substitute under section 21080.5, is "the heart of
9 CEQA" and "an environmental alarm bell whose purpose it is to alert the public and its responsible
10 officials to environmental changes before they have reached ecological points of no return." Laurel
11 Heights Imp. Ass'n v. Regents of Univ. of Calif. (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 392 ("Laurel Heights") (internal
12 quotation marks and citations omitted). It serves as "the primary means of achieving the Legislature's
13 considered declaration that it is the policy of this state to "take all action necessary to protect, rehabilitate,
14 and enhance the environmental quality of the state.'" Id. (quoting ยง 21001(a)).

15 44. To fulfill CEQA's public informational role, environmental documents "must contain
16 facts and analysis, not just the agency's bare conclusions or opinions." Sierra Club v. County of Fresno
17 |(2018) 6 Cal.5th 502, 522. Courts cannot "countenance a result that would require blind trust by the
18 |public, especially in light of CEQA's fundamental goal that the public be fully informed as to the
19 environmental consequences of action by their public officials." Laurel Heights, 47 Cal.3d at 404.

20 45. In approving the Project and certifying the THP, the Department failed to comply with
21 CEQA and the FPA, and failed to proceed in the manner required by law - or, alternatively, its approval
22 is not supported by substantial evidence - in the following respects, among others.

23 The THP Fails to Respond to Comments

24 46. CEQA requires that the public review period for draft environmental documents "shall not
25 be less than 30 days." (ยง 21091, subd. (a).) CalFIRE is not exempt from section 21091, which is located
26 in CEQA's Chapter 2.6; CalFIRE is exempt only from Chapters 3 and 4. (See ยง 21080.5, subd. (c).)
27 Here, CalFIRE violated section 21091 because the public was given only 15 days to comment after THP
28 revisions were made at the Second Review Team meeting.

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 9-

1 47. This mandates reversal of Project approval. (Ultramar, Inc. v. South Coast Air Quality
2 Management District (1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 689, 699-700 [overturning approval because one chapter of
3 environmental document was emailed to the public for comment for 24 days instead of the required 30].)

4 The THP's Alternatives Analysis Is Inadequate

5 48. CEQA requires an EIR or its substitute to consider and discuss a reasonable range of
6 feasible alternatives that would reduce or avoid the Project's significant impacts. ยงยง 21080.5(d)(2)(A),
7 21080.5(d)(3)(A); Guidelines ยง 15126.6(a), (e). The FPA contains virtually identical requirements. 14

8 C.C.R. ยงยง 896(a), 898.1(c)(2).

9 49. The environmental document also must identify an environmentally superior alternative,
10 which must be adopted unless it is infeasible. ยงยง 21002, 21002.1(b), 21081; Guidelines ยงยง 15091(a), (b),
11 15092(b), 15093, 15126.6(e)(2). The discussion of alternatives is "the core of an EIR" or its equivalent.
12 Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Board of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 564.

13 50. The THP's cursory and conclusory analysis of alternatives fails to satisfy CEQA and the
14 FPA. As discussed above, the THP, which was written by the landowner, makes the landowner's primary
15 goal to earn an immediate financial return from the subject property and for this reason refuses to study
16 |numerous environmentally protective alternatives in detail. But under CEQA, as stated in Kings County
17 Farm Bureau v. City of Hanford (1990) 221 Cal. App. 3d 692, 736, "[a]n environmentally superior
18 alternative cannot be deemed infeasible absent evidence the additional costs or lost profits are SO severe
19 the project would become impractical." No such evidence is provided.
20 51. Furthermore, it violates CEQA to restrict the range of alternatives through the use of
21 Junduly narrow project objectives. (NCRA v. Kawamura (2015) 243 Cal.App.4th 647, 668.) This was
22 /precisely the pernicious result of the landowner's primary focus on economic returns here.

23 52. Furthermore, the THP's refusal to analyze a full scope of alternatives based on the claim
24 that the THP mitigates all environmental impacts of the Project is likewise contrary to law. As noted in
25 Friends of the Old Trees, supra, 52 Cal.App.4th at p. 1404, "the Supreme Court . .. has made it
26 abundantly clear that mitigation measures, even where they are expected to eliminate significant
27 environmental effects, still cannot substitute for a discussion of project alternatives."

28 53. The combined result of these many errors was a unlawful failure to analyze a reasonable

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT 10 -

- range of alternatives. No offsite alternatives were considered. One alternative, the use of alternatives
2 harvesting methods, does not constitute an alternative as a matter of law. And no environmentally
3 superior alternative is clearly identified.

4 54. "If [a] project proponent concludes there are no feasible alternatives, it must explain in
5 meaningful detail . the basis for that conclusion." Laurel Heights, 47 Cal.3d at 405. Allowing
6 Japplicants and agencies to dismiss alternatives with mere conclusory platitudes is contrary to CEQA's
7 requirement of enabling the public to meaningfully understand the Project's environmental impacts. Id.
8 at 399 (agency violated CEQA by failing to provide data supporting its bald assertion that off-site
9 alternatives were in feasible in the EIR itself; whether or not substantial evidence in agency's files
10 supported finding of infeasibility was irrelevant because "the public must be equally informed"). Yet the
11 THP commits this precise error. Because it fails to include information sufficient for the public to
12 meaningfully understand the THP's environmental impacts, the THP is contrary to law.

13 The THP's Analysis of the Project's Impacts Is Legally Inadequate

14 55. The Department's review of the Project's environmental impacts failed to proceed in the
15 manner required by CEQA and the FPA in the following respects, among others.

16 56. "An EIR must include detail sufficient to enable those who did not participate in its
17 |preparation to understand and to consider meaningfully the issued raised by the proposed project."
18 Laurel Heights, 47 Cal.3d at 405; Sierra Club v. County of Fresno ("Sierra Club") (2018) 6 Cal.5th 502,
19 516.

20 57. Likewise, under the FPA, where "the information contained" in any THP "is insufficient to
21 evaluate significant environmental effects," the THP must be disapproved. 14 C.C.R. ยง 898.2(c); see also
22 id. ยง 897(b)(3)(registered professional foresters preparing THPs "have the responsibility to provide the
23 Director with information . . . which is sufficiently clear and detailed to permit adequate and effective ...
24 input by the public to assure that significant adverse individual and Cumulative Impacts are avoided or
25 reduced to insignificance").

26 58. CEQA requires agencies to quantify environmental impacts where it is possible to do so.
27 Guidelines ยง 15144 ("an agency must use its best efforts to find out and disclose all that it reasonably
28 can"); Kings County Farm Bureau v. City of Hanford (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 692, 735-36. "The fact that

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT . 11 -

H /precision may not be possible โฆ. does not mean that no analysis is required." Laurel Heights, 47 Cal.3d
2 at 399.

3 59. Under CEQA, the environmental document "must . disclos[e] the analytic route the

4 lagency traveled from evidence to action." Id. at 404. Put differently, it "must contain facts and analysis,
5 not just the bare conclusions of a public agency. An agency's opinion concerning matters within its
6 expertise is of obvious value, but the public and decision-makers, for whom the EIR is prepared, should

7 also have before them the basis for that opinion so as to enable them to make an independent, reasoned
8 |judgment." Santiago County Water Dist. v. County of Orange (1981)118 Cal. App. 3d 818, 831.

9 60. Contrary to these commands, the THP's discussion of the Project's environmental impacts
10 is riddled with bald assertions about impacts and unsupported conclusions about the effectiveness of
11 unclear mitigation measures - not detailed information that allows for meaningful public review, as
12 CEQA and the FPA demand. The THP's disjointed nature makes understanding the Project's
13 environmental impacts all the more impossible. Vineyard Area Citizens for Reasonable Growth v. City of
14 Rancho Cordova (2007) 40 Cal.4th 412, 440 (*The data in an EIR must not only be sufficient in quantity,

15 it must be presented in a manner calculated to adequately inform the public and decision makers, who
16 may not be previously familiar with the details of the project"). As does its failure to require adequate
17 surveys of environmental resources.

18 61. For these reasons, among others, the THP thus fails to promote meaningful public review,
19 which renders it legally inadequate. Sierra Club, 6 Cal.5th at 514 ("whether a description of an
20 environmental impact is insufficient because it lacks analysis or omits the magnitude of the impact is not
21 a substantial evidence question"); 14 C.C.R. ยง 897(b)(3) ("The information in proposed [THPs] shall
22 be sufficiently clear and detailed to permit adequate and effective review by responsible agencies and
23 input by the public to assure that significant adverse individual and Cumulative impacts are avoided or
24 reduced to insignificance").

25 62. For example, and for illustrative purposes only, the THP's analysis fails to include
26 sufficient information to enable meaningful public review of the Project's impacts in the following areas,

27 among others:

28 a. Impacts on biological resources, including endangered and threatened species;

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 12 -

1 b. Impacts on anadromous salmonids;

2 C. Water quality;

3 d. Sedimentation; and

4 e. Fire Hazards.

5 63. Because it provides only unsupported conclusions about the Project's environmental
6 impacts instead of the required facts and analysis, the THP violates CEQA and the FPA.

7 64. The also THP defers formulation of mitigation measures until after approval, contrary to
8 CEQA. (CEQA Guidelines ยง 15126.4, subd. (a)(1)(B); CCEC v. City of Woodside (2014) 225
9 Cal.App.4th 173, 195-196 (CCEC) [EIR "is inadequate if 'the success or failure of mitigation efforts may
10 largely depend upon management plans that have not yet been formulated, and have not been subject to
11 analysis and review'* (internal brackets and ellipsis omitted)].) An environmental document "is
12 inadequate if "the success or failure of mitigation efforts . may largely depend upon management plans
13 that have not yet been formulated, and have not been subject to analysis and review within the EIR."
14 (Communities for a Better Environment v. City of Richmond (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 70, 92, brackets
15 omitted, quoting San Joaquin Raptor Rescue Center v. County of Merced (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 663,
16 670.) The public is entitled to review specific mitigation measures both to ascertain their efficacy and
17 also to ensure that the mitigation measures themselves do not have environmental impacts. The THP
18 fails to afford this opportunity, which renders it legally inadequate. it

19 The THP's Analysis of Cumulative Impacts is Legally Inadequate

20 65. A robust and thorough analysis of cumulative impacts is an essential component of an
21 adequate environmental review document. "One of the most important environmental lessons evident
22 from past experience is that environmental damage often occurs incrementally from a variety of small
23 sources. These sources appear insignificant, assuming threatening dimensions only when considered in
24 light of the other sources with which they interact." Kings County Farm Bureau v. City of Hanford
25 (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 692, 720. "[I]t is vitally important that an EIR avoid minimizing the cumulative
26 impacts. Rather, it must reflect a conscientious effort to provide .. . adequate and relevant detailed
27 information about them." San Franciscans for Reasonable Growth v. San Francisco (1984) 151
28 Cal.App.3d 61, 79.

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 13 -

1 66. Like CEQA, the FPA also requires an analysis of cumulative impacts. 14 C.C.R. ยงยง
2 912.9, 932.9, 952.9. Indeed, in 14 C.C.R. section 895.1, the FPA "adopt[s] the CEQA regulations'
3 definition of 'cumulative impactsโข" from Guidelines 8 15355. Ebbetts Pass, supra, 43 Cal.4th at 943.
4 Moreover, the FPA's implementing regulations specifically emphasize that a THP's cumulative impacts
5 analysis must also satisfy CEQA's requirements: in the introduction to Technical Rule Addendum No. 2
6 to 14 CCR section 912.9, which governs cumulative impacts, it states that the THP "must distinguish
7 between [1] the potential on-site Impacts of the Plan's proposed activities (which may not be significant
8 when considered alone) with [2] Impacts of Timber Operations and Reasonably Foreseeable Future
9 Projects pursuant to [CEQA Guidelines] ยง 15130(b)(1)(A)." Put differently, even when the THP'S
10 "proposed activities .. may not be significant when considered alone, " Technical Rule Addendum No.
11 2 nonetheless expressly requires a cumulative impacts analysis that complies with CEQA by detailing the
12 cumulative impacts of the THP when combined with all past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future
13 projects.

14 67. The FPA contains special additional requirements applicable where, as here, a proposed
15 THP covers an area that is upstream from a waterbody listed as impaired under section 303(d) of the
16 Clean Water Act. 14 C.C.R. ยงยง 898 (*When assessing cumulative Impacts of a proposed project on any
17 |portion of a waterbody that is located within or downstream of the proposed timber operation and that is
18 listed as water quality limited under Section 303(d) of the Federal Clean Water Act, the [THP] shall
19 assess the degree to which the proposed operations would result in Impacts that may combine with
20 existing listed stressors to impair a waterbody's beneficial uses, thereby causing a significant adverse
21 effect on the environment").

22 68. The THP falls far short of satisfying these mandates. As noted, the area's long history of
23 logging has left the Gualala River and its tributaries choked with sediment and suffering from
24 temperatures high enough to cause HABs. Protected species live in these watercourses, and a large
25 proportion of the South Fork Gualala watershed has been logged in the past decade. Accordingly, many
26 comments on the THP expressed concern about cumulative impacts; even a small increase in
27 sedimentation or temperatures could be the proverbial straw that breaks the camel's back.

28 69. But the THP does not contain any concrete data or quantified information about the

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 14 -

- |Project's cumulative impacts. The only analysis provided in the THP is a repeated series of circular
2 statements that, because the Project (supposedly) will not have any significant environmental impacts, it
3 also will not have any cumulative impacts. Such an analysis is directly contrary to the requirement in
4 Technical Rule Addendum No. 2 that a THP "distinguish between the potential on-site Impacts, . ..
5 which may not be significant when considered alone," versus "Impacts of Past Projects and Reasonably
6 Foreseeable Future Projects." No such distinction is drawn in the THP.

7 70. The THP does not even provide a comprehensive list of other projects with cumulative
8 effects. Nor does it provide any detailed or quantitative information that could be used by the public to
9 support its conclusions. To the contrary, the THP simultaneously claims both that it is not possible to
10 create a set of quantified cumulative impact thresholds and that the FPA provides thresholds of
11 significance - but both cannot be the case.

12 71. In Kings County, supra, 221 Cal.App.3d at 729-30 the court rejected the challenged EIR's
13 analysis of cumulative groundwater impacts because it contained "no information regarding [the
14 surrounding projects'] expected impacts on ground water resources and no analysis of the cumulative
15 impacts. It merely assumes whatever impacts such projects may have will be mitigated by existing and
16 planned water conservation efforts of governmental agencies in the area."

17 72. Likewise here, by using its regurgitated impact analyses as the sole basis for its
18 |conclusions that the Project will not have a significant cumulative impact, while providing no quantified
19 or detailed information about either the cumulative impacts of other logging operations or the magnitude
20 of the THP's supposedly-less-than-significant impacts, the THP commits the same error. Sadly, it
21 appears that neither the Department nor Richardson have learned from "past experience . .. that
22 environmental damage often occurs incrementally from a variety of small sources. These sources appear
23 insignificant, assuming threatening dimensions only when considered in light of the other sources with
24 which they interact." Kings County Farm Bureau v. City of Hanford (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 692, 720.

25 73. The THP's failure to provide a robust and complete analysis of cumulative impacts that is
26 supported by concrete data violates CEQA and the FPA.

1 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (Writ of Mandate, Declaratory and Injunctive Relief to Set Aside Department's

3 Approval of the Project as Contrary to Code of Civil Procedure ยง 1094.5)

4 74. The paragraphs set forth above and below this cause of action are realleged and
5 incorporated herein by reference.

6 75. Respondent proceeded in excess of its jurisdiction and abused its discretion in purporting
7 to approve the Project and its THP because such approvals violate Code of Civil Procedure section
8 1094.5 in the following respects, among others:
9 a. such approvals were not granted in accordance with procedures required by law;

10 b. such approvals were not based on the findings required by law; and

11 C. such approvals were not based on, or were contrary to, the evidence in the record.

12 76. Respondent failed to proceed in the manner required by law, in that the Department
13 violated CEQA and the FPA as alleged above.

14 77. Respondent's actions in approving the Project without complying with the procedures
15 required by Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 exceeded respondent's jurisdiction and constitute a
16 prejudicial abuse of discretion, and therefore are invalid and must be set aside.

17 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

18 WHEREFORE, petitioner prays for the following relief:

19 1. This Court's alternative and peremptory writs of mandate, declaratory judgment, and
20 permanent injunction, setting aside and enjoining respondent's actions purporting to (1) certify the THP

21 as in conformance with CEQA and the FPA and (2) approve the Project, on the grounds that such
22 approvals and certification violate CEQA and the FPA;

23 2. This Court's temporary restraining order, stay order, preliminary injunction, and
24 alternative and peremptory writs of mandate, enjoining and restraining (1) respondent and real party in
25 interest, (2) respondent's and real party in interest's officials, agents, employees, representatives, and (3)
26 all persons acting in concert or participating with them, from taking any action to implement the Project
27 that could result in any change or alteration to the physical environment pending the Department's
28 |compliance with CEQA and the FPA;

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT . 16 -

1 3. For attorney's fees under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5, in that petitioner's
2 |successful prosecution of this proceeding confers a significant benefit on the public, and an award of its
3 attorney's fees is otherwise warranted and appropriate;

4 4. For costs of suit herein; and

5 5. For such other and further equitable or legal relief as the Court deems just and proper.
