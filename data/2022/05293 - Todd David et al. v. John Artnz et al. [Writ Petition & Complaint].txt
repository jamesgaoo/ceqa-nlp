INTRODUCTION

1. Petitioners/Plaintiffs TODD DAVID and SAN FRANCISCO HOUSING

3 ACTION COALITION (collectively, "Petitioners") bring this action to challenge the

4 legality of the "Affordable Housing Production Act" (the "Chan/Peskin Measure"), which,

5 after being spearheaded by San Francisco County Supervisors Connie Chan and Aaron

6 Peskin, was placed on the November 8. 2022 City and County of San Francisco (the "City"

7 or "San Francisco"*) ballot by the City and County of San Francisco Board of Supervisors

8 (the "Board").

9 2. The Chan/Peskin Measure, which Petitioners assert is legally invalid because

10 it violates mandatory provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act (Pub. Res.

11 Code §§ 21000 et seq.) ("CEQA") and Section 31.07 of City and County of San Francisco

12 Administrative Code ("Administrative Code"), was cynically designed to counter a ballot

13 measure which qualified for the November 8, 2022 San Francisco ballot via citizen

14 signatures (the "Affordable Homes Now Measure"). Both measures purport to increase

15 certain types of housing production within San Francisco, but the Affordable Homes Now

16 Measure is legal, whereas the Chan/Peskin Measure is illegal.

17 3. The City skipped indispensable procedures for placing the Chan/Peskin

18 Measure on the ballot because it could not follow the rules and place the Chan/Peskin

19 Measure on the ballot in time to compete with the Affordable Homes Now Measure on the
20 November 8, 2022 ballot. The City thereafter concocted ex post facto justifications for

21 failing to follow the procedures for placing a measure such as the Chan/Peskin Measure on

22 the ballot.1 The Court must protect the voters from the City's cynicism and 23 underhandedness. TR&N 4. It is well established that pre-election review of ballot measures is appropriate
where the validity of a proposed measure is in serious doubt, and where the matter can be

t Petitioner/Plaintiff SFHAC wrote a letter to the Board of Supervisors in anticipation of its
2.8 vote on the Chan/Peskin Measure, explaining the legal concerns in more detail. A true and
correct copy of the letter is attached hereto as Exhibit 1 and incorporated herein by this
reference.)
SMRH:4889-3372-5741.3 -3-

1 resolved before expenditures of time and a effort are wasted on a futile election campaign.

2 (See City of San Diego v. Dunkl (2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 384, 389; Citizens for Responsible

3 Behavior v. Superior Court (1991) Cal.App.4th 1013, 1022-23.) Where the issue of

4 whether a proposal is lawful has been placed before the court, the court has the power and

5 duty to order that the measure, if invalid, be stricken from the ballot. (Dunkl, 86 Cal.

6 App4th at 397.)

5. Additionally, the presence of an invalid measure on the ballot steals attention,

8 time, and money from the numerous valid propositions on the same ballot; it will confuse

9 some voters and frustrate others. (See American Federation of Labor v. Eu (1984) 36

10 Cal.3d 687, 697.) An ultimate decision that the matter is invalid, coming after the voters

11 have voted in favor of the measure, denigrates the legitimate use of the initiative procedure.

12 (Id.)

13 6. It is especially important to avoid voter confusion when an invalid ballot

14 measure (i.e., the Chan/Peskin Measure) is directly in conflict with a valid measure (i.e., the

15 Affordable Homes Now Measure), as is the case in the present action.

16 7. Petitioners have no plain, speedy and adequate remedy at law to challenge the

17 legality of the Chan/Peskin Measure, and therefore bring this Verified Petition for Writ of

18 Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief (*Petition").

19 PARTIES

20 8. Petitioner/Plaintiff TODD DAVID is a resident, duly registered voter, and

21 taxpayer in the City and County of San Francisco.
22 9. Petitioner/Plaintiff SAN FRANCISCO HOUSING ACTION COALITION

23 ("SFHAC") is a nonprofit organization which educates the public on housing affordability

24 issues and advocates for the construction of more housing across all affordability levels in
25 order to alleviate the Bay Area's and California's housing shortage, displacement crisis,
26 and affordability crisis. SFHAC is also one of the chief supporters of the citizens* initiative
27 Affordable Homes Now Measure, which will appear on the November 8, 2022 ballot.
28

| SMRH:4889-3372-5741.3 -4-

1 10. Respondent/Defendant JOHN ARNTZ ("Arntz") is San Francisco's Director

2 of Elections. As such, he is the official responsible for printing the voter information

3 pamphlets and ballots that will be distributed to the voters and which will contain an invalid

4 ballot measure unless this Court intervenes to protect the voters. Petitioners are required to

5 name Arntz as a Respondent, and Arntz is sued herein in his official capacity only.

6 11. Respondent/Defendant CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO is a

7 municipal government governed by the laws of the State of California, and the City and

8 County of San Francisco Charter ("San Francisco Charter") and laws of the San Francisco.

9 12. The true identities and capacities of Respondent Does 1 through 10 are

10 unknown to Petitioners at this time. Petitioners are informed and believe, and based upon

11 such information and belief allege, that each of the fictitiously named respondents is in

12 some manner responsible for the actions described in this Petition. When the true identities

13 and capacities of these respondents have been determined, Petitioners will seek leave to

14 amend this Petition to insert such identities and capacities.

15 VENUE

16 13. Venue for this action lies within the City and County of San Francisco

17 pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 393(b) and 394.

18 JURISDICTION

19 14. Petitioners bring this action as a petition for writ of mandate pursuant to
20 California Elections Code section 13314 and California Code of Civil Procedure sections

21 1085 et seq., and as a Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief pursuant to Code of

22 Civil Procedure sections 526 and 1060.

23 TIMELINESS

24 15. This action is being brought in a timely manner. Petitioners are informed and
25 believe, and on that basis allege, that the ballot materials will be printed on or about 26 September 1, 2022. Accordingly, after the matter is briefed on shortened time, the
27 expedited issuance of a writ or other appropriate relief will not interfere with the printing of

28 official election materials.

/ SMRH:4889-3372-5741.3 -5-

1 16. On August 8, 2022, as required by Public Resources Code section 21167.5,

2 Petitioners notified Respondents that they intended to file suit to enforce the requirements

3 of CEQA and the City and County of San Francisco Administrative Code ("Administrative

4 Code"). A copy of that notice and proof of service are filed as Exhibit A with this Petition.

5 17. On August 8, 2022, as required by Public Resources Code section 21167.7

6 and Code of Civil Procedure section 388, Petitioners notified the Attorney General of the

7 State of California that they intended to file suit to enforce CEQA and the Administrative

8 Code. A copy of that notice and proof of service are filed as Exhibit B with this Petition.

9 STATEMENT OF FACTS

10 18. On July 13, 2022, the voter-sponsored Affordable Homes Now Measure

11 qualified for inclusion on the November 8, 2022 ballot after obtaining signatures from

12 roughly 80,000 voters in accordance with the Elections Code requirements. The Affordable

13 Homes Now Measure seeks to cut several years off the approval timeline for qualifying

14 housing projects that are 100% affordable, are for teachers or are mostly market-rate but

15 have 15% more below-market rate units than San Francisco would otherwise require under
16 affordability mandates. The Affordable Homes Now Measure would accelerate building by

17 streamlining San Francisco's lengthy and often cumbersome approval process for projects

18 that already meet all existing local planning and building codes, including zoning

19 requirements. Substantially similar proposals had previously been struck down by the
20 Board.

21 19. Therefore, it was not surprising that on or about May 24, 2022, Supervisor

22 Connie Chan proposed the Chan/Peskin Measure as an amendment to the San Francisco

23 Charter, for inclusion on the ballot for the November 8, 2022 election in direct competition

24 with the Affordable Homes Now Measure.
25 86 20. On or about June 23, 2022, the City and County of San Francisco Planning
Department (*Planning Department") determined that inclusion of the Chan/Perkins
Measure on the ballot did not constitute a "project" under the CEQA and the CEQA
28 Guidelines (14 C.C.R. §§ 15000 et seq.).

| SMRH:4889-3372-5741.3 -6-

21. On or about July 14, 2022, San Francisco's Environmental Review Officer

2 ("ERO") determined that the Chan/Peskin Measure was "[n]ot defined as a project under

3 CEQA Guidelines Section 15378 and 15060(c)(2) because it would not result in a direct or a

4 indirect change in the environment." This determination was in error.

5 22. On or about July 19, 2022 and July 26, 2022, SFHAC submitted comment

6 letters in opposition to the Chan/Peskin Measure, alleging that the Board's consideration of

7 the matter violated CEQA and the Administrative Code, specifically Section 31.07.

8 23. On or about July 26, 2022, the Board voted 7-4 to submit the Chan/Peskin
9 Measure to the Department of Elections for printing and inclusion on the ballot for the

10 November 8, 2022 election.

11 24. As of the date of this filing, neither San Francisco nor the Board have filed a

12 Notice of Exemption or Notice of Determination related to this action.

13 25. Currently, under the San Francisco Charter, the City and County of San

14 Francisco Planning Code (the "Planning Code") and other municipal codes, housing
15 development projects require discretionary approval or approvals by various San Francisco

16 agencies including the Board, San Francisco Planning Commission (the "Planning

17 Commission") and other boards, committees and commissions.

18 26. The Chan/Peskin Measure would amend the San Francisco Charter to create a

19 streamlined, ministerial approval for "Incrcased Affordability Housing Projects" in addition

20 to those currently permitted under Planning Code section 206.9 ("100% Affordable

21 Housing" and "Educator Housing" projects).

22 27. The Chan/Peskin Measure defines "Increased Affordability Housing

23 Projects" as market-rate multi-family housing developments of ten (10) or more units that

24 provide on-site inclusionary housing units, plus additional affordable units in an amount

25 equal to eight percent (8%) of the total number of units in the entire project.

26 28. Thus, the Chan/Peskin Measure would modify and expand the list of housing

27 projects eligible for ministerial review. Moreover, the additional project type would

28 provide for market-rate units and a density bonus outside of and additional to what is

SMRH:4889-3372-5741.3 -7-

1 authorized under the State Density Bonus Law (Govt. Code §§ 65915 et seq.). Petitioners

2 allege that neither of these components is authorized in the two project types previously

3 permitted by the Planning Code section 206.9 to forego discretionary review.

4 29. The Chan/Peskin Measure would also: (i) allow eligible projects to receive

5 certain modifications to the Planning Code; (ii) allow limited design review by the Planning

6 Department; and (iii) require ministerial approval within 180 days of submittal of a

7 complete development application. The Planning Commission will not be permitted to

8 accept or hear requests for discretionary review for eligible projects. Projects will be
9  reviewed through an administrative/ministerial process in a Planning Code section 344, as

10 amended by the ballot measure.

11 APPLICABLE PROCEDURAL LAW

12 30. California Elections Code section 13314 provides for the issuance of a writ of

13 mandate to prevent "an error or omission in the …. printing of, a ballot, county voter a
14 information guide .. . or other official matter," or that a neglect of duty as occurred or is

15 about to occur, so long as the issuance of the writ "will not substantially interfere with the

16 conduct of the election." Section 13314(a)(3) provides that such a suit "shall have priority

17 over all other civil matters."

18 31. Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 et seq. provide that Petitioners may

19 seck a writ of mandate to prevent government officials - in this casc Respondents Arntz

20 and San Francisco (collectively, "Respondents") - from taking any official action to print
21 ballots and voting materials for an invalid ballot measure.
N8FN8 32. Code of Civil Procedure section 526 permits Petitioners to seek an injunction
restraining Respondents from taking any action to print ballots and voting materials for an
invalid ballot measure or spending any public funds on such measure.
33. Code of Civil Procedure section 1060 provides that in cases of actual
controversy relating to the legal rights and duties of the respective parties, any person may

27 bring an original action in the Superior Court for a declaration of his or her rights.

SMRH:4889-3372-5741.3 -8-

1 APPLICABLE SUBSTANTIVE LAW
34. CEQA Guidelines section 15060(c)(2) provides that CEQA does not
apply to an activity that is not a "project" as defined in Section 15378. CEQA Guidelines

4 section 15378 defines a project as:

5 .the whole of an action, which has a potential for resulting in either a direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment, and that is any of the following:

7 (1) An activity directly undertaken by any public agency including but

8 not limited to public works construction and related activities clearing or grading of land, improvement to existing public structures, enactment and amendment of zoning ordinances, and the adoption and amendment of local General Plans or elements thereof pursuant to Government Code Sections 65100-65700.

(2) An activity undertaken by a person which is supported in whole or in part through public agency contacts, grants subsidies, or other forms of
12 assistance from one or more public agencies.
13 (3) An activity involving the issuance to a person of a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement for use by one or more public
14 agencies.
i 35. A "project" has two essential elements. First, it is an activity directly

16 undertaken by a public agency, an activity supported in whole or in part by a public agency,

17 or an activity involving the issuance by a public agency of some form of entitlement,

18 permit, or other authorization. Second, a "project" is an activity that may cause a direct (or

19 reasonably foreseeable indirect) physical environmental change. (Pub. Res. Code § 21065;

20 CEQA Guidelines § 15378.) §

21 36. Ministerial projects, or "non projects," do not require an agency to exercise

22 discretion in order to approve the project. CEQA Guidelines section 15369 explain that
23 F6&FG agency actions determined "not to be a project" is:
a governmental decision involving little or no personal judgment by the public official as to the wisdom or manner of carrying out the project. The public official merely applies the law to the facts as presented but uses no special discretion or judgment in reaching a decision.[it] involves only the use of fixed standards or objective measurements, and the public official cannot use personal, subjective judgment in deciding whether or how the project should be carried out.
(Emphasis added.)
37. An activity approved or carried out by a public agency is not exempt from

SMRH:4889-3372-5741.3 -9-

1

2 CEQA simply because it will not have an immediate or direct effect on the environment.

3 CEQA applies if the activity may cause "a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change

4 in the environment." (Muzzy Ranch Co. v. Solano County Airport Land Use

5 Comm'n (2007) 41 Cal.4th 372; Pub. Res. Code § 21065; CEQA Guidelines § 15378(a).)

6 The determination whether an activity may cause a foresceable change in the environment

7 indirectly is made without considering whether such a change will actually occur.
38.

8 A proposed activity is a project if it "is the sort that is capable of causing

9 direct or reasonably foreseeable indirect effects on the environment." (Union of Med.

10 Marijuana Patients, Inc. v. City of San Diego (2019) 7 Cal.5th 1171, 1198.) The question is

11 not whether the activity will affect the environment, or what effects it might have, but

12 whether the activity has the potential to change the physical environment. Thus, under the
definition of a project in Public Resources Code section 21065 and CEQA Guidelines
13 section15378(a), an activity that sets in motion a chain of events that could result in a
foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment qualifies as a project subject to * croA
16 See Union of Med. Marijuana Patients, Inc., supra, 7 Cal.5th at 1199 [city

17 ordinance authorizing establishment of medical marijuana dispensaries and regulating their

18 location and operation could foreseeably result in construction of new stores and could alter

19 traffic patterns]; Muzzy Ranch Co., supra, 41 Cal.4th at 383 [development restrictions in
airport land use plan could result in changes to environment indirectly by causing
20 development to be displaced to other areas]; Plastic Pipe & Fittings Ass'n v. Cal. Bldg.

21

22 Standards Comm'n (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1390, 1412 [addition of PEX plastic pipe to

23 state building codes would allow use of PEX piping in construction which could

24 foreseeably have variety of adverse environmental impacts]; City of Livermore v.
LAFCO (1986) 184 Cal.App.3d 531 [revision of LAFCO sphere-of-influence guidelines to
25 change policies, such as those relating to where growth would occur and whether g

27 agricultural land would be developed, may promote urbanization in unincorporated

28 areas]; Terminal Plaza Corp. v. City & County of San Francisco (1986) 177 Cal.App.3d
892 [residential hotel unit conversion and demolition ordinance could cause changes to

| SMRH:4889-3372-5741.3 -10-

1 environment indirectly because it required either construction of replacement units or in-

2 lieu fee for new construction as condition of conversion permit].)

3 39. An agency's determination that an approval process is a project as a defined by

4 CEQA is not dispositive. Where the agency's decision involves any exercise of judgment,

5 the action taken is a project for purposes of a CEQA and compliance with CEQA is

6 required unless the action qualifies a for a codified exemption. (CEQA Guidelines

7 § 15002(i)(2).)
40. Here, the Chan/Peskin Measure, with its proposed change to the San
g Francisco Charter to add an additional type of housing development that is exempt from

10 further discretionary review, is clearly - by its nature - a project.

11 41. The adoption of legislation proposed by the electorate through California's

12 initiative process is not a "project" subject to CEQA, regardless of whether the measure is

13 placed on the ballot and approved by the voters or is adopted by the local agency decision-

14 making body as authorized by the initiative procedures set forth in the Elections Code.
15 (Tuolumne Jobs & Small Bus. Alliance v. Super. Court (2014) 59 Cal.4th 1029 ["Tuolumne
16 Jobs"] [agency action on voter-sponsored measure]; DeVita v. County of Napa (1995) 9

17 Cal.4th 763, 794 [adoption by electorate]; Stein v City of Santa Monica (1980) 110

18 Cal.App.3d 458 [adoption by electorate].)

19 42. The courts have set forth two distinct rationales for determining that the
20 adoption of a voter-sponsored measure is not a project subject to CEQA. First, courts have

21 determined that imposing CEQA on voter-sponsored initiative measure would be
22 inconsistent with Elections Code procedures that require the decision-making body to either

23 adopt the measure without change or submit the measure to the voters. (Tuolumne Jobs,

24 supra, 59 Cal.4th at 1036; Elec. Code § 9212.) The Elections Code created a ministerial duty

25 for an agency to either adopt a qualified voter-sponsored initiative or place it on the ballot.
26 Thus, the ministerial and limited nature of the agency's decision exempts the action from
27 further CEQA review. (Native Am. Sacred Site & Envt'1 Prot. Ass'n v. City of San Juan
28 Capistrano (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 961.) Second, courts have long held that voters do not

| SMRH:4889-3372-5741.3 -11-

1 act as agents of the public agency when adopting a voter-sponsored initiative. (DeVita,

2 supra, 9 Cal.4th at 794; Stein, supra, 110 Cal.App.3rd 458.)

3 43. In contrast to the rules governing voter-sponsored measures, a decision by a
4 public agency to submit an agency-sponsored measure to the voters is a discretionary

5 action, thus a project, and is not exempt from CEQA. (Friends of Sierra Madre v. City of

6 Sierra Madre (2001) 25 Cal.4th 165, 187.) In articulating the difference between voter- and

7 agency-sponsored ballot measures, the California Supreme Court held:

8 Voters who are advised that an initiative has been placed on the ballot by city council will assume that the city council has done so only after itself making a
9 study and thoroughly considering the potential environmental impact of the measure. For that reason a prelection [Environmental Impact Report] should 10 ANIR be prepared and considered by the city council before the council decided to place a council-generated initiative on the ballot. By contrast, voters have no reason to assume that the impact of a voter-sponsored initiative has been subjected to the same scrutiny and, therefore, will consider the potential environmental impacts more carefully in deciding whether to support or oppose the initiative.

(Id. at 191.)
44. Similarly, a public agency proposal that requires voter approval after the
initial decision and approval by the public agency a is a project subject to CEQA (Fullerton
17 Joint Union High Sch. Dist. v. State Bd. of Educ. (1982) 32 Cal.3d 779, 796; People ex rel
18 Younger v. LAFCO (1978) 81 Cal.App.3d 464, 479; Citizens for Responsible Gov't v. City
19 of Albany (1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 1199.)
20 45. The Chan/Peskin Measure is not a voter-sponsored ballot initiative. Instead,

21 it is a Board-sponsored proposal, and therefore is not subject to the same CEQA exemption

22 enjoyed by those measures placed on the ballot via the voter initiative process.
23 46. Here, the Chan/Peskin Measure is directly analogous to the agency action the
24 California Supreme Court struck down in Union of Med. Marijuana Patients, Inc., supra. In

25 that case, the Court determined that introduction of a new use "could cause a citywide

26 change in patterns of vehicle traffic...The necessary causal connection between the
27 Ordinance and the effects is present because the adoption of the Ordinance was an
28 *essential step culminating in action [authorization of new use] which may affect the

| SMRH:4889-3372-5741.3 -12-

1 environment.™ (7 Cal.5th at 1199.)
47. Like the new use in Union of Med. Marijuana Patients, Inc., the Chan/Peskin

3 Measure authorizes the inclusion of an additional type of development authorized to bypass

4 environmental compliance and discretionary review. The additional type is a wholly

5 different development model than what is currently permitted and includes a density

6 component that will - by its very nature - result in housing in excess of what is currently

7 permitted under the applicable zoning and state law.

8 48. Additionally, the Chan/Peskin Measure will remove barriers to demolition

9 and adverse alternation of historic resources. Given this and the fact this intensity in

10 residential use has not otherwise been analyzed or mitigated for previously, it is reasonably

11 foreseeable that such inclusion, which will allow for an eight percent (8%) increase in

12 density in addition to what is permitted by the State Density Bonus Law, could result in

13 direct and cumulative environmental impacts related to traffic, noise/vibration, land use

14 plan consistency, noise and vibration, archeological resources, air quality and historic

15 resources.

16 49. In Union of Med. Marijuana Patients. Inc., supra, the City of San Diego at

17 least had the benefit of arguing that the new use authorized under its decision would be

18 subject to subsequent CEQA review on a project-by-project basis. Here, San Francisco

19 does not even have this luxury as the Chan/Peskin Measure specifically authorizes

20 ministerial review of any housing development that qualifies under the proposed new use.
NH&I0RR 50. Section 31.07 of the Administrative Code states:

The Environmental Review Officer shall maintain a listing of types of nonphysical and ministerial projects excluded from CEQA. Such listing shall be modified over time as the status of types of projects may change under applicable laws, ordinances, rules and regulations. The listing shall not be considered totally inclusive, and may at times require refinement or interpretation on a case-by-case basis. When the Environmental Review Officer proposes to modify such listing, notice shall be provided on the Planning Commission agenda prior to such modification. Any person who may consider any modification to be
incorrect may appeal such modification to the Planning Commission within twenty (20) days of the date of the Planning Commission agenda

SMRH:4889-3372-5741.3 -13-

on which notice of such modification was posted. The Planning Commission may affirm, modify or disapprove such modification, and the decision of the Planning Commission shall be final.

(Emphasis added.)

5 51. By the very language of the Administrative Code, the ERO is required to
6 maintain a list of approved ministerial or non-physical projects exempt from further CEQA
7 review. If that list is to be modified for any reason, notice must be provided on the
8 Planning Commission agenda. A party may then appeal the modification, triggering
9 Planning Commission review.

10 52. Contrary to these requirements, the Chan/Peskin Measure, which very clearly
11 would result in the modification of San Francisco's list of ministerial projects, was never
12 included on a Planning Commission agenda, nor does it fit within any existing category of
13 approved ministerial projects or non-physical projects exempt from environmental review.
14 53. Should the Chan/Peskin Measure be included on the November 8, 2022 ballot
15 and subsequently approved by the voters, there is no mechanism that would authorize this
16 modification to be noticed on a Planning Commission agenda and the ability to further
17 appeal this action would be eliminated.
18 54. Therefore, in order to comply with Administrative Code section 31.07, the
19 ERO was required to notice the Chan/Peskin Measure on a Planning Commission agenda
20 prior to a determination by the Board whether to submit it to the Department of Elections
21 effectively deprived Petitioners of their procedural due process rights, codified in the
22 Administrative Code.
23 55. Had the Planning Commission heard from a large number of opponents of the
24 Chan/Peskin Measure during the requisite appeal period, it likely would have required
25 CEQA compliance prior to sending the matter on to the Board. Failure to comply with these
26 procedural requirements will substantially and detrimentally impact Petitioners.
27 56. As such, by conducting the Board's hearing on the matter prior to compliance
28 with the Administrative Code, Respondents failed to proceed in a manner prescribed by

| SMRH:4889-3372-5741.3 -14-

1 Administrative Code section 31.07 This constitutes an abuse of discretion.

2 57. Assuming arguendo that Administrative Code section 31.07 did not require

3 notice and appeal for project listings initiated by the Board of Supervisors, the ERO's

4 actions here nonetheless constitute an abuse of discretion in violation of Section 31.07 as

5 they impermissibly added a broad new category of ministerial projects without requisite

6 notice to the Planning Commission and the public, again effectively depriving Petitioners

7 of their procedural due process rights, codified in the Administrative Code.

8 58. Specifically, the ERO made a de facto alteration of the list to include

9 discretionary actions by the Board that: (a) alter and/or eliminate subjective Planning Code

10 standards that protect broad categories of historic resources, including listed historic

11 buildings in the Planning Code; (b) eliminate current subjective standards that exist to

12 prevent environmental impacts; and (c) create a new category of market-rate housing with

13 increased affordability that are excluded from environmental protections.

14 59. The ERO's assertion that the issue is moot, because the Chan/Peskin Measure

15 could have been processed as an addendum to the 2004 and 2009 Housing Element Final

16 Environmental Impact Report ("FEIR") underscores the ERO's deviation from its practices

17 in approving seven (7) other housing streamlining programs. In each case, the ERO

18 recognized the potential for indirect physical impacts but determined those impacts were

19 disclosed in the FEIR, in large part due to substantive environmental protections in the

20 Planning Code that would be eliminated by the Chan/Peskin Measure.
21 60. Erroneously shoehorning the Chan/Peskin Measure into an existing category
22 of approved ministerial projects or non-physical projects that are not subject to CEQA is an
23 Nb 48 abuse of discretion. It deprives Petitioners of their due process rights to notice and appeal,
and sets a precedent for future end-runs around CEQA so the Board can place competing
measures on the ballot in violation of its own Administrative Code and the California
Supreme Court's holding in Friends of Sierra Madre, supra, 25 Cal.4th at 187.

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
Elections Code Writ of Mandate Preventing the Director of Elections from Printing the Chan/Peskin Measure on the Ballot (Elections Code Section 13314) (Against All Respondents and Defendants)
61. Petitioners re-allege and incorporate herein by this reference Paragraphs
60 of this Petition as set forth herein in full.

62. CEQA's purpose is to maintain a quality environment for the people of
California. (Pub. Res. Code § 21000(a).) The law requires evaluation, analysis and public

9 disclosure of potentially adverse impacts that an action requiring government approval may

10 have on the environment. (Pub. Res. Code §§ 21002, 21002.1, 21080(a).) CEQA must be

11 interpreted to provide the fullest possible protection to the environment.
63. The Board found that inclusion of the Chan/Peskin Measure on the ballot
12

13 was not a project, and, therefore, exempt from CEQA compliance. The Board's finding,

14 however, is erroncous. The Chan/Peskin measure does not meet the requirements for such

15 an exemption under CEQA.
64.
16 The Chan/Peskin Measure, which is specifically intended to provide

17 "[a]ccelerated review" and increased housing, amends the San Francisco Charter to allow

18 for a new, denser project type to avoid subsequent environmental review by classifying

19 approval of these projects as "ministerial."
65.
20 The Chan/Peskin Measure will limit review to, essentially, a Planning

21 Department checklist and eliminate the ability to appeal an approval. Without any

22 mechanism for assessing the environmental impacts of additional, denser housing type,

23 there is no question that development of said projects would result in direct, indirect and/or

24 cumulative impacts on environmental resources.

25 66. The decision to place the Chan/Peskin Measure on the November 8, 2022

26 ballot constituted an inherently discretionary process. The determination required

27 deliberation and the exercise of judgment, as evidenced by the number of Rules Committee

28 and Board meetings and amendments.
67. Approval of the Chan/Peskin Measure did not simply involve the application

SMRH:4889-3372-5741.3 -16-

1 of the law to the facts, or a determination as to whether the Board had complied with

2 applicable legal requirements in a manner that renders the approval a non-project.

3 68. Given the Chan/Peskin Measure's inclusion of, essentially, a new use to the

4 San Francisco Charter, it reasonably foreseeable that Board's action could result in direct

5 and cumulative environmental impacts.

6 69. Because approval of the Chan/Peskin Measure was discretionary and could

7 result in environmental impacts, it qualifies as a "project" for purposes of CEQA and is not

8 eligible for exemption from further environmental review.

9 70. The Board failed to proceed in a manner required by law, and its exemption
10 determination was an error, omission, or neglect of duty.

11 71. The Board thereafter impermissibly utilized San Francisco Elections Code

12 section 300 to impermissibly place an invalid and illegal measure on the ballot.

13 72. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy at law, and

14 unless this Court takes action and grants Petitioners' relief, the voters will be faced with an

15 unlawful measure on the November 8, 2022 ballot.

President Walton
President of the Board of Supervisors 1 Dr. Carlton B. Goodlett Place, Room 244 San Francisco, CA 94102

Re: Affordable Housing Production Act; BOS File Nos. 220631 & 220835

Dear President Walton and Members of the Board of Supervisors:

On behalf of the Housing Action Coalition ("HAC"), a member-supported nonprofit that
advocates for building more homes at all levels of affordability, write to urge the Board of Supervisors ("Board") not to put the sham Affordable Housing Production Act ("Chan/Peskin Measure" at Exhibit A) before the voters. There is already a measure - the "Affordable Homes Now Initiative" ("Citizen Measure") - to create a streamlined approval process a for projects that provide more affordable housing than required. Roughly 80,000 San Franciscans (16% of registered voters) signed the Citizen Measure. (Citizen Measure at Exhibit B.)
The Chan/Peskin Measure is not being put forward to streamline housing production. It is a cynical ploy to confuse and distract voters and divide the pro-housing vote. For the Board to place this on the ballot would be both illegal and unethical; unlike measures put on the ballot by citizen signature, the Chan/Peskin Measure cannot be placed on the ballot before environmental review under the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") is completed. The Chan/Peskin Measure has not done this for one simple reason: time. There isn't enough of it to do an environmental review and qualify in time to sabotage the Citizen Measure, which will be on the November 2022 ballot. Should the Board illegally place the Chan/Peskin measure on the ballot, the HAC is prepared to immediately pursue all legal remedies available.

The Measures

On the surface, both the Chan/Peskin Measure and the Citizen Measure appear similar.
Both proposals would streamline city approval for three kinds of qualifying projects 100 percent
affordable housing, teacher housing, and mixed-use projects. Both proposals require that labor is paid a prevailing wage, and both proposals involve an increase in affordable units for qualifying projects. However, there's a key difference: the higher affordability requirements in the Chan/Peskin Measure will be feasible for a more limited subset of projects and will result in fewer
developers using it.
Here's how the figures break down and it what it means for home builders. Let's say a developer wants to build a 100-unit project. Currently, San Francisco requires that 21.5 percent of homes in larger projects are designated affordable, so the 100-unit project would need to include 22 homes that are below market rate ("BMR").
The Citizen Measure would require a project to meet the 21.5 percent figure, plus 15 percent of the bonus affordable units. For example, to qualify, that 100 unit-project would now
have to build 25 BMR homes.

50 Otis Stree
HOUSING San Francisco, CA 9410
(415) 541.90C
COALITION info@housingactioncoalition.or
housingactioncoalition.or

The Chan/Peskin Measure, however, further increases the overall affordability requirement by 8 percent, so instead of 21.5 percent it would be 29.5 percent BMR homes. That means the 100-unit project would be required to designate 30 BMR homes. It also requires higher percentages of two- and three-bedroom units.
On the surface, the Chan/Peskin Measure appears to be the measure that more effectively addresses San Francisco's shortage of affordable homes. Even in San Francisco, everyone can agree that 30 affordable homes are better than 25.

However, for new homes to be built in the first place, they must be financially feasible for the homebuilders. The additional 8 percent of affordable housing that the Chan/Peskin Measure requires, won't necessarily result in more affordable homes being built because fewer multi-family
projects will be feasible. Nonetheless, for some developers, the added cost associated with the higher affordable requirements may outweigh holding costs in a high interest rate environment with the risk of change in economic conditions during a lengthy approval process.
1. The Chan/Peskin Measure's CEQA Review Is Inadequate.
a. The "No Project" Determination Is Specious.
In the race to qualify the Chan/Peskin Measure for the November 2022 ballot, the public has been misled by CEQA findings stating:
The Pianning Department has determined that the actions contemplated in this proposed Charter Amendment and ordinance comply with [CEQA]..Said determination is on file with the Clerk of the Board of Supervisors... and is incorporated herein by reference.
(Chan/Peskin Measure Sec. 1. at Exhibit A.) However, there iS no environmental analysis in the file beyond a conclusory statement lacking any analysis whatsoever appended to the Clerk of the Board's request for environmental evaluation. It reade:

Not defined as a project under CEQA Guidelines Section 15378 and 15060(c)(2) because it would not result in a direct or indirect physical change in the environment.
(July 14, 2022 CEQA Determination at Exhibit C.) This determination cannot withstand even the most cursory scrutiny under CEQA.

b. CEQA's Definition of a Project.

Under CEQA, a "project" is an activity (1) undertaken or funded by or requiring the approval of a public agency that (2) "may cause either a direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment." (Pub. Res. Code Sec. 21065.) Zoning changes, even minor ones, are typically considered "projects" for CEQA purposes. The California Supreme Court held that a zoning change to allow medical marijuana dispensaries (4 in each city council district; 36 citywide) was a project under CEQA in Union of Marijuana Patients, Inc. V. City of San Diego, 7 Cal. 5th 1171 (2019).

50 Otis Stret
HOUSING San Francisco, CA 94IC
(415) 541.901
COALITION info@housingactioncoalition.or
housingactioncoalition.or
The question posed in determining whether an ordinance is a project "is not whether the activity will affect the environment, or what those effects might be, but whether the activity's potential for causing environmental change is sufficient to justify the further inquiry into its actual effects that will follow from the application of CEQA." (ld. at 1198.) If the proposed activity is the sort that is capable of causing direct or reasonably foreseeable indirect effects on the environment, some type of environmental review is justified, and the activity must be deemed a project." (Id.) In Union of Marijuana Patients, the Court determined:
the establishment of new stores could cause a citywide change in patterns of vehicle traffic from the businesses' customers, employees, and suppliers. The necessary causal connection between the Ordinance and these effects is present because adoption of the Ordinance was "an essential step culminating in action [the establishment of new businesses] which may affect the environment."
(ld. at 1199.)

C. The Chan/Peskin Measure Is a Project and Must Complete an Environmental Review.

The Chan/Peskin Measure's own findings contradict a determination that it is not a Project under CEQA. Its provisions for "[a]ccelerated review will allow San Francisco to incentivize and accelerate the development of housing projects that specifically expand the city's affordable housing supply by reducing the time and expense associated with obtaining planning approval." (Sec. 2(n).) A program that aims for more and faster housing construction obviously qualifies as a "project" capable of causing direct or reasonably foreseeable indirect effects on the environment.

This is particularly true given the Chan/Peskin Measure's substantive changes to the rules governing qualified projects. Those projects would not be subject to CEQA review by virtue of being ministerial. CEQA requires the imposition of mitigation measures to reduce impacts to less- than-significant levels where feasible and consistent with project objectives. However, by making projects ministerial and subject to objective standards only, there is no mechanism for commonplace impacts to be mitigated.
It is impossible to square the rationale used to classify the Chan/Peskin Measure as not being a project, when the City's Housing Element Update (see Exhibit D), which merely sets the stage for future changes, was classified as a project. The Draft EIR for the Housing Element Update (see Exhibit E) states:

The housing element update would modify the policies of the general plan's housing element. It would not implement specific changes to existing land use controls (e.g., zoning) or approve any physical development (e.g., construction of or
infrastructure). [Citation Omitted] As housing
such, the proposed action would not result in any direct physical changes to the environment. Instead, the housing element update would result in reasonably foreseeable indirect changes. Specifically, the department assumes that adoption of the housing element update would lead to future actions, such as planning code amendments to increase

height limits along transit corridors and to modify density controls in low-density areas that are primarily located on the west and north sides of the city, designation of housing sustainability districts, and
approval of development projects consistent with the goals, policies, and actions of the housing element update.

(Page S-2.)

As such, the housing element update would not result in any direct
physical changes to the environment. Instead, the housing element
update would result in reasonably foreseeable indirect changes. Specifically, the department assumes that adoption of the housing
element update would lead to future actions, such as planning code amendments to increase height limits along transit corridors and modify density controls in low- density areas that are primarily
located on the north and west sides of the city, designation of
housing sustainability districts, and approval of development projects consistent with the goals, policies, and actions of the housing element update. Therefore, this EIR identifies the
reasonably foreseeable impacts of future actions that would implement the proposed goals, policies, and actions, including rezoning actions that would enable increased housing density.

(Page 4-4.)

d. The Chan/Peskin measure will result in environmental impacts that should be
evaluated at the project-level and cumulatively.

CEQA requires the imposition of mitigation measures to reduce impacts to less-than-
significant levels where feasible and consistent with project objectives. However, by making projects ministerial and subject to objective standards only, there is no mechanism to require mitigation of common impacts:

Noise and vibration. Because most San Francisco developments are built lot-line to lot- line, mitigation measures are often needed to reduce construction noise to acceptable levels. Where deep excavations occur near older buildings, particularly historic ones,
mitigation measures are often required to avoid damaging adjacent structures. (See
1010V Mission Street, Mitigated Neg. Dec. at Exhibit F; see also 1101 Sutter Initial Study
at Exhibit G.)

Transportation impacts/mitigation are also common in San Francisco, particularly for projects where loading docks and driveways are on busy pedestrian or vehicular streets, are on narrow streets, have poor visibility, or where multiple projects are under
construction in close proximity. Mitigation measures are needed to address transportation
impacts.

Archeological resources. Archeological resources are commonplace in San Francisco. Mitigation measures to test for the presence of archeological resources, evaluate their significance, and for preservation (either on- or off-site) are often required. (See 1010V

COALITION info@housingactioncoalition.op

Mission Street, Mitigated Neg. Dec. at Exhibit F; see also Housing Element Update DEIR
Maps at Exhibit E.)
Air Quality. Construction equipment frequently generates diesel particulate and other emissions. For larger projects near residential buildings, schools, and other sensitive receptors, emissions may cause significant exposures and health risks without mitigation measures. (See 1101 Sutter DEIR at Exhibit G.)
Historic Resources. Under CEQA, environmental impacte on a "historic resource" must be analyzed. Historic resources are broadly defined to include any building eligible for listing on the California Register, or actually listed on other state and local registers. Demolition of a historic resource is a significant impact under CEQA. The Peskin/Chan Measure allows for ministerial demolition of non-residential buildings that are considered historic resources under CEQA but do not fall within the Peskin/Chan Measure's narrower
class of protected historic buildings, along with more extensive alterations to certain
contributory buildings listed in Articles 10 and 11 of the Planning Code. Buildings like the
one at 3140 16th Street have been preserved by virtue of their eligible status and would be at heightened risk of demolition, as would numerous small-scale historic resources. These potentially significant impacts must be disclosed in an EIR before the measure is put to the vote on the ballot. (See 1101 Sutter DEIR at Exhibit G, 3140 16th St. records at Exhibit H; see also Historic Resources at Exhibit I.)
Cumulative Impacts. All potential cumulative impacts should be studied, particularly in relation to the policy changes proposed in the Housing Element Update. In particular, due
to the concentration of eligible historic buildings on the City's east side and the relatively permissive development controls, the Chan/Peskin Measure could conflict with the Update's goal of shifting more development to the west side and further burden public services on the east side. (See Housing Element Draft 3 Goals, Objectives, Policies, 3 and Actions at Exhibit D)
2. Supervisors Cannot Bypass CEQA In Order to Place A Competing Measure on the
Ballot.

In a case factually similar to the Chan/Peskin Measure, the California Supreme Court clearly held that the discretionary submission of a ballot measure to the voters by a local legislature is not exempt from CEQA. (Friends of Sierra Madre v. City of Sierra (2001) 25 Cal 4th 165.) The measure in Friends sought to delist 29 properties from the city's historic register and was placed on the ballot over objections that the delisting required CEQA analysis. The city took the position that delisting was not a project, and the ballot measure ultimately passed. However, the court invalidated the measure for the City's failure to comply with CEQA, agreeing with the Court of Appeals reasoning that the delisting would lead to a change in legal status under CEQA:

Although the city might still have the power to review the historical significance of the property when a demolition permit was sought, delisting might have the effect of removing the property from CEQA requirements for other types of use, for building permits for alteration, and for relocation of the property, Thus, delisting constituted a project with an effect that might cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of an historical resource.

50 Otis Stret
HOUSING San Francisco, CA 941C
(415) 541.90(
COALITION info@housingactioncoalition.or
housingactioncoalition.or

(ld. at 182.) The Chan/Peskin Measure effectively removes a large number of properties from all CEQA requirements for qualified projects, while ignoring its clear duty to conduct an environmental review. Notably, the City and County of San Francisco argued in an amicus brief that "requiring CEQA compliance for city- council-generated initiatives will handicap a city in responding to a voter-sponsored land use initiative by offering its own alternative because the process of CEQA compliance cannot be completed before the voter-sponsored initiative must be
placed on the ballot. (ld. at 191.) The Court dismissed the argument and declined to create a legal loophole, noting elsewhere that:

Voters who are advised that an initiative has been placed on the ballot by the city council will assume that the city council has done SO only after itself making a study and thoroughly considering the potential environmental impact of the measure. For that reason a preelection EIR should be prepared and considered by the city council before the council decides to place a council-generated initiative on the ballot. By contrast, voters have no reason to
assume that the impact of a voter-sponsored initiative has been
subjected to the same scrutiny and, therefore, will consider the potential environmental impacts more carefully in deciding whether to support or oppose the initiative.

(ld. at 190.)

The sponsors of the Chan/Peskin Measure are surely aware of the City's obligations under CEQA. Each of the six sponsors voted to overturn the EIR for a large housing development at 469 Stevenson Street on grounds including the scale of the building in relation to nearby historic buildings. (Board of Supervisors Motion No. M21-182 at Exhibit J.) This decision, along with other housing disapprovals, prompted the California Department of Housing and Community Development ("HCD") to review the Board's actions as a possible violation of the Housing Accountability Act. The HCD expressed concern that these "actions are indicative of review processes that may be constraining the provision of housing in San Francisco." (See Exhibit K.) Now the same supervisors whose actions are being scrutinized by the HCD for disapproving residential projects are ignoring legal obligations under CEQA in a mad dash to manipulate the results of a citizen-sponsored, pro-housing measure. This is bad faith violation of due process and subjects the Chan/Peskin Measure to a preelection legal challenge. (Yes on Measure A V. City of Lake Forest (1997) 60 Cal. App. 4th 620, 626 ("preelection challenges are desirable because "the presence of an invalid measure on the ballot steals attention, time and money from
the numerous valid propositions on the same ballot. It will confuse some voters and frustrate others, and an ultimate decision that the measure is invalid, coming after the voters have voted in favor of the measure, tends to denigrate the legitimate use of the initiative procedure." [citations omitted]").)

Conclusion

The Chan/Peskin Measure is a transparently fraudulent attempt to confuse and divide voters with the sole purpose of undermining the Citizen Measure. It is being rushed to the ballot for political reasons. Too rushed. So rushed, in fact, that it is has not gone through the normal procedural steps required for a measure placed on the ballot by the Supervisors, including, crucially, environmental review under CEQA. This fatal flaw subjects the Measure to a preelection legal challenge that will prevent the Measure from reaching the ballot. On behalf of the 16% of
