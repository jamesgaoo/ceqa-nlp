- INTRODUCTION

2 1.

3 Petitioner and Plaintiff CHARLES S. SYERS (*Petitioner") brings this action, on his
own behalf and on behalf of the general public and in the public interest, for judicial review and
4 invalidation of the unlawful actions, determinations, decisions, and approvals made by the
5 Respondents and Defendants, the CITY OF PETALUMA ("City") and the MAYOR and CITY
6 COUNCIL OF CITY OF PETALUMA ("City Council," and collectively with City,
7 "Respondents"), including the Respondents' actions on or about July 18, 2022 and August 1, 2022

8 to introduce and adopt Ordinance No. 2820 (the "Contested Ordinance"). The Respondents' actions
0 and the Contested Ordinance modify Table 4.3 (Allowed Land Uses and Permit Requirements for
10 Mixed Use Zones) and Table 4.4 (Allowed Land Use and Permit Requirements for Commercial
11 Business Park, and Industrial Zone) of the City's Implementing Zoning Ordinance ("IZO") to
12 provide for discretionary review for proposed "General Retail, Grocery, and Building and
13 Landscape Materials Sales Indoor" land uses over 25,000 square feet and associated modifications
14 to implement these changes (the "Project" or the "Zoning Change").

15 2. The Zoning Change will effectuate major changes in the City's land use planning
16 and permitting process. Most commercial land uses that were previously allowed ministerially as
17 of right will now require a conditional use permit ("CUP") if they are located in a building that is
18 more than 25,000 square feet in size. The Contested Ordinance makes no exception for pre-existing
19 uses, such as the Plaza North Shopping Center (the "Shopping Center"), owned by Petitioner.
20 3. More than 40 years ago, the City granted a use permit and design review approvals
21 to Petitioner's predecessor, expressly allowing for unrestricted commercial uses in the Shopping
22 Center, including a now-vacant nearly 90,000 square foot commercial building formerly occupied
23 by Kmart. Despite years of good faith reliance on those City approvals, however, the City hastened
24 to enact the new constraints of the Contested Ordinance in reaction to a recent application by a

25 prospective new tenant, The Home Depot (*THD"), to locate in the Shopping Center. Through the
26 Contested Ordinance, the City seeks to change the proverbial rules in the middle of the game in
27 order to improperly protect an existing business from potential economic competition that might be
28 posed by new occupants of the Shopping Center, all in violation of state and federal law.

DECLARATORY RELIEF AND DAMAGES

1 4. Respondents consciously failed to conduct any environmental review prior to hastily
2 adopting the Zoning Change. The Project may result in physical environmental impacts and thus
3 the City must conduct environmental review pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act
4 ("CEQA") before it can lawfully act on it. (Public Resources Code §§ 21080, 21000, 21065.) It is
5 | reasonably foreseeable that the Zoning Change could chill or freeze existing commercial business
6 in their current locations, precluding updates or improvements, or displace existing and potential
7 new commercial businesses, or deter existing businesses from renovating existing facilities or
8 expanding existing operations, or cause certain commercial businesses to locate in other areas
9 outside the City. Reasonably foreseeable and probable impacts of the Project would result in
10 associated traffic, air quality, and noise pollution, including an increase in greenhouse gas emissions,
11 vehicle miles traveled, and other related emissions. Another reasonably foreseeable consequence
12 of the Project is that it leads to larger buildings and centers remaining vacant, thereby contributing
13 to urban decay impacts. Accordingly, pursuant to CEQA, Respondents were required to prepare an
14 initial study/negative declaration or environmental impact report prior to approving the Project.
15 Respondents did not undertake either of these actions, wrongly claiming that their actions were
16 exempt from CEQA, and thereby leaving the decision-makers and the public completely "in the
17 dark" about the environmental consequences associated with the proposed Project.

18 5. In approving the Project, Respondents improperly and unlawfully relied on
19 inapplicable exemptions from CEQA in finding that the Project would not result in any significant
20| impacts. Respondents' conclusions are not supported by substantial evidence in the record, or
21 actually any evidence or analysis, but rather are contrary to evidence in the record raising at least a
22 fair argument that the Zoning Change would result in significant adverse environmental impacts,
23 precluding reliance upon said exemptions and requiring further public environmental review and
24 analysis. As a result, the Respondents failed to consider significant adverse impacts of the Project,
25 including impacts to the environment, public health and regional welfare, and to communities that
26 are located outside of the City's limits, and improperly failed to consider possible mitigation
27 measures or feasible alternatives to the proposed Project as required by CEQA.

28 6. The Zoning Change is inconsistent with the City's General Plan and thus void ab

Rutan & Tucker, LLP -3-
attorneys at law 2783/099999-0084 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
18170532.7 a08/24/22 DECLARATORY RELIEF AND DAMAGES

initio. The Zoning Change adds new unstudied barriers to economic development and changes in
2 the commercial vitality of the City, to the harm of the community and the public at large.

3 7. The Zoning Change makes no provision for those who have previously acquired
4 vested rights such as Petitioner, as a result of their substantial expenditures and investments made
5 in good faith reliance on the City's existing zoning rules and on permits issued pursuant to such
6 rules. The Zoning Change implements an improper use of police powers to restrict economic
7 competition, to the harm of the public at large and Petitioner. It violates Petitioner's due process
8 and equal protection rights and amounts to an unlawful regulatory taking of Petitioner's property.

9 The Zoning Change unlawfully impairs contractual relations and interferes with economic relations.

10 8. Respondents' arbitrary and unauthorized actions, and deliberate disregard of the
11 applicable requirements of CEQA, the Planning & Zoning Law, and other applicable federal, state,
12 and local laws and policies, result in significant changes to land use and planning processes, vehicle
13 miles traveled, regional air quality, public health, safety, and welfare of the City and the surrounding
14 communities, as well as significant harm to Petitioner and others and adverse environmental impacts
15 and other harm to the environment and regional welfare.

16 9. Petitioner seeks relief from Respondents' hasty, ill-considered, and unlawful actions,
17 including the Respondents' failure to comply with CEQA, the Planning & Zoning Law, the state
18 and federal constitutions, and request that the Zoning Change be declared void and invalid, and that
19 Respondents be mandated to set aside the Zoning Change and be permanently enjoined from taking
20 any further action in furtherance of, or in implementation of, the Zoning Change.

21 10. Petitioner also seeks immediate issuance of temporary and preliminary injunctive
22 relief and an alternative writ of mandate enjoining Respondents from taking any further action in
23 furtherance of, or in implementation of, the Zoning Change unless and until the Respondents first
24 rescind their unlawful actions and approvals, and fully comply with the applicable requirements of
25 state and local law, including but not limited to, CEQA, and comply with the writs or orders of this

26 Court.

27 11. Petitioner, and other interested parties, duly raised these issues and objections,
28 verbally and in writing, at appropriate times during the administrative process leading up to

Rutan & Tucker, LLP -4-
attorneys at law 2783/099999-0084 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
18170532.7 a08/ DECLARATORY RELIEF AND DAMAGES

T Respondents' approval of the Project. Petitioner has exhausted all available administrative
2 remedies, but Respondents have persisted in acting in derogation of their obligations under the
3 CEQA, the Planning & Zoning Law, and other state and federal laws, as well as the public's rights

4 and interests in compliance with those laws.

5 12. Petitioner now brings this action in the public interest, for enforcement of the
6 important public rights and environmental interests intended to be protected by CEQA and for the
7 enforcement of the State Planning & Zoning Law, and the City's own General Plan and policies, as
8 well as statutory and constitutional rights to, among others, due process and equal protection of the

9 laws.

10 PARTIES

11 13. Petitioner and laintiff CHARLES S. SYERS is the owner of the Plaza North
12 Shopping Center located at 261 McDowell Boulevard, Petaluma, who has and will be significantly
13 and adversely impacted and harmed by the Zoning Change.

14 14. Respondent City of Petaluma is a municipal corporation, organized and existing
15 under the laws of the State of California, located in the County of Sonoma. Respondents Mayor and
16 City Council are the elected governing body of the respondent City, which erroneously adopted the
17 invalid and unlawful Zoning Change challenged in this action. Respondent City together with the
18 Mayor and City Council collectively are referred to herein as "the City" or "Respondents."

19 15. Respondents have and had mandatory duties to comply with federal, local, and state
20 laws, including, without limitation, the U.S. and California Constitutions, CEQA, the CEQA
21 Guidelines, the Planning & Zoning Law, and the City's own adopted General Plan and local
22 ordinances and policies when considering discretionary activities, and land use decisions and
23 | development projects and actions such as the Zoning Change.

24 16. Petitioner is ignorant of the true names and capacities of those sued herein as DOES

25 through 50, inclusive, and therefore sues those respondents/defendants by such fictitious names.
26 Petitioner will amend this Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory
27 Relief and Damages (the "Petition") to allege the true names and capacities of these fictitiously
28 named respondents/defendants when they have been ascertained. Petitioner designates all other

unknown persons or entities claiming any interests in the subject of this litigation as DOE
2 respondents/defendants.

3 17. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that each of the
4 respondents/defendants designated herein as "DOE" is responsible in contract or tort, or in equity

5 or by statute, for the events and happenings referred to herein, and proximately caused, contributed
6 to, or are otherwise liable for the arbitrary, unauthorized, or invalid actions, demands, fees, or
7 exactions which are the subject of this Petition, as hereinafter set forth.

8 18. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that at all times herein
9 mentioned, Respondents and Defendants, and each of them, were and are the agents and employees
10 of their co-Respondents and co-Defendants, and in doing the things herein alleged, were acting
11 within the purpose and scope of their agency and employment.

12 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

13 19. This Court has jurisdiction over this proceeding pursuant to California Code of Civil
14 Procedure ("CCP") sections 1085, 1094.5, and 1060; Public Resources Code ("PRC") sections
15 21168 and 21168.5; 42 U.S.C. section 1981 et seq; and the various provisions of the federal and
16 state constitutions cited herein.

17 20. Petitioner has beneficial and direct financial and business interest in the outcome of

18 this action because Petitioner's use and enjoyment of the Shopping Center is directly impacted by
19| Respondents' unlawful actions.

20 21. Petitioner has exhausted all non-judicial remedies available to them and required to
21 be exhausted as a prerequisite to the filing of this Petition and action. Other than through this action,
22 Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law.

23 22. Venue for this action is proper in this Court pursuant to CCP section 394 because the
24 Respondents and the subject Shopping Center are located in the City of Petaluma, Sonoma County,
25 California, which is within the jurisdiction of the Superior Court for the County of Sonoma.

26 FACTUAL BACKGROUND

27 23. The Shopping Center is approximately 20 acres in size and is located along one of
28 the City's main commercial arterials--McDowell Boulevard. The City's General Plan designates

Rutan & Tucker, LLP -6-
allorneys at lew 2783/099999-0084 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
18170532.7 a08/24/22 DECLARATORY RELIEF AND DAMAGES

1 the Shopping Center site as Community Commercial. "This category includes shopping centers

2 and commercial districts, including regionally-oriented centers." (General Plan, p. 1-7.) The
3 Shopping 2 Center is zoned Commercial 2 ("C2") under the IZO. The C2 zone is applied to existing
4 community and regional shopping center sites. (IZO § 4.020.)

5 24. The City Planning Commission granted a use permit and design review approvals
6 for the Shopping Center on February 6, 1979 (the "Shopping Center Approvals"). The Shopping
7 Center approvals allowed approximately 200,000 square feet of commercial development with two
8 main anchor buildings as well as several in-line stores.

9 25. In connection with granting the Shopping Center Approvals, the City's Planning
10 Commission found that the Shopping Center conformed to the City's General Plan and Zoning
11 Code and "will not constitute a nuisance or be detrimental to the public welfare of the
12 community." (Report to Planning Commission, February 6, 1979, p. 3; Minutes of February 6,
13 1979 Planning Commission Meeting, p. 3.) Among others, the conditions imposed on the
14 Shopping Center Approvals provided that exterior modifications to individual store fronts would
15  be subject to review and approval by the Planning Director. In actual and good faith reliance on
16 the City's approvals and permits, the Shopping Center was thereafter constructed in accordance
17 with the Shopping Center Approvals and has been in continuous operation since that time.

18 26. One of the Shopping Center's main anchor buildings, totaling approximately
19 90,000 square feet, was leased for many years to Kmart. In or around 2020, Kmart ceased
20| operations. Thereafter, Petitioner sought a long-term tenant for the empty Kmart building space.
21  For a commercial retail center, an anchor building like the now-empty Kmart building, is vital to
22 the overall leasing and thus economic viability of the center as a whole.

23 27. Sometime in 2021, THD expressed interest in becoming a tenant in the Shopping
24 Center and redeveloping the site of the former Kmart building with a new home improvement
25 store. Petitioner discussed THD's expression of interest with responsible City officials to
26 determine the feasibility of pursuing a new tenancy agreement with THD, and Petitioner was
27 assured by those responsible City officials that the City would welcome the opportunity to have
28 THD become a tenant in the Shopping Center.

18170532.7 a08/24/22 DECLARATORY RELIEF AND DAMAGES

- 28. In justifiable reliance on those City assurances and representations, and in reliance
2 on the existing permits, approvals and zoning applicable to the use of the Shopping Center, the
3 Petitioner exercised contractual option rights to reclaim the vacant Kmart space and pursue new
4 lease negotiations with THD. Had Petitioner not been induced to exercise the lease termination
5 option with Kmart, Kmart's obligations to pay rent would have continued through April 30, 2025.

6 29.

7 Under the City's Zoning Code in effect when THD submitted its application, a
home improvement store was a use permitted as of right, subject only to design review approval
8 for new construction or exterior modifications. In Petaluma, design review approval is referred to
9 as Site Plan & Architectural Review or "SPAR."

10 30. THD and Petitioner entered into a new written Lease Agreement for the former
11 Kmart space on February 5, 2021, and THD submitted a formal application to the City for SPAR
12 approval to demolish the existing Kmart store building and build a new store in that general
13 location, on November 3, 2021.1 On December 9, 2021, City staff deemed the SPAR application
14 "incomplete," citing the ostensible need to complete studies of various potential impacts,
15 including among others, traffic, air, and noise studies. Although the requested studies were
16 outside the scope of matters publicly identified by the City as necessary for a complete SPAR
17 application, THD nonetheless prepared and provided the requested information to City staff.
18 Shortly thereafter, the City undertook action to amend its SPAR ordinance, so as to make review
19 thereunder "discretionary" for purposes of CEQA. (Ordinance No. 2811 introduced April 18,
20 2022 and approved May 2, 2022.)

21 31. THD made several attempts to respond to City demands for "more information" by
22 repeated submittals, but the City persisted in requesting additional information, that had nothing
23 to do with the application. THD eventually decided to simply attempt to remodel and reoccupy the
24 existing Kmart building with no substantial exterior changes. As acknowledged in a City Staff
25 Report to the Planning Commission (06/28/22), the amount of City discretion over such a tenant a
26 improvement/remodeling project is limited, since the relevant SPAR ordinance, even as amended,

27

DECLARATORY RELIEF AND DAMAGES

- focuses on exterior design changes to the building. Under the controlling Shopping Center
2 approvals, the Planning Director is authorized to review and approve such changes.

3 32. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that shortly after THD
4 expressed interest in locating at the Shopping Center and re-tenanting the empty Kmart building,

5 the City--without any formal notice to Petitioner or THD-introduced the Zoning Change to
6 require a conditional use permit ("CUP") for any otherwise permitted commercial retail project

7 occupying more than 25,000 square feet. The Planning Commission recommended approval of
8 the Contested Ordinance at its June 28, 2022 meeting. The City Council, in turn, quickly

0 approved the Contested Ordinance at its August 1, 2022 hearing.

10 33. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that former Kmart building
11 at the Shopping Center (which was then under consideration for occupancy by THD) was the only
12 vacant retail space larger than 25,000 square feet in Petaluma at the time of Respondents' actions
13 on the Zoning Change that would be subject to the Zoning Change.

14 34. In connection with Respondents' adoption of the Zoning Change, Petitioner is
15 informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that at least one councilmember purported to justify the
16 Zoning Change based on a perceived need to "'protect Friedman's." Friedman's owns and operates
17 an existing 83,000 square foot home improvement store located nearby and has its corporate
18 headquarters in Petaluma.

19 35. In its recitals purporting to justify the Zoning Change, the City Council make various
20 speculative, unfounded, and unsubstantiated claims about the impacts posed by "large" stores.
21 Some of these claims about increasing air quality emissions and vehicle miles traveled were

22 specifically refuted by expert studies submitted by THD in connection with its application. The
23 record evidence demonstrated, for example, that the requested THD project would reduce vehicle
24 miles traveled by 8,223 miles per day. Put differently, actual data shows Respondents' enactment
25 of the Zoning Change will add over 8,000 daily vehicle miles traveled, with increased emissions,
26 compared to the pre-existing conditions under which THD occupancy is permitted by right.

27 36. Further, even though the City's General Plan and IZO specifically provide for
28| regional commercial uses at the Shopping Center and elsewhere, the City's recitals in the Contested

atlorneys at law 2783/099999-0084 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
18170532.7 a08/24/22 DECLARATORY RELIEF AND DAMAGES

1 Ordinance speculate inconsistently about the alleged risks "large stores" pose to the "economic
2 viability of local and regional businesses," and the negative impact such stores could have on the
3 "aesthetic and historical culture of neighborhoods." The recitals also refer to the difficulties posed

4 by re-tenanting a large single occupant store which can lead to blight and urban decay. Yet, an
5  immediate and direct effect of the Zoning Change is that a large single-occupant store will remain
6 vacant indefinitely, and will be much more difficult to re-tenant under the Contested Ordinance, and

7 thus the Contested Ordinance itself potentially contributes to blight and urban decay.

8 37. In terms of CEQA, the City Council purported to find that the Zoning Change was
9 not a "project" as defined by CEQA, and/or exempt from CEQA. However, because of its potential
10 to result in significant environmental impacts, the Zoning Change is not exempt from CEQA. The

11 City cannot credibly claim it is enacting the Zoning Change to ensure more CEQA review while at
12 the same time inconsistently purporting to exempt its actions approving the Zoning Change from
13 CEQA review.

14 38. Although the City did not approve the Project until August 1, 2022, it prematurely
15 filed a Notice of Exemption for the Project on July 22, 2022. While such a prematurely-filed notice

16 is not legally effective,2 this Petition was nonetheless filed within 35 days from the filing and posting
17 of such notice of exemption. (PRC § 21167(d).)

18 39. In response to the City's adoption of the Zoning Change, and as a direct and
19 proximate result thereof, THD withdrew its application from the City and withdrew from its
20 proposed tenancy agreements with Petitioner. This action is timely filed to seek relief from the
21 Respondents' arbitrary and unlawful actions.

22 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

23 (Petition for Writ of Mandate for Violation of CEQA)

24 40. Petitioner hereby incorporates the allegations of the foregoing paragraphs as though
25 set forth in full herein by this reference.

26 41. Pursuant to CEQA, before a public agency undertakes or approves any action,

including amendments to a zoning ordinance, which may cause a direct, or reasonably foreseeable
2 indirect, physical change in the environment, the agency must first identify, assess and publicly
3 disclose the project's potential environmental effects. An agency may not approve a project that
4 has the potential to have significant environmental impacts if there are feasible alternatives or
5 mitigation measures that would avoid or substantially lessen the adverse environmental impacts.

42. Rather than comply with CEQA, the Respondents erroneously purported to rely on
7 various inconsistent and unsupported "theories" as to why they should not be required to comply
8 with CEQA before taking action on the proposed Zoning Change.

9 43. The Respondents erroneously claimed that the Zoning Change is not a "project" as
10 defined by CEQA. To the contrary, it is well settled that the adoption or amendment of a zoning
11 ordinance is a "project" subject to § CEQA. (PRC § 21080(a) [CEQA applies to "discretionary
12 projects proposed to be carried out or approved by public agencies, including . . . the enactment and
13 amendment of zoning ordinances . . ."]; CEQA Guidelines § 15378(a) [noting that for CEQA
14 purposes, a "project" includes "[a]n activity directly undertaken by any public agency including .

15 enactment and amendment of zoning ordinances . . .."])

16 44. It is reasonably foresecable that the Project would cause displacement of
17 development and force (and has, in fact, forced) certain commercial businesses, to locate in other

18 areas outside the City. As such, the Project may likely result in increased air quality, noise,
19 transportation, and urban decay impacts, including an increase in greenhouse gas emissions, vehicle
20 miles traveled, and other related emissions. (See, e.g., Muzzy Ranch Co. v. Solano Airport Land
21 Use Commission (2007) 41 Cal.4th 372, 383 [land use plan found to be a project due to potential to
22 result in displaced development impacts]; accord, Napa Citizens for Honest Government V. Napa
23 County Board of Supervisors (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 342, 369 [court observes that "the purpose of
24 CEQA would be undermined if the appropriate governmental agencies went forward without an
25 awareness of the effects a project will have on areas outside of the boundaries of the project area."].)
26 Thus, the City had no legal or factual basis on which to erroneously claim that the Zoning Change

27 was not a project subject to CEQA.

28 45. Respondents also erroneously purported to rely on the Class 8 categorical exemption

Rutan & Tucker, LLP -11-
attorneys at law 2783/099999-0084 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
18170532.7 a08/24/22 DECLARATORY RELIEF AND DAMAGES

1 from CEQA applicable to actions by regulatory agencies for protection of the environment (the
2 "Environmental Protection Exemption"). However, the Environmental Protection Exemption only
3 applies to "actions, as authorized, by state or local ordinance, to assure the maintenance, restoration,
4 enhancement, or protection of the environment where the regulatory process involves procedures
5 for protection of the environment." (CEQA Guidelines con 15308.) This narrow exemption is
6 reserved for situations in which an agency has been authorized by law to undertake environmental
7 protection activities. Nothing in the exemption nor case law supports its broader application to an

8 amendment to a zoning ordinance, such as at issue here, and as a matter of law, the exemption does
9 not apply to the Zoning Change Project. Exemptions from CEQA are to be narrowly construed and
10 not unreasonably expanded. (Wildlife Alive v. Chickering (1976) 18 Cal.3d 190, 205; McQueen v.
11 Board of Directors (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 1136, 1148.)

12 46. CEQA expressly provides that a categorical exemption "shall not be used for an
13 activity where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the
14 environment due to unusual circumstances." (CEQA Guidelines § 15300.2(c).) By requiring
15 additional discretionary approvals for commercial uses that were previously allowed as a matter of
16 right, the Project has the unusual consequence of displacing such development to other jurisdictions.
17 Moreover, the evidence submitted to Respondents showed that the Zoning Change may result in
18 significant environmental impacts to, among others, air quality, greenhouse gas emissions, noise,
19 transportation/vehicle miles traveled, and urban decay. The City's reliance on a categorical
20 exemption thus was unlawful.

21 47. Respondents also erroneously claimed that the Project is exempt from CEQA
22 pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15183 because the proposed zoning amendments are
23 consistent with the General Plan. CEQA Guidelines section 15183 is irrelevant however because it
24 merely provides for the potential of streamlined review for development projects that are consistent
25 with the development densities set forth in a general plan. The Zoning Change is not a development
26 project nor does it implicate issues of consistency with development densities.3

27
Even if viewing consistency in a manner broader than that specified in section 15183, the 28 Project is not consistent with the City's General Plan. See Second Cause of Action alleging Violation of the Planning & Zoning Law, infra.
Rütan & Tucker, LLP -12-

48. Even assuming that the Project somehow qualified for CEQA Guidelines section

2 15813, that section still requires an analysis of project-specific significant impacts which are

3 peculiar to the project or its site. Examples of such impacts include off-site impacts and other
4 impacts that were not disclosed in the prior EIR for the general plan. As noted above, the Project
5 may result in significant impacts to, among others, air quality, greenhouse gas emissions, noise,
6 transportation/vehicle miles traveled, and urban decay. None of these impacts were disclosed in the
7 prior EIR for the General Plan. The City undertook no initial study or other analysis to determine
8 whether the Project would or would not result in any such impacts as required by CEQA Guidelines

0 section 15183. Moreover, the City made no finding that applicable mitigation measures in the
10 general plan EIR would be imposed and undertaken. As such, related significant environmental
11 effects are not exempt from further review: (PRC § 21083.3(c); CEQA Guidelines § 15183().)
12 Respondents cannot blithely say that the Project is "exempt" pursuant to section 15183 without
13 actually doing the analysis and following the procedure set forth in that section.

14 49. Respondents further claim that the Project is exempt under the "common sense

15 exemption." That exemption, however, is reserved for very limited situations in which "it can be
16 seen with certainty that there is no possibility that the activity in question may have a significant
17 effect on the environment .. (CEQA § Guidelines § 15061(b)(3).) An agency relying on the
18 exemption must be able to show, based on record evidence, that it is certain that that the activity
19 cannot have a significant effect on the environment. The City did not undertake this mandatory
20 inquiry here. Even if it had, it could not show with certainty that the Project will not have a
21 significant effect on the environment. As previously mentioned, Project may result in significant
22 environmental impacts to, among others, air quality, greenhouse gas emissions, noise,
23 transportation/vehicle miles traveled, and urban decay

24 50. In doing the things herein alleged, Respondents failed to comply with their
25 mandatory duties under CEQA in several substantial and prejudicial respects, including without
26 limitation, the following:

27 51. Respondents erroneously relied on inapplicable CEQA exemptions, and as a result
28 failed to consider, disclose, or itigate the Project's significant environmental impacts, as required

Rutan & Tucker; LLP -13-
ellorneys at lew 2783/099999-0084 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR

1 by CEQA. Had appropriate review been conducted, it would have revealed that the Project will
2 have significant adverse impacts that Respondents failed to disclose or mitigate prior to approving

3 the Project. Such significant adverse impacts include, but are not limited to, impacts to air quality,

4 greenhouse gas emissions, noise, transportation/vehicle miles traveled, and urban decay.

5 52. Respondents failed to provide substantial evidence in the public record prior to its
6 decision to exempt the Project from CEQA review sufficient to support such decision.

7 53. Respondents erroneously failed to publicly consider or provide evidence in the public
8 record addressing the CEQA Guidelines section 15300.2 exception or other exceptions to
9 Respondents' proposed reliance upon categorical exemptions. Thus, Respondents would have been
10 precluded from relying on a categorical exemption, even if the Project otherwise qualified for one.

11 54. Respondents failed to make required findings when approving the Project and/or any
12 findings made by Respondents were not supported by substantial evidence in light of the whole
13 record.

14 55. Respondents failed to consider feasible alternatives to the Project, or to consider
15 feasible mitigation measures for the Project's significant environmental impacts.

16 56. Respondents' actions in approving the Project were not in compliance with
17 procedures required by law, were not supported by substantial evidence in the public record, were
18 not reflected in legally adequate findings, and were arbitrary, capricious, and reflected a prejudicial
19 abuse of discretion.

20 57. Petitioner has no plain, adequate, and speedy remedy at law to redress the wrongs

21 described in this Petition.

22 58. Petitioner has performed any and all conditions precedent to filing this action and
23 has exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent required by law by, inter
24 alia, submitting written and oral comments objecting to the Project and Respondents' failure to
25 comply with CEQA.

26 59. Pursuant to PRC section 21167.5, Petitioner has provided written notice of the
27 commencement of this action to Respondents.

28 60. Pursuant to PRC section 21167.7, and CCP section 388, Petitioner has or will

1 provide written notice of this action, including a copy of this Petition, to the State Attorney General.

2 61. Petitioner brings this action pursuant to PRC section 21168.5 and CCP section 1085

3 (or, alternatively, under PRC section 21168 and CCP section 1094.5), which require that an

4 agency's approval of a project be set aside if the agency has prejudicially abused its discretion.

5 Prejudicial abuse of discretion occurs where Respondents have failed to proceed in the manner

6 required by law, the decision is not supported by the findings, or the findings are not supported by

7 the evidence.

8 62. Pursuant to CCP section 1085 (or 1094.5), a writ of mandate should accordingly

9 issue: directing Respondents to rescind their approvals of the Project, and Respondents'
10 determination that the Project is exempt from CEQA review; invalidating any and all purported
11 approvals or permits based on such inadequate CEQA review; and prohibiting Respondents from
12 taking any subsequent action to implement, enforce, or rely upon the Contested Ordinance or the
13 Zoning Change, unless and until Respondents have complied with CEQA.

14 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

15 (Petition for Writ of Mandate for Violation of Planning & Zoning Law)

16 63. Petitioner hereby incorporates the allegations of the foregoing paragraphs as though
17 set forth in full herein by this reference.

18 64. All local land use decisions, including consideration of the Zoning Change, must be
19 shown to be "consistent with" the applicable general plan. (Orange Citizens for Parks &
20 Recreation v. Superior Court (2016) 2 Cal.5th 141, 152 [invalidating project approval where not
21 shown to be consistent with general plan]; Families Unafraid to Uphold Rural Etc. of Placer
22 County v. Board of Supervisors of Placer County (1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 1332, 1336 [county
23 abused its discretion by approving a development project inconsistent with general plan policies].)

24 65. A city's general plan is effectively the "constitution for future development" in the
25 community, and any zoning ordinance or other subordinate land use action that is not shown to be
26 consistent with the general plan is "void ab initio." (Lesher Communications, Inc. v City of y
27 Walnut Creek (1990) 52 Cal.3d 531, 540; Elysian Heights Residents Assn. v. City of Los Angeles
28 (1986) 182 Cal.App.3d 21, 38.) "The propriety of virtually any local decision affecting land use

Rutan & Tucker, LLP -15-
allorneys et law 2783/099999-0084 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR

1 and development depends upon consistency with the applicable general plan and its elements.»
2 (Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Board of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 570.) In particular, a
3 subsidiary zoning ordinance must be consistent with the general plan, and in the case of any

4 inconsistencies between the two, the general plan governs.

5 66. In order to be deemed "consistent," the Zoning Change must actually be
6 "compatible with the objectives, policies, general land uses, and programs specified in the general
7 plan." (Napa Citizens for Honest Government v. Napa County Board of Supervisors (2001) 91
8 Cal.App.4th 342, 378-79 [county abused its discretion in adopting a specific plan that permitted
9 development without "definite affirmative commitments to mitigate" impacts to traffic and
10 housing contrary to policies and objectives set forth in its general plan].) "Consistency requires
11 more than incantation, and [an agency] cannot articulate a policy in its general plan and then
a 12 approve a conflicting project." (Endangered Habitats League, Inc. v. County of Orange (2005)
13 131 Cal.App.4th 777, 789.)

14 67. Failure to comply with even one general plan policy is enough to render a project
15"inconsistent" with the general plan, and any project approvals would be invalid. (See, e.g.,
16 (Spring Valley Lake Assn. V. City of Victorville (2016) 248 Cal.App.4th 91 [invalidating city's
17 approval of permit for commercial development because of failure to show consistency with one
18 general plan policy]; California Native Plant Society v. City of Rancho Cordova (2009) 172
19 Cal.App.4th 603, 640-642 [finding a project to be inconsistent with an agency's general plan
20 based on its failure to comply with a single policy requiring the agency to "coordinate" with
21 specified resource agencies on mitigation for impacts to special-status species]; accord,
22 Endangered Habitats League, supra, 131 Cal.App.4th at 789 [project's failure to comply with a
23 single general plan provision calling for use of a prescribed traffic study methodology].)

24 68. The proposed Zoning Change is manifestly inconsistent with several of the City's
25 fundamental policies embodied in the City's own General Plan, and there is no substantial
26 evidence in the record to support any finding or implied finding of general plan consistency by the
27 Respondents.

28 69. First, commercial retail uses are listed as principally permitted uses in the General

Rutan Tucker, LLP -16-
atforneys at law 2783/099999-0084 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR

Plan. Specifically, the Community Commercial designation "includes shopping centers and
2 commercial districts, including regionally-oriented centers.34 (General Plan, Land Use Element,

3 p. 1-7.) And the Mixed Use designation "requires a robust combination of uses, including retail,
4 residential, service commercial, and/or offices." (Id.) Contrary to the General Plan, the Zoning

5 Change only allows retail uses larger than 25,000 square with approval of a use permit. In this
6 regard, the Zoning is fundamentally and irreconcilably inconsistent with the General Plan.

7 70. Second, the arbitrary size limits imposed on retail uses by the Zoning Change
8 conflict with the controlling floor area ratios ("FAR") set forth in the General Plan. Sites with a
9 Neighborhood Commercial land use designation are subject to a 0.8 FAR. (General Plan, Land
10 Use Element, p. 1-7.) Sites with a Community Commercial land use designation are subject to a
11 1.2 FAR. (Id.) And sites designated Mixed Use are subject to a 2.5 FAR. (See also General Plan,
12 Table 1.3-3 [provides for approximately 2.8 million square feet of additional commercial/retail
13 development by general plan buildout].) Even the designation with the lowest FAR-
14 Neighborhood Commercial-envisions a commercial development site of up to 10 acres. At this
15 size, the General Plan would allow for approximately 350,000 square feet of commercial
16 development. In stark contrast, the Zoning Change allows only for 25,000 square feet of
17 commercial development, at least without securing and obtaining approval of a discretionary CUP.
18 The arbitrary size limits imposed by the Zoning Change would likely make it impossible to
19 achieve the allowed FAR for commercial development sites specified, and "required," by the
20 General Plan.

21 71. Third, the General Plan contains several goals and policies supporting the retention
22 and expansion of commercial and retail uses. Certain of the General Plan's Guiding Principles
23 call for fostering and promoting economic diversity and opportunities as well as expanding retail
24 opportunities to meet residents' needs and promoting the city's fiscal health. (General Plan, p. i-
25 8.) Per Goal 1-G-1, the City is to maintain a balanced land use program that meets the long-term
26 residential, employment, retail, institutional, education, recreation, and open space needs of the
27 community. Policy 1-P-2 calls for using land efficiently by "promoting infill development, at

equal or higher density and intensity than surrounding uses." Policy 1-P-7 encourages "flexibility
2 in building form and in the nature of activities to allow for innovation and the ability to change
3  over time." Policy 1-P-11 allows for "land use intensification at strategic locations along the

4 arterial corridors leading to Downtown and Central Petaluma, including aging commercial and

5 industrial sites."

72. General Plan Policy 9-P-1 calls for attracting economic activity that brings dollars
7 into the local economy by exporting products and services," including "serving unmet local
8 demands for goods [and] services," "generating revenue for the City," and "providing jobs for un-
9 and under-employed segments of the work force." Policy 9-P-3 provides for "an array of
10 employment opportunities to existing and future residents by assuring diversity in Petaluma's
11 industry and enterprise mix." Policy 9-P-13 calls for expanding and diversifying Petaluma's retail
12 base and encourages expansion of "local choice in types of retail enterprises." Policy 9-P-16
13 promotes strengthening existing retail concentrations, particularly those that serve Petaluma's
14 residential neighborhoods.

15 73. The Zoning Change conflicts with all of the above goals and policies. It will make
16 many existing commercial/retail uses nonconforming and would allow new commercial/retail uses
17 only with approval of a discretionary CUP. The Zoning Change will cause a significant decline in
18 business activity, employment opportunities, and tax revenues otherwise benefitting the City and
19 the community at large.

20 74. By approving the Zoning Change that is inconsistent with the City's General Plan,
21 Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law and committed a prejudicial abuse of
22 discretion.

23 75. Pursuant to CCP sections 1085 and/or 1094.5, a writ of mandate should issue
24 | setting aside Respondents' approval of the Zoning Change as violating the Planning & Zoning

25 Law and being arbitrary, capricious, and without evidentiary support.

26 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

27 (Petition for Writ of Mandate for Violation of Petitioner's Vested Rights)

28 76. Petitioner hereby incorporates the allegations of the foregoing paragraphs as though

Rutan & Tucker, LLP -18-
attorneys at law 2783/099999-0084 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
18170532.7 a08/24/22 DECLARATORY RELIEF AND DAMAGES

1 set forth in full herein by this reference.

2 77. Petitioner has a vested right to use the Shopping Center for commercial uses
3 through substantial reliance on the Shopping Center Approvals and building permits issued by the
4 City for buildings designed and long used for commercial/retail purposes. Specifically, Petitioner
5 has spent millions of dollars in reliance on the approved permits and planned infrastructure for the
6 Shopping Center and its environs. These funds were used to acquire the Shopping Center,
7 negotiate and draft leases, and pay other direct and indirect expenses related to the ownership,
8 maintenance, and operation of the Shopping Center. As a result of Petitioner's reasonable and

9 detrimental reliance on permits and approvals issued by the City, Respondents are estopped from
10| precluding general retail use, including building materials and landscape materials sales, of the
11 Shopping Center or from imposing new regulations on the use inconsistent with the City's prior
12 actions, representations, and approvals.

13 78. A use of property, and the right to use property, is lawfully established once rights
14 have vested through substantial expenditures in reliance on permits issued by a governmental
15 agency. (Cf. Avco Community Developers, Inc. v. South Coast Regional Commission (1976) 17
16 Cal.3d 785, 791.) The vested rights doctrine is predicated upon estoppel of the governing body.
17 "An equitable estoppel requiring the government to exempt a land use from a subsequently
18| imposed regulation must include (1) a promise such as that implied by a building permit that the
19 proposed use will not be prohibited by a class of restrictions that includes the regulation in
20 question; and (2) reasonable reliance on the promise by the promisee to the promisee's detriment.3
21 (Santa Monica Pines, Ltd. v. Rent Control Board (1984) 35 Cal.3d 858, 867.)

22 79. Respondents are estopped by their prior actions and representations, and cannot
23 equitably or lawfully revoke or modify the Shopping Center Approvals without cause and without
24| providing due process (e.g., notice and a hearing) to Petitioner. (Goat Hill Tavern v. City of Costa
25 Mesa (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1519, 1530 ["Once a use permit has been properly issued, the power

26

27 (Accord, Hock Investment Co. v. City & County of San Francisco (1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 438, 449 [noting that the issuance of a permit "constitutes a promise by the approving agency that a 28 subsequently adopted ordinance will not prohibit the proposed use. When the applicant reasonably relies upon that promise to its detriment, an estoppel is created."].)
Rutan & Tucker, LLP -19-

of a municipality to revoke it is limited."]; accord, Malibu Mountain Recreation, Inc. v. County of
2 Los Angeles (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 359, 367 ["A CUP creates a property right which may not be
3 revoked without constitutional rights of due process."].) Nor can the government infringe on a
4 vested right by changing the requirements of the original entitlements, e.g., by requiring additional
5 mitigation. (See, e.g., Kaufman & Broad Central Valley, Inc. v. City of Modesto (1994) 25
6 Cal.App.4th 1577, 1591 [city could not impose new fees on developer who had already obtained
7 vested right to complete a project].)

8 80. Action by Respondents to modify or revoke Petitioner's Shopping Center

9 Approvals impacts fundamental vested rights, and is subject to non-deferential judicial review.
10 (CCP § 1094.5(c) [as to cases involving fundamental vested rights, a reviewing court exercises its
11 "independent judgment on the evidence," to determine if an abuse of discretion is established
12 because "the findings are not supported by the weight of the evidence."]; see also Goat Hill
13 Tavern, supra, 6 Cal.App.4th at 1526, 1530 and Malibu Mountains, supra, 67 Cal.App.4th at 366-
14 370.)

15 81. By approving the Zoning Change that impermissibly infringes on and abridges
16 Petitioner's judicially-protected vested rights, Respondents failed to proceed in the manner
17 required by law and committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion.

18 82. Respondents' enactment of the Zoning Change will cause a significant decline in
19 business activity, employment opportunities, and a significant loss of tax revenues otherwise
20 benefitting the City and the community at large. Respondents' actions will have an enormous
21 detrimental economic effect and devaluation of the Shopping Center, and the other businesses
22 located and operating in and around the Shopping Center.

23 83. Pursuant to CCP sections 1085 and/or 1094.5, a writ of mandate should issue
24 setting aside Respondents' approval of the Zoning Change as violating applicable law and being
25 arbitrary, capricious, and without evidentiary support.

26 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

27  (Petition for Writ of Mandate for Abuse of Police Powers to Restrict Economic Competition)

28 84. Petitioner hereby incorporates the allegations of the foregoing paragraphs as though

Rutan & Tucker, LLP -20-
attorneys at law 2783/099999-0084 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
18170532.7 a08/24/22 DECLARATORY RELIEF AND DAMAGES

set forth in full herein by this reference.

2 85. It is well settled that a city cannot use its land use powers to grant existing businesses
a monopoly or shield them from economic competition. (Hernandez V. City of Hanford (2007) 41
4 Cal.4th 279, 297 [California Supreme Court observes that it is impermissible for a zoning action to
5 have a "private anticompetitive goal of protecting or disadvantaging a particular favored or
6 disfavored business or individual."].) In Friends of Davis v. City of Davis (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th
7 1004, the Court of Appeal held that a city could not use its design review ordinance to exclude a
8 prospective tenant from a proposed retail development project on the basis that it was a nationwide

9 chain store.

10 86. Despite these clear legal mandates, Respondents have inappropriately used their land
11 use powers to grant an existing business a monopoly or shield it from economic competition. One
12 of the councilmembers admitted as much in citing the need to "protect Friedman's" as a basis for
13 approving the Zoning Change. And the chronology of zoning changes here--amending the IZO to
14 make SPAR discretionary and then requiring a CUP for retail and home improvement stores-were
15 done in direct response to THD's application.

16 87. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that the City has exhibited
17 a pattern and practice of misusing or exceeding its police power/land use authority for improper
18 purposes or without legal or evidentiary support. The Respondents' arbitrary and capricious land
19 use planning and zoning actions described in this Petition are similar to that pattern and practice of
20 abuse of police power authority.

21 88. By approving the Zoning Change aimed at restricting and shielding existing
22 businesses from competition, which is not a legitimate or valid exercise of Respondents' police
23 powers, Respondents failed to procced in the manner required by law and committed a prejudicial
24 abuse of discretion.

25 89. Pursuant to CCP sections 1085 and/or 1094.5, a writ of mandate should issue setting
26 aside Respondents' approval of the Zoning Change as violating applicable law and being arbitrary,
27 capricious, and without evidentiary support.

L FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

2

3 (Complaint for Damages for Violation of Constitutional and Civil Rights
42 U.S.C. § 1981 et seq.)

90. Petitioner hereby incorporates the allegations of the foregoing paragraphs as though
5 set forth in full herein by this reference.

6 91. In doing the things herein alleged, the Respondents and each of them were acting or
7 purporting to act within the course and scope of their official positions and under the color of state
8| law, and violated Petitioner's rights protected by the Constitution or laws of the United States and/or
9 California, including (without limitation):

10 a.

11 constitutional rights to Equal Protection of the laws;

b.

12 constitutional rights to Due Process of law; and

C.

13 property rights. constitutional protections against the uncompensated taking of property or

14 92. The Respondents are subject to the Constitution of the United States and the
15 California Constitution, which guarantee certain rights, including rights to due process and equal
16 protection of the law, and prohibit governmental action which impairs such rights, or which take or
17 damage property without payment of just compensation.

18 93. Respondents, and each of them, have nevertheless acted arbitrarily and unreasonably,
19 in violation of Petitioner's rights under the federal and state constitutions to substantive and
20  procedural due process, and rights to equal protection of the laws, and rights against uncompensated
21 taking or damaging of property, by arbitrarily subjecting them to unreasonable and discriminatory
22 treatment, including the Zoning Change.

23 94. Respondents' actions are in conflict with and preempted by Petitioner's rights to be
24 free from arbitrary and irrational governmental action, to be treated fairly and equally with other
25 similarly situated property owners, and to be free from an uncompensated taking of property.

26 95. In doing the things herein alleged, the Respondents have harmed and impaired
27 Petitioner's rights and interests and the Petitioner's constitutional rights. (U.S. Constitution, 5th and
28 14th Amendment; California Constitution, Article I, § 17.) Respondents have, in effect, impaired

F and taken Petitioner's rights to the lawful use and occupancy of the Shopping Center property,
2 without offering or providing just compensation.

3 96. The Federal Civil Rights Act (42 USC § 1981 et seq.) provides remedies for
4 violations of rights protected under the Constitution or laws of the United States.

5 97. As a proximate result of Respondents' actions as alleged herein, Petitioner has
6 suffered, and continues to suffer, irreparable harm as set forth above and are thereby entitled to

8 proof at trial. Petitioner is entitled to recover just compensation for the taking of the Shopping
9 Center property.

10 98. As a result of Respondents' actions, Petitioner has also been required to incur
11 attorneys' fees, expenses, and court costs, and are entitled to seek recovery of such damages and
12 reasonable attorneys' fees and costs under 42 U.S.C. § 1988.

13 99. WHEREFORE, Petitioners seek relief and judgment as set forth herein.

14 SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION

15 (Complaint For Damages for Unlawful Interference With Contractual Relations)

16 100. Petitioner hereby incorporates the allegations of the foregoing paragraphs as though
17 set forth in full herein by this reference.

18 101. Article I. section I, 10 of the U.S. Constitution provides that, "No State shall ... pass
19 any Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts."

20 102. Petitioner and THD entered into a written Lease Agreement of the Property for the
21 Shopping Center on February 5, 2021. THD was not able to proceed with its proposed development
22 and enjoyment of the leased premises at the Shopping Center because of Respondents' arbitrary and
23 pretextual delays in processing THD's applications and Respondents' dilatory and unreceptive
24 actions leading to the enactment of the Contested Ordinance, which once enacted interposed new
25 obstacles, delays, and burdens including redundant CEQA review and new discretionary approvals
26 (adding at least one to two years of additional delay to a project that had already been under review
27 by the City for more than one year).

28 103. The enactment of the City's new Contested Ordinance, and the Respondents' actions

atforneys af law 2783/099999-0084 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
18170532.7 a08/24/22 DECLARATORY RELIEF AND DAMAGES

leading to that enactment, substantially impaired and interfered with the contractual lease
2 relationship between THD and Petitioner, by precluding the use of the Shopping Center for which

3 it was proposed to be leased, and Respondents' actions as alleged caused the ensuing termination of
4 that Lease Agreement by THD, resulting is substantial economic harm to Petitioner, and to other
5 occupants and users of the Shopping Center.

104. Respondents have intentionally and/or negligently interfered with prospective
7 economic relations between Petitioner and THD. The Lease demonstrates an economic relationship
8 between Petitioner and THD. Respondents were aware of the relationship and intentionally acted
9 to disrupt that relationship. Respondents did disrupt that relationship causing THD to withdraw its
10 application. And significant economic harm to Petitioner was proximately caused by the acts of
11 Respondents.

12 105. The actions of Respondents as set forth in this Petition were unprivileged, wrongful,

13 and unexcused.

14 106. City staff and representatives, acting in their official capacities for Respondents are,
15 and were at all times relevant to this action, persons acting under color of state law, pursuant to an
16 official policy, custom or practice of the City.

17 107. By reason of the acts, omissions and conduct of City staff and representatives, acting

18 in their official capacities for Respondents, as alleged above, Petitioner has been damaged in an
19 amount according to proof at the time of trial. Petitioner will continue to suffer such damages until
20 Respondents afford Petitioner their constitutional right to freedom from interference with
21 contractual relations and common law right to be free from interference with prospective economic
22 advantage.

23 108. Petitioner is entitled to recover just compensation for the taking of the Shopping
24 Center property. Additionally, Petitioners are entitled to recover their attorneys' fees and litigation
25 expenses pursuant to 42 U.S.C. section 1988.

26 109. WHEREFORE, Petitioner seeks relief and judgment as set forth herein.

27 SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION

28 (Complaint For Declaratory and Injunctive Relief)

Rutan & Tucker, LLP -24-
attorneys et law 2783/099999-0084 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
18170532.7 a08/24/22 DECLARATORY RELIEF AND DAMAGES

1 110. Petitioner hereby incorporates the allegations of the foregoing paragraphs as though
2 set forth in full herein by this reference.

3 111. An actual controversy exists between Petitioner and Respondents regarding
4 Respondents' approval of the Zoning Change. Petitioners maintain that Respondents' approval of
5 the Project violates state law, including CEQA and the State Planning & Zoning Law, as well as the
6 City's own General Plan, and state and federal constitutional provisions, as described above.
7 Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that Respondents maintain the contrary.
8 Accordingly, declaratory relief is appropriate and necessary to determine Respondents' authority to
9 approve the Zoning Change.

10 112. To remedy Respondents' violations of law, as described above, Petitioner seeks a
11 declaration that Respondents' approval of the Zoning Change was invalid and contrary to law,
12 including but not limited to CEQA, the State Planning & Zoning Law, the City's General Plan, and
13 state and federal constitutional provisions. Such a declaration is a necessary and proper exercise of
14 the Court's power to prevent future actions by Respondents' in violation of the law.
15 113. Respondents' actions, including the wrongful enactment of the Contested Ordinance,
16 has caused and continues to cause irreparable harm to the Petitioner, and to other members of the
17 public. Petitioner has no speedy or effective remedy at law for relief from such harm.

18 114. Immediate issuance of temporary and preliminary injunctive relief enjoining
19 Respondents from taking any further action in furtherance of, or in implementation of, the Zoning
20 Change pending the resolution of this action is therefore necessary and appropriate.

21 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

22 WHIEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully prays for judgment as follows:

23 1. For a Writ of Mandate:

24 a. Directing Respondents, and each of them, to rescind and set aside the
25 determination that the proposed Project is exempt from CEQA review, and to rescind and set aside
26 the Zoning Change;

27 b. Commanding Respondents to refrain from taking any further actions in
28 furtherance or implementation of the Contested Ordinance and Zoning Change;

C. Commanding Respondents to prepare an environmental impact report and
2 circulate it for public review and comment, consistent with the requirements of CEQA, and to
3 comply with all other requirements of CEQA, prior to taking any subsequent action to approve the
4 Project;

d. Commanding Respondents to rescind and set aside the Contested Ordinance;

6 and

7 e. Commanding Respondents to conform their actions to controlling law,
8 including state and local planning and zoning requirements;

9 2. For compensatory damages, according to proof at trial;

10 3. For the declaratory relief requested above;

11 4. For preliminary injunctive relief ordering the Respondents to refrain from
12 implementing or enforcing the Zoning Change, while this action is pending;

13 5. For a permanent injunction ordering the Respondents to refrain from implementing
14 or enforcing the Zoning Change pending Respondents' full compliance with CEQA and otherwise
15 conforming their actions with the procedural mandates of the law;

16 6. For an award of attorneys' fees, litigation expenses, and costs as permitted or
17 required by law, including but not limited to, CCP §§ 1021.5, 1036; Government Code §§ 800,
18 6259, 54960.5; 42 U.S.C. § 1988; and other statutory and common law; and

19 7. For such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

Under that practice, I deposited such envelope(s) in an out-box for collection by other personnel of Rutan & 17 Tucker, LLP, and for ultimate posting and placement with the U.S. Postal Service on that same day in the ordinary course of business. If the customary business practices of Rutan & Tucker, 18 LLP with regard to collection and processing of correspondence and mailing were followed, and am confident that they were, such envelope(s) were posted and placed in the United States mail at 19 Irvine. California, that same date. I am aware that on motion of party served, service is presumed is invalid if postal cancellation date or postage meter date is more than one day after date of deposit 20 for mailing in affidavit.
