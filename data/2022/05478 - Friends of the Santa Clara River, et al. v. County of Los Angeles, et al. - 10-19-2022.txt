26 petition this Court for a Writ of Mandate and Order under Code of Civil Procedure sections

27 1094.5 and/or 1085, directed to COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES and LOS ANGELES COUNTY

28 BOARD OF SUPERVISORS, (collectively "Respondents" or the "County"), setting aside
Respondents' approval of revisions to the Santa Clara Floodway Maps by adopting Maps 43-

1

2 ML26.1, 43-ML27.1 and 43-ML28 (the "Project") in the unincorporated Community of Castaic,
in Los Angeles County.

3 2.

4 Petitioners contend that the County violated the California Environmental Quality
Act ("CEQA") and failed to proceed as required by law when it concluded that the revisions to

5 the Floodway Ordinance and the corresponding maps and water-surface elevations are

6 categorically exempt from review under CEQA pursuant to CEQA Guidelines (14 CCR § 15000,

7 et seq) sections 15061(b)(3) and 15308.
3.
8 Respondents also violated CEQA because the County staff reports failed to

9 adequately and accurately describe the whole of the Project by neglecting to admit and explain

10 that several land use projects, including construction of bank stabilization, a sheriff station, and

Babak Naficy 11 portions of the unapproved Entrada North project are directly related to and are dependent on
these floodway map revisions.

12 THE PARTIES

13 4.

14 Petitioner and Plaintiff FRIENDS OF THE SANTA CLARA RIVER ("Friends")

7 is a California non-profit, public interest corporation with its principal place of business in

Office Law 15 Ventura, California. Friends brings this action on behalf of all its members who have been and

16 will continue to be harmed the County's approval of the project which along with other past,

17 present and future projects, will result in the loss of wetlands, destruction of vegetation in the

18 riverbed, and other degradation of the Santa Clara River. Friends' members canoe, swim, fish,

19 hike, travel, recreate, and observe wildlife throughout the Santa Clara River watershed.
5.
20 Petitioner and Plaintiff SANTA CLARITA ORGANIZATION FOR PLANNING

21 THE ENVIRONMENT ("SCOPE") is a California non-profit membership organization that is

22 concerned with protection of the environment. Some members of SCOPE live and work in

23 Northern Los Angeles County, in the vicinity of the project site. SCOPE and its members would

24 be directly, adversely, and irreparably harmed by the Project and its components, as described

25 herein, until and unless this Court provides the relief prayed for in this petition. SCOPE brings
this action on its own behalf, for its members, and in the public interest.

26 6. Respondent and Defendant, County of Los Angeles, is a local government

27 agency and subdivision of the State of California charged with authority to regulate and

28 administer land use and development within its territory, but only in compliance with the duly
adopted provisions of its zoning ordinances, General Plan, and all applicable provisions of state

PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF - 2- .t,.

1 law, including the California Environmental Quality Act, the Planning and Zoning law, and the

2 Subdivision Map Act.

3 7. Respondent and Defendant Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors (the
"Board") is the legislative body and highest administrative body of the County. The Board has

5 the authority to approve and is responsible for amendments to the County General Plan, its

6 Zoning Maps, County ordinances, and the floodway maps at issue in this case.
8. Petitioners do not know the identity of DOES 1 to 10 but will amend the Petition
as required to specifically identify each such person or entity as a respondent and defendant if the
8 identity, interest, and capacity of such party, if any, becomes known.
9 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

10 9. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to California Code of Civil
Babak Naficy 11 Procedure sections 1085 and 410.10. This Court has the authority to issue a writ of mandate
12 directing Respondents to cease all further action on the Project until it can be brought into

13 compliance with the law pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1085. This Court also has

14 authority to award attorney's fees and costs under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5 where.

6 15 as here, Petitioners seek to enforce important rights affecting the public interest.
00!0 M07 16 10. Venue for this action properly lies in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County

17 because Respondents are a local agency situated in the County of Los Angeles. Code Civ. Proc.

18 394, subd. (a). In addition, the action concerns, in part, real property located in Los Angeles
County. Code Civ. Proc. § 392.
19 PROCEDURAL ALLEGATIONS
20
11.
21 Petitioners have performed any and all conditions precedent to filing the instant
action and have exhausted any and all administrative remedies to the extent required by law, by
22 inter alia, submitting written comments on the Project and its environmental review at every step
23 of the administrative review process.

24 12. Petitioners have requested that the County not approve the Project and argued

25 forcefully that the Project is not exempt from CEQA review. Any further attempts to pursue

26 administrative remedies would be futile.

27 13. Petitioners have complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code

28 section 21167.5 by mailing a written notice of the commencement of this action to Respondent

PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 3-

1 prior to filing this petition and complaint. A true and correct copy of the letter is attached hereto
2 as Exhibit A.

3 14. Petitioners have complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code

4 section 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure section 388 by mailing a copy of the Petition and

5 Complaint to the state Attorney General.
15.
6 Petitioners have no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of

7 law unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to comply

8 with their duties and set aside the approval of the Project until they have adequately reviewed the
Project as required by CEQA. In the absence of such remedies, Respondents' approvals will
9 remain in effect in violation of CEQA.
10 16. If Respondents are not enjoined from approving the Project, and from undertaking
Babak Naficy 11 or permitting development in reliance thereon, Petitioners will suffer irreparable harm from

12 which there is no adequate remedy at law in that the immediate Project area and surrounding

13 areas would be irrevocably altered and significant adverse impacts on the environment would

14 occur. Petitioners and the general public have been harmed by Respondents' failure to

6 15 adequately disclose and analyze the environmental impacts of the whole of the project.
00!0 Law 17.
16 In pursuing this action, which involves enforcement of important rights affecting

17 the public interest, Petitioners will confer a substantial benefit on the general public, including
citizens of Santa Clarita, Los Angeles County, and the State of California, and will therefore be
18 entitled to attorneys' fees and costs pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5.
19 18. Petitioners bring this action in part pursuant to Public Resources Code section
20 21168.5 and Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 or 1094.5, which require that an agency's

21 approval of a project be set aside if the agency has prejudicially abused its discretion. Prejudicial

22 abuse of discretion occurs either where an agency has failed to proceed in a manner required by

23 law or where its determination or decision is not supported by substantial evidence. Respondents

24 have prejudicially abused their discretion because Respondents have failed to proceed according

25 to the law and their decision to approve the Project is not supported by substantial evidence.
FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
26
19.
27 This is the second time the County of Los Angeles has attempted to approve thesel

28 map revisions without any adequate environmental review. The County first approved flood
map revisions at a January a 5, 2016, meeting, a after a first reading on December 15, 2015. The

PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF - 4-

P Board approved the Project, revising the floodway for a portion of the Santa Clara River and

2 related Floodway Maps ML Maps 43-ML26.2, 43-ML27.2 and 43-ML28.1.

3 20. As a result of SCOPE and Center for Biological Diversity's successful challenge

4 to the County's adoption of the flood map revisions on the basis of a CEQA exemption, the

5 County was directed by the court to set aside the map revisions.
21. More than six years later, the County again decided to approve the map revisions 6
without any adequate environmental review, based on a false conclusion that this Project is 7 exempt from CEQA. As set forth more fully below, the County's conclusion is unlawful and
8 inconsistent with the requirements of CEQA.
9 22. On March 4, 2015, the County's Department of Regional Planning issued a
10 Notice of Preparation ("NOP"), which included an Initial Study and an extended project
Babak Naficy 11 description a in connection with a project entitled Entrada North. According to the NOP, the

12 Entrada North project would include 1,150 multi-family residential units, 2,624,400 square feet

13 of commercial uses, and "a 50,000 square-foot public facility." According to the evidence in the

14 record, the "public facility" referred to in the NOP will be a new sheriff station which Newhall

7 15 Land Farming ("Newhall"), the developer of Entrada North and other projects in the vicinity is
Office Law being required to build as a condition of the County's approval of Newhall's developments. 16 23. Ignoring the evidence that shows the primary purpose of the flood map revisions
17 are to enable construction of a sheriff station and portions of the Entrada North project, including
18 required bank stabilization, the County continues to insist that the only purpose of these revisions
19 is merely to update the maps and to incorporate more accurate engineering analysis.

20 24. The County filed and on June 29, 2022, posted, two Notices of Exemption

21 ("NOE") for the Project asserting that the Project is categorically exempt pursuant to sections

22 15308 and 15061(b)(3) of the CEQA Guidelines (14 CCR § 15000, et seq). The NOEs do not

23 even mention the Entrada North project and sheriff station or the pivotal role the floodway map

24 revisions will play in enabling those projects to go forward.
25. The County relied on a Class 8 exemption, "Actions by Regulatory Agencies for 25 Protection of the Environment." The text of CEQA Guideline section 15308 explains that this
26 exemption "consists of actions taken by regulatory agencies, as authorized by state or local
27 ordinance, to assure the maintenance, restoration, enhancement, or protection of the environment
28 where the regulatory process involves procedures for protection of the environment.

PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF - 5-

* Construction activities and relaxation of standards allowing environmental degradation are not

2 included in this exemption."

3 26. The County also found the project is exempt pursuant to the so-called "common

4 sense" exemption pursuant to CEQA Guideline 15061, subdivision (b)(3).
CEQA MANDATES 5

6 27. CEQA was enacted to require public agencies and decision-makers to document

7 and consider the environmental implications of their actions before formal decisions are made.

8 Pub. Res. Code § 21000. CEQA operates to "[e]nsure that the long-term protection of the
environment shall be the guiding criterion in public decisions." Pub. Res. Code § 21001, subd.
9 |(d). "CEQA was intended to be interpreted in such a manner as to afford the fullest possible
10 protection to the environment within the reasonable scope of the statutory authority." 14
Babak Naficy 11 California Code of Regulations, ("CEQA Guidelines") § 15003, subd. (f), citing Friends of
12 Mammoth v. Board of Supervisors (1972) 8 Cal.3d 247. "[T]he overriding purpose of CEQA is
13 to ensure that agencies regulating activities that may affect the quality of the environment give

14 primary consideration to preventing environmental damage. CEQA is the Legislature's

O 15 declaration of policy that all necessary action be taken 'to protect, rehabilitate and enhance the
00!0 MD7 16 environmental quality of the state." Save our Peninsula v. Monterey County Board of

17 Supervisors (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 99, 117, citing Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. v. Regents
of University of California, (1988) 47 Cal.3d 373, 392 ("Laurel Heights"); and Pub. Res. Code § 18 21000.
19 28. The California Supreme Court "has repeatedly observed that the Legislature
20 intended CEQA to be interpreted to afford the fullest possible protection to the environment
21 within the reasonable scope of the statutory language." Sierra Club V. County of Sonoma, (1992)
22 6 Cal.App.4th 1307, 1315.

23 29. The lead agency must identify all potentially significant impacts of the Project

24 and must therefore consider all the evidence in the administrative record, not just its initial study.

25 Pub. Res. Code §§ 21080, subds. (c) & (d), 21082.2. CEQA Guidelines direct lead agencies to

26 conduct an Initial Study to "determine if the Project may have a significant on the environment."
14 CCR § 15063, subd. (a). "All phases of the Project planning, implementation, and operation 27 must be considered in the Initial Study." 14 CCR § 15063, subd. (a)(1). Besides the direct
28 impacts, the lead agency must also consider reasonably foreseeable indirect physical changes in

PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF - 6-

the environment in the area in which significant effects would occur; directly or indirectly. See,

2 14 CCR §§ 15064, subd. (d) & 15360; see, also, Laurel Heights, supra, 47 Cal.3d at 392.
30. Where the CEQA process is procedurally or substantively defective, reviewing

4 courts may find prejudicial abuse of discretion even if proper adherence to CEQA mandates

5 would not have resulted in a different outcome. a Pub. Res. Code § 21005, subd. (a). For

6 example, the court in Citizens to Preserve the Ojai v. County of Ventura (1985) 176 Cal.App.3d

7 421, 428 held that the certification of an EIR that had not adequately discussed the
environmental impacts of the Project constituted a prejudicial abuse of discretion even if strict
8 compliance with the mandates of CEQA would not have altered the outcome. Resource Defense
Fund v. LAFCO (1987) 191 Cal.App.3d 886, 897-8, went so far as to declare that failure to
10 comply with CEQA procedural requirements was per se prejudicial. Kings County Farm Bureau
f Babak Naficy 11 V. City of Hanford (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 692 explained that an agency commits prejudicial

12 error if "the failure to include relevant information precludes informed decision making and

13 informed public participation, thereby thwarting the statutory goals of the EIR process." Id., at

14 712.

6 31.
15 The environmental review process under CEQA is intended assure the public that
93!J0 MDT 16 "the agency has, in fact, analyzed and considered the ecological implications of its actions."
Laurel Heights, supra (1988) 47 Cal.3rd 376, 392. The function of the environmental review is
17 not merely to result in informed decision making on the part of the agencies, it is also to inform
18 the public so they can respond to an action with which they disagree. Ibid.
19 32. In limited circumstances, an agency's project approval may be exempt from
20 CEQA if it falls within one or more of 33 classes of exemptions enumerated under the CEQA

21 Guidelines. 14 CCR §§ 15061, subd. (b)(2), 15300-15333. These "categorical exemptions" are

22 intended to apply to agency project approvals that clearly fall within a predefined, specific type

23 of activity that has been carefully analyzed and categorically found to not have an individual or

24 cumulative significant effect on the environment. Pub. Res. Code § 21084, subd. (a); 14 CCR §

25 15061, subd. (b)(3) ("Where it can be seen with certainty that there is no possibility that the
activity in question may have a significant effect on the environment, the activity is not subject
26 to CEQA") (Emphasis added). In general, categorical exemptions are applicable to routine
27 agency approval actions, such as those affecting an individual residence or business with no
28 consequence on the surrounding community and environment. See, Friends of Mammoth y.

PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF -7-

Board of Supervisors, (1972) 8 Cal.3d 247 ("common sense tells us that the majority of private
2 projects for which a government permit or similar entitlement is necessary are minor in scope-
e.g., relating only to the construction, improvement, or operation of an individual dwelling or

4 small business-and hence, in the absence of unusual circumstances, have little or no effect on
the public environment."). If there is any "reasonable possibility" thàt a project or activity may

6 have a significant effect on the environment, an exemption is improper. 14 CCR § 15300.2, subd.
(c); Wildlife Alive v. Chickering, (1976) 18 Cal.3d 190, 205-06.
7 33. CEQA does not require public agencies to follow any particular procedure in
8 approving exempt projects, or to provide notice to the public or other agencies regarding its
determination that the activity is exempt. Nor is the agency required to provide an opportunity to
10 review and comment on the project, or to conduct a public hearing before on its determination
Babak Naficy 11 that the project is exempt from review. San Lorenzo Valley Comm. Advocates for Responsible

12 Ed. v. San Lorenzo Valley Unified School District (2006) 139 Cal.App.4th 1356, 1358. The

13 agency is not required to make any findings in support of an exemption determination. CalBeach

14 Advocates v. City of Solana Beach (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 529.

6 34.
15 When an agency determines that a project is exempt, it may, but is not required to,
30!0 MD] 16 a file a notice of exemption ("NOE"). Pub. Res. Code §§ 21108, 21152; 14 CCR § 15062. § Filing
an NOE triggers a 35-day statute of limitations on challenges to the agency's exemption
17 determination. An NOE must be filed, if at all, after the agency approves the project. 14 CCR §
18 15061.

19 35. Pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21108, subdivision (b) and CEQA

20 Guideline section 15062, subdivision (a), an NOE must contain the following elements:
21 (1) A brief description of the project,
22 (2) The location of the project (either by street address and cross street for
23 a project in an urbanized area or by attaching a specific map, preferably a copy of a U.S.G.S. 15'or 7-1/2'topographical map identified by quadrangle
24 name).

25 (3) A finding that the project is exempt from CEQA, including a citation to the State Guidelines section or statute under which it is found to be exempt,
26 and

27 (4) A brief statement of reasons to support the finding.

28 36. Where, as here, the agency relies on a categorical exemption, the exemption must
be narrowly construed. Dehne v. County of Santa Clara (1981) 115 Cal.App.3d 827, 842.

PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF - 8-

37. Categorical exemptions are not absolute. A project that might otherwise be

2 categorically exempt must be denied if one of the following three exemptions apply:

3 There is a reasonable possibility of a significant effect on the environment
4 due to unusual circumstances (14 CCR § 15300.2, subd. (c));

5 Significant cumulative impacts from projects of the same type will result (14 CCR § 15300.2, subd. (b));
6 In some cases, the project will have impacts on a uniquely sensitive
7 environment.

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION 8

9 (Violation of CEQA: Project Not Subject to Categorical Exemption)

10 38. Petitioners refer to and incorporate herein by this reference all preceding

MoqD9: Naficy 11 paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.

12 39. CEQA requires the lead agency to evaluate the environmental impacts of

13 discretionary projects prior to approval. The County elected to not to conduct any environmental
review of the revisions to the Santa Clara River floodway maps because it concluded its approval 14

6 of these revisions was categorically exempt from CEQA as a Class 8 exemption, "Actions by
15
eD!0 M07 Regulatory Agencies for Protection of the Environment." The text of CEQA Guideline section
16 15308 explains that this exemption "consists of actions taken by regulatory agencies, as
17 authorized by state or local ordinance, to assure the maintenance, restoration, enhancement, or
18 protection of the environment where the regulatory process involves procedures for protection of

19 the environment. Construction activities and relaxation of standards allowing environmental
20 degradation are not included in this exemption."

21 40. The Class 8 categorical exemption does not cover the map revisions at issue here

22 because strictly speaking, the revisions do not in themselves serve to maintain or protect the
environment. If anything, the flood maps are tools that the County may use to protect
23 infrastructure and private development from flood hazard. However, the map revisions are not in
24 themselves intended to maintain or protect resources because the maps are also used in
25 connection with actions that may have a negative effect on the environment. Accordingly, the
26 County's reliance on a Class 8 exemption was an abuse of discretion.

27 41. The County also found that the flood map revisions are subject to the so-called

28 "common sense" exemption pursuant to CEQA Guideline section 15061, subdivision (b)(3),
which applies "[w]here it can be seen with certainty that there is no possibility that the activity in

PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF 9-

2 question may have a significant effect on the environment, the activity is not subject to CEQA."

3 The agency's determination that a project is subject to the "common sense" exemption "must be
supported by evidence in the record demonstrating that the agency considered possible
environmental impacts in reaching its decision." Davidon Homes v. City of San Jose (1997) 54

6 Cal.App.4th 106, 117, as modified on denial of reh'g (Apr. 29, 1997). "Moreover, the showing
required of a party challenging an exemption under subdivision (b)(3) is slight, since that

7 exemption requires the agency to be certain that there is no possibility the project may cause
significant environmental impacts. If legitimate questions can be raised about whether the project

9 might have a significant impact and there is any dispute about the possibility of such an impact,

10 the agency cannot find with certainty that a project is exempt." Id.
42.

MOqDE JO 02!J0 MD7 6 Naficy 11 The County abused its discretion by relying on the common sense exemption

12 because there is evidence in the record to show there is more than a mere possibility that the map

13 revisions could result in significant impact on the environment. The County's implied finding

14 that the Project could not possibly result in a significant environmental impact is not supported
by any substantial or credible evidence.

15 43. The project here is not subject to the common sense exemption because, as

16 SCOPE explained in its public comments, the map revisions may result in adverse impacts to the

17 environment to the extent that they delineate areas subject to flood hazard based the County's

18 policy choices to enable certain development to occur on the banks of the Santa Clara River,

19 including a sheriff station that would not be built unless the County were able to show that the

20 proposed location for the sheriff station is outside of the flood zone.
44.

21 Moreover, as SCOPE explained, the Project area contains sensitive habitat for a

22 number of protected species including the Arroyo toad and Santa Ana Sucker etc. The Project is
not exempt because it has the potential to cause an impact on these species.

23 45. Location of floodways is a potential barrier to development to the extent that any

24 structure built within areas believed to be subject to flooding must be armored and protected

25 against flood damage. The evidence in the record shows that the final floodway boundaries

26 depicted in the revised maps are the product of County's policy decisions that reflect the

27 County's preference to limit the boundaries of flood zones in order to enable more development

28 on the banks of the Santa Clara River. These policy decisions, which affected the floodway

PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF - 10-

1 boundaries, are more than capable of causing significant environmental impacts by removing a

2 significant barrier to development on the banks of the Santa Clara River.

3 46. Therefore, because the County abused its discretion when it impermissibly relied

4 on a categorical exemption to approve the Project, despite substantial evidence that the Project

5 has the potential to cause a variety of significant adverse environmental impacts, the County's
approvals and NOE must be set aside.

babaknaficy@sbcglobal.net Re: Notice of Intent to Bring Suit Against County of Los Angeles
and Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors

Dear Supervisors, Ms. Davenport, and Ms. Zavala:

This office represents Friends of the Santa Clara River (Friends) and Santa
Clarita Organization for Planning the Environment (SCOPE) on whose
behalf I provide you with this notice of intent to commence litigation against
the County of Los Angeles (County) and the Los Angeles County Board of
Supervisors (Board) unless the County immediately withdraws its action
revising Santa Clara Floodway Maps ML Maps 43-ML26.1, 43-ML27.1 and
43-ML28 in the unincorporated Community of Castaic, in Los Angeles
County (the Project).

Friends and SCOPE (collectively Petitioners) are non-profit organizations
whose members are concerned with the environmental impact of the Project
on the Santa Clara River. Petitioners intend to commence litigation
pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure sections 1094.5 and/or 1085
and the California Environmental Quality Act to overturn the County's
adoption of the revised maps.

LEGAL ARGUMENTS

Petitioners contend that the County violated CEQA by relying on a
categorical exemption to approve the Project without conducting
adequate environmental review.

In particular, the Class 8 exemption is inapplicable because the maps do
not in themselves maintain or protect resources and are used in
connection with actions that may reasonably have an adverse impact on
the environment.

Likewise, the "common sense" exemption is inapplicable because there is
evidence in the record that there is more than a mere possibility that
the Project may result in significant environmental impacts. Therefore,
the County's implied finding that the Project could not possibly result in a significant environmental impact is not supported by substantial or
credible evidence.

Feel free to contact the undersigned should you have any questions or
concerns.

Sincerely,

Is/ Babak naficy

Babak Naficy
Attorney for Petitioners
