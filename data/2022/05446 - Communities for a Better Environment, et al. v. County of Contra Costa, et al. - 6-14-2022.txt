Case No.

1 Petitioners Communities for a Better Environment and Center for Biological Diversity
2 (collectively, Petitioners) bring this action on their own behalf, on behalf of their members, on behalf of
3 the general public, and in the public interest and allege as follows:

4 I. Introduction

5 1. Despite its small size of 13.63 square miles, the City of Martinez (the City or Martinez) is

6 home to communities that are some of the most overburdened by pollution in the state. These
7 communities-recognized by CalEPA as "disadvantaged" because of their high exposure to air, water,
8 and soil contamination-suffer from high asthma and low birth weights, as well as high amounts of
9 other respiratory and other ailments linked to pollution. Now, residents are facing further exposure to
10 industrial pollution proposed under the guise of an environmentally beneficial project.

11 2. Martinez residents were able to breathe a sigh of relief when the Marathon Refinery,
12 which operated in the City for over 100 years, finally idled its operations in 2020. The Refinery had
13 processed millions of barrels per year of crude oil and amassed dozens of permit violations for incidents
14 that compromised air quality and exposed residents to pollutants known to cause long-term health
15 problems.

16 3. That relief is threatened by the Marathon Refinery's proposal to repurpose its shuttered
17 facility into a refinery that would receive, process, and ship out plant- and animal-based fuels (known as
18 biofuels), 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

19 4. Despite proponents' claims that biofuels are environmentally friendly, they are anything
20 but. Biofuels require converting crops and animal products into fuels, which can contribute to climate
21  change by causing land clearing and deforestation, thereby eliminating natural carbon stores and
22 shrinking species habitat.

23 5. Biofuel refineries increase demand for crops and drive up food prices, putting prices out
24 of reach for the country and world's most vulnerable people.
25 6. For those living near biofuel refineries, significant impacts can include air, water, and soil
26 pollution, nuisance odors, processing upsets and safety hazards, and harmful fuel spills. And because
27 most biofuels are expected to come from the Midwest, communities along the supply route to places like
28 Martinez are likely to experience pollution exposure from transportation modes like diesel trucks and

3

Case No.

railcars.

2 7. Marathon's proposed Martinez Refinery Renewable Fuels Project (the Martinez Project,
3 or the Project) would process 735 million gallons per year, measured as 17.5 million barrels per year (at
4 48,000 barrels per day, or bpd), of bio-based feedstocks into diesel fuel, propane, naphtha, and other
5 byproducts. Biofuels produced by the Martinez Project would then be distributed by truck throughout
6 Central and Northern California and via ships to destinations outside the Bay Area.

7 8. On February 17, 2021, the Contra Costa County Department of Conservation and
8 Development (DCD) announced that, under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), the
9 County would prepare an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) to assess the Martinez Project. An EIR
10 aims to ensure that decisionmakers and the public have complete information about a proposed project's

11 foresecable environmental impacts and ways to mitigate or avoid the significant effects before its
12 approval.

13 9. On May 3, 2022, the Board of Supervisors of County of Contra Costa voted unanimously
14 to approve and certify the problematic and unlawful Martinez Project EIR over the objections of
15 Petitioners as well as residents and other groups.

16 10. The County treated CEQA as a mere exercise in paperwork by approving the Project
17 without the disclosure, analysis, and mitigation required under CEQA. The EIR disregards,
18 underestimates, and ignores key project components, inputs, and impacts, thereby obscuring the
19 environmental and health harms and preventing the development of effective mitigation measures.

20 11. Specifically, the EIR uses a highly misleading baseline. Even though the Marathon
21 Refinery has been shuttered since April 2020 and its owners indicated their intent not to resume
22 operations processing fossil fuels, the County inappropriately selected a baseline time period when the
23 Refinery was actively processing crude oil. This irrational choice masks the environmental harms of the
24 proposed Project.

25 12. The EIR also fails to disclose critical information about the Project, such as the types of
26 feedstocks that may be used and in what amounts. Without disclosing where the feedstocks come from,
27 what they are, and how much will be processed, the so-called "analysis" of environmental harms related
28 to air emissions, climate change, species, and is safety hazards is speculative guesswork.
4
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
Case No.

1 13. The EIR uses an artificially narrow and misleading geographic range for its cumulative
2 impacts analysis. This range shields from public view the combined impacts of this Project and the
3 Phillips 66 biofuels refinery conversion in Rodeo, CA which is located only ten miles away and
4 proceeding along the same timeline as the Martinez Project. It also obscures the upstream impacts from
5 biofuel crop production.

6 14. The EIR fails to adopt adequate and enforceable mitigation measures for odors and
7 dismisses feasible alternatives that would reduce environmental impacts, including an alternative that
8 reduces throughput.

9 15. The EIR acknowledges that a marine or other waterway spill of biofuels would be
10 significant and unavoidable, but the spill response protocols (in place to address spill of petroleum
11 products) are not sufficient to account for the potential harms from a spill of biofuels. The EIR failed to
12 support the assumption that petroleum and non-petroleum feedstocks react similarly in marine
13 environments.

14 16. The County either dismissed or ignored comments from the community and groups
15 highlighting theseand many other-concerns. As a result of these deficiencies, the EIR fails to fully
16 inform the public and decisionmakers of the Project's significant health, safety, and environmental
17 impacts, and fails to analyze and mitigate these impacts as CEQA requires. Because the County violated
18 CEQA's requirements, the residents of Martinez would be subjected to yet another giant industrial
19 facility without due consideration for and minimization of the environmental and public health harms
20 associated with it. Petitioners seek a writ of mandate from this Court to require the County to rectify the
21 multiple and serious deficiencies in the EIR and provide the public with full and honest assessment of
22 this Project's adverse impacts.

23 II. Parties

24 17. Petitioner COMMUNITIES FOR A BETTER ENVIRONMENT (CBE) is a membership-
25 based California non-profit environmental health and justice organization. CBE's mission is to build
26 people's power in California's communities of color and low-income communities to achieve
27 environmental health and justice by preventing and reducing toxics and air and water pollution, and
28 building healthy and sustainable communities.
5
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
Case No.

1 18. Petitioner CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY (the Center) is a non-profit
2 organization with offices in California and throughout the United States. The Center is actively involved
3 in environmental protection issues throughout California and North America and has over 89,000

4 members, including over 800 throughout Contra Costa County. The Center's mission includes reducing
5 greenhouse gas pollution to preserve a safe climate and protecting air quality and public health.

6 19. By this action, Petitioners seek to protect the health and welfare interests of its members
7 and the general public, and to enforce public duty owed to them by the County of Contra Costa (the
8 County). Petitioners' members have an interest in their health and well-being, as well as an interest in
9: the conservation, environmental, aesthetic, and economic interests of the County. Petitioners' members
10 who live, work, and recreate near the Marathon Refinery and in Contra Costa County have a right to,

11 and a beneficial interest in, the County's compliance with CEQA. These interests have been, and
12 continue to be, threatened by the County's decision to certify the EIR in violation of CEQA, and unless
13 the relief requested in this case is granted, will continue to be adversely affected and irreparably injured
14 by the failure of the County to comply with the law.

15 20. Respondent COUNTY OF CONTRA COSTA, a political subdivision of the State of
16 California, is the lead agency charged with principal responsibility for ensuring the Project's compliance
17 with CEQA under Public Resources Code section 21067.

18 21. Respondent BOARD OF SUPERVISORS OF COUNTY OF CONTRA COSTA (the
19 Board of Supervisors) is the elected legislative body for the County. The Board of Supervisors certified
20 the final EIR and approved the Project on May 3, 2022.

21 22. Respondent CONTRA COSTA COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION AND
22 DEVELOPMENT (DCD) is the County department responsible for processing the Project application
23 and preparing the EIR for the Project.

24 23. Real Party in Interest MARATHON PETROLEUM CORPORATION, the Project
25 applicant, is an Ohio corporation and parent company of Real Party in Interest Tesoro Refining &
26 Marketing Company LLC.

27 24. Real Party in Interest TESORO REFINING & MARKETING COMPANY LLC, an
28 indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Marathon Petroleum Corporation based in San Antonio, Texas, is
6

Case No.

the registered owner and operator of the Marathon Refinery, which is located at 150 Solano Way in

2 Martinez, California, 94553.

3 25. Petitioners do not know the true names and capacities, whether individual, corporate,

4 associate, or otherwise, of respondents and real parties in interest Doe 1 through Doe 40, inclusive, and
5 therefore sue said respondents and real parties in interest under fictitious names. Petitioners will amend

6 this Petition to show their true names and capacities when the same have been ascertained. Each of the
7 respondents is the agent and/or employee of Respondent County, and each performed acts on which this
8 action is based within the course and scope of such Respondent's agency and/or employment. Each of
9 the real parties in interest is the agent and/or employee of each other real party in interest; and each
10 performed acts on which this action is based within the course and scope of such real party in interest's
11 agency and/or employment.

12 III. Jurisdiction And Venue

13 26. This Court has jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandate to a set aside the County's decision

14 under Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5, or, in the alternative, section 1085. Judicial review is
15 governed under Public Resources Code section 21168.5, or, in the alternative, section 21168.

16 27. Venue is proper in this Court under Code of Civil Procedure section 395 because the
17 County, its Board of Supervisors, the DCD, and the proposed Project are currently located, or will be
18 located, in Contra Costa County. Venue is also proper in this Court under Code of Civil Procedure
19 sections 393 and 394.

20 28. This action was timely filed within 30 days of the Contra Costa County Clerk posting on
21 its website the Notice of Determination to approve the Project and certify the EIR, in accordance with
22 Public Resources Code section 21167, subdivision (c) and California Code of Regulations, title 14,
23 section 15112, subdivision (c)(1).

24 29. Petitioners have provided written notice of their intent to file this petition to the County
25 and Board of Supervisors and provide the notice and proof of service as Exhibit A as required by Public
26 Resources Code section 21167.5.

27 CEQA Guidelines are codified in title 14, section 15000 et seq. of the California Code of Regulations; 28 all references to "CEQA Guidelines" refer to these sections in title 14.
7
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
Case No.

30. Petitioners have served the Attorney General with a copy of the Petition and Complaint
2 along with a notice of filing, in compliance with Public Resources Code section 21167.7 and Code of

3 Civil Procedure section 388, and provide the notice and proof of service as Exhibit B.

4 31. Petitioners have performed any and all conditions precedent to filing this instant action
5 and have exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent required by law.

6 32. Petitioners do not have a plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law because Petitioners
7 and their members will be irreparably harmed by the ensuing environmental damage caused by
g implementation of the Martinez Project and the County's violations of CEQA.

9 IV. CEQA Legal Background

10 33. The California Environmental Quality Act is a comprehensive statute designed to provide
11 for long-term protection of the environment. Cal. Pub. Res. Code §§ 21000-21189. CEQA review
12 informs decisionmakers and the public about the potential significant environmental effects of a project.
13 CEQA Guidelines, § 15002(a)(1). Such disclosure ensures that "long term protection of the environment

14 shall be the guiding criterion in public decisions." Cal. Pub. Res. Code 21001(d). The EIR is the
15 "heart" of this requirement. See No Oil, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles, 13 Cal. 3d 68, 84 (1974). The EIR
16 has been described as "an environmental 'alarm bell' whose purpose it is to alert the public and its
17 responsible officials to environmental changes before they have reached ecological points of no return."
18 County of Inyo v. Yorty, 32 Cal. App. 3d 795, 810 (1973).
19 34. An EIR must identify and describe "[d]irect and indirect significant effects of the project

20 on the environment." CEQA Guidelines, § 15126.2(a). An EIR must also identify and analyze
21 cumulative effects when the "incremental effects of an individual project are significant when viewed in
22 connection with the effects of past projects, the effects of other current projects, and the effects of
23 probable future projects." CEQA Guidelines, § 15065(a)(3); id. § 15130(a).

24 35. CEQA requires public agencies to avoid or reduce environmental damage whenever
25 feasible by considering changes in projects through project alternatives or enforceable mitigation
26 measures. See CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15002(a)(2)-(3), 15126.4(a)(1)-(2); see also Citizens of Goleta
27 Valley v. Bd. of Supervisors, 52 Cal. 3d 553, 564 (1990). To measure the environmental damages of a
28 project and provide adequate mitigation, CEQA and its implementing guidelines require that an EIR
8
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
Case No.

"include a description of the physical environmental conditions in the vicinity of the project" that
2 generally reflect conditions "as they exist at the time the notice of preparation is published." CEQA
3 Guidelines, § 15125(a). (a)(1). This baseline is a key component in identifying and quantifying a

4 project's environmental effects and the starting point from which a lead agency measures whether an
5 impact may be environmentally significant. Id. Without an adequate baseline description, "analysis of

6 impacts, mitigation measures and project alternatives becomes impossible." Save our Peninsula Comm.

7 V. Monterey Cnty. Bd. of Supervisors, 87 Cal. App. 4th 99, 124 (2001) [quoting County of Amador v. El
8| Dorado Cnty. Water Agency, 76 Cal. App. 4th 931, 953 (1999)].

9 36. When the lead agency approves project which will result in significant and unavoidable
10 effects, the agency must provide reasons, supported by substantial evidence, to support its approval.
11 CEQA Guidelines, § 15093(b).

12 37. After releasing a draft EIR for public comment, the lead agency must evaluate comments
13 received and offer good faith, reasoned analysis in response. CEQA Guidelines, § 15088(a), (c). Major
14 environmental issues raised when the lead agency's position differs with recommendations and
15 objections raised in the comments must be addressed in detail. Id. § 15088(c).

16 V. Statement of Facts

17 A. Community and Environmental Setting

18 38. Contra Costa County has just over 1.1 million residents, making it the tenth most
19 populous county in the state. The city of Martinez is 12.13 square miles and home to around 40,000
20 residents.2

21 39. Contra Costa County is within the San Francisco Bay Area Air Basin, which is not is in
22 compliance with state air pollution standards for 24-hour PM10, annual PM10, and annual PM2 5.
23 Particulate matter, or PM, pollution is linked to serious health problems such as premature death in

people with heart or lung disease, aggravated asthma, and other respiratory ailments.3

40. CalEnviroScreen is a mapping tool developed by California's Office of Environmental
Health Hazard Assessment that assesses communities at the census tract level to identify those most
4 burdened by particular kinds of pollution from multiple sources and those most vulnerable to its effects,

5 based on socioeconomic factors and underlying health status.* Based on these factors, census tracts are

6 assigned a percentile score from 1 to 100.5 The higher the census tract's percentile score, the greater the
7 pollution burdens and population vulnerabilities of residents in that tract as compared to other residents

8 In the state.6

9 41. According to CalEnviroScreen, residents in the census tracts nearest the Marathon

10 Refinery experience a pollution burden worse than 82-91 percent of census tracts in the state.7
11 Communities in these nearby census tracts experience an increased risk of asthma and cardiovascular
12 disease, and newborns in these areas have an increased risk of having low birthweight.3 For these
13 reasons, in 2022, CalEPA designated Martinez and the communities to the east of the refinery as
14 disadvantaged under Senate Bill 535.'

1 significantly increase production capacity over the next few years.10

2 43. In California alone, there are several proposed projects to convert petroleum refineries to
3 process biofuel feedstocks. Only ten miles away from the Martinez Project, similar project approved
4 by the County at the Phillips 66 Refinery in Rodeo would produce over 24.4 million barrels per year (at
5 67,000 bpd) of biofuels, which would make it the largest biofuel refinery in the world.11 In the Central

6 Valley, Bakersfield Renewable Fuels is converting the closed Alon Bakersfield Refinery into 15,000

7 bpd biorefinery.12 In Southern California, the Chevron Refinery in El Segundo plans to co-process up to

8 10,000 bpd of non-crude oil feedstock, and the AltAir Refinery in the City of Paramount is proposing to
9 process 25,000 bpd of animal fat and vegetable oil feedstock.13

10 44. Biofuels are fuels generated from plant oil or animal fat feedstock, which are part of the
11 food system. There are several categories of biofuel end products, including biodiesel and renewable
12 diesel.14 Biodiesel refers to petroleum diesel blended with animal fats, vegetable oils, and/or cooking
13 greases.15 Renewable diesel refers to biofuels that are not blended with petroleum.16

14 45. Refining biofuel feedstocks can be more carbon intense than crude oil refining. This is
15 largely because many feedstocks have more oxygen than crude oil, which then requires more hydrogen

production to remove the oxygen. Fecdstock choice can drive up the magnitude of carbon emissions. For
2 example, processing soybean oil into fuel emits more carbon than processing animal fat.

3 46. Biofuels require massive amounts of crops, which in turn require significant land
4 dedicated to agriculture, fertilizer, pesticides, and other energy intensive resources. There is broad

5 census in scientific literature that increased demand for food crop biofuel feedstocks drives climate
6 I environmental harms and climate change.17

7 47. Biofuel refineries draw from the same feedstock pool; therefore, each refinery competes

8 in the same markets for limited quantities of feedstock.18 According to some estimates, by 2024, there

15 C. Marathon Refinery Background

17 which 1,300 acres are developed for oil and gas operations and the remaining acreage is undeveloped is
18 marshlands and grasslands.22 The property's southern boundary adjoins the city of Concord, and the

1 western boundary is 0.25 miles from the municipal limits of the city of Martinez. East of the property

2 are marshlands, including the 761-acre Point Edith Wildlife Preserve, an area accessible to the public for

3 wildlife viewing and hunting.

4 50. Refining activities first began at the Martinez site in 1913. Between 2015 and 2020, the
5 Refinery processed an average of 121,000 bpd of crude oil and was the second-largest refinery in

6 Northern California.

7 51. In April 2020, the Marathon Refinery suspended operations and has been idle ever since.
8 Available evidence strongly indicates that the Marathon Petroleum Corporation closed the refinery to
9 consolidate its refining assets in Southern California and Washington State.23
10 D. The Proposed Refinery Conversion Project and Its Environmental Impacts

11 52. On November 1, 2020, Marathon, and/or its subsidiary Tesoro, applied for a land use
12 permit to convert the Marathon Refinery into a facility that processes food system feedstocks into
13 biofuels.24

14 53. The proposed Project would overhaul the Refinery SO it can refine biofuel feedstocks
15 rather than crude oil. Some existing equipment would be altered or replaced, and additional new
16 equipment, such as tanks, would be added. Upon completion, the Project would produce 48,000 bpd of
17 biofuel-based end products.

18 54. The Project would continue to use pipelines to distribute petroleum products and rely on
19 trucks, rail, and marine vessels to transport biofuel feedstocks and end products. As a result, the EIR
20 estimates that rail trips will increase over the crude oil operations to approximately 22,191 railcars per
21 year, or 63 per day, the majority of which are expected to come from the Midwest. The EIR estimates
22 that the Project would utilize over 65,700 truck trips per year, or 180 trucks per day, to transport finished
23 fuels to their distribution locations.

24 55. The majority of biofuel feedstocks are expected to arrive to the Project by marine vessels,

2 resulting in a higher number of vessels using the Project's marine terminals than during crude oil
refining. Marine traffic to the Avon Marine Oil Terminal (MOT) will increase nearly twofold to
3 approximately 364 annual visits, and the facility's Amorco MOT will receive 40 vessel calls per year.

4 Marine vessels would also be used to distribute finished products beyond the Bay Area. To
accommodate the increased and different types of marine vessels, the Project would require
6 modifications of the Amorco and Avon MOTs.

7 56. Equipment that cannot be repurposed from the facility's crude oil operations will be
8 decommissioned (demolished) and disposed of. Examples of equipment that will be demolished include
9 a gas plant, boilers, and a chemical recovery plant.

10 57. In addition to equipment changes at the Project site, the Marathon Refinery conversion
11 would require equipment modifications at off-site locations in the Bay Area and San Joaquin Valley
12 used for feedstock storage. These changes include natural gas-fired heaters to maintain the temperature
13 of feedstocks, piping components, storage tanks, and unloading/loading racks.

14 58. The Project would require a massive amount of food system crops as feedstock to refine
15 into biofuels. The Project has not disclosed the volumes or sources of feedstock it expects to refine.
16 Marathon acknowledges it could process corn oil, soybean oil, and tallow, a greasy, lard substance
17 derived from animal rendering. Other biological fuel sources such as plant and animal by-products may
18 also be used.

19 59. The Project does not disclose the expected geographic origins of its feedstocks, but
20 existing biofuel refineries primarily obtain their feedstock from agricultural lands in the Midwest.

21 60. The Project will generate GHGs from construction, biofuel processing, transportation of
22 feedstocks and finished products, and employee vehicle trips. Combined with other development in the
23 region, GHG emissions from the Martinez Project would be cumulatively considerable. Further, the
24 amount of biofuels the Project (particularly when combined with other biofuel projects planned in
25 California) would lead to an oversupply of renewable diesel that could cause a net increase in GHG
26 emissions because of the resulting need to export excess fuels, a result known as "emission shifting."

27 61. Though not analyzed in the EIR, food system feedstocks demanded by the Project would
28 lead to land use conversion (meaning, grasslands and wetlands are destroyed to grow fuel crops),

Case No.

1 deforestation, or both. These landscape changes not only result in direct GHG emissions, but the
2 reduction in natural carbon "sinks" like wetlands translates into less natural capacity to store
3 atmospheric GHG. Converting land to grow more biofuel crops and destroying forests also leads to
4 human health harms, habitat loss for plant and animal species, and often irreparable injury to Indigenous

5 populations.

6 62. Project operations would result in significant and unavoidable impacts on cumulative
7 PM2.5 pollution. In addition to the continuing operational impacts, construction of new equipment and
8 changes to existing equipment at both the Marathon Refinery site and MOTs required by the Project
9 would generate emissions of PM2.5 and other criteria pollutants.

10 63. In addition to air quality harms, the Martinez Project will have significant and
11 unavoidable impacts on water quality as a result of feedstock or refined products spills. In particular,
12 the DEIR acknowledges that even with implementation of best practices and spill prevention plans, a

13 large spill could still occur, resulting in devastating impacts to water quality and biological resources in
14 San Francisco Bay and beyond.

15 64. The Proposed Project will also have potentially significant objectionable odors from
16 project operations. Different types of feedstocks, such as rendered animal fats, could lead to different
17 odor problems.

18 65. Increases in marine vessel traffic because of the Project will, in turn, increase the risk of
19 introduction of non-native invasive species, vessel strikes of marine mammals, and biofuel spills, which
20 can harm or kill aquatic plants and animals.

21 66. Project construction and operations could impact valuable remaining habitat for local
22 endangered and other imperiled species, including the salt marsh harvest mouse, delta smelt, and
23 California ridgeway rail.

24 E. Environmental Review and the Proposed Martinez Project Approval Process
25 67. The County of Contra Costa, as the public agency with principal responsibility for
26 approving the Project, is the lead agency for the Project under CEQA.

3 comment period on the draft EIR ran through December 17, 2021.27

4 70. Petitioners submitted comments highlighting numerous flaws in the draft EIR, including

5 its project description, selected baseline, consideration of alternatives, cumulative impacts analysis, and
6 adequacy of mitigation measures, among other deficiencies. In total, the County received 251 comment
7 letters in response to the DEIR.28

8 71. In March 2022, just three months after public comment period closed, the DCD released
9 the final EIR. The DCD at this time was also reviewing comments on another EIR for a biofuel refinery
10 conversion, the Phillips 66 Rodeo Renewed Project, which generated 86 comment letters and over 1,600

1 Commission to develop a revised draft EIR for public comment.

2 75. On May 3, 2022, the County Board of Supervisors held a public hearing to consider the
3 environmental review and approvals for the Project.31 During the public hearing, community members

4 and concerned Bay Area residents spoke in opposition to the Martinez Project, raising concerns about

5 the increased pollution, climate impacts, lack of specific information on biofuel feedstocks, likelihood of

6 nuisance odors. and more.

7 76. Despite the concerns raised about the sufficiency of the EIR as an informational
8 document and significant impacts that would be caused by the Project, the Board of Supervisors voted
9 unanimously to certify the EIR and approve the Project.

10 77. On May 9, 2022, the Contra Costa County Clerk posted the Notice of Determination
11 providing notice of the County's final decision triggering the 30-day statutory deadline under CEQA to
12 challenge the certification of the final EIR. CEQA Guidelines, § 15112(c)(1).

13 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

14 (Violations of CEQA - Public Resources Section 21000, et seq.)

15 78. Petitioners incorporate herein by reference the allegations contained in the foregoing
16 paragraphs.

17 79. The County violated CEQA by certifying a legally deficient EIR and by approving the
18 Project without adequate environmental review. The County's CEQA violations include the following:

19 a. The County failed to require that the EIR base its environmental review and analyses on
20 an accurate, stable, complete, and finite description of the Project that fully discloses and
21 fairly evaluates the Project's nature and objectives. The description of the Project failed
22 to provide decisionmakers and the public with enough information to understand its

23 environmental impacts, appropriate mitigation, and potential alternatives. For instance,

24 the project description is inaccurate and incomplete in the following ways:

25 i. The EIR fails to analyze impacts from the biofuel refining technology that the

Case No.

I Project would use, even though this technology---known as the Hydrotreating

2 Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA)has specific types of impacts, capabilities, and

3 limitations that distinguish it from other biofuel technologies. It is only in the

4 Responses to Comments that the final EIR even identifies the proposed HEFA

5 technology by name, and this response still does not describe essential aspects of

6 the technology deployment as the basis for the Project.

7 ii. The EIR's description of the Project's biofuel feedstocks a core Project

8 component-is both speculative and incomplete. The EIR merely lists potential
types of feedstocks that the Project may process, then opens the door for the

10 Project to use different feedstocks in the future based on whether technology

11 changes. With respect to all of these potential feedstocks, the EIR fails to analyze

12 availability, constraints, and reasonably foreseeable estimates of feedstocks or the

13 proportions in which they may be processed by Project. The EIR fails to even

14 evaluate a "reasonable worst case scenario" for feedstock consumption and

15 impacts. Vague allusions to different feedstocks and potential changes over time

16 do nothing to inform the public or decisionmakers about the type or magnitude of

17 the Project's potential environmental impacts, as different impacts such as air

18 pollution, climate impacts, species impacts, objectionable odor impacts, and

19 more-flow from the choice of feedstock. The mere existence of uncertainty

20 around feedstock use does not justify the EIR's wholesale failure to address

21 feedstock-specific impacts or any feedstock-varying scenarios. Further, the EIR's

22 failure to specify feedstocks with certainty makes the Project description vague

23 and unstable and prevents meaningful assessment and mitigation of its likely

24 impacts.

25 iii. While the EIR describes maximum Project throughput volumes of 48,000 bpd per

26 day of feedstocks, this measure is only an estimate: nothing constrains the Project

27 from significantly exceeding these throughput volumes. As many Project

28 environmental impacts are a function of throughput volumes, the lack of a cap on
18
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
Case No.

1 or stable and reliable description of maximum throughput volumes undermines a

2 meaningful assessment of Project impacts.

3 b. The County failed to measure the impacts of the Project using an accurate or realistic

4 baseline that reflects existing physical environmental conditions at the time the County

5 published the notice of preparation on February 17, 2021.32 The EIR uses the years 2015-

6 2020 as its baseline, meaning that the baseline reflects the period when the Marathon
7 Refinery was processing crude oil. The baseline at the time of the notice of preparation,

8 however, was no crude processing (or any activity), as the Marathon Refinery ceased
operations in April 2020. Since ending operations, Marathon has not publicly indicated
10 any intent to continue crude oil refining at the site; to the contrary, the company made
11 it clear and widely-reported declaration that it no longer intends to refine crude oil at the

12 facility. The EIR lacks substantial evidence supporting its use of a baseline tied to crude

13 oil refining, or how that baseline provides a realistic measurement of existing conditions

14 against which to evaluate the Project's impacts. The EIR's baseline is misleading and
15 prevented decisionmakers and the public from understanding the Project's likely

16 environmental impacts of processing biofuels exclusively.

17 C. The County failed to adequately analyze cumulative impacts of the Project, including in

18 the following ways:

19 i. The EIR uses an overly narrow and arbitrary two-mile geographic radius around

20 the Project site and associated marine terminals to identify projects and activities
21 considered for the cumulative impacts analysis. The County provided no rationale
22 or evidentiary support for use of this geographic limitation, or for selecting a
23 cumulative impacts scope based on a geographic limitation at all.

24 ii. Instead of performing an actual cumulative impacts analysis of the nearby Phillips
25 66 Rodeo refinery conversion project-a project located less than ten miles from

the Martinez site that could create the largest biofuels refinery in the world-the

2 EIR makes only passing mention of this project. These passing references do not

3 substitute for consideration of what the cumulative impacts of two nearby, large-

4 scale biofuels refining projects could be on air quality, odors, noise, vessel traffic,

5 biofuel demand, and other metrics.

6 iii. The EIR fails to analyze the environmental and climate impacts that will result

7 from competition for limited quantities of feedstock and increases in oil crop

8 production or foreign imports that are associated with current biofuel trends.

9 d. The County failed to adequately disclose and evaluate the Martinez Project's

10 environmental impacts, and failed to respond to public comments concerning a variety of

11 significant environmental effects of the Project, including the following:

12 i. The EIR fails to describe the range of feedstocks that could be processed and their

13 differing environmental impacts. The EIR lists as potential feedstocks soybean

14 oil, distillers corn oil, and rendered animal fats, but these categories are overbroad

15 and the EIR does not provide market analyses on the availability of these
16 feedstocks and estimates of which feedstocks the facility is likely to rely on. The

17 EIR then opens the door to the Project potentially using a wider universe of

18 feedstocks by stating that as technologies evolve, other biological fuel sources

19 such as used cooking oils and plant and animal byproducts may be used. The EIR

20 does not discuss what technological changes may precipitate these new feedstocks
21 or how that could alter the original list of potential feedstocks. Nor does the EIR

22 evaluate the environmental impacts specific to potential Project feedstocks, even

23 while acknowledging that certain impacts-such as noxious odors-may vary by

24 feedstock.

25 ii. The EIR fails to disclose and analyze the Project's climate change impacts. By

26 not estimating the potential feedstock types that could be used, the EIR ignores

27 the broad consensus in scientific literature that certain feedstocks can induce land

28 use conversion and/or deforestation--both of which have significant negative
20
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
Case No.

environmental and climate change implications. Further, the EIR erroneously
N substituted reliance on upstream climate impacts found in California's Low
3 Carbon Fuel Standard program-level environmental assessment in lieu of a
t project-specific analysis. The EIR also ignores that the amount of biofuels
u demanded by the Martinez Project-particularly in concert with the other biofuels
projects planned for the State could lead to an oversupply of biofuels that will
7 trigger the need to export more fuels, thus increasing greenhouse emissions.
8 iii. The EIR did not adequately disclose or analyze impacts to species, including from
a indirect impacts caused by land conversion and deforestation.
10 iv. The EIR fails to disclose or evaluate varying air emissions impacts that could
11 result from using different types of feedstocks. Processing different types of
12 biofuels can increase and alter processing emissions in different ways, with
13 variable impacts on air pollution. Additionally, contaminants in feedstocks
14 themselves can be released during processing, adding to the air emissions burden.
15 By not estimating feedstock amounts and types, the EIR's air emissions analysis
16 is incomplete and uninformative.

17 V. The EIR fails to analyze the impacts of demolishing or decommissioning parts of

18 the crude oil refinery that will no longer be needed and resulting contamination
19 hazards. The Project site is heavily contaminated, which gives rise to issues
20 concerning both how decommissioned portions of the site will be addressed, and

21 how construction needed for converting the Refinery to biofuels may affect
22 remediation and monitoring activities.

23 vi. The EIR fails to account for potentially increased operational upsets. Processing
24 biofuels using HEFA technology can cause an increased number of process upsets
25 that can lead to worker and public hazards. These upsets can also result in

26 increased flaring, which itself is a cause of air pollution. The EIR did not disclose

27 and properly mitigate the impacts from upsets and flares, and the EIR did not

28 include a flare minimization plan.
21
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
Case No.

1 e. The County failed to consider, discuss, or adopt adequate mitigation measures to

2 minimize the Martinez Project's significant and detrimental impacts, or otherwise

3 improperly deferred mitigation necessary to minimize the Project's impacts, including

4 but not limited to the following:

5 i. The County improperly approved the Project even though the EIR unlawfully

6 deferred addressing potential objectionable odors from the Project, which may be

7 considerable and significant depending on the feedstocks used. Instead, the

8 County proposed that odor mitigation measures could be developed at a later date

9 depending on whether people complain. This is inadequate. Further, the County

10 failed to show that it would be infeasible to develop and analyze the mitigation in

11 their or to commit itself to cognizable performance standards or criteria for any

12 eventual mitigation.

13 ii. The EIR notes that feedstock or refined products spills will have significant and

14 unavoidable impacts on species, but the EIR offers no enforceable guarantee that

15 a large spill of biofuels will even be responded to, let alone cleaned up

16 effectively, and there is no analysis of what such a cleanup would entail or the

17 damage such a spill could cause.

18 f. The County failed to adequately analyze a reasonable range of alternatives and rejected

19 feasible alternatives that would substantially lessen the Martinez Project's significant

20 environmental effects.

21 i. The EIR created narrow objectives to ensure the Project would be approved as

22 proposed and to dismiss from consideration other feasible alternatives with less

23 significant environmental impacts, including a reduced throughput alternative that

24 would permanently cap throughput at the interim maximum of 23,000 bpd.

25 ii. Further, a rather than select as a "no project" alternative the option that the facility

26 remain idle, the County chose as that alternative a fictitious scenario under which
1  p 27 crude refining operations resume. This choice is not supported by the evidence
28 that the refinery made clear that crude operations had been permanently ended.

Case No.

80. The County violated CEQA by failing to adequately respond to comments on the EIR,
2 including, but not limited to, ignoring or dismissing in a cursory fashion suggestions of feasible
3 mitigation measures and alternatives.

4 81. The County violated CEQA by adopting findings and a statement of overriding
5 considerations that are not supported by substantial evidence in the record. The findings do not provide

6 the reasoning, or analytic route from facts to conclusions, as required by law.

7 82. If the County and Real Parties in Interest are not enjoined from moving forward with
8 permitting, constructing and operating the Martinez Project without adequate environmental analysis

o and mitigation, and without complying with CEQA's environmental review and evidentiary
10 requirements, Petitioners will suffer irreparable harm from which there is no plain, speedy, or adequate
11 remedy at law unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate.
12 83. By certifying the final EIR and by approving the Martinez Project, the County committed
