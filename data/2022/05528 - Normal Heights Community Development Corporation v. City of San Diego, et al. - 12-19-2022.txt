20 PROJECT DESCRIPTION
21 11. The project site is a 26,047 square foot lot located on the corner of Adams Avenue and
22 35th Street in the Normal Heights Community of the City of San Diego. The project includes the
23 demolition of an existing, vacant restaurant (DeMille's Italian Restaurant) and construction of a new
24 mixed-use multi-family project. The roject includes 175 residential units ranging in size from 493 to
25 598 square feet of gross floor area. The project also includes two commercial shell spaces totaling
26 3,361 square feet of gross floor area. The structure will be seven stories above grade with one parking
27 level below grade and a portion of Level 1 will provide parking for a total of 100 parking spaces.
28

3
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

Overall structure height is 90 feet with 112,347 square feet of residential gross floor area and 3,361

2 square feet of commercial gross floor area. Real Parties in Interest are proposing 12 affordable units.

3 BACKGROUND AND HISTORY

4 12. The project site is located in the Central Urbanized Planned District and zoned CUPD-

5 CU-3-3 and CUPD-CT-3-3. CU-3-3 is intended to accommodate development with a pedestrian

6 orientation and medium-high density residential uses. The CT zones are intended to provide a
7 transition from commercial zones to residential zones. A mixed-use multi-family development is

8 permitted through a ministerial process with a maximum density of 44 dwelling units per acre and a

9 maximum height of 50 feet. The zoning on this project site allows 27 residential units exclusive of
10 density bonuses or other affordable housing considerations. The land development code requires 1.5
11 parking spaces per residential unit and 2.5 parking spaces per 1,000 square feet of commercial area.
12 13. The City adopted Complete Communities Housing Solutions on December 9, 2020
13 ("Complete Communities"). Complete Communities is an opt-in incentive program to help the City
14 meet its Regional Housing Needs Allocation targets set by the State of California. A development is
15 eligible for Complete Communities if it is: (1) located within a Transit Priority Area ("TPA"); (2)
16 provides a minimum of 40 percent of the pre-density bonus units as affordable units; (3) replaces
17 equivalently sized existing affordable units; (4) pays $9.00 per square foot of lot area or $11.00 per

18 square foot of lot area if the building is more than 95 feet in height into the Neighborhood
19 Enhancement Fund.

20 14. If a project meets all the criteria for Complete Communities, the development is
21 eligible for incentives: (1) ministerial approval with limited exceptions; (2) development density
22 governed by a new floor area ratio(FAR) - 6.5 in this location; (3) height governed by FAR; (4)
23 affordable housing incentives and waivers; and (5) scaling of development impact fees (DIF) based on
24 the development square footage.
25 15. Real Parties in Interest filed an application for Preliminary Review in the spring of
26 2021, the application was deemed complete on July 28, 2021. The City determined the application
27 contained the materials required by Senate Bill 330 ("SB 330"). SB 330 requires the City to apply the
28

4
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

standards in effect at the time of preliminary review if a formal application is submitted within 180

2 days.

3 16. There was no major transit stop existing or planned within ยฝ mile of the project site at
4 the time the Preliminary Review application was deemed complete. Therefore, the project site was not

5 located in a TPA. A major transit stop is the intersection of two major bus routes with a frequency of

6 service interval of 15 minutes or less during the morning and afternoon peak commute periods.
7 Respondent and Real Parties in Interest relied on plans to add a rapid bus route along Adams Avenue
8 to the existing bus route along Adams Avenue as providing the intersection of two major bus routes.

9 The Metropolitan Transportation Authority informed the City it would not operate two major bus
10 routes along the same route at the same time.
11 17. Real Parties in Interest submitted grading and shoring plans for review in December
12 2021; the Respondent deemed these plans complete on January 18, 2022. These plans did not include
13 the information necessary to take advantage of the protections provided by Senate Bill 330.
14 18. Real Parties in Interest submitted construction plans for a building permit on March 8,
15 2022. The rapid bus route proposed along Adams Avenue had been removed from the regional
16 transportation plan by this time and there was no justification for finding the project site is located in a
17 TPA.

18 19. Petitioner does not know if the application for a building permit has been deemed
19 complete at this time or if the application contained all materials required by SB 330.
20 20. Petitioner submitted a letter to the City on July 19, 2022, informing the City the Project
21 does not comply with the height limits, density, and parking requirements set forth in the San Diego
22 Municipal Code. Petitioner also stated the project does not qualify for processing under Complete
23 Communities because the project is not located in a TPA. This letter also noted Real Parties-in-
24 Interest were not being required to pay the necessary Developer Impact Fees ("DIF"). Petitioner
25 requested the City deny the requested building permit and advise the applicant of the discretionary
26 approvals that would be necessary to approve the Project.
27

28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

21. On August 26, 2022, Petitioner was informed by City staff the Project was subject to
2 the Complete Communities Housing Solutions regulations.

3 22. Petitioner submitted a second letter to the City on October 20, 2022. The letter explained

4 why the project site was not located in a TPA a at the time of Preliminary Review. Petitioner also stated

5 the applicant could not rely on the ordinance, policies and standards in effect as of the Preliminary

6 Review date as provided by SB 330 because the required application materials were not submitted
7 within 180 days of the date the preliminary application was deemed complete. The project was not

8 located in a TPA when the applicant submitted the materials required by SB 330 on March 8, 2022.
9 23. Petitioner is informed and believes the City issued a Grading and Right-of-Way Permit
10 to the Project on October 21, 2022.
11 24. Petitioner noted construction equipment being moved on to the project site in Mid-
12 December; the exact date is unknown.
13 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

14 AND INADEQUATE REMEDIES AT LAW

15 25. Petitioner has exhausted all available administrative remedies, and objections to the

16 Project have been presented in writing to Respondent.

17 26. Petitioner has no adequate remedy at law unless this Court grants the requested writ of

18 mandamus requiring Respondent to rescind its approval of the grading permit and right of way permit

19 and any subsequent building permits issued for the Project. Petitioner will suffer irreparable harm

20 because the Project does not conform to the specific laws adopted by Respondent to protect the public

21 health, safety and welfare. The Project includes a density that is more than 6.5 times more than

22 allowed by the municipal codes without the requisite public improvements, contributions to

23 infrastructure and required parking. The project is not located in proximity to transit, thereby

24 exacerbating traffic and causing significant increases in greenhouse gases.

25 27. Petitioner has performed all conditions precedent to filing this action by complying

26 with all requirements and has no other remedy than to bring this action. All other requests of

27 Respondent, having been previously made, would be futile.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (Abuse of Discretion - Failure to Proceed in the Manner Required by Law)

3 28. Petitioner incorporates by reference each of the allegations set forth in this Petition as if

4 set forth herein in full.

5 29. Respondent wrongly issued a grading permit and a right of way permit for a project that

6 is not allowed by the San Diego Municipal Code.

7 30. Respondent wrongly issued a grading permit and right of way permit without requiring

8 the necessary discretionary approvals that might allow the proposed project.

9 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
(CEQA)
10 31. Petitioner incorporates by reference each of the allegations set forth in this Petition as if
11 set forth herein in full.
12 32. Respondent failed to comply with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).
13 33. a Respondent relied on a GHG checklist that stated the project is consistent with the
14 General Plan and the Municipal Code. The project is not consistent with the General Plan and the
15 Municipal Code, therefore there is no substantial evidence to support Respondent's conclusion the
16 project will not have significant GHG impacts.
17 34. Respondent relied on a statutory exemption for ministerial projects to comply with
18 CEQA. The project does not qualify for a ministerial approval and requires a discretionary approval.
19 35. The project is not consistent with the General Plan or the Municipal Code, therefore
20 the project does not qualify for a categorical exemption.
21 36. Respondent must perform adequate environmental review prior to approving or
22 allowing development of the Project.
23

24 PRAYER FOR RELIEF
25 WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully prays:
26 1. That this Court find that Respondent failed to proceed in the manner required by law
27 when it issued a grading permit and right of way permit for the Project; and
28

7
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

2. That this Court order Respondent to rescind all City approvals for the Project; and

2 3. That this Court issue a peremptory writ of mandamus declaring all City approvals of

3 the Project become null and void, and of no force and effect; and

4 4. That this Court order Respondent to set aside any construction permits and refrain from

5 any inspections for the Project; and

6 5. That this Court order Respondent to issue an order stopping all work on the Project site
7 and ordering the Project rendered safe until such time as the required discretionary approvals are

8 received; and

9 6. That Petitioner be awarded its reasonable costs incurred in this action; and

10 7. That Petitioner be awarded reasonable attorney's fees pursuant to Cal. Code of Civil
11 Procedure Section 1021.5; and

12 8. For such other legal or equitable relief that the Court deems just and proper.
