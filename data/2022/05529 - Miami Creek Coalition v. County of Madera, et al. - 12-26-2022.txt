VERIFIED COMPLAINT AND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

1 Almanac Holdings, LLC ("Almanac"), and Yosemite Basecamp, LLC ("Basecamp", and

2 collectively with Almanac, "Defendants") have constructed and are operating a resort without

3 having first conducted an environmental review or obtained the necessary permits. This lawsuit

4 seeks declaratory and injunctive relief to enjoin the operation of this illegal facility, which is a

5 public nuisance. Additionally, petitioner Miami Creek Coalition seeks to compel Madera County

6 and Madera County Community and Economic Development Department ("Respondents") to
7 perform mandatory statutory duties pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act
8 ("CEQA") and its implementing regulations and to comply with Title 18 of the Madera County

9 Code before issuing any permits to Defendants for the expansion of Sierra Meadows Resort and

10 Event Center to include resort facilities ("Sierra Meadows" or "Project"). In support of its petition,
11 Miami Creek Coalition alleges as follows:

12 INTRODUCTION

13 1. Within the last few years, Defendants have constructed a resort motel consisting of
14 multiple permanently affixed micro, tiny, and one- and two-bedroom cabins at Sierra Meadows, for
15 which they did not, and have not obtained the proper land use and operation permits necessary from
16 the County.
17 2. On June 29, 2022, Madera County issued Underground Fire Main Permit No. 21-
18 0822-FR ("Fire Main Permit") to Almanac, which approved the connection of new water lines to
19 the existing service main of the local water utility district, Maintenance District 46 ("MD-46"),
20 without verifying the availability of water or otherwise examining potential environmental impacts

21 of the proposed expansion of the resort for which the lines had been requested. Madera County gave
22 no public notice of this proposed project and apparently made no CEQA determination concerning
23 this discretionary approval.
24 3. Madera County violated CEQA, Public Resources Code, section 21000, et seq., and
25 the CEQA Guidelines, 14 California Code of Regulations ("CCR"), section 15000 et seq, by

26

27 As authorized and required by CEQA, Pub. Res. Code, § 21083, the state Office of Planning and Research ("OPR")
28 and the Natural Resources Agency developed and prepared guidelines for implementing CEQA, officially known as the State CEQA Guidelines. The CEQA Guidelines are certified and adopted by the Secretary of the Natural Resources Agency and are incorporated in the CCR as title 14, chapter 3 (14 CCR, $§15000-15387).
2
VERIFIED COMPLAINT AND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

F failing to analyze or mitigate potentially significant environment impacts for the proposed
2 expansion of the Sierra Meadows Resort and Event Center, facilitated by its Fire Main Permit.

3 4. Madera County violated its planning and zoning ordinance, codified as Madera
4 County Code Title 18, by issuing permits based on an outdated conditional use permit ("CUP") that
5 never vested and never contemplated : project for a motel-style resort or the expansion thereof.

6 5. Madera County has facilitated a public nuisance by failing to enforce planning and
7 zoning laws and allowing Defendants to construct or install structures for an unpermitted use that

8 adversely impacts petitioners and other area residents.

9 6. Petitioner possesses no effective remedy to challenge the approvals at issue in this
10 action other than by means of this lawsuit.

11 7. By this action, petitioner Miami Creek Coalition seeks a declaration that CUP 84-69

12 is expired and invalid and that the Fire Main Permit, and any other permits issued under the
13 auspices of that expired permit, is ultra vires, and, to the extent the County considers any further
14 approval related to the Project, that a writ issue requiring the respondents to first issue a CUP as
15 required by Title 18 of Madera County Code and to perform its duties under CEQA

16 8. Miami Creek Coalition also seeks a declaration of public nuisance and an order to
17 abate the same requiring Defendants to cease their operation of the Sierra Meadows resort and

18 remove the unauthorized structures.

19 PARTIES

20 9. Petitioner and plaintiff Miami Creek Coalition is an unincorporated community
21 association of Madera County residents who live near Miami Creek and seek to protect and enhance
22 the surrounding community. Coalition members include multiple residents of the Ahwahnee Estates
23 area, whose only paved residential access road, Opah Drive, and sole residential water supply--MD-
24 46--is directly and negatively impacted by the illegal Sierra Meadows existing unpermitted resort as
25 well as the anticipated expansion facilitated by the Fire Main Permit.
26 10. Respondent Madera County is a political subdivision of the State of California with
27 the power to approve proposed land use development projects subject to the state planning and
28 zoning laws. At all times relevant herein, Madera County has served as the lead agency, as that term

3
VERIFIED COMPLAINT AND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

F is defined in CEQA, because it is the public agency with principal responsibility for carrying out or

2 approving the Project at issue in this litigation. (14 CCR, § 15050.)

3 11. Respondent Madera County Community and Economic Development Department
4 ("CED") is the County Department to which the County has delegated responsibility for conducting

5 environmental reviews pursuant to the Madera County Code, Title 16. CED conducts this work

6 through several divisions, including the Planning Division, Environmental Health Division, and Fire

7 Prevention Division.

8 12. Real party in interest and defendant Almanac Holdings, LLC ("Almanac") is a
9 privately owned limited liability company that owns the property at which the Sierra Meadows
10 Resort and Event Center resort is located on Opah Drive in Ahwahnee, within Madera County.
11 Almanac is also the Project proponent and permit applicant to which the County allegedly issued
12 permits in violation of CEQA. (See Pub. Res. Code, § 21167.6.5.)

13 13. Real party in interest and defendant Yosemite Basecamp, LLC ("Basecamp") is a
14 privately owned limited liability company that owns and operates the business known as Sierra
15 Meadows Resort and Event Center, which is located on Opah Drive in Ahwahnee, within Madera
16 County.

17 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

18 14. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure,

19 sections 1085 (traditional writ of mandamus) and 1060 (declaratory relief), Public Resources Code
20 section 21168.5 (CEQA), and Civil Code section 3493 (public nuisance).

21 15. Venue is proper in the Superior Court of California for Madera County, pursuant to
22 Code of Civil Procedure, section 394, as this action is brought against Madera County, and the
23 actions complained of and real property upon which they occur are located in Madera County.
24 16. On December 20, 2022, the Miami Creek Coalition complied with Public Resources
25 Code section 21167.5 by serving a written notice on Respondents regarding the petitioner's
26 commencement of this action.

27 17. The Coalition is sending a copy of this Petition and Complaint to the California
28 Attorney General concurrently with filing, thereby complying with the requirements of Public

4
VERIFIED COMPLAINT AND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

F Resources Code section 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure section 388.

2 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS OF FACT

3 Madera County Code Land Use Provisions

4 18. Madera County Code, Title 18, provides procedures for the issuance of CUPs for

5 land uses "that may be desirable under appropriate circumstances, but are not permitted by right in

6 the applicable zone." Such uses are to be reviewed "on a case-by-case basis to determine whether

7 and under what conditions the use may be approved at a given site" in order to "fully protect the
8 public health, safety, and welfare of the community." (Madera County Code, § 18.92.003.)

9 19. When an agency issues a CUP for a proposed project, "[a]ll existing and proposed
10 uses on the site shall be identified in the permit, including existing or new uses permitted by right in

11 the applicable zone, any uses subject to a use permit, and those proposed uses that require the
12 conditional use permit. (Madera County Code, § 18.92.005 (B).)

13 20. An application for a CUP may not be approved unless the decision maker makes
14 specific findings, including findings that "[t]he proposed use will not be contrary to the public
15 health, safety, or general welfare of the citizens of Madera County" and "[t]he proposed use will not
16 be hazardous, harmful, noxious, offensive, or a nuisance." (Madera County Code, § 18.92.030.)

17 21. When a decision maker places conditions on a CUP's approval, "[t]he conditional
18 use permit is not deemed valid or issued until all required conditions are satisfied." (Madera County
19 Code, § 18.92.050.)

20 22. A CUP may be amended to address changes in the size of the facility or in the style,
or location of buildings. A change consisting of a ten percent increase in the size of a facility or 21

22 conditions of approval is a "major amendment" and requires approval of the decision maker, while

23 a change limited to the style and location of buildings requires a zoning permit. (Madera County
24 Code, § 18.92.055.)

25 23. The Project is located in the Open Space District. CUPs are specifically required for
26 "[p]rivate clubs and outdoor recreational facilities," including recreational camps and resorts.
27 Permits for these uses are subject to additional requirements set forth in Madera County Code

28 sections 18.94.080 and 18.94.100.

5
VERIFIED COMPLAINT AND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

1 24. Madera County Code provides that "[a]ny building or structure set up, erected,

2 constructed, altered, enlarged, converted, moved, placed or maintained in conflict with the

3 provisions of this title and any use of land, building or premises established, conducted, operated or
4 maintained contrary to the provisions of this title shall be and same is declared to be unlawful and a

5 public nuisance." (Madera County Code, § 18.112.020.)

6 25. In addition, prior to use or occupancy of any motel, including a resort or any auto
7 court, the owner or operator is required to apply for and obtain a valid certificate of occupancy from

8 the county department of public health (Madera County Code, §§ 7.12.040 - 7.12.060). The motel

q operator must also obtain an annual permit from the department of public health, authorizing them
10 to operate the motel. (Madera County Code, §§ 7.12.090, 7.12.110.) A "change of conditions"

11 requires a new permit. (Id. § 7.01.060.)

12 26. No person may maintain a motel in Madera County without a valid permit. (Madera
13 County Code, § 7.01.050.A.5.)

14 27. "Any violation of or failure to comply with any provision of the Madera County
15 Code" is a nuisance. (Madera County Code, § 1.12.080; see also §§ 7.24.141, 7.01.160.)

16 28. "[T]he rights which may 'vest' through reliance on a government permit are no

17 greater than those specifically granted by the permit itself." (Davidson v. Cty. of San Diego (1996)
18 49 Cal.App.4th 639, 646.) And no vested right is established by a CUP where the detailed plans

19 were yet to be determined and never disclosed to the authorizing body. (Avco Community.

20 Developers, Inc. v. South Coast Regional Comm'n (1976) 17 Cal.3d 785, 797.)

21 29. Moreover, even when a project does vest, the developer's right does not last forever
22 but may be lost if the project does not proceed within a reasonable time frame. (Lakeview Dev.
23 Corp. V. City of South Lake Tahoe (9th Cir. 1990) 915 F.2d 1290, 1298-99 (finding no vested right
24 to build phase two of a project after a ten-year delay).)
25 History of Sierra Meadows Resort

26 30. In 1985, a previous owner of the property on which the current Sierra Meadows site
27 is located, applied for and was issued CUP 84-69, authorizing golf course with a clubhouse,
28 swimming pool and horse trails, and a 600-space RV park. The CUP anticipated phased

6
VERIFIED COMPLAINT AND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

F development of the RV Park and included eighteen conditions. CUP 84-69 was later in the 1980s

2 amended by Site Plan Review No. 88-9 ("SPR 88-9"), which added additional conditions, including

3 approved sewer and water systems and a secondary a access road.

4 31. At some point in the 1980s, the RV park was built out to 54 RV parking places.

5 32. Real party in interest, Almanac, purchased the property in 2014 or 2015. Shortly
6 thereafter, the golf course was permanently closed.

7 33. At some point after the current owners assumed control of the property, the RV Park
8 was abandoned and replaced by the existing 28-cabin resort.

9 34. Over 35 years after CUP 84-69 issued, only the clubhouse and swimming pool are

10 still in use.

11 35. Since Almanac's purchase, the Defendants have constructed the existing resort. The

12 use of the site a as a resort with permanent structures was never considered or approved by CUP 84-

13 69 or SPR 88-9, which anyway are not valid to permit new construction.

14 36. Based on petitioner's information and belief, neither of the Defendants, nor anyone
15 else, has ever obtained a valid certificate of occupancy or annual operating permits from the
16 Department of Public Health as required before operating a motel.

17 37. In June 2020, Madera County, acting in its discretion, issued grading permit 20-
18 0035-GR, but no CUP, for expansion of Sierra Meadows that would allow for 27 additional rental
19 cabins, including at least several with kitchens and bathrooms requiring sewer and water hook-ups,

20 additional propane tanks, an additional community bathroom, and a laundry facility for
21 housekeeping and guests. The grading permit refers to the nearly 40-year old CUP 84-69 and states
22 that it incorporates the conditions placed on that CUP.

23 38. In June 2022. Madera County, acting in its discretion, issued Underground Fire Main
24 Permit No. 21-0822-FR to Almanac, approving the connection of new underground water lines to
25 MD-46 to provide fire hydrants, apparently for the expansion of the Sierra Meadows' resort.

26 39. Madera County made no effort to notify the public or area residents of the proposed
27 expansion of Sierra Meadows, did not seek public comment, and did not issue a new CUP for rental
28 cabins, a resort, or a motel, or for the expanded facilities at Sierra Meadows.

7
VERIFIED COMPLAINT AND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

1 40. Madera County did not conduct an environmental review to evaluate the potential

2 environmental impacts of the expansion of Sierra Meadows and did not a issue a Notice of
3 Determination that the project was exempt form CEQA.

4 41. Because the County failed to conduct any environmental review for the Project and

5 issued permits without public notice or opportunity for public comment, Petitioner had no
6 opportunity to engage in the administrative process or provide comments regarding the expansion of
7 Sierra Meadows.

8 42. Petitioner did not become aware of the Sierra Meadows expansion until Spring 2022
q when grading activities commenced and became visible, and which petitioner originally perceived

10 as unpermitted work. Petitioner learned of the County's approval of the expansion of Sierra
11 Meadows only after obtaining a copy of the grading permit and underground hydrant permits
12 through record requests to the County.

13 43. On November 22, 2022, petitioner notified Madera County officials, including the
14 Chair of the Madera County Board of Supervisors and the Director of the Community & Economic
15 Development Department, of their concerns regarding potential environmental impacts from the

16 Project and the failure of the County to proceed under a valid CUP as required by law.

17 44. The County has not responded to petitioner's November 22, 2022, letter.
18 Respondents Ignored Significant Impacts to the Environment

19 45. "The 'foremost principle' in interpreting CEQA is that the Legislature intended the

20 act to be read so as to afford the fullest possible protection to the environment within the reasonable

21 scope of the statutory language." (Communities for a Better Environment v. Calif. Resources
22 Agency (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 98, 109.)

23 46. CEQA has two primary purposes. First, CEQA is designed to inform decision
24 makers and the public about the potential, significant environmental effects of a project. (14 CCR,

25 15002, subd. (a)(1).) "Its purpose is to inform the public and its responsible officials of the
26 environmental consequences of their decisions before they are made. Thus, the EIR [environmental
27 impact report] 'protects not only the environment but also informed self-government.' (Citizens of
28 Goleta Valley v. Board of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 564.) The EIR has been described as

8
VERIFIED COMPLAINT AND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

F "an environmental 'alarm bell' whose purpose it is to alert the public and its responsible officials to

2 environmental changes before they have reached ecological points of no return." (Berkeley Keep

3 Jets Over the Bay v. Bd. of Port Comm'rs. (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1344, 1354; County of Inyo v.

4 Yorty (1973) 32 Cal.App.3d 795, 810.)

5 47. CEQA, Public Resources Code, section 21000, et seq., and the "CEQA Guidelines",

6 14 CCR, section 15000 et seq, apply whenever a government agency approves a "project" that may
7 significantly affect the environment, directly and/or indirectly, and is defined as "an activity which

8 may cause either a direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect
9 physical change in the environment." (Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21065, 21080.)

10 48. In addition to direct and indirect effects, a project is deemed to have a significant

11 effect on the environment if "the possible effects of a project are individually limited but
12 cumulatively considerable." (Pub. Resources Code, § 21083.) A project's cumulative impact is to be
13 considered "when viewed in connection with the effects of past projects, the effects of other current
14 projects, and the effects of probable future projects." (Id.)

15 49. CEQA's primary purpose includes informing government decision makers and the
16 public about the potential, significant environmental effects of proposed activities; identifying ways
17 that environmental damage can be avoided or significantly reduced; and preventing significant,
18 avoidable damage to the environment by requiring changes in projects through the use of
19 alternatives or mitigation measures when the governmental agency finds the changes to be feasible.

20 (14 CCR, § 15002, subd. (a).)

21 50. Under CEQA, a "lead agency" is "the public agency which has the principal
22 responsibility for carrying out or approving project which may have a significant effect upon the

23 environment." (Pub. Resources Code, § 21067.)

24 51. For any project that may significantly affect the environment directly and/or
25 indirectly, CEQA requires the lead agency to conduct an environmental assessment of the project's
26 potential environmental impacts prior to project approval. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21080.)

27 52. A reviewing court must "scrupulously enforce all legislatively mandated CEQA
28 requirements." (Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Bd. Of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 564.)

9
VERIFIED COMPLAINT AND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

1 53. CEQA requires agencies to undertake additional environmental review before

2 approving new discretionary permits when a project is substantially changed, or when there are
3 changed circumstances or new information concerning potential environmental impacts. (Pub.
4 Resources Code, § 21166; 14 CCR, § 15162.)

5 54. An action a alleging that a public agency has approved a project without having
6 determined whether the project may have a significant effect on the environment shall be
7 commenced within 180 days from the date of the agency's decision to approve the project, or from

8 the date of commencement of the project. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21167, subd. (a).)

9 55. The potential impacts of a motel are great. The majority of Sierra Meadows' cabins

10 are fully plumbed with kitchen facilities and bathrooms, mounted on pads, and further enclosed by

11 added porches and decks. Their design allows for long-term and continuous occupancy. The
12 potential impact of dozens, or perhaps hundreds of new water and sewer connections has never been
13 examined by the County. The additional water use required for housekeeping services and more
14 permanent occupancy has never been examined.

15 56. CUP 84-69 was also approved prior to the residential development of the area. More
16 than a hundred homes now occupy the surrounding area and most rely on the same sole access road

17 and water system as the proposed resort. Wildfire and drought now plague the County in a way that

18 they did not in the 1980s.

19 57. The availability of an adequate water supply for the expansion is a major concern of
20 area residents. The existing water supply to MD-46 is already stressed and inadequate to support the

21 proposed expansion. At least 88 homes currently rely on the same water system. The County failed
22 to determine that Almanac had obtained an adequate water supply for the proposed expansion
23 before issuing a discretionary permit allowing new water lines to be connected to MD-46.

24 58. Correspondence between the County and Defendants, indicates that the expected
25 water demand of the existing resort and proposed expansion combined would be 17.6 water units.
26 Almanac currently holds entitlements to only 9 water units. The total capacity of the MD-46 water
27 system is only 105 water units (or residential connections). The County has informed Defendants
28 that three new wells and an additional storage tank would be necessary to meet the additional

10
VERIFIED COMPLAINT AND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

F demand, but nevertheless approved permits without requiring these improvements, examining the
2 impacts of allowing a motel and/or resort to operate, issuing a proper CUP, or examining the

3 impacts of this increased draw on the environment and neighboring community.

4 59. The adequacy of existing access roads and evacuation routes is a major concern for
5 area residents. The Project is in CalFire-designated State Responsibility Area that is adjacent to a

6 High Fire Risk Area consisting of forested wildlands of the Sierra foothills where major wildfires
7 have occurred in recent years. The proposed expansion of Sierra Meadows will increase fire risk

8 and add congestion to Opah Drive, increasing the need for a paved and legally compliant secondary

9 access road.

10 60. The only current secondary access road for the project and area residents is a dirt
11 road that fails to comply with the County's minimum fire safety standards and Public Resource
12 Code section 4290, which is incorporated into the Safety Element of the County General Plan.
13 (Madera Cty. Gen. Plan, Ch 7.3, at 658.)

14 61. The adequacy of the Project's sewage and septic systems is critical to the protection
15 of groundwater, which is the primary source of drinking water for area residents. Madera County
16 has not determined whether the Sierra Meadows' wastewater treatment systems are adequate to
17 meet the needs of the proposed expansion.

18 62. Conditions have changed substantially in the period since the expired CUP 84-69
19 was approved in 1980s including substantial growth in residential use surrounding the site, and

20 increased risk of severe drought and wildfires due to climate change. There is also important new

21 information to be considered, including new laws, updates to the General Plan, and provisions of

22 the Ahwahnee Area Plan.

23 63. The County's continued issuance of permits under expired CUP 84-69 raises the
24 further concern that such expansions could continue and perhaps authorize as many as 600 rental

25 cabins. This could allow a massive trailer park to be approved under a 40-year-old CUP that

26 envisioned an RV park that never materialized. CUP 84-69 is no longer valid.

27 64. Respondents' failure to conduct an environmental review of the Project is inimical to
28 the spirit and purpose of CEQA's mandate to examine potential impacts prior to project approval to

11
VERIFIED COMPLAINT AND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

F facilitate informed decision making and to identify potential environmental impacts and mitigation

2 measures.

3 65. The relief requested by petitioner here, if granted, would redress, or at least lessen,
4 the injury to petitioner, its members, and other area residents. The relief requested by petitioner, if
5 granted, would require respondents to comply with the requirements of CEQA before authorizing a
6 project that could significantly impact the environment by substantially increasing water demand,
7 groundwater pollution, and fire risks. The relief requested by petitioner, if granted, would likely

8 reduce these injuries by requiring abatement of the public nuisance created by the unpermitted

9 motel and allowing public input on any future projects to assure that reasonable mitigation measures

10 are identified to protect the environment and the surrounding community prior to implementation.

11 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

12 (Writ of Mandate under CCP, § 1085 and Pub. Resources Code, § 21000, et seq., CEQA Compliance as to Respondents only)
13 66. Petitioner hereby realleges and incorporates by reference each of the above
14 paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.
15 67. Before approving any "project," a lead agency must first decide whether CEQA
16 applies. Here, respondents are the "lead agency" under CEQA but undertook no such inquiry and
17 have therefore violated CEQA.
18 68. The discretionary approval of the underground hydrant connection permit is "an
19 activity which may cause either a direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably
20 foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment." (Pub. Resources Code, § 21065.)
21 69. Respondents are capable of performing the duties required by applying CEQA
22 Review to the proposed project following procedures set forth in Title 16 of the Madera County
23 Code. Notwithstanding such ability, Respondents have failed to perform their duties and will
24 continue that failure and refusal to perform its duties unless so compelled by this Court.
25 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
26 (Writ of Mandate under CCP, § 1085, Government Code, § 65000 et seq., Madera County Code, Title 18, Conditional Use Permits as to Respondents only)
27
70. Petitioner hereby realleges and incorporates by reference each of the above
28

12
VERIFIED COMPLAINT AND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

F paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.

2 71. Respondents' approval of permits for the project without a valid CUP violates their
3 duties under California's Planning and Zoning Law, Government Code sections 65000 et seq.

4 72. Under the Planning and Zoning Law, a local public agency may approve a proposed

5 land use only if it is consistent with the goals, policies, and objectives contained in a General Plan,

6 and with all applicable local zoning laws. This law also requires public notice and comment to
7 guarantee the right to due process respecting area zoning and land uses changes.

8 73. Madera County General Plan Policy 3.C.1 requires that "[t]he county shall approve
9 new development only if an adequate water supply to serve such development is demonstrated."
10 The County's approval of permits for the Project without requiring Almanac to first demonstrate
11 adequate water supply is inconsistent with this policy.

12 74. The permit approvals are also inconsistent with the Ahwahnee Area Plan, which
13 similarly requires "[a]pprov[al of] new development only if adequate water supply to serve such
14 development is demonstrated."

15 75. Madera County General Plan section 7.3 incorporates minimum Fire-Safe
16 Regulations and Road Standards to comply with Public Resources Code section 4290. This statute
17 requires emergency access roads in State Responsibility Areas to meet minimum safety standards
18 and emergency water sources to be adequate in quantity. The current secondary access road is a
19 narrow dirt road that fails to comply with the County's minimum fire safety standards.

20 76. The Ahwahnee Area Plan also requires the County to ensure that construction in high
21 fire-hazard areas "meets all applicable State and County fire standards" and requires new
22 developments to have water systems that meet county fire flow requirements.

23 77. The respondents failed to issue a valid CUP for the Project before issuing permits
24 approving its construction and connection to an inadequate water supply, and failed to act in a
25 manner consistent with policies of the County's General Plan and the Ahwahnee Area Plan.

26 78. A CUP can only authorize the existing and proposed uses that are identified in the
27 permit. (Madera County Code, § 18.92.005 (B).) Uses that were never identified at the time of a
28 CUP's approval cannot become vested entitlements. (Davidson v. Cty. Of San Diego (1996) 49

2 17 Cal.3d 785, 797.)

3 79. Respondents have improperly issued permits for uses that were never identified in

4 CUP 84-69.

5 80. CUPs expire if not timely vested.

6 81. CUP 84-69 has expired.

7 82. Respondents have failed to make required findings that "[t]he proposed use will not

8 be contrary to the public health, safety, or general welfare of the citizens of Madera County" and
9 "[t]he proposed use will not be hazardous, harmful, noxious, offensive, or a nuisance." (Madera

10 County Code, § 18.92.030.)

11 83. Respondents are capable of properly reviewing the proposed project under the
12 procedures set forth in Title 18 of the Madera County Code. Notwithstanding such ability,
13 Respondents have failed to perform their duties and will continue that failure and refusal to perform

14 its duties unless so compelled by this Court.

15 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION
(Civil Action under Civil Code §§ 3479, 3480, 3491, 3493, 16 Continuing Public Nuisance and Nuisance Per Se as to Almanac and Basecamp only)
17 84. Petitioner hereby realleges and incorporates by reference each of the above
18 paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.
19 85. Defendants' failure to obtain CUP and comply with Madera County Code, prior to
20 proceeding with an unauthorized project, namely the construction of a motel consisting of
21 permanent cabins at Sierra Meadows constitutes a continuing public nuisance within the meaning of
22 Madera County Code sections 18.112.020 7.24.141 and California Civil Code, sections 3479 and
23 3480.
24 86. As a direct and proximate result of Almanac and Basecamp's actions and inactions,
25 Petitioner's members have been, and will be, specially damaged within the meaning of California
26 Civil Code, section 3493, because the resulting unauthorized land use impacts their use and
27 enjoyment of property located adjacent to or very near Sierra Meadows through unauthorized water
28 use threating members' own water source, unauthorized discharges to groundwater threatening

14
VERIFIED COMPLAINT AND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

F members' water quality, and increased fire risk due to reliance of members on the same evacuation
2 routes as guests at Sierra Meadows, all resulting from unauthorized activity at Sierra Meadows.

3 87. Almanac and Basecamp's failure to obtain a CUP and comply with Madera County

4 Code constitutes a per se nuisance because their actions in developing Sierra Meadows and in

5 operating a motel without obtaining a CUP, certificate of occupancy, or annual permits violate

6 Madera County code.

7 88. The unauthorized activities at Sierra Meadows affect a substantial number of people,

guests that could suffer harm as a result of 8 including hundreds of area residents and Sierra Meadows
9 increased fire risk, inadequate evacuation routes, as well as the health risks associated with
10 unauthorized operation of a motel. These are also conditions that an ordinary person would be
11 reasonably annoyed or disturbed by, and the seriousness of the harm outweighs the social utility of

12 Defendants' conduct.

13 89. a As a further direct and proximate cause of the public nuisance per se created and
14 perpetuated by Almanac and Basecamp, plaintiff has suffered damages as previously described
15 herein and seeks abatement of the public nuisance, and all other legally available costs and
16 damages.

17 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

18 WHEREFORE, petitioner respectfully prays for judgment as follows:

19 a. Declaratory Relief: That this court find that, by issuing the grading permit and the

20 Underground Fire Main Permit No. 21-0822-FR, respondents have violated CEQA

22 null and void and of no force and effect;

24 to:

25 i. Vacate and set aside approval of Underground Fire Main Permit No. 21-

5 any further permits allowing changed or expanded uses of the Sierra

6 c. Injunctive Relief:

9 all other applicable state and local laws, policies, ordinances, and regulations

10 with respect to Sierra Meadows, such parties be enjoined and restrained from

11 taking any physical actions toward development or completion of its

12 expansion, including any grading, clearing, digging, or similar actions; and

13 d. That Defendants will abate the public nuisance caused by their failure to comply

14 with applicable state and local laws by removing the unauthorized structures at

15 Sierra Meadows and ceasing operation of the unauthorized motel;
