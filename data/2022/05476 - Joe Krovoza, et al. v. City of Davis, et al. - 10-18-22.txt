VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Petitioners JOE KROVOZA and JANET KROVOZA (*Petitioners"), for their causes of

2 action, allege:

3 INTRODUCTION

4 1. Petitioners respectfully petition this Court for a writ of mandate ordering the

5 CITY OF DAVIS ("CITY") and the CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF DAVIS ("DAVIS

6 COUNCIL") to rescind its August 30, 2022, decision to approve locating a "Sky Track" play

7 structure within Arroyo Park and the installation of new playground equipment (*Project"). As

8 set forth below, the CITY's approval of the Project violates the California Environmental

9 Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code § §21000 et seq., and Title 14, California Code

10 of Regulations §§15000 et seq. (the "CEQA Guidelines"). Petitioners seek a writ of mandate

11 directing the Respondents to set aside the CEQA exemption determination and approval of the

12 Project pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1085 and 1094.5.

13 PARTIES

14 1. Petitioners are residents of the CITY and reside in their home that is adjacent to

15 Arroyo Park, near the Project site. Petitioners have a direct and substantial beneficial interest in:

16 (i) ensuring that Respondents comply with its obligations under CEQA on behalf of the public,

17 (ii) preventing the CITY from taking actions that will subject nearby residents, everyday park

18 users, and community pool users to excessive noise impacts from the Project; (iii) reducing

19 community pool safety; (iv) impacting biological resources, particularly bird nesting and

20 foraging; and (vi) reducing park aesthetics.

21 2. CITY OF DAVIS, a general law city incorporated under the laws of the State of

22 California and located in Yolo County, is responsible for regulating and controlling land use in

23 the CITY and for implementing and complying with the local and state laws implicated by this

24 Verified Petition For Writ of Mandate, including CEQA. CITY is the CEQA "lead agency" for

25 the Project. As lead agency for the Project, CITY is responsible for preparation of an

26 environmental document that describes the Project and its impacts, and, if necessary, evaluates

27 mitigation measures and/or alternatives to lessen or avoid any significant environmental

28 impacts.
-2-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 3. CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF DAVIS is the duly elected legislative body

2 authorized under the California Constitution and the laws of the State of California to act on

3 behalf of CITY. Respondent DAVIS COUNCIL is responsible for implementing and complying

4 with the local and state laws implicated by this Verified Petition For Writ of Mandate, including

5 the provisions of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines.

6 4. The true names and capacities, whether individual, corporate, associate,

7 co-conspirator, partner or alter-ego of those respondents sued herein under the fictitious names

8 of DOES 1 through 20, inclusive, are unknown to Petitioners, who therefore sue those

9 respondents by such fictitious names. Petitioners will ask leave of court to amend this Petition

10 and insert the true names and capacities of these respondents when the same have been

11 ascertained. Petitioners are informed and believe and, on that basis, allege that each of the

12 respondents designated herein as a DOE respondent is legally responsible in some manner for

13 the events, acts and omissions, and the impact on Petitioners' rights alleged in this Petition.

14 5. At all relevant times to this action, each named DOE respondent 1 through 20

15 was and is the alter-ego, agent, servant, employee, co-conspirator or aider and abettor of each of

16 the remaining named and DOE respondents, and acting within the purpose and scope of that

17 relationship with the express or implied knowledge, permission and consent of the remaining

18 named and DOE respondents, and each of them, and each of said respondents ratified and

19 approved the acts of the other respondents.

20 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

21 6. Pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure sections 1094.5 and 1085 and

22 Public Resources Code sections 21168, 21168.5 and 21168.9, the Court has jurisdiction to issue

23 a writ of mandate to set aside Respondents' decision to find the Project is exempt from CEQA

24 and approve the Project.

25 7. Venue is proper in this Court because the causes of action alleged in this Petition

26 arose in Yolo County, where the proposed Project will be constructed and operate.

27 8. Petitioners have complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code

28 section 21167.5 by serving written notice of Petitioners' intention to commence this action on
-3-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Respondents on October 3, 2022. Copies of the written notice and proof of service are attached

2 hereto as Exhibit A.

3 9. Petitioners have complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code

4 section 21167.6 by filing, concurrently with this Petition, a notice of their election to prepare the

5 record of administrative proceedings relating to this action.

6 10. Petitioners are complying with the requirements of Public Resources Code

7 section 21167.7 by sending a copy of this Petition to the California Attorney General within 10

8 days after the filing of this Petition.

9 11. Petitioners have performed any and all conditions precedent to filing this instant

10 action and have exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent required

11 by law.

12 12. Petitioners have no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary

13 law unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to set aside

14 their finding that the Project is exempt from CEQA and approval of the Project.

15 STATEMENT OF FACTS

16 The Project

17 13. The "Sky Run Zip Track" at Arroyo Park ("SKY TRACK") consists of two metal

18 tracks, each 53' long and raised 9' above the surface of a bed. The track's interior is a channel

19 that allows multiple wheels to roll forward and backward the length of the track. The track is

20 supported by double posts at either end and by five arching intermediate posts placed at intervals

21 between the ends. The track is not a single piece of metal; it is multiple sections between the

22 posts bolted together and at each post the seams increase the noise when the wheels bounce over

23 them. Each track ends abruptly and the wheels strike these ends with each length of Sky Track

24 they travel. Suspended from one tube's wheels are a hanging disk for sitting or standing, and

25 suspended from the second tube's wheels is a plastic molded chair. The two tracks are situated

26 in a raised cement bed that measures 30 yards in length and from 10 to 12 yards in width. SKY

27 TRACK is intended for use by 5 to 12-year-olds, but in practice it is often used by both children

28 and adults. Maximum enjoyment seems to be derived when parents or friends push or throw the
-4-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 disk and chair as hard as possible against the stationary track ends. Multiple riders are often on

2 the disk at the same time, and this is true of the chair on some occasions.

3 14. The noise generated by the SKY TRACK is of two kinds: continuous and impact

4 (or impulse) noise when the wheels strike each end and then begin their return in the opposite

5 direction. The continuous noise is primarily the sound of the wheels scraping the interior of the

6 metal channel as they move rapidly along the track, with louder impact sounds when the wheels

7 bounce over the seams. The primary impact noise occurs when the wheels strike the ends of the

8 track. The characteristics of the continuous sound are grating, abrasive, grinding and harsh; the

9 impact sounds are of a sudden clanging, bonging, pile-driver-like, clanking nature. The noise

10 generated depends on the weight and velocity of the user(s). The loudest scraping (continuous)

11 and banging (impact) noise is usually caused by adults pushing or throwing seated children with

12 great force and effort, a routine use of the equipment, but even the mild pushing of a swing by

13 hand (with no rider) will generate noise audible within neighbors' homes.

14 15. The SKY TRACK is the largest and loudest piece of playground equipment in the

15 CITY. To be locked at night, it requires daily management and staff attention that often fails. No

16 other play structure in the CITY requires daily management.

17 16. The Project site is located in Arroyo Park, a public park facility located within the

18 CITY's jurisdiction. Arroyo Park is nearly surrounded by single-family homes along its

19 southern, eastern and northern boundaries, and an elementary school is on its western boundary.

20 17. CITY originally installed the SKY TRACK in Arroyo Park in spring of 2019,

21 opening it in April of 2019. It was permanently closed in March of 2022 based on a noise a report

22 that established that this piece of park equipment had operated in violation of CITY's noise

23 standards for day and night residential levels since it was installed.

24 18. CITY now proposes a new project to site the SKY TRACK at a still unspecified

25 location to the north of the initial location within Arroyo Park. Because Arroyo Park is nearly

26 surrounded by residential homes, by locating SKY TRACK in Arroyo Park further away from

27 the southern neighbors, by definition SKY TRACK would be located closer to other residences

28 to the north.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Sky Track's Noisy History

2 19. Within days of its opening at the end of April 2019, the SKY TRACK generated

3 complaints from nearby residents regarding both daytime and nighttime noise directly

4 attributable to the moving/mechanical nature of the SKY TRACK and its close proximity to

5 neighboring homes.

6 20. From early May 2019 to the present, Petitioners submitted continuous and

7 extensive verbal and written comments on the impacts to nearby residents from the excessive

8 nuisance noise generated by the SKY TRACK. Many other CITY residents joined Petitioners in

9 appearing before the Recreation and Park Commission and DAVIS COUNCIL, and in providing

10 written comments to both of these bodies and to staff of CITY.

11 21. On May 2, 2019, Petitioners telephoned the CITY and complained of noise. Not

12 receiving a response, on May 15, 2019, after speaking to neighbors who were also hearing the

13 noise, Petitioners wrote DAVIS COUNCIL. That evening Petitioners received an email stating

14 CITY would look into it.

15 22. On May 18, 2019, CITY disabled the tracks to prevent their use. Two days later

16 the playground equipment sales representative (*Playground Rep") and her husband attempted

17 to mitigate the noise by adding pieces of rubber doormat to the ends of the tracks and lubricating

18 the moving wheel. The Playground Rep's husband stated to Petitioners that nothing would

19 diminish the sound; however, the Playground Rep told Petitioners she wished she had

20 recommended another piece of equipment given she now understood the noise impacts on

21 neighbors. The lubrication and added rubber did not attenuate the noise.

22 23. CITY reopened the SKY TRACK on May 24, 2019, posting new hours of use (8

23 a.m. to sunset) and beginning a program of locking and unlocking the tracks with metal chains

24 and padlocks, initially calling on the fire department to do this. Repeated infractions occurred at

25 night and, on the advice of CITY, Petitioners called the police on eight or more occasions to stop

26 nighttime activity.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 24. On July 17, 2019, Petitioners were among a group of citizens who appeared and

2 spoke in front of the Recreation and Park Commission, imploring the CITY to move the SKY

3 TRACK where it would not disturb neighbors while remaining accessible to the public.

4 25. On August 16, 2019, Petitioners met with assistant city manager Ashley Feeney

5 ("Feeney") to discuss the problem and seek solutions. At this meeting, Feeney was in possession

6 of, but did not share, a sound analysis report from Bollard Acoustical Consultants ("BAC")

7 commissioned by CITY in July of 2019 ("2019 Study") that, according to Feeney, showed the

8 SKY TRACK operated in compliance with CITY's noise ordinance. Petitioners would later

9 learn that the 2019 Study only concluded that the SKY TRACK operated in compliance with

10 daytime noise limits by the narrowest of margins (and not nighttime limits), and applied only an

11 "average" noise level standard instead of the "maximum" and "repetitive peak-level" noise limit

12 standards from the noise ordinance.

13 26. From August 2019 to March 2020 Petitioners repeatedly communicated concerns

14 about the SKY TRACK noise to individual council members and CITY staff.

15 27. On March 5, 2020, Petitioners submitted a written comment to CITY attesting to

16 continuing problems with the SKY TRACK's noise, that stated: "(the SKY TRACK) generates

17 an inescapable abrasive industrial sound that ports directly into our yard and house interior

18 whenever it is in use, interrupting sleep, rest, and concentration, impacting our physical and

19 mental health, and preventing enjoyment of our home. It has had a profoundly negative effect on

20 our lives since it was installed."

21 28. On March 21, 2020, the CITY locked the SKY TRACK to prevent use during the

22 pandemic.

23 29. On April 21, 2021, the Recreation and Park Commission voted to reopen the

24 SKY TRACK but to discontinue nightly locking, a decision informed by the first public release

25 of the 2019 Study.

26 30. On June 8, 2021, Petitioners wrote to DAVIS COUNCIL, with a copy to City

27 Manager Mike Webb and City Attorney Inder Khalsa, to demand that CITY resume locking the

28 SKY TRACK at night. Petitioners documented 62 use violations between sunset 8 and 8 a.m. and
-7-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 40 noise ordinance violations between 9 p.m. and 7 a.m. in the 42 days since the SKY TRACK

2 had been reopened with no nighttime locking. Additionally, Petitioners noted their household

3 had been awakened or sleep delayed on 18 of the 42 nights.

4 31. Pursuant to Davis Municipal Code ("DMC") Chapter 24 (Noise Regulations) at

5 24.02.020(c), Petitioners formally withdrew their consent to hear noise from the SKY TRACK

6 within their home between the hours of sunset and 8 a.m. and stated they withdrew their consent

7 to hear noise from the SKY TRACK during all hours, day or night, if the SKY TRACK were not

8 removed from the east side of Arroyo Park by October 1, 2021.

9 32. On June 9, 2021, CITY resumed nighttime locking of the SKY TRACK.

10 33. On March 10, 2022, CITY disabled the SKY TRACK in response to the results

11 of a March 1, 2022, noise study conducted by Acoustic Group, Inc. ("AGI") (*2022 Study"),

12 that showed that SKY TRACK operations violated both daytime and nighttime noise limits

13 under the CITY's noise ordinance. The 2022 Study also applied the "average" noise level

14 standard instead of the "maximum" and "repetitive peak-level" noise limit standards from the

15 noise ordinance.

16 34. On March 16, 2022, CITY staff presented the results of the 2022 Study to the

17 Recreation and Park Commission. CITY staff explained the SKY TRACK would be moved

18 elsewhere in Arroyo Park to avoid noise violations and the vandalism that nightly locking

19 invited (at least 12 incidents reported). CITY staff stated that it would now be unnecessary as

20 average noise was not expected to exceed 49.5 dBA at the nearest residences.

21 35. Via Zoom meeting participation, Petitioners voiced their opinion that with such

22 thin margins, any proposed location within Arroyo Park was doomed to failure and at a

23 minimum would require nightly locking. City Attorney Khalsa also acknowledged that the

24 CITY's noise ordinance's statutory nuisance provisions in DMC 24.05.010(a-c) applied to SKY

25 TRACK use.

26 The Flawed Noise Analyses

27 36. In response to neighborhood and citywide complaints, CITY originally engaged a

28 noise consultant to prepare the 2019 Study to determine whether the SKY TRACK violated the
-8-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 CITY's daytime and nighttime noise limits established in the CITY's noise ordinance. The 2019

2 Study concluded that the SKY TRACK operations would not violate the daytime noise limits of

3 the City's ordinance.

4 37. The 2019 Study did not make any conclusions as to compliance with the CITY's

5 nighttime noise limits, nor did it compare the existing ambient noise level without an operating

6 SKY TRACK to determine the level of increase in the ambient noise level resulting from an

7 operating SKY TRACK.

8 38. On May 19, 2021, Petitioners submitted a written comment to the Recreation and

9 Parks Commission stating that the 2019 Study wrongly applied a more limited average noise

10 (measured with Leq) standard, nstead of the maximum noise (measured with Lmax) standard

11 described in the CITY ordinance, to conclude there was no violation.

12 39. On June 1, 2021, CITY staff asked DAVIS COUNCIL to change the DMC

13 regarding noise standards in ways that would bring the SKY TRACK into compliance by,

14 among other features, changing the noise limit standards from "maximum" and "repetitive peak-

15 level" to "average." The proposal was removed from the DAVIS COUNCIL agenda at the June

16 1, 2021, DAVIS COUNCIL meeting following public outcry.

17 40. CITY's second noise consultant released the 2022 Study on March 1, 2022. The

18 2022 Study conducted an additional noise study to reassess whether the SKY TRACK was in

19 violation at the original site and to attempt to predict whether the CITY's daytime and nighttime

20 exterior noise limits established in the CITY's noise ordinance might be violated at four (4)

21 possible alternative locations within Arroyo Park (Locations A through D). The 2022 Study

22 concluded that the SKY TRACK does violate the CITY's daytime and nighttime noise standards

23 at its original location. This conclusion was reached using the same average noise levels

24 standard in the 2019 Study.

25 41. Similar to the 2019 Study, the 2022 Study did not compare the ambient noise

26 level without an operating SKY TRACK to determine the level of increase in the ambient noise

27 level resulting from an operating SKY TRACK at each of the four (4) alternative locations.

28

-9-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 42. As a result of the 2022 Study, the CITY removed the hanging disc and hanging

2 chair from the SKY TRACK apparatus in March 2022.

3 43. On May 12, 2022, CITY released a report defending the use of "averages"

4 instead of "maximums," despite the CITY's noise ordinance use of the terms "maximum" and

5 "repetitive peak-level" to describe the CITY's noise ordinance limits. The word "average" does

6 not appear once in DMC Chapter 24.

7 44. The 2022 Study estimates that Location B will create maximum noise of 68.8

8 dBA at the Arroyo Community Pool. Noise at this level will detract from enjoyment at the pool

9 and potentially cause safety hazards due to distractions of pool attendees and safety staff.

10 45. The 2022 Study estimates that Location B will create maximum noise of 61.7

11 dBA at the children's playground west of the original SKY TRACK site.

12 46. CITY has not conducted any analysis under its statutory nuisance provision DMC

13 24.05.010(a-c) that requires consideration of (1) Loudness (intensity) of the sound; (2) Pitch

14 (frequency) of the sound; (3) Duration of the sound; (4) Time of day; (5) Necessity of noise; and

15 (6) Background noise. As previously mentioned, CITY attorney acknowledged at the March 16,

16 2022, Recreation and Park Commission meeting the relevance of DMC 24.05.010 to SKY

17 TRACK compliance.

18 Project Approval

19 47. On June 21, 2022, CITY called a special meeting of the Recreation and Park

20 Commission with representatives of AGI and BAC available remotely to answer questions.

21 Petitioners registered their concerns in both written and remote live comments during the

22 meeting regarding noise impacts, as well as problems with the City's interpretation of its noise

23 ordinance. Nevertheless, the Recreation and Park Commission voted to locate the SKY TRACK

24 to Location B in Arroyo Park, as CITY staff was recommending.

25 48. On August 30, 2022, the DAVIS COUNCIL held a public hearing on the Project.

26 Petitioners submitted an extensive written comment letter and both Petitioners spoke. Numerous

27 parties spoke at the meeting or via pre-recorded audio against locating the SKY TRACK in

28
-10-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Arroyo Park. Among other objections, Petitioners identified potential environmental impacts

2 resulting from operation of the SKY TRACK and other CEQA violations such as:

3 a. inconsistency with the Noise Ordinance standards,

4 b. how the use of "average" noise levels and other missing analytical data in the

5 two Noise Studies at Arroyo Park understate the noise impacts of the Project

6 as a result.

7 49. In addition, Petitioners and others also commented on how the CITY's desired

8 Location B is shown to be in the middle of existing trees per the August 30, 2022, staff report.

9 As a result, the Project will either (i) lead to an undisclosed impact to the critical root zone of the

10 existing trees at Location B; or (ii) the SKY TRACK's actual location will be different than

11 what was approved in the August 30, 2022, staff report, and further undermine the usefulness of

12 the 2022 Study.

13 50. After Petitioners and other members of the public made comments, the DAVIS

14 COUNCIL closed the public hearing, found that the Project was exempt from CEQA pursuant to

15 CEQA Guidelines sections 15303 ("New Construction or Conversion of Small Structures"),

16 15304 ("Minor Alterations to Land"), and 15311 ("Accessory Structures"), and voted to approve

17 the Project.

18 51. CITY additionally adopted a finding stating that: "there are no 'unusual

19 circumstances' that would cause the potential for a significant impact that a would preclude the

20 use of any of the exemptions listed above," pursuant to CEQA Guidelines $15300.2. The only

21 evidence cited by CITY in support of this statement was its reliance on the 2022 Study's

22 findings that "the new location of the Sky Track has been found not to exceed the CITY's noise

23 ordinance standards day or night.'

24 52. CITY filed its Notice of Exemption for the Project on or after September 1, 2022.

25 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

Violation of the California Environmental Quality Act,
27 Public Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.

28 (Against All Respondents)

-11-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 53. Petitioners reallege and incorporate by reference Paragraphs 1 through 52,

2 inclusive, of this Petition, as if fully set forth below.

3 54. CEQA requires the lead agency for a project with the potential to cause

4 significant environmental impacts to prepare an EIR that complies with the requirements of the

5 statute, including, but not limited to, the requirement to analyze the project's potentially

6 significant environmental impacts. The EIR must provide sufficient environmental analysis such

7 that the decisionmakers can intelligently consider environmental consequences when acting on

8 the proposed project. Additionally, the EIR must analyze mitigation measures and an adequate

9 range of alternatives to the project.

10 55. CEQA also mandates that the lead agency adopt feasible mitigation measures that

11 would reduce or avoid any of a project's significant environmental impacts. If any of the

12 project's significant impacts cannot be mitigated to a less than significant level, then CEQA bars

13 the lead agency from approving project if a feasible alternative is available that would meet the

14 project's objectives while avoiding or reducing its significant environmental impacts.

15 56. CEQA further mandates that a lead agency may approve a project that would

16 have significant, unavoidable environmental impacts only if the agency finds that the project's

17 benefits would outweigh its unavoidable impacts.

18 57. CEQA requires that an agency's findings for the approval of a project be

19 supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record and requires that an agency

20 provide an explanation of how the record evidence supports the conclusions the agency has

21 reached.

22 58. Respondents violated CEQA by finding that the Project was exempt from CEQA

23 and, thus, failed to comply with the requirements of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines. Among

24 other CEQA violations, the CITY:

25 a. Improperly relied on CEQA exemptions to approve the Project, because it

26 involved unusual circumstances of the operation of the SKY TRACK, a uniquely noisy piece of

27 playground equipment, that resulted in undisclosed potentially significant noise impacts that

28
-12-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 preclude the use of the asserted CEQA exemptions pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section

2 15300.2.

3 b. Failed to adequately disclose, analyze or mitigate the Project's potentially

4 significant impacts on the environment, including, but not limited to, the Project's impacts on

5 nuisance noise imposed on residents, the disruption of park tranquility for all park users,

6 biological resources (especially bird nesting and foraging), park aesthetics, and community pool

7 safety.

8 C. Failed to conduct an analysis of the increase of noise levels as compared

9 to the existing conditions to determine whether or not the Project would have a potentially

10 significant effect on nearby sensitive receptors; and

11 d. Failed to identify feasible mitigation measures to reduce or avoid the

12 impacts of the Project, including, but not limited to the adoption of mitigation for noise impacts

13 on nearby sensitive receptors;

14 59. Respondents further violated CEQA by failing to prepare a mitigated negative

15 declaration ("MND") or an environmental impact report ("EIR"), thus depriving the public of a

16 meaningful opportunity to review and comment on the CITY's evidence used to support its

17 CEQA determinations.

18 60. Respondents violated CEQA by adopting findings that are inadequate as a matter

19 of law in that they are not supported by substantial evidence in the record, including, but not

20 limited to the following findings:

21 a. The determination that there were no unusual circumstances that precluded the

22 use of the CEQA exemptions to approve the Project, despite the unusually noisy nature of the

23 SKY TRACK that caused the CITY to conduct two separate noise studies and substantial CITY

24 resources to prevent its use at night in an attempt to limit its impact on nearby sensitive

25 receptors;

26 b. The determination that the 2019 Study and the 2022 Study demonstrate that

27 the Project is in compliance with DMC 24.02.020's explicit "Maximum Noise Level (dBA)"

28 standards of 55 dBA day and 50 dBA night.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 C. The determination that the 2019 Study and the 2022 Study, which only

2 evaluate the absolute noise level of the Project, demonstrate that the Project would not have a

3 potentially significant noise impact on nearby sensitive receptors, that is in direct contradiction

4 with the decision in Keep Our Mountains Quiet v. County of Santa Clara (2015) 236

5 Cal.App.4th 714, which held that demonstrating compliance with an adopted noise standard was

6 insufficient under CEQA, because "the lead agency should consider both the increase in noise

7 level and the absolute noise level associated with a project"; and

8 d. The determination that other certain impacts would not occur or would be less

9 than significant and, thus, the Project was exempt from CEQA.

10 61. Respondents further violated CEQA by adopting findings that do not provide the

11 reasoning, or analytic route, from facts to conclusions as required by law.

12 62. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents prejudicially abused their

13 discretion by finding the Project was exempt from CEQA, making findings, and taking related

14 actions that do not comply with the requirements of CEQA. As such, Respondents' CEQA

15 exemption determination and approval of the Project must be set aside.

17 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

18 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for judgment as follows:

19 1. For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing Respondents to vacate

20 and set aside the CITY's CEQA exemption determination and approval of the Project;

21 2. For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing Respondents to

22 comply with CEQA, the Guidelines, and other applicable laws, and take any other action as

23 required by Public Resources Code section 21168.9;

24 3. For a temporary stay, temporary restraining order, and preliminary and

25 permanent injunctions restraining Respondents and their agents, servants, and employees, and

26 all others acting in concert with Respondents on their behalf, from taking any action, including

27 issuance of grading or building permits, to implement the Project, pending full compliance with

28 the requirements of CEQA, the Guidelines, and other applicable laws;
