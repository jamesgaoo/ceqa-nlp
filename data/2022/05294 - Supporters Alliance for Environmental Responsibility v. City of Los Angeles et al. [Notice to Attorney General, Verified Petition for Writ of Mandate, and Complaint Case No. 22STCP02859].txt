Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

INTRODUCTION

2 1. Petitioner Supporters Alliance for Environmental Responsibility ("SAFER" or

3 "Petitioner") brings this action to challenge the unlawful actions of Respondents City of Los Angeles,

4 the City Council of the City of Los Angeles, and the Los Angeles Department of City Planning

5 (collectively, "City" or "Respondents") in approving the 9500 Pico mixed-use residential and

6 commercial development project ("Project") without first preparing an Environmental Impact Report

7 ("EIR") in accordance with the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"),

8 Public Resources Code § 21000 et seq., and the CEQA Guidelines, title 14, California Code of
9 Regulations, § 15000 et seq.
10 2. The Project includes the demolition of an existing a office building, a food stand, and a car

11 wash, along with the construction of a six-story, 72-foot high mixed-use building including 108

12 residential units and 3,250 square feet of commercial space.

13 3. The Project site, where the 108 new residential units will be built, is heavily

14 contaminated with benzene, petroleum hydrocarbons, and other contaminants resulting from the site's

15 historic uses as a gas station and car wash. Petitioner submitted evidence from experts presenting a fair

16 argument that the Project may have significant environmental effects on air quality and greenhouse gas

17 emissions, human health impacts from diesel particulate emissions, impacts from hazardous materials,

18 and energy impacts and that the City's Initial Study and Negative Declaration is not supported by

19 substantial evidence. Respondents are in violation of CEQA by failing to prepare an EIR for the Project
20 despite substantial evidence in the record of a fair argument that the Project may have significant

21 environmental effects that have not been mitigated.

22 4. At a minimum, the City was required to prepare a mitigated negative declaration

23 (*MND") because the City's approval of the Project included approval of various measures meant to
24 reduce the Project's environmental impacts.

25 5. Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion in adopting the IS/ND and failing to

26 prepare an EIR or an MND. Alternatively, Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by relying

27 upon an IS/ND that is not supported by substantial evidence, failing to disclose the Project's baseline

28 conditions for hazardous soil vapors, and improperly classifying mitigation measures as project design

2
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

features. Accordingly, the approval of the Project should be set aside and Respondents should be

2 required to prepare an EIR and fully comply with CEQA, Public Resources Code § 21000 et seq., prior

3 to considering whether to approve the Project.

4 PARTIES

5 6. Petitioner Supporters Alliance for Environmental Responsibility is a California nonprofit

6 corporation with members who live and/or work in or near the City of Los Angeles. The primary

7 objective and purpose of SAFER is to contribute to the preservation and enhancement of the

8 environment; to advocate for programs, policies, and development projects that promote not only good
9 jobs but also a healthy natural environment and working environment, including but not limited to

10 advocating for changes to proposed projects and policies that, if adopted, would reduce air, soil and

11 water pollution, minimize harm to wildlife, conserve wild places, reduce traffic congestion, reduce

12 global warming impacts, and assure compliance with applicable land use ordinances; to work to attain

13 the widest range of beneficial uses of the environment without degradation, risk to health or safety, or

14 other undesirable and unintended consequences; to promote environmentally sustainable businesses and

15 development projects, including providing comments raising environmental concerns and benefits on

16 proposed development projects; to advocate for changes to proposed development projects that will help
17 a to achieve a balance between employment, the human population, and resource use which will permit

18 high standards of living and a wide sharing of life's amenities by the general public; to take steps to

19 preserve important historic, cultural, and natural aspects of our national heritage, and maintain, wherever

20 possible, an environment which supports diversity and variety of individual choice; and to carry on other
21 charitable and educational activities associated with this goal as allowed by law.

22 7. SAFER's members who live and/or work near the Project have several legally cognizable

23 interests in the Project and will be negatively affected by the Project's adverse environmental impacts

24 and improper approval. The interests of Petitioner and its members are unique and will be directly

25 impacted by the Project. Petitioner brings this action on behalf of itself and its members, and in the

26 public interest. Petitioner and its members have a direct and beneficial interest in Respondents'

27 compliance with laws bearing upon approval of the Project. These interests will be directly and

28 adversely affected by the Project, which violates provisions of law as set forth in this Petition and would

3
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

cause substantial harm to the natural environment and the quality of life in the surrounding community.

2 The maintenance and prosecution of this action will confer a substantial benefit on the public by

3 protecting the public from the procedural, environmental, and other harms alleged herein.

4 8. Petitioner participated in the administrative proceedings by inter alia submitting written

5 and verbal comments on the Project and the City's violations of CEQA. Petitioner brings this action on

6 behalf of itself, its adversely affected members, and the public at large.

7 9. Petitioner has a direct and beneficial interest in the City's compliance with CEQA and the

8 CEQA Guidelines. Petitioner and its members are interested in making sure that the Project is approved
a in a way that protects the environment and its resources. That interest has been and will continue to be

10 directly and adversely affected by the City's actions challenged herein, which actions violate provisions

11 of law set forth in this Petition, precluded informed public participation, and would cause substantial
12 harm to the environment. Petitioner will suffer concrete, actual, and imminent injury from the City's

13 prejudicial abuse of discretion as well as from implementation of the proposed Project without full

14 CEQA compliance.

15 10. Respondent CITY OF LOS ANGELES is a municipal corporation in whose jurisdiction

16 the Project will be located. The City is the "lead agency" for the Project for purposes of Public

17 Resources Code § 21067, and has principal responsibility for conducting environmental review of the

18 Project and taking other actions necessary to comply with CEQA.

19 11. Respondent CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES serves as the elected

20 governing body of the City of Los Angeles. As the governing body for the City, the City Council was

21 ultimately responsible for reviewing and approving or denying the Project. On June 29, 2022, the City

22 Council voted to approve the Project and the IS/ND under CEQA. The Notice of Determination was

23 filed with the Los Angeles County Clerk's office on June 30, 2022.
24 12. Respondent LOS ANGELES DEPARTMENT OF CITY PLANNING is a local agency

25 of the City. The Los Angeles Department of City Planning reviews project applications, manages the

26 environmental review of projects for the City, and processes entitlements and approvals. The

27 Department of City Planning is listed on the Notice of Determination as the "Lead City Agency."

28 13. Real Party in Interest TRG 9500 W PICO, LLC is a California limited liability

4

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

corporation and is listed on the Notice of Determination as the "Project Applicant."

2 14. Real Party in Interest CRAIG LAWSON & CO., LLC is a California limited liability a

3 corporation and is listed on the Notice of Determination as the "Person or Agency Carrying Out the

4 Project If Other Than Lead Agency." The Craig Lawson & Co., LLC is also listed as the "Entitlements

5 Consultant" in the IS/ND.

6 15. Real Party in Interest JESSICA HENCIER is an individual and is an associate project

7 manager of Craig Lawson & Co., LLC. She is also listed on the Notice of Determination as the "Person

8 or Agency Carrying Out the Project If Other Than Lead Agency."

9 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

10 16. This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this Petition pursuant to Code of

11 Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5, and Public Resources Code sections 21167, 21168 and

12 21168.5.

13 17. Venue is proper in Los Angeles County Superior Court in accordance with Code of Civil

14 Procedure section 395 because the Project at issue is located in the County of Los Angeles.

15 18. Venue is proper in this Court under California Code of Civil Procedure section 394

16 (actions against a city, county, or local agency) and section 395 (actions generally) because Respondents

17 include a city and local agencies based in the County of Los Angeles and because the cause of action

18 alleged in this Petition arose in the County of Los Angeles and the Project will occur within the County

19 of Los Angeles.

20 19. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section 21167.5

21 by serving a written notice on July 29, 2022, of Petitioner's intention to commence this action against

22 Respondents pursuant to CEQA. A copy of the written notice is attached hereto as Exhibit A.

23 20. This action is being filed within 30 days of the posting of the City's Notice of

24 Determination with the Los Angeles County Clerk's office, in accordance with Public Resources Code
25 section 21167(b).

26 21. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section 21167.6

27 by filing a notice of their election to prepare the record of administrative proceedings relating to this

28 action. A copy of the notice is attached hereto as Exhibit B.

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

22. Petitioner will comply with the requirements of Public Resources Code section 21167.7

2 and Code of Civil Procedure section 388 by sending a copy of this Petition and Complaint to the

3 California Attorney General within the required time period.

4 23. Petitioner has performed any and all conditions precedent to filing this instant action and

5 has exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent required by law.

6 24. Petitioner is an interested entity because its members live and work in the vicinity of the

7 Project site and will be directly affected by the Project. Further, Petitioner is interested in ensuring that

8 the Project is approved in a way which protects the environment and its resources for themselves and

9 future generations.

10 25. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law unless

11 this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents set aside the City's actions taken
12 in violation of CEQA, to require Respondents to prepare the legally adequate CEQA document for the

13 Project, and to enjoin the City from approving the Project pending completion of legally adequate

14 CEQA review. In the absence of such remedies, Respondents' decision will remain in violation of state

15 law.

16 FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

17 26. On September 15, 2020, Real Parties in Interest submitted an application to the City for

18 the development and design of the proposed 9500 Pico Mixed-Use Project, Case No. CPC-2020-5837-

19 DB-CU-SPR-VHCA, which consists of the demolition of a car wash, food stand, and office building and
20 the construction of a six-story, 72-foot high mixed-use building consisting of 108 dwelling units and

21 3,250 square feet of commercial space, including a 1,000 square-foot restaurant and 2,250 square feet of

22 retail, on 10 parcels in the City of Los Angeles, on the south side of Pico Boulevard, between Beverly

23 Drive and Reeves Street.

24 27. The City released an initial study and negative declaration that purported to analyze the
25 Project's potential environmental impacts. The IS/ND included many mitigation measures that it labeled

26 as project design features, rather than mitigation measures.

27 28. The City scheduled a Planning Commission hearing for September 9, 2021 to consider

28 the proposed 9500 Pico Mixed-Use Project, Case No. CPC-2020-5837-DB-CU-SPR-VHCA, the

6

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

requested discretionary approvals, and the Initial Study and Negative Declaration, No. ENV-2020-5838-

2 ND, prepared for the Project pursuant to CEQA.

3 29. On August 8, 2021 and September 9, 2021, before the time of the scheduled Planning

4 Commission hearing, Petitioner submitted comments to the Planning Commission regarding the Project

5 (*August 8, 2021 Comment" and "September 9, 2021 Comment," respectively) stating, inter alia, that

6 the IS/ND failed as an informational document, and that there was a fair argument that the Project may

7 have significant adverse air quality, diesel particulate matter, greenhouse gas, hazards and hazardous

8 materials, and energy impacts.

9 30. Petitioner's August 8, 2021 Comment and September 9, 2021 Comment noted that the

10 Project required the City to prepare an Environmental Impact Report, or at least a Mitigated Negative

11 Declaration, to analyze and reduce adverse environmental impacts to a less than significant level.
12 31. Petitioner's September 9, 2021 Comment was accompanied and supported by comments

13 from Certified Industrial Hygienist Francis Offermann, PE, CIH, ("Offermann September 4, 2021

14 Comment"). Industrial Hygienist Offermann's September 4, 2021 expert comments concluded that the

15 Project would expose future residents to significant cancer risks from formaldehyde emissions as a result

16 of off-gassing from the Project's building materials. a Formaldehyde is a known human carcinogen. After

17 reviewing the IS/ND and related Project materials, Mr. Offermann determined that as a result of

18 formaldehyde emissions, future residents of the Project will raise the risk of cancer by an additional 120

19 per one million people, which far exceeds the South Coast Air Quality Management District's
20 ("SCAQMD") CEQA significance threshold for airborne cancer risk of 10 per million. Mr. Offermann

21 also concluded that employees of the Project's future restaurant and retail business will be exposed to
22 formaldehyde levels that will result in an additional 17.7 occurrences per million people, which is 1.77

23 times the SCAQMD threshold of significance. Mr. Offermann's calculations assume all materials are

24 compliant with the California Air Resources Board's formaldehyde airborne toxics control measures.
25 The IS/ND does not analyze or mitigate the Project's impacts on human health as a result of
26 formaldehyde emissions.

27 32. Petitioner's September 9, 2021 Comment also included expert comments from Matt

28 Hagemann, P.G., C.Hg., and Dr. Paul E. Rosenfeld, Ph.D., of the environmental consulting firm

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

Soil/Water/Air Protection Enterprise ("SWAPE"). After reviewing the IS/ND and related documents,

2 SWAPE determined that the IS/ND's analysis and model of the Project's air emissions were based on

3 input parameters that could not be substantiated, or were based on mitigation measures that were not

4 actually included as mitigation measures. As a result of these errors, SWAPE concluded that the

5 Project's air quality emissions and GHG emissions were underestimated. SWAPE prepared an updated

6 air quality emissions model that corrected these errors. When updated, the model demonstrated that the

7 Project would have significant construction-related VOC and NOx emissions. Specifically, SWAPE's
updated analysis demonstrated that the Project would emit 127.15 lbs/day of VOCs, which exceeds the
SCAQMD threshold of significance of 75 lbs/day. Similarly, SWAPE's updated analysis demonstrated

10 that the Project would emit 561.2 lbs/day of NOx, more than five times the SCAQMD threshold of

11 significance of 100 lbs/day.

12 33. As part of its expert comments, SWAPE prepared a Health Risk Assessment ("HRA") to

13 determine how Project-related emissions would impact human health. SWAPE's HRA concluded that,

14 as a result of Project-related diesel particulate matter, the Project would result in an excess cancer risk of

15 47.8 per million for infants and 14.8 per million for children. In addition, the excess lifetime cancer risk

16 over the course of the Project's operation of 30 years is 69.9 per million.

17 34. Petitioner's September 9, 2021 Comment also raised concerns about the existing soil
18 contamination at the Project site. The site is currently under Los Angeles Regional Water Quality

19 Control Board ("LARWQCB") oversight due to previous soil contamination issues. The Project Site was

20 most recently occupied by Century West Car Wash for commercial use. According to the IS/ND, the car

21 wash property was identified as an underground storage tank (UST), leaking UST (LUST), Enforcement

22 Action Listing (ENF), Historic Hazardous Waste & Substances Site (Hist Cortese), Facility and

23 Manifest Data (HAZNET), and EDR Historic Auto Station site in the regulatory database report.

24 35. In response to the identification of contaminated soils on the Project site, a total of 64,759

25 pounds of total petroleum hydrocarbons were removed using soil vapor extraction (SVE) system from

26 April 2001 to March 2004. The LARWQCB issued a "No Further Action" letter for soil remediation on

27 September 17, 2008. However, in its review of the Project at issue, the LARWQCB clarified that its

28 2008 No Further Action letter was based on the 2008 commercial land uses and soil conditions, and it

8
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

"does not apply to the [Project's] proposed development." The LARWQCB explained in a March 5, a

2 2021 correspondence to the City that "[b]enzene and other petroleum hydrocarbon concentrations in soil

3 and groundwater" at the Project site "could pose a risk of vapor intrusion into on-site buildings." In

4 addition, the IS/ND admits that "concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons in soil remaining at 25 feet

5 bgs slightly exceed the human health screening levels for dermal contact, inhalation, and ingestion at

6 residential properties." (IS/ND, p. 58.) As a result of the existing contamination, the LARWQCB has

7 asserted that, for a residential use, like that proposed by the Project, "a soil vapor assessment needs to be

8 completed at the [Project Site] to determine the risk of vapor intrusion into the proposed future building
at the Site" and "[Century West Car Wash] is required to submit a soil vapor assessment work plan for

10 the installation of soil vapor probes and collection of soil vapor samples at the Site."

11 36. In addition, the IS/ND does not include an adequate description of the Project's site's

12 baseline soil vapor conditions. Instead, the IS/ND states that soil gas sampling is planned to be
13 completed after site excavation to determine baseline conditions.

14 37. Petitioner's September 9, 2021 Comment noted that the required action by the

15 LARWQCB is substantial evidence of a fair argument that the Project involves significant risks to

16 public health and the environment from soil contamination that the IS/ND failed to adequately disclose,

17 analyze, or mitigate.

18 38. Petitioner's September 9, 2021 Comment also noted that the IS/ND imposed several

19 mitigation measures for soil contamination that are improperly treated as project design elements or

20 features, including:

21 The proposed building is planned to be constructed with an active depressurization system beneath the foundation due to elevated methane gas and a subterranean ventilated parking
22 structure. Based on these vapor control systems, the exposure route of possible vapor intrusion
from off-gassing contaminated soil or groundwater, if any, has been eliminated.
23

24 the subterranean parking structure will be constructed with a ventilation system that will include exhaust fans as well as fresh air intake fans designed to protect occupants from
25 inhalation of vehicle exhaust. In accordance with the LADBS requirements, the ventilation
system will ensure at least four air exchange rates per hour for the lowest level of the parking
26 structure.

27 39. Based on this information, Petitioner's September 9, 2021 Comment concluded that the

28 IS/ND (1) failed to adequately analyze soil contamination impacts, (2) improperly characterized

9
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

mitigation measures as project design features thereby avoiding preparation of an MND at minimum,

2 and (3) failed to disclose baseline conditions and improperly deferred mitigation measures to address

3 impacts.

4 40. In addition, Petitioner's September 9, 2021 Comment noted that the IS/ND failed to

5 demonstrate that the Project would not cause wasteful, inefficient, or unnecessary consumption of

6 natural gas, and noted that the City was required to analyze the feasibility of using renewable energy.

7 Instead, the IS/ND improperly relied on the fact that the Project would be within the gas provider's

8 capacity, and that the Project would comply with Title 24 and the Los Angeles Green Building Code, as
sufficient analysis of energy impacts.

10 41. On September 9, 2021, the Los Angeles City Planning Commission approved the Project,

11 adopted the IS/ND, and made related findings.

12 42. On October 5, 2021, the Planning Commission filed a Letter of Determination officially

13 confirming that all these actions were approved and adopted.

14 43. On October 7, 2021, Petitioner appealed the Planning Commission's decision.
15 44. An appeal hearing before the Los Angeles City Council Planning and Land Use

16 Management (*PLUM") Committee was scheduled for June 21, 2022.

17 45. On February 10, 2022, Real Parties in Interest provided responses to Petitioner's August

18 8. 2021 and September 9, 2021 comments ("February 10, 2022 Response to Comments").

19 46. On June 21, 2022, prior to the PLUM Committee appeal hearing, Petitioner submitted
20 additional comments to the City that addressed the Real Parties' February 10, 2022 Response to

21 Comments. These comments were supported by additional expert comments of Mr. Offermann and

22 SWAPE.

23 47. On June 21, 2022, the PLUM Committee denied Petitioner's appeal of the Planning
24 Commission's Project approvals and CEQA determination.

25 48. On July 29, 2022, the Los Angeles City Council approved the Project, adopted the

26 IS/ND, and made related findings and approvals

27 49. On July 30, 2022, the City filed a Notice of Determination with the Los Angeles County

28 Clerk.

LEGAL BACKGROUND

2 The California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA")

50. CEQA is an integral part of every public agency's decision-making process. (Pub. Res.

4 Code § 21006.) CEQA was enacted to protect the environment by the establishment of administrative

5 procedures to ensure that long-term protection of the environment shall be the guiding criterion in public

6 decisions.

7 51. The purpose of an EIR is to provide public agencies and the public with "detailed

8 information" about the likely significant environmental effect of a proposed project and ways in which

9 the significant effects might be minimized. (Pub. Res. Code § 21061; see § 21002.1, subd. (a).) An EIR

10 serves not only to protect the environment but also to demonstrate to an apprehensive public that it is

11 being protected. (CEQA Guideline § 15003, subd. (b).)

12 52. All public agencies must prepare, or cause to be prepared, and certify the completion of

13 an EIR on any project which they propose to carry out that may have significant effect on the
14 environment. (Pub. Res. Code §§ 21100(a), 21151(a).) A significant effect is a "potentially substantial,

15 adverse change." (Pub. Res. Code § 21068.) This means that an activity has a significant effect if it "has

16 the potential to degrade the quality of the environment." (Pub. Res. Code § 21083; 14 CCR § 15065.)
17 53. An EIR must be prepared where "there is substantial evidence, in light of the whole

18 record before the agency, that the project may have a significant effect on the environment." (Pub. Res.

19 Code § 21080(d).) If there is substantial evidence supporting a "fair argument" that a project a "may"
20 have a significant environmental effect, the agency "shall" prepare an EIR. (CEQA Guideline

21 15064(a)(1).) The fair argument standard provides a "low threshold" for requiring the preparation of an

22 EIR, with a preference for resolving doubts in favor of an EIR.

23 54. "Substantial evidence" is "enough relevant information and reasonable inferences from

24 this information that a fair argument can be made to support a conclusion, even though other

25 conclusions might also be reached." (CEQA Guideline § 15384(a).) Substantial evidence includes fact, a

26 reasonable assumption predicated upon fact, or expert opinion supported by fact. (Pub. Res. Code §
27 21080(e)(1).) Where some experts conclude there may be a potentially adverse impact, and other experts

28 disagree, an EIR must still be prepared. (CEQA Guidelines § 15064, subd. (g).)

11
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

55. All phases of project planning, implementation, and operation must be considered in an

2 Initial Study. (CEQA § Guideline § 15063(a)(1).)

3 56. To identify potentially significant adverse environmental effects of a project, an initial

4 study must delineate environmental conditions prevailing absent the project, defining baseline of

5 existing physical conditions in the affected area.

6 57. A mitigation monitoring plan must be adopted by the lead agency when an initial study
7 identifies potentially significant effects, but revisions in the project which would avoid such effects are

8 adopted before the negative declaration and initial study are released for public review. (Pub. Res. Code

9 § 21081.6.)

10 58. Mitigation measures may not be construed as project design elements or features in an

11 environmental document under CEQA if such a mischaracterization is significant. (Lotus V. Department
12 of Transportation (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 645.) A "mitigation measure" is a measure designed to

13 minimize a project's significant environmental impacts, (Pub. Res. Code 21002.1(a)), while a

14 "project" is defined as including "the whole of an action, which has a potential for resulting in either a

15 direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the

16 environment.' (CEQA Guidelines 15378(a).) Unlike mitigation measures, project elements are

17 considered prior to making a significance determination. Measures are not technically "mitigation"

18 under CEQA unless they are incorporated to avoid or minimize "significant" impacts. (Pub. Res. Code
19 21100(b)(3).)

20 59. To ensure that a project's potential environmental impacts are fully analyzed and

21 disclosed, and that the adequacy of proposed mitigation measures is considered in depth, mitigation

22 measures a that are not included in a project's design are not to be treated as part of the project

23 description. (Lotus, 223 Cal.App.4th at 654 -55, 656 fn.8.) Mischaracterization of a mitigation measure

24 as a project design element or feature is "significant," and therefore amounts to a material error, when

25 "it precludes or obfuscates required disclosure of the project's environmental impacts and analysis of

26 potential mitigation measures." (Mission Bay Alliance v. Office of Community Investment &
27 Infrastructure (2016) 6 Cal.App.5th 160, 185.)

28 60. Where an initial study shows that the project may have a significant effect on the

12
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

environment, a mitigated negative declaration may be appropriate. However, a mitigated negative

2 declaration is proper only if the project revisions would avoid or mitigate the potentially significant

3 effects identified in the initial study "to a point where clearly no significant effect on the environment

4 would occur, and…there is no substantial evidence in light of the whole record before the public agency

5 that the project, as revised, may have a significant effect on the environment." (Pub. Res. Code §§

6 21064.5; 21080(c)(2); Mejia v. City of Los Angeles (2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 322, 331.) In that context,

7 "may" means a reasonable possibility of a significant effect on the environment. (Pub. Res. Code §§

8 21082.2(a), 21100, 21151(a); Pocket Protectors v. City of Sacramento (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 903, 927;

9 League for Protection of Oakland's etc. Historic Res. v. City of Oakland (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 896,

10 904-05.) Otherwise, an agency must prepare an EIR. (14 CCR § 15064(f)(1); Pocket Protectors, 124

11 Cal.App.4th at 931; Stanislaus Audubon Society v. County of Stanislaus (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 144,

12 150-51; Quail Botanical Gardens Found., Inc. V. City of Encinitas (1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 1597, 1602.)

13 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

14 Violation of CEQA - Failure to Prepare an Environmental Impact Report or
15 Mitigated Negative Declaration

16 (Public Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.)

17 (Code of Civil Procedure § 1085 or in the alternative §1094.5)
61. Petitioner hereby realleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs, in
18 their entirety, as if fully set forth herein.
19 62. Respondents failed to comply with CEQA by failing to prepare an EIR for the Project
20 despite substantial evidence in the record of a fair argument that the Project may have one or more
21 significant environmental impacts, including, but not limited to, the following:
22 a. There is a fair argument that the Project may have significant impacts on indoor air
23 quality due to the use of composite wood products that off-gas carcinogenic
24 formaldehyde. Substantial evidence demonstrates that future residents of the Project and
25 future workers at the restaurant and retail spaces may be exposed to significant adverse
26 indoor air quality impacts.
27 b. There is a fair argument that the cumulative cancer risk posed by formaldehyde used in
28 the Project together with additional nearby cancer risks may be significant. Substantial

13
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

2 evidence demonstrates that future residents of the Project and future workers at the

au p w restaurant and retail spaces may be exposed to a significant cumulative cancer risk.
c. There is a fair argument that the Project may have significant impacts on air pollution
because the City underestimated air pollution from the Project. Substantial evidence
demonstrates that the Project may cause significant adverse air quality effects.

7 d. The City's conclusion that the Project's construction and operation will not have a

8 significant health risk impact on adjacent residents and children is not supported by

9 substantial evidence and a fair argument exists that the health risks from the Project's
construction and operation may be significant.

10 e.

11 The City's conclusion that the Project will not have a cumulative health risk impact is not

12 supported by substantial evidence and a fair argument exists that the Project will result in
cumulative health risks.

13

14 f. The City's conclusion that the Project will not have a significant impact on GHG

15 emissions is not supported by substantial evidence and a fair argument exists that the

16 Project may have significant GHG emission impacts.

g.

17 The City's conclusion that the Project will not have a significant a cumulative impact on

18 GHG emissions is not supported by substantial evidence and a fair argument exists that

19 63. the Project may have a significant cumulative impact on GHG emissions.

20 The City further violated CEQA in the following ways:

a.

21 The IS/ND fails to disclose the Project's baseline conditions for soil vapor at the Project

22 site in violation of CEQA. Respondents abused their discretion and failed to act in a

23 manner required by law by approving the Project without a CEQA analysis containing a
proper baseline within the meaning of CEQA.

24 b.

25 The IS/ND improperly classifies mitigation measures as project design features.

C.

26 Respondents approved the Project while improperly deferring formulation and selection

27 of mitigation measures to reduce potentially significant impacts to a future time after

28 64. Project approval, and outside of public scrutiny, in violation of CEQA.
Because a fair argument exists that the Project may have one or more significant

14
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

environmental impacts, the City must prepare an EIR for the Project to analyze all environmental

2 impacts and to propose all feasible mitigation measures and alternatives to reduce those impacts.

3 65. Alternatively, Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by adopting an IS/ND,

4 the environmental impact analysis for which is not supported by substantial evidence.

5

6 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

7 Violation of CEQA - Failure to Adopt a Mitigation Monitoring Plan for All Revisions to Mitigate
Project Impacts
8 (Public Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.)
9 (Code of Civil Procedure § 1085 or in the alternative §1094.5)

10 66. Petitioner hereby realleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs, in

11 their entirety, as if fully set forth herein.

12 67. CEQA required adoption of a mitigation monitoring plan where the Initial Study

13 identifies potentially significant effects, but revisions in the project are adopted to avoid or minimize

14 such effects before the Initial Study and Negative Declaration are released for public review. (Pub. Res.

15 Code § 21081.6.)

16 68. The IS/ND includes Project mitigation measures that are intended to reduce air quality

17 impacts, greenhouse gas emissions, and soil contamination impacts.

18 69. The IS/ND improperly labeled each of these mitigation measures as project design

19 elements or features.

20 70. The City did not adopt a mitigation monitoring plan for the changes made to the Project

21 or conditions of Project approval to mitigate or avoid significant environmental effects.

22 71. By proceeding without a mitigation monitoring plan, the City violated CEQA and

23 prejudicially abused its discretion.

24

25 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

26 WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests the following relief and entry of judgment as

27 follows:

28

15
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

1. For peremptory writ of mandate directing Respondents to set aside the approval of the

2 Project, Case No. CPC-2020-5837-DB-CU-SPR-VHCA, including the requested discretionary

3 approvals, and certification of the IS/ND, No. ENV-2020-5838-ND, and its related findings, unless and

4 until Respondents have prepared, circulated, and considered a legally adequate EIR prior to any

5 subsequent approval action;

6 2. For a peremptory writ of mandate directing Respondents and Real Parties in Interest to

7 suspend all activities in furtherance of the Project unless and until Respondents take all necessary steps

8 to bring their actions into compliance with CEQA.

9 3. For a preliminary and permanent injunction staying the effect of Respondents' approval

10 of the Project.

11 4. For a declaratory judgment declaring Respondent's approval of the Project to be null and

12 void and contrary to law;

13 5. For an award of Petitioner's attorneys' fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §
14 1021.5, and any other applicable authority;

15 6. For an award of costs of suit; and

RE: Notice of Intent to File Suit Under the California Environmental Quality Act
Regarding the 9500 Pico Project (Case No. CPC-2020-5837-DB-CU-SPR-
VHCA; ENV-2020-5838-ND)

Dear Mayor Garcetti, Honorable Members of the City Council, Clerk Wolcott, Mr.
Bertoni, Ms. Pacheco, and Mr. Song:

Please take notice, pursuant to Public Resources Code ("PRC") § 21167.5, that Supporters Alliance for Environmental Responsibility ("SAFER") intends to file a Verified Petition for Peremptory Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief ("Petition") in Los Angeles Superior Court under the provisions of the California

Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code § 21000 et seq., against
the City of Los Angeles, the City Council of the City of Los Angeles, and the Los
Angeles Department of City Planning (collectively "City") and against Real Parties in Interest TRG 9500 W PICO, LLC and Craig Lawson & Co., LLC, challenging the June
30, 2022 decision of the City to (1) approve a Site Plan Review and related entitlements under CPC-2020-5837-DB-CU-SPR-VHCA for the construction of a six-story a mixed-use
building with 108 residential units above approximately 3,250 square feet of ground floor commercial space and 134 vehicle parking spaces provided within two subterranean levels and a portion of the ground floor, located at 9500-9530 West Pico Boulevard
("Project"); and (2) adopt the Negative Declaration ENV-2020-5838-ND for the Project. The Petition will argue that an environmental impact report ("EIR") was required for the Project because there is a fair argument that the Project may have significant
unmitigated adverse environmental impacts.
Sincerely,
