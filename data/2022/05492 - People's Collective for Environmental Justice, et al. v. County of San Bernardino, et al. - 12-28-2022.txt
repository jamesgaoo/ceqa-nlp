F INTRODUCTION

2 1.

3 On November 15, 2022, the Board of Supervisors for the County of San Bernardino

4 approved the Bloomington Business Park Specific Plan Project ("Project"). The Project rezones 213

5 acres near three schools and other sensitive sites in low-income communities and communities of

6 color to construct and operate large warehouses and other development the size of roughly 56

7 football fields. The Project also rezones 24 acres to increase their residential development capacity

8 with the goal of offsetting the housing capacity that is lost from constructing the warehouses. On the

9 day of the hearing, the County also certified a final environmental impact report ("Final EIR") that

10 purports but fails to analyze the widespread impacts of the Project's construction and operation.

2.

11 The Project would be one of many major warehouse and distribution centers in

12 Bloomington, California. If the Project is constructed and operated as planned, residents of

13 Bloomington and its surrounding areas will continue to see a future dominated by large-scale

14 warehouse developments, increased truck shipments and traffic, and even worse air quality than they

15 already experience. Given the scope and significant impacts of the Project, it is critical that the

16 County complies with the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA")

17 before moving forward with a project of this a scale. To date, the County has failed to do so.

3.

18 The County's CEQA process for the Project consistently prevented many of
Bloomington's residents who are most affected by warehouse development from participating
19 meaningfully. In particular, the County failed to provide Spanish-language versions of the executive

20

21 summaries of the Draft and Final EIRs and to make certain hearings available in Spanish even

22 though a substantial portion of Bloomington's residents only speak or primarily speak Spanish.

23 Warehouse development is already overwhelmingly located in proximity to predominantly Hispanic
or Latino communities, and the Project will increase the harm to these already overburdened

24 I communities.

25 4.

26 Several organizations and individuals expressed deep concerns about the Project and

27 the associated environmental review conducted by the County throughout the County's decision-

28 making process. As noted in the comments submitted by these individuals and entities, as well as
others, there are myriad concerns stemming from the Project's environmental, displacement, and

3
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
CASE NO.

- public health impacts. The Project will substantially add to the existing presence of ozone, ozone

2 precursors, and other contaminants, such as carcinogenic diesel particulate matter ("DPM"), in an air

3 basin that already suffers from some of the worst air quality in the nation. This additional air

4 pollution will only exacerbate the serious direct health impacts already experienced by nearby

5 residents. In addition, the Project will contribute significant levels of greenhouse gas ("GHG")

6 emissions that will add to, rather than reduce, climate change impacts. As a result, the Project a

7 directly conflicts with existing State GHG reduction goals. The Project will also impose severe and

8 detrimental impacts on a variety of imperiled species, habitats, and other biological resources. Yet,

9 the Project's environmental review document and the County's environmental review process have

10 failed to adequately address these impacts.

11 5. These concerns were also echoed by the California Air Resources Board ("ARB"),

12 which noted that the Project would expose nearby communities to elevated levels of air pollution

13 beyond the existing baseline emissions at the Project site. ARB emphasized that the Project site is

14 surrounded by residences and schools that are already exposed to toxic DPM emissions generated by

15 existing industrial buildings, vehicle traffic along Interstate 10, and rail traffic along existing Union

16 Pacific rail lines and rail yards.

17 6. The County has failed to require re-circulation of the Final EIR in light of critical

18 information that must be analyzed in the document, and for which the Public must be allowed the

19 opportunity to provide comments. These and many additional fatal flaws in the Final EIR's analyses

20 have led Bloomington residents and other individuals, community groups, and entities to become

21 deeply concerned by the County's decision to approve this Project.

22 7. The Project also requires residential displacement from the Project site. The Project

23 does not allow for any residential uses. The Project requires the elimination of housing stock, and the

24 change in allowable use from residential to industrial will impact existing homeowners' future

25 ability to use, modify, finance, or sell their homes. The Project does not include any plans to replace

26 these homes.

27 8. The County's approval of the Project violates the County's duty to affirmatively

28 further fair housing and the Fair Employment and Housing Act by siting the Project in a Hispanic or

4
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
CASE NO.

- Latino community and a community already experiencing negative health impacts due to air quality

2 causing displacement of residents and compounding environmental harm to those who remain. The

3 County has also failed to follow Housing Crisis Act requirements to identify and replace protected

4 residential units in the Project footprint.

5 9. For all these reasons, this Court should direct the Board of Supervisors to set aside its

6 approval of the Project, certification of the Final EIR, and adoption of related findings and Statement

7 of Overriding Considerations; direct the County to publish any future notices and the executive

8 summaries of any future EIRs, in Spanish as well as in English; direct the County to evaluate and
9 appropriately mitigate any loss of protected units as defined under the Housing Crisis Act; and grant

10 injunctive and declaratory relief finding that the County's approval of the Project is materially

11 inconsistent with its obligation to affirmatively further fair housing and is discriminatory on the basis

12 of national origin and other protected characteristics.

13 PARTIES

14 10. Petitioner PEOPLE'S COLLECTIVE FOR ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE (*PCEJ")

15 1S an unincorporated nonprofit association dedicated to building community power in the Inland

16 Empire to fight against pollution and environmental racism. Founded in 2020, PCEJ represents over

17 1,000 community members in the Inland Empire who are impacted by the freight and logistics

18 industry. PCEJ's purpose is rooted in historical struggle, to advance collective resistance and power;

19 to support and fight against pollution, exploitation, and existential threats to lifeultimately to build

20 for the health, well-being, and self-reliance of the Inland Empire in a way that uproots white

21 supremacy and the reigning hegemonic extractive systems. PCEJ's members are concerned that the

22 Project will adversely affect their health and the health of their community, cause displacement, and

23 cause other adverse environmental and housing impacts. PCEJ submitted comments concerning the

24 EIR for the Project, as well overall comments on the Project's fair housing and residential

25 displacement impacts. PCEJ has diverted its limited resources to address the Project. PCEJ's mission

26 to fight against pollution and environmental racism and build for the health, well-being, and self-

27 reliance of the Inland Empire is frustrated by the County's approval of the Project. PCEJ will have to

28

5
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
CASE NO.

- divert additional resources and experience greater frustration of its mission if the Project proceeds as

2 approved.

3 11. Petitioner CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION AND ENVIRONMENTAL

4 JUSTICE ("CCAEJ"') is a membership-based California nonprofit environmental health and justice

5 organization with its membership in and around San Bernardino County. CCAEJ's mission is to

6 bring people together to improve their social and natural environment, and to build community

7 power in order to create safer, healthier, toxic-free places to live, work, learn and play in and around

8 the counties of San Bernardino and Riverside. CCAEJ has its physical offices in Jurupa Valley and

9 organizes to build leadership for community action in Jurupa Valley, Mira Loma, Riverside, the

10 unincorporated areas in San Bernardino County, as well as other cities throughout the counties of

11 San Bernardino and Riverside. CCAEJ has identified the unincorporated area of Bloomington in San

12 Bernardino County as a "community at risk" for various environmental injustices, including bearing

13 a disproportionate share of the impacts from high polluting industries, heavy-duty diesel truck, and

14 other mobile source emissions, and suffering other disparities created by zoning and irresponsible

15 land use planning. Accordingly, CCAEJ filed extensive comments that are part of the administrative

16 record for the County's approval of the Project and Final EIR. CCAEJ's members are extremely

17 concerned that the Project will detrimentally impact their health and well-being, and the health and

18 well-being of their children, their community, and the environment, and that it will detrimentally

19 impact the area's surrounding resources. Most of CCAEJ's members who reside in and around the
20 unincorporated area of Bloomington in San Bernardino County and around the proposed site for the

21 Project already suffer a disproportionate burden from existing stationary and mobile sources of

22 pollution, including significant air pollution from, inter alia, the movement of goods throughout the

23 region to existing warehouses and other storage and distribution centers. CCAEJ's mission to create

24 safer, healthier, toxic-free places to live, work, learn and play in and around the counties of San

25 Bernardino and Riverside is frustrated by the County's approval of the Project. CCAEJ will have to

26 divert additional resources and experience greater frustration of its mission if the Project proceeds as

27 approved.

H 12.

2 Petitioner CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY (the "Center") is a nonprofit

3 corporation with offices in Oakland and elsewhere throughout the United States. The Center is

4 actively involved in environmental protection issues throughout California and North America and

5 has over 86,000 members, including many throughout California and in San Bernardino County. The

6 Center's mission includes protecting and restoring habitat and populations of imperiled species,

7 reducing GHG pollution to preserve a safe climate, and protecting air quality, water quality, and

8 public health. The Center's members and staff include individuals who regularly use and intend to

9 continue to use the areas in San Bernardino County and elsewhere affected by the Project, including

10 numerous members who are particularly interested in protecting the native, endangered, imperiled,

11 and sensitive species and habitats found in the area that will be detrimentally impacted by the

12 construction and operation of the Project. As such, the Center submitted comments to the County,

13 which are now part of the administrative record of the County's decision to approve the Project and

14 its Final EIR. The Center's mission to protect and restore habitat and populations of imperiled

15 species, reduce GHG pollution a to preserve a safe climate, and protect air quality, water quality, and

16 public health is frustrated by the County's approval of the Project. The Center will have to divert

17 additional resources and experience greate frustration of its mission if the Project proceeds as

approved.

18 13.

19 Petitioner SIERRA CLUB is a national nonprofit organization of approximately one

20 million members. Sierra Club is dedicated to exploring, enjoying, and protecting the wild places of

21 the earth; to practicing and promoting the responsible use of the earth's ecosystems and resources; to
educating and encouraging humanity to protect and restore the quality of the natural and human
22 environment; and to using all lawful means to carry out these objectives. Sierra Club's particular

23

24 interest in this case and the issues that this Project approval concerns stem from the Sierra Club's

25 local San Gorgonio Chapter's interest in preserving the native, endangered, imperiled, and sensitive

26 species and wildlife habitats in the region; decreasing rather than increasing heavy-duty and

27 medium-duty truck traffic in an already highly overburdened air basin; and ensuring that good,

28 livable and healthy jobs are brought to the area. The members of the San Gorgonio Chapter live,
work, and recreate in and around the areas that will be directly affected by the construction and

7

CASE NO.

- operation of the Project. Sierra Club submitted extensive comments to the County throughout its

2 environmental review process for the Project that are part of the County's record of its decision to

3 approve the Project and its Final EIR. Sierra Club's mission to explore, enjoy, and protect the wild

4 places of the earth; to practice and promote the responsible use of the earth's ecosystems and

5 resources; to educate and encourage humanity to protect and restore the quality of the natural and

6 human environment; and to use all lawful means to carry out these objectives is frustrated by the

7 County's approval of the Project. Sierra Club will have to divert additional resources and experience

8 greater frustration of its mission if the Project proceeds as approved.

9 14. Petitioners are collectively referred to herein as "Bloomington Petitioners."

10 15. Respondent COUNTY OF SAN BERNARDINO (the "County"), a political

11 subdivision of the State of California, is responsible for regulating and controlling land use in the
12 unincorporated territory of San Bernardino County, including, but not limited to, implementing and

13 complying with the provisions of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines. The County is the "lead agency"

14 for purposes of Public Resources Code § 21067, with principal responsibility for conducting

15 environmental review and approving the Project.

16 16. As referred herein, "the County" refers to all boards, departments, and commissions,

17 including the Board of Supervisors, Land Use Services Department, and Planning Commission.

18 17. Bloomington Petitioners do not know the true names and capacities, whether

19 individual, corporate, associate, or otherwise, of Respondents DOE 1 through DOE 20, inclusive,

20 and therefore sue said Respondents under fictitious names. Bloomington Petitioners will amend this

21 Petition to show their true names and capacities when they are known.

22 18. Bloomington Petitioners are further informed and, on that basis, believe that TIM

23 HOWARD is a Real a Party in Interest insofar as he is listed as an owner and developer of the

24 property subject to the County's actions pursuant to its Project approvals and Project related actions.

25 The County's November 15, 2022 Notice of Determination for the Project lists Tim Howard as the

26 "Project Applicant."

27 19. Bloomington Petitioners are further informed and, on that basis, believe that
28 HOWARD INDUSTRIAL PARTNERS LLC ("Howard Industrial"), a California limited liability

8
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
CASE NO.

- company, is a Real Party in Interest insofar as it is listed as an owner and developer of the property

2 subject to the County's actions pursuant to its Project approvals and Project related actions. The

3 County's November 15, 2022 Notice of Determination for the Project lists Howard Industrial as the

4 "Project Applicant."

5 20. Bloomington Petitioners do not know the true names and capacities, whether

6 individual, corporate, associate or otherwise, of Real Parties in Interest DOE 21 through DOE 40,

7 inclusive, and therefore sue said Real Parties under fictitious names. Bloomington Petitioners will

8 amend this Petition to show their true names and capacities when they are known.

9 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

10 21. Venue is proper in the Superior Court of California, County of San Bernardino under

11 Code of Civil Procedure § 395 because the County and the Project are currently located, or will be

12 located, in San Bernardino County.

STATEMENT OF FACTS

18 Community and Environmental Setting

19 29.

20 Bloomington is an unincorporated, census-designated place in San Bernardino
County, California.

21 30. According to census data from 2020, approximately 24,339 people reside in
22 Bloomington.' Bloomington residents are 85.6 percent Hispanic or Latino, and 67.8 percent of

23

24 residents speak a language other than English at home.- An estimated 14.1 percent of the population

25 earns income below the federal poverty level.3 A summary of community input from Bloomington

26 residents in connection with preparation of the County's Sixth Cycle Housing Element reveals

- residents experience housing discrimination based on national origin and immigration status.4 The

2 report also notes that linguistic isolation of persons who are limited English proficient contributes to

3 fair housing issues in the region and is a barrier to public participation in proposed development

4 projects and cites data showing the average linguistic isolation percentile of Bloomington is over 50

5 percent.»

6 31. There is a shortage of housing affordable to low-income, very low-income, and

7 extremely low-income households in San Bernardino County, particularly in high-opportunity

8 neighborhoods and cities.

9 32. Public input to the County's Sixth Cycle Housing Element included acknowledgment

10 that the community of Bloomington indicated a desire for amenities and housing opportunities, with

11 housing stock, housing affordability, and air quality being cited as among the areas with the greatest

12 needs.

13 33. Bloomington is surrounded by the City of Fontana to the west and northwest, the City

14 of Rialto to the east and northeast, and the City of Jurupa Valley in Riverside County to the south.

15 Bloomington is located along Interstate 10, a commonly used truck route between Bloomington and

16 the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach located about 70 miles away.

17 34. Notably, much of Bloomington's recent development has been geared towards

18 receiving goods from the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach for storage, sale, and distribution.

19 Bloomington has experienced worsening air quality as a result of increased diesel pollution from

20 trucks used to transport goods into the region's growing warehouse and other storage and

21 distribution facilities. Due to this influx of industrial projects over the past several years,
22 Bloomington has become known as a "diesel death zone."6

2 CalEnviroScreen,' the California Environmental Protection Agency's health

3 screening tool, identifies the Project area in Bloomington as having an overall pollution burden that

4 is heavier than 94 percent of the state. Indeed, Bloomington has some of the State's worst

5 concentrations of ozone, particulate matter ("PM") and DPM, and traffic density. Residents in the

6 Project area are exposed to more particles with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or smaller (*PM2.5")

7 than 91 percent of census tracts in California, more DPM than 80 percent of census tracts, and more
traffic than 83 percent of census tracts.

8 36. Bloomington is located within the jurisdiction of the South Coast Air Quality
9| Management District ("SCAQMD") the regional air pollution control agency with authority to

10

11 regulate the "critical air pollution problems" throughout the South Coast Air Basin ("South Coast"),

12 which includes all of Orange County and the non-desert portions of Los Angeles, Riverside and San
Bernardino counties. (Health & Safety Code § 40402(b).)

13 37.

14 SCAQMD is specifically responsible for clean air planning in and throughout the

15 South Coast, pursuant to the Clean Air Act. The air quality planning SCAQMD conducts is critical

16 to meeting national air pollution control standards set forth under the Clean Air Act, including

17 National Ambient Air Quality Standards aimed at reducing the presence of contaminants of concern

18 that severely impact public health and the environment, and which contribute to climate change.

19 These contaminants include but are not limited to nitrogen oxide ('NOx") and PM, which produce

20 soot, ground-level ozone (or "smog"), and ozone precursors that are highly prevalent throughout the
South Coast, and specifically in Bloomington.

21 38.

22 The South Coast experiences complex and significant air quality issues caused by an

23 extremely high concentration of various industrial activities and on-road vehicle traffic, including

24 diesel emissions from heavy-duty truck traffic. As a result, the a South Coast exceeds federal public

25 health standards for PM and both ozone and ozone precursors, resulting in its residents suffering

26 from some of the worst air pollution in the nation. For example, exposure to PM2.5-which comes

27 primarily from combustion activities (71 Fed. Reg. 61,144, 61,146 (Oct. 17, 2006)) can cause

28 California Environmental Protection Agency, CalEnviroScreen 4.0 (last updated Oct. 20, 2021), available at https://oehha.ca.gov/calenviroscreen/report/calenviroscreen-40.

CASE NO.

- aggravation of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, lung disease, asthma attacks, heart attacks,

2 and premature death. (See 70 Fed. Reg. 65,984, 65,988 and 65,991 (Nov. 1, 2005).) Individuals with

3 heart and lung disease, the elderly, and children are most sensitive to PM2.s exposure. (Id. at 65988.)

4 39. ARB is the state agency charged with monitoring the regulatory activity of

5 California's 35 local air districts, including SCAQMD. ARB has determined that diesel exhaust is

6 responsible for over 70 percent of the health risks associated with air pollution statewide. SCAQMD

7 has determined that DPM accounts for over 68 percent of the health risks associated with breathing

8 air in and around the South Coast.

9 40. Consistent and continued exposure to DPM is, therefore, a serious concern for South

10 Coast communities, particularly those residing along heavy-duty truck thoroughfares like Interstate

11 10. Residents who live along these and other thoroughfares experience some of the region's most

12 concentrated vehicle traffic and breathe some of its most polluted air. Most of these residents also

13 lack the financial means to address the health problems caused by these exposures. Children, who

14 are among the most vulnerable residents, are not only subject to these avoidable health impacts, but

15 they also experience some of the highest rates of school absences, which means lost workdays for

16 parents and caregivers, all of which only further impacts families and these communities.

17 41. In addition to the region's grave DPM, ozone, and other PM emission concentrations,

18 the South Coast and the western portion of San Bernardino and Riverside counties, like the rest of

19 the state, are experiencing increased impacts from climate change, including decreasing water supply

20 and rainfall as well as increasing temperatures, which often exacerbate air pollution concentrations.

21 42. GHG emissions contribute to local, regional, and global climate change impacts and,

22 as such, they have been the subject of increased statewide regulatory efforts. ARB, SCAQMD, and

23 the Governor's office have all adopted rigorous goals and standards to decrease the state's GHG

24

25

26

27

13
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
CASE NO.

- emissions and impacts from climate change. Some of these targets have been codified into state law,

2 and others have been declared by executive order or agency action.8

3 43. The crux of many of the State's most recent efforts has been to actively limit GHG

4 emissions as government agencies have recognized that a pure "business as usual" approach will

5 only exacerbate and accelerate the impacts of climate change rather than help to reduce and slow its

6 negative consequences.' In setting forth its GHG reduction efforts, the State has emphasized the

7 importance of local agency involvement and local agency commitments to reducing GHG emissions

8 through their policy and planning processes. Continued coordination between State, regional and

9 local entities is instrumental to ensuring the efficacy of the State's policies and to enabling the State

10 to reach its reduction targets.

11 II. The Project and Its Environmental Impacts

12 44. The Project includes approval of the Bloomington Business Park Specific Plan

13 ("Specific Plan"); a policy plan amendment; zoning amendments; site plan approvals; conditional

14 use permits; vesting tentative parcel a maps; and a community facilities district.

15 45. The Specific Plan is a land-use guiding document whose stated goal is to accomplish

16 the orderly development of a 213-acre industrial business park for around 3,235,836 square feet of

17 industrial uses. This entails rezoning the 213 acres from residential to non-residential in order to

18 construct a 383,000-square foot warehouse building, a 1.25 million-square foot warehouse, a

19 479,000-square foot warehouse, and a truck/trailer parking lot.

20 46. The Specific Plan Site is generally bounded by Santa Ana Avenue to the north, Maple

21 Avenue and Linden Avenue to the east, Jurupa Avenue to the south, and Alder Avenue to the west,

22 in the southern area of Bloomington.

23

24

25 See e.g., Health and Safety Code § 38500 et seq., the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (setting forth statewide requirement to reduce GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 - reduction of approximately 15 percent below
26 emissions expected under a "business as usual" scenario - and requiring ARB to adopt regulations to achieve the maximum technologically feasible and cost-effective GHG emission reductions; to mitigate risks associated with climate change;
27 improve energy efficiency; and expand the use of renewable energy resources, cleaner transportation, and waste reduction practices). See id., see also, California State Executive Order B-30-15, April 29. 2015, Governor Edmund G. Brown (increasing the
28 state's GHG reduction target to achieve 40% below 1990 level reductions by the year 2030).

H 47.

2 The Specific Plan Site comprises an opening year planning area that includes 141.4

3 acres. It entails construction and operation of the three warehouse structures and truck/trailer parking

4 lot on four developments, as well a as a future development planning area that includes 71.6 acres and
a proposed buildout year of 2040.

5 48.

6 At least 117 existing residential units will be displaced from the Specific Plan Site as

7 a result of the Project. Other existing residences and agricultural uses in the Specific Plan Site would
become legal non-conforming uses.

8 49.

9 The Project will expose sensitive receptors to substantial pollutant concentrations.

10 These sensitive receptors include a church, Bloomington High School, Walter Zimmerman

11 Elementary School, Kessler Park, Ruth Harris Middle School, and single-family residences. The
closest residence to the Project is located 11 feet north of the area.

12 50. The Specific Plan Site also contains a host of biological resources, with seventeen
13 special-status species identified as having the potential to occur in the vicinity of the Project site.

14

15 These include the burrowing owl, a California species of special concern; pocketed free-tailed bat;

16 and western yellow bat. Much of the site also consists of Delhi Fine Sand, a highly unusual habitat

17 found nowhere else on earth. This habitat is home to the federally endangered Delhi Sands flower-

18 loving fly, whose populations have dwindled down into the dozens, primarily due to the loss of

19 suitable habitat. Due to extensive development in San Bernardino County, only a few hundred acres,

20 or approximately 2 percent of the original habitat area, of Delhi Fine Sand remains undeveloped.

51.

21 The Project also entails a policy plan amendment that would rezone an "Upzone Site"

22 to allow higher residential density to offset the residential zoning capacity that would be lost from

23 rezoning the 213-acre Specific Plan Site to a non-residential zone.

52.

24 The Upzone Site is a 24-acre area in the northern area of Bloomington, specifically

25 east of Locust Avenue, south of Hawthorne Avenue, and north of San Bernardino Avenue. The

26 Upzone is residentially zoned and surrounded by single-family residential uses to the north, Mary
Lewis Elementary School northwest of the San Bernardino Avenue/Locust Avenue intersection,
27 single-family residences southwest of Hawthorne Avenue at Locust Avenue, and single-family

28 residences to the south and east.

15

CASE NO.

H 53.

2 54. No physical development or improvements are proposed at the Upzone Site.

3 Because the Project involves the construction and operation of a large warehouse

4 complex, the Project will necessarily attract increased truck and other vehicular traffic.

55.

5 Accordingly, the Project will significantly impact the air quality in the immediate

6 vicinity of the Project, as well as throughout Bloomington, San Bernardino County, and the South

Coast.

7 56.

8 Moreover, because the Project will be located about 70 miles away from the nearest

9 port, the Project is likely to cause significant impacts along all roadways, thoroughfares, highways,

10 and highway corridors linking the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach to Bloomington.

57.

11 Finally, the Project will involve disruptive construction and operation as well as high
levels of light, noise, and glare, which will also obstruct scenic views.

12 III. The County's Environmental Review Process and Project Approval

13 A. The Draft EIR

14 58.

15 On or about December 30, 2020, the County issued a Notice of Preparation of a draft

16 environmental impact report ("Draft EIR") and Notice of Public Scoping Meeting for the Project.

59.

17 On or about January 8, 2021, the County recirculated a revised Notice of Preparation
of the Draft EIR and Notice of Public Scoping Meeting.

18 60.

19 61. On or about January 14, 2021, the County held a virtual scoping meeting.

20 On or about August 5, 2021, the County held a Bloomington Municipal Advisory

21 Council meeting in person and via video conference where the Project was discussed.

62. On or about September 23, 2021, the County issued a Notice of Completion and
22 Availability of the Draft EIR for the Project.

23 63.

24 On or about September 29, 2021, the County released the Draft EIR and circulated
the document for a 45-day period of public comment.

25 64.

26 Petitioners are informed and believe that the County did not publish any portion of
the Draft EIR in Spanish.

27 65.

28 On or about October 6, 2021, the County held a Bloomington Municipal Advisory
Council meeting in person and via video conference. Petitioners are informed and believe that Real

2 Party in Interest Tim Howard presented on the Project and informed the public in English that

3 Respondents and/or Real Parties in Interest had provided a Spanish translator. However, neither

4 Respondents nor Real Parties in Interest provided translation. During the meeting, simultaneous

5 English translation was provided via audio equipment, but consecutive English translation for

6 Spanish speakers at the podium was not provided. Anticipating this, Bloomington Petitioners hired
their own translator to assist at the meeting.

7 66.

8 On October 13, 2021, Bloomington Petitioners submitted a written request that the

9 County extend the comment period by an additional 30 days to allow for adequate evaluation of the

10 lengthy and highly technical Draft EIR, particularly in light of the previous failures of the County to

11 provide Bloomington's non-English speaking community members meaningful opportunities to

12 participate in the decision-making process. On October 22, 2021, Senior Planner Aron Liang from

13 the Land Use Services Department informed Bloomington Petitioners that their request for a 30-day
extension was granted.

14 67.

15 On or about October 25, 2021, the County issued a Notice of Availability of

16 Extension of the Draft EIR, wherein the County extended the comment period for an additional 30

days.

17 68.

18 Numerous organizations, individuals, and agencies like SCAQMD and ARB
submitted comments criticizing the Draft EIR.

19 69.

20 Bloomington Petitioners submitted letters to the County regarding the Draft EIR

21 dated December 15, 2021. Incorporated into one of Bloomington Petitioners' letters was an expert

22 report from Dr. Ranajit Sahu. The letters and report explained that the Draft EIR failed to comply
with CEQA in the following respects:

23 1. Mitigation Measures

24 70.

25 While the Project purports to include mitigation measures aimed at reducing impacts

26 to air quality, GHGs, noise, energy impacts, and other impact categories, many of these proposed

27 measures were inadequate, unenforceable, and/or improperly deferred for reasons including, but not

limited to:

28

17
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
CASE NO.

H 71.

2 The mitigation measures for air quality, GHGs, noise, energy impacts, and other

3 impact categories were inadequate and failed to include all feasible mitigation measures as required

4 under CEQA. For example, the Draft EIR failed to require the use of Class 7 and 8 electric trucks

5 even though this is a feasible mitigation measure that would substantially lessen significant

6 environmental effects. Numerous studies show that the current total cost of ownership for a large

7 battery-electric semi-truck is less than a diesel equivalent. As time progresses, this cost will drop

8 even lower, whereas diesel trucks are expected to increase in cost or remain stagnant. There are also

9 numerous Class 7 and 8 battery-electric truck models available for purchase, and many freight

10 facilities have already committed to utilizing these trucks. Requiring the usage of zero-emission

11 7 Class 7 and 8 semi-trucks in lieu of diesel semi-trucks is an effective, feasible mitigation measure

12 under CEQA because these vehicles have no tailpipe emissions and much lower life cycle GHG

emissions.

13 72.

14 The Draft EIR was also inadequate because it failed to include mitigation measures

15 requiring all cranes, forklifts, and other on-site construction and operational equipment to be

electrified.

16 73.

17 The Draft EIR also failed to include a mitigation measure requiring trucks that haul

18 dirt or other materials to and from the Project site to be covered during transit, even though this was
a feasible mitigation measure.

19 74.

20 Likewise, the Draft EIR failed to include a 30-minute limit on truck turnaround time,

21 even though this is a feasible mitigation measure. The Draft EIR was also deficient because it did not

22 include idling limits for yard tractors, even though this would save fuel costs, cut pollution, and
reduce a significant source of worker exposure.

23 75.

24 The Draft EIR also included mitigation measures that were unenforceable.

25 Specifically, measures intended to abate air quality impacts failed to include an authority, permit, or

26 regulatory body that will ensure proper oversight and compliance. For example, Mitigation Measure

27 AQ-1 failed to provide or cite to any oversight body or method that would ensure enforceable

28 mitigation. Similarly, Mitigation Measure AQ-2 did not include any specifications as to when on-site
inspections to verify compliance with construction mitigation will occur, how often they would

18
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
CASE NO.

-

2 occur, and what consequences would be for non-compliance. Mitigation Measure AQ-3 must include
language regarding enforcement of the idling rules.

3 76.

4 The mitigation measures included in the Draft EIR for GHG impacts were similarly

5 unenforceable. For example, Mitigation Measure GHG-1 required projects exceeding a 3,000 million

6 tons CO2e/year threshold to "achieve a minimum of 100 points." However, this measure lacked any

7 commitment associated with how this point determination would be carried out or overseen and was

therefore unenforceable.

8 2. Air Quality Impacts

9 77.

10 The Project's air quality analysis severely underestimated emissions from the Project.

11 The Draft EIR noted that "with compliance with existing rules, and implementation of the mitigation

12 measures, emissions would continue to exceed regional thresholds of significance established by the
SCAQMD for emissions of VOC and NOx."

13 78.

14 The Draft EIR's air quality analysis was inadequate because it relied on improper, it

15 unjustified, and inaccurate assumptions included in the traffic analysis. For example, the Draft EIR

16 improperly assumed, inter alia, the underlying activity levels of goods and people movement into

17 and out of the Project; the numbers and types of passenger cars and heavy-duty trucks; miles

18 traveled to and from the Project; the manner in which these trips were distributed in the vicinity of

19 the Project; and truck trips as a share of total trips related to the Project.

79.

20 Moreover, the Draft EIR also failed to adequately disclose and analyze the Project's

21 significant impacts to air quality. For example, the air quality analysis underestimated the air

22 pollution associated with the Project due to undercounting the number of trucks connected to the
Project and minimizing truck trip length.

23 80.

24 The Draft EIR also failed to adequately disclose and analyze the air quality impacts

25 associated with the Project under a Friant Ranch-type analysis in that it did not study it or disclose the

26 impact of the Project's NOx emissions on ozone formation in the South Coast air basin, and the

27 resulting cumulative impacts of these air emissions on human health.

81.

28 The Draft EIR's measures for mitigating air quality impacts were vague, ineffective,
deferred, unenforceable, unsupported by substantial evidence, and/or otherwise inadequate.

19
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
CASE NO.

82. Finally, the Draft EIR failed to incorporate all feasible mitigation or avoidance

2 measures, as previously noted.

3 3. Greenhouse Gas Emissions Impacts

4 83. The Draft EIR failed to adequately disclose, analyze, and/or mitigate the Project's

5 considerable GHG emissions.

6 84. The Draft EIR's GHG analysis was inadequate because it relied on improper

7 underlying values and assumptions and/or failed to disclose the values and assumptions it is based

8 upon. For example, the Draft EIR should have relied on the global warming potential ("GWP")

9 values from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's 5th Assessment Report, but it was

10 unclear if the Draft EIR instead improperly used GWP values from the earlier 2nd Assessment

11 Report. Likewise, the Draft EIR did not explain the underlying emission factors used in the

12 calculations to determine emissions of methane and nitrous oxide. The Draft EIR should have

13 provided a more thorough discussion of these emission factors.

14 85. The Draft EIR's GHG analysis was also inadequate because it relied on improper,

15 unjustified, and inaccurate assumptions included in the traffic analysis. For example, the Draft EIR

16 improperly assumed, inter alia, the underlying activity levels of goods and people movement into
17 and out of the Project; the numbers and types of passenger cars and heavy-duty trucks; miles

18 traveled to and from the Project; the manner in which these trips were distributed in the vicinity of

19 the Project; and truck trips as a share of total trips related to the Project.

20 86. Finally, the Draft EIR relied on mitigation measures that are vague, ineffective,

21 deferred, unenforceable, unsupported by substantial evidence, and/or otherwise inadequate. For

22 example, the Draft EIR stated that San Bernardino County includes a GHG Development Review

23 Process that relies on a screening threshold of 3,000 million tons CO2e/year to determine if

24 additional analysis is required. Projects that exceed the 3,000 MTCO2e/year, such as certain

25 scenarios in this Project, are then required to "achieve a minimum 100 points" per certain tables in
26 San Bernardino guidelines in order to be determined to have a less than significant impact for GHGs.

27 However, the limited discussion of the 100-point requirement and how any commitments associated

28 with this point determinations were unenforceable in the Draft EIR.

20
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
CASE NO.

H 4. Environmental Justice Impacts

2 87.

3 The Draft EIR failed to analyze and mitigate the environmental justice impacts and
address concerns the Project presents for Bloomington residents.

4 88.

5 The Draft EIR failed to analyze any of the environmental justice impacts of the

6 Project, despite the fact that the South Coast is one of the nation's most polluted regions, and

7 CalEnviroScreen data demonstrating that residents in the Project's specific census tracts endure a
pollution burden heavier than most of the State of California.

8 89.

9 The Draft EIR did not analyze the impacts the Project will expose sensitive receptors

10 to substantial pollutant concentrations, particularly in light of paltry and ineffective mitigation

11 measures. For example, it did not acknowledge the harms the Project will have on numerous schools,

12 parks, and a church in the area, as well as residences as close as 11 feet north of the area.

90.

13 The Draft EIR also failed to comply with San Bernardino County General Plan's

14 Countywide Environmental Justice goals and policies. For example, the Draft EIR stated its

15 compliance with these goals and policies by "construct[ing] frontage improvements, including

16 sidewalks, which would encourage walking in the Project area." But the Draft EIR did not provide

17 substantial evidence of how installing sidewalks will address the environmental justice concerns of

18 adding more diesel truck traffic, air pollution, noise, and other impacts to a community already
overburdened by air pollution.

19 91. Moreover, the County violated CEQA by denying Bloomington residents a
20 meaningful opportunity to participate throughout the Project's review process on numerous

21

22 occasions. This included failing to accommodate Spanish speakers in written documents and public

23 hearings and failing to provide timely and accessible notices. According to comments on the Draft

24 EIR that were submitted by individuals, residents did not receive proper notice or enough time to
comment during the Scoping Meeting.

25 92.

26 The Project also fails to comply with San Bernardino County General Plan's

27 Countywide Environmental Justice goals and policies. The County of San Bernardino Countywide

28 Plan ("Countywide Plan") serves as the County's general plan, and it contains policies to protect
against and minimize the effects of incompatible development. Countywide Plan Policy HZ-3.18

21
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
CASE NO.

-

2 states that a planning project application must "indicate whether the project is within, adjacent to, or

3 nearby an unincorporated environmental justice focus area and, if so, to: document to the County's

4 satisfaction how an applicant will address environmental justice concerns potentially created by the

5 project; and present a plan to conduct at least two public meetings for nearby residents, businesses,

6 and property owners to obtain public input for applications involving a change in zoning." The Draft

7 EIR is both procedurally and substantively inconsistent with Policy HZ-3.18 because the County did

8 not hold the requisite amount of community meetings. Even when the County held meetings, it

9 denied residents meaningful opportunities to participate in those meetings, as detailed above.

5. Noise Impacts

10 93.

11 The Project presents significant noise issues for neighboring and surrounding

12 sensitive receptors, including existing residences. The closest residences are a mere 11 feet from the

13 Project site, yet the Draft EIR did not accurately and fully evaluate the Project's impact on these

14 receptors. There were numerous flaws and omissions with respect to the Draft EIR's analysis of the

15 Project's noise impacts. For example, the Draft EIR's failed to measure the Project's noise impacts

16 against nighttime noise standards, despite the Project operating on a 24-hour basis.

94.

17 The Draft EIR also did not measure noise levels at property lines, as it dubiously
assumed that residents will not utilize their backyards.

18 95.

19 Additionally, the Draft EIR relied on an improper threshold of significance to

20 evaluate construction noise impacts that did not account for the Project's proximity to sensitive noise

21 receptors, as well as uncertain and deferred noise mitigation.

6. Agricultural Resources Impacts

22 96.

23 The Project site currently contains substantial agricultural resources and open space.

24 According to the Draft EIR, the site contains .04 acres of "prime farmland" and 23.55 acres of

25 "farmland of statewide importance." Because the Project will permanently remove this designated

26 farmland and not replace it, the Project results in adverse impacts on agricultural resources contrary

to the conclusion of the Draft EIR.

27 97.

28 In addition, the Project results in potentially significant cumulative impacts where it
a will convert a sizeable portion of existing farmland of statewide importance with no corresponding

22
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
CASE NO.

- mitigation. Rather than treat these impacts as significant, the Draft EIR assumed that other

2 speculative projects would mitigate this impact. This represented deferred analysis and mitigation

3 pursuant to CEQA.

4 7. Land Use Impacts

5 98. The Project results in significant land use impacts because it is not consistent or

6 compatible with surrounding land uses. For example, the Draft EIR failed to adequately evaluate and

7 mitigate the impacts associated with developing the Project at its location and in relation to

8 surrounding sensitive uses. The Project would introduce a massive industrial complex in an area

9 typified by low-density residences, agricultural uses, and community-oriented development. Among

10 other things, three schools are located within 1/4 mile of the Project site, and a park is located at the
11 southwestern boundary of the site. The Project with its intense warehouse operations, including

12 thousands of diesel truck trips and round-the-clock operations, will radically alter the character and
13 nature of this semi-urban environment.

14 99. For example, the Draft EIR's analysis and mitigation of the Project's land use impacts
15 were inadequate because the Project conflicts with Countywide Policy LU-2.1 in that the Project is
16 not "located, scaled, buffered, and designed to minimize negative impacts on existing conforming
17 uses and adjacent neighborhoods." The Project conflicts with Countywide Policy LU-2.3 in that the

18 Project is not "located, scaled, buffered, and designed for compatibility with the surrounding natural
19 environment and biodiversity." The Project conflicts with Countywide Policy LU-4.5 in that the
20 Project has not been designed to "be consistent with and reinforce the physical and historical
21 character and identity of our unincorporated communities." The Project conflicts with Countywide

22 Policy LU-6.4 in that the Project should be prohibited because it is a "new industrial development"
23 located "at least one-half mile from an existing or planned public primary or secondary school or

24 public park." The "Specific Plan" zoning does not eliminate the Project's land use conflicts and the

25 need for mitigation to address the incompatibility between uses, particularly where the "Specific

26 Plan" has no community features or benefits.
27

28

23
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
CASE NO.

H 100.

2 The Project also conflicts with Countywide Policy NR-7.1 in that the Project does not

3 "protect economically viable and productive agricultural lands from the adverse effects of urban

4 encroachment, particularly increased ... non-agricultural land development."

101.

5 Finally, the Project conflicts with the goals, policies, and "aspirations" of the

6 Community Action Guide for the unincorporated Bloomington community, including the policy that
"Bloomington contains great neighborhoods, parks and recreation centers, and local services, while
7 maintaining safe, small-town feel."

8 8. Biological Resources Impacts

9 102.

10 The Project presents significant biological impacts that the County failed to address.

11 For example, the Draft EIR failed to adequately disclose, analyze, and/or mitigate the Project's

12 significant direct and cumulative impacts on biological resources, including numerous special status

13 wildlife and plant species affected by the Project and their habitat. Those wildlife species include but

14 are not limited to: Delhi Sands flower-loving fly, which is listed as endangered under the Federal

15 Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C. § 1531 et seq.; burrowing owl, pocketed free-tailed bat, western

16 yellow bat, and numerous special status native plant species. The Draft EIR failed to adequately

17 disclose, analyze, and/or mitigate the Project's significant and cumulative impacts on habitats and

18 features. The Draft EIR also failed to disclose, analyze, or mitigate the biological impacts associated
with developing the Upzone Site.

19 103.

20 The Draft EIR also relied on mitigation measures that are vague, ineffective, deferred,
unenforceable, unsupported by substantial evidence, and/or otherwise inadequate. It failed to
21 incorporate all feasible mitigation or avoidance measures and failed to adequately disclose, analyze,

22

23 and/or mitigate the direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts of the Project on other biological

resources.

24 9. Housing Impacts

25 104.

26 The Draft EIR failed to adequately disclose, analyze, or mitigate the displacement

27 impacts of the Project, including information about the number of people residing in the Project's

28 footprint, the applicant's acquisition plan for these properties, and the impact of that rezoning to
non-residential uses on existing homeowners and tenants. Nor is there any disclosure, analysis, or

24
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
CASE NO.

- mitigation plan for residents adjacent to the Project who will be constructively displaced through

2 loss of full use and enjoyment of their properties due to conversion to non-conforming uses.

3 105. The Draft EIR did not include information about whether any of the residential units

4 in the Project footprint are "protected units" as defined by the Housing Crisis Act, triggering

5 replacement housing obligations.

6 B. The Responses to Comments and Final EIR

7 106. On or about September 15, 2022, the County issued a notice of hearing regarding the

8 Planning Commission's consideration of the Project and the Final EIR.

9 107. On or about September 16, 2022, the Land Use Services Department released a staff

10 report for the Planning Commission (*Planning Commission Staff Report") containing its proposed

11 findings of fact and Statement of Overriding Considerations to be adopted with the approval of the

12 Project.

13 108. On or about September 22, 2022, the Planning Commission held a hearing at which it
14 recommended that the Board of Supervisors certify the Final EIR, adopt the CEQA findings,

15 Statement of Overriding Considerations and Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program; adopt

16 findings for and approve the Bloomington Business Park Specific Plan, the policy plan amendment,

17 the zoning amendment, the site plan approvals, the vesting tentative parcel maps, the community

18 benefits agreement/development agreement, the community facilities district, and the conditional use

19 permits to construct the warehouses and truck/trailer parking lot; and direct the Clerk of the Board to

20 a file a Notice of Determination.

21 109. On October 29, 2022, the County released the Final EIR, which includes its responses

22 to comments on the Draft EIR as well as the other finalized sections of the EIR.

23 110. The County did not provide the public with a Spanish version of the Final EIR, or any

24 portions thereof.

25 111. The Final EIR indicates that the County made only minimal changes to the Draft EIR,

26 failing to remedy most errors identified by Bloomington Petitioners and other commenters. For

27 example, the Final EIR continues to fail to adequately disclose or analyze the Project's significant

28 impacts on the environment, including, but not limited to, the Project's aesthetic, agricultural, air

25
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
CASE NO.

- quality, biological, energy, GHG emissions, land use, noise, traffic and transportation, and

2 environmental justice impacts. It also fails to consider cumulative impacts associated with other

3 proposed logistics centers in the area, as well as fails to consider, discuss, or adopt adequate,

4 feasible, and enforceable mitigation measures to minimize the Project's significant and detrimental

5 impacts, and otherwise improperly deferred mitigation necessary to minimize the Project's impacts.

6 112. The County did not adequately respond to comments on the Draft EIR, including, but

7 not limited to, dismissing expert comments, requests for additional information, and suggestions of

8 feasible mitigation measures. For example, the Final EIR declines to respond to comments

9 highlighting the Project's social and economic merits because they "do not pertain to the potential

10 for significant physical impacts." Despite calls for an environmental justice analysis, the Final EIR

11 omitted any such analysis while also conceding that the Project is cited in an Environmental Justice

12 Focus Area.

13 113. The Final EIR also failed to acknowledge the procedural justice violations alleged in

14 the comments on the Draft EIR. For example, the County responded to requests for translations for

15 Bloomington's Spanish-speaking residents by arguing that "[t]ranslation of CEQA documents is not

16 part of the County's standard CEQA procedures and is not consistent with the County's existing

17 activities or procedures." But the County has already demonstrated that translations are in fact part

18 of its CEQA procedures. As the Final EIR concedes, the County provided Spanish translations of the

19 Notice of Preparation and Notice of Public Scoping Meeting, the Notice of Availability, and Notice

20 of Availability Extension. Notably, the Final EIR also responded in English to comments that were

21 submitted in Spanish, further denying meaningful opportunities for engagement and public review of

22 the Final EIR.

23 114. Additionally, the Planning Commission Staff Report fails to acknowledge nor

24 sufficiently address the fair housing, displacement, and community development issues that

25 community members and advocacy organizations raise with respect to the Project.

26 115. The Final EIR also included significant new information but was not recirculated for

27 full public review. For example, the Final EIR includes significant new analysis, including a new

28

26
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
CASE NO.

- 1,300-page Health Risk Assessment and 120-page traffic analysis, and a new analysis on a

2 environmental justice impacts, seemingly disclosing significant impacts from the Project.

3 116. As a result of these actions, the County prejudicially abused its discretion by failing

4 to proceed in the manner required by law and by failing to act on the basis of substantial evidence.

5 117. Bloomington Petitioners submitted letters to the County regarding the Final EIR

6 dated September 21, 2022. These letters highlighted the Final EIR's failure to correct the errors

7 identified by comments on the Draft EIR and failure to comply with CEQA. Bloomington

8 Petitioners also requested that the County recirculate the EIR for 60 days for full public review in

9 light of significant new information and the County's failure to translate documents into Spanish.

10 C. The County's Approval of the Project

11 118. On or about November 10, 2022, the County issued a notice of hearing regarding the

12 Board of Supervisors' consideration of the Project and the Final EIR.

13 119. Bloomington Petitioners submitted letters to the County regarding the Final EIR

14 dated November 14, 2022. These letters further explained the Final EIR's deficiencies and failures to

15 comply with CEQA.

16 120. On November 15, 2022, the County of San Bernardino Board of Supervisors held

17 public hearing at which it considered approval of the Project.

18 121. Bloomington Petitioners submitted oral comments at the November 15, 2022 public
19 hearing, reiterating their concerns from their written comments on the Final EIR.

20 122. Despite concerns expressed by Bloomington Petitioners, residents, and others, the

21 Board voted to certify the Final EIR, adopt the CEQA findings, Statement of Overriding
22 Considerations and Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program; adopt findings for and approve

23 the Bloomington Business Park Specific Plan, the policy plan amendment, the zoning amendment,

24 the site plan approvals, the vesting tentative parcel maps, the community benefits

25 agreement/development agreement, the community facilities district, and the conditional use permits

26 to construct the warehouses and truck/trailer parking lot; and direct the Clerk of the Board to file a

27 Notice of Determination.

2 The County's approval of the Project will cause Bloomington Petitioners irreparable

3 injury for which Bloomington Petitioners have no adequate remedy at law. Bloomington Petitioners
and their members will be irreparably harmed by the County's actions in approving the Project.
4 Bloomington Petitioners were harmed by, among other things, the failure of the County in its

5

6 certification of the Final EIR to adequately evaluate the potential impacts of the Project and the

7 County's approval of the Project without providing adequate and effective mitigation measures
contrary to the requirements of state law.

8 124.

9 The maintenance of this action is for the purpose of enforcing important public

10 policies of the State of California with respect to the protection of the environment under CEQA and

11 conformance with state law and local law, including mandates to refrain from unlawful

12 discrimination and the duty to affirmatively further fair housing. The maintenance and prosecution
of this action will confer a substantial benefit

13 upon the public by protecting the public from

14 environmental, residential displacement, and other harms alleged in this Petition. Bloomington

15 Petitioners are acting as private attorneys general to enforce these public policies and prevent such

harm.

20 Bloomington Petitioners hereby reallege and incorporate herein by reference the
allegations contained in the foregoing paragraphs.

21 Applicable CEQA Requirements

22 126.

23 CEQA is designed to ensure that the environmental consequences of proposed

24 projects are disclosed, considered, and feasibly avoided at the earliest opportunity. CEQA requires

25 the lead agency for a project with the potential to cause significant environmental impacts to prepare

26 an EIR that complies with the requirements of the statute, including, but not limited to, the

27 requirement to analyze the project's potentially significant environmental impacts. (Pub. Resources

28 § Code § § 21002.1, subd. (a), 21080, subd. (d).) The EIR must provide sufficient environmental
analysis to ensure that the decision makers can intelligently consider environmental consequences

-

2 when acting on the proposed project. (Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. V. Regents of Univ. of Cal.
(1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 405.)

3 127.

4 An EIR must "provide the public with an accurate, stable and finite description of the

5 project." (Washoe Meadows Community. v. Dept. of Parks & Recreation (2017) 17 Cal.App.5th 277,

6 285.) "[A] project description that gives conflicting signals to decision makers and the public about

7 the nature and scope of the project is fundamentally inadequate and misleading." (Id. at 287.)

128.

8 An EIR "must delineate environmental conditions prevailing absent the project,

9 defining a 'baseline' against which predicted effects can be described and quantified." (Neighbors

10 for Smart Rail v. Exposition Metro Line Construction Authority (2013) 57 Cal.4th 439, 447.) An

11 EIR's description of this environmental setting should be sufficiently comprehensive to allow the

12 project's significant impacts "to be considered in the full environmental context." (CEQA
Guidelines, § 15125, subd. (c).)

13 129. An EIR must disclose and analyze the direct and the reasonably foreseeable indirect
14 environmental impacts of a proposed project if they are significant. (CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15126.2,

15 15064, subd. (d)(3).) "[A] sufficient discussion of significant impacts requires not merely a
16 determination of whether an impact is significant, but some effort to explain the nature and

17

18 magnitude of the impact." (Sierra Club v. County of Fresno (2018) 6 Cal.5th 502, 519 ("Friant
Ranch").)

19 130.

20 An EIR must discuss a cumulative impact if a project's incremental effect combined

21 with the effects of other projects is "cumulatively considerable." (CEQA Guidelines, § 15130, subd.

22 (a).) The discussion of cumulative impacts must be more than "a conclusion utterly devoid of any

23 reasoned analysis." (Whitman v. Bd. of Supervisors (1979) 88 Cal.App.3d 397, 411.)

131.

24 will reduce or CEQA also mandates that the lead agency identify feasible mitigation measures that

25 avoid a project's significant environmental impacts. (Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21002,

26 21002.1, subd. (b).) Even where a public agency cannot completely eliminate project's significant

27 impacts, CEQA requires that it nonetheless reduce those impacts to the extent feasible. (Friant
Ranch, supra, 6 Cal.5th 502, 524-25.)

28

29
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
CASE NO.

H 132.

2 An EIR must respond to comments making specific suggestions for mitigating a

3 significant impact unless the suggested mitigation is "facially infeasible." (L.A. Unified School Dist.

4 V. City of L.A. (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1019, 1029.) If an agency rejects a suggested measure as

5 infeasible, the rejection must be supported by substantial evidence and free of legal error. (Pub.
Resources Code, § 21168.5.)

6 133.

7 CEQA instructs that "[a] public agency shall provide that measures to mitigate or

8 avoid significant effects on the environment are fully enforceable through permit conditions,

9 agreements, or other measures." (Pub. Resources Code, § 21081.6, subd. (b).) The agency must

10 assure that its mitigation is "effective" and will "present a viable solution" to mitigating the adverse

11 effect. (Gray v. County of Madera (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1099, 1116.) The EIR must include facts

12 and analysis to support its conclusions regarding the effect of its mitigation measures. (Friant Ranch,

13 supra, 6 Cal.5th at 522 ("The EIR must accurately reflect the net health effect of proposed air quality

14 mitigation measures"), citing Cleveland Nat. Forest Foundation v. San Diego Assn. of Governments
(2017) 3 Cal.5th 497, 514.)

15 134.

16 Requiring a project to implement or fund its fair share of a measure designed to

17 mitigate a cumulative impact is a legally acceptable mechanism for addressing the project's

18 contribution to the impact. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15130, subd. (a)(3).) Fair-share contributions to a

19 mitigation fund may be adequate mitigation if they are "part of a reasonable, enforceable plan or

20 program that is sufficiently tied to the actual mitigation of the . impacts at issue." (Anderson First

21 Coalition v. City of Anderson (2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 1173, 1189.)

135.

22 CEQA requires a lead agency to address new information before certifying an EIR

23 when "[s]ubstantial changes occur with respect to the circumstances under which the project is being

24 undertaken which will require major revisions in the environmental impact report" or "[n]ew

25 information, which was not known and could not have been known at the time the environmental

26 impact report was certified as complete, becomes available." (Pub. Resources Code, § 21166, subds.

27 (b), (c).) This includes significant effects not discussed in the previous EIR and impacts that are

28 "substantially more severe" than what the previous EIR disclosed. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15162,
subd. (a)(3)(B).)

30
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
CASE NO.

H 136.

2 CEQA prohibits lead agency from approving project with significant

3 environmental effects unless it has made written findings for each of those effects, accompanied by

4 an explanation of the rationale for each finding. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21081, subd. (a).) These

5 findings must support the ultimate decision, be based on substantial evidence in the record, and trace

6 the analytical route between the evidence in the record and the agency's conclusions.

137.

7 CEQA provides that where a project's significant environmental effects cannot

8 feasibly be mitigated, the lead agency may still approve the project if it finds that "specific

9 overriding economic, legal, social, technological or other benefits of the project outweigh the

10 significant effects on the environment." (Pub. Resources Code, § 21081, subd. (b).) However, an
agency's Statement of Overriding Considerations constitutes

11 an abuse of discretion where it is not

12 supported by substantial evidence. (Id. § 21168.5; CEQA Guidelines, § 15093, subd. (b).) The

13 statement's core "purposes are undermined if its conclusions are based on misrepresentations of the

14 contents of the EIR or it misleads the reader about the relative magnitude of the impacts and benefits

15 the agency has considered." (Woodward Park Homeowners Assn., Inc. v. City of Fresno (2007) 150
Cal.App.4th 683, 718.)

16 138.

17 An agency's Statement of Overriding Considerations provides "a proper basis for

18 approving a project despite the existence of unmitigated environmental effects, only when the

19 measures necessary to mitigate or avoid those effects have properly been found to be infeasible."

20 (City of Marina V. Bd. of Trustees of Cal. State Univ. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 341, 368.) Where an agency

21 improperly determines that significant impacts cannot feasibly be mitigated, it "necessarily follows"

22 that the statement of overriding consideration is invalid. (Ibid.)

139.

23 Among CEQA's basic purposes are to "[i]nform . . . the public about the potential,

24 significant environmental effects of proposed activities" and to "[d]isclose to the public the reasons
why a governmental agency approved the project in the manner the agency chose if significant
25 environmental effects are involved."(CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15002, subds. (a)(1), (a)(4).) "Public

26

27 participation is an essential part of the CEQA process," (id., § 15201), and a CEQA lead agency like

28 San Bernardino County possesses inherent authority and discretion to provide translations of CEQA
documents in Spanish.

9 Respondents failed to consider cumulative impacts associated with other proposed

10 logistics centers in the area and failed to revise and recirculate the EIR in response to significant new

11 information that occurred after the release of the Project's Draft EIR regarding the newly proposed
Project.

12 143.

13 Respondents failed to consider, discuss, or adopt adequate, feasible, and enforceable

14 mitigation measures to minimize the Project's significant and detrimental impacts, and otherwise

15 improperly deferred mitigation necessary to minimize the Project's impacts.

144.

16 Respondents failed to adopt feasible Project alternatives and make adequate findings

17 supported by substantial evidence that Project alternatives are infeasible within the meaning of
CEQA.

18 145.

19 Respondents failed to support the adopted Statement of Overriding Considerations
with substantial evidence in the record.

20

21 146. Respondents failed to provide meaningful opportunity for Spanish-speaking county
residents to participate in the CEQA Process.

22 147.

23 As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion

24 by certifying a Final EIR that does not comply with CEQA and by approving the Project in reliance

25 thereon. Accordingly, Respondents' certification of the Final EIR and approval of the Project must
be set aside.

3 (Ordinary Mandamus: Code of Civ. Proc. § 1085, and Declaratory & Injunctive Relief; Duty

4 to Affirmatively Further Fair Housing Government Code § 8889.50.)

5 148. Bloomington Petitioners hereby reallege and incorporate herein by reference the
allegations contained in the foregoing paragraphs.

6 The Duty to Affirmatively Further Fair Housing

7 149.

8 The County is prohibited from taking actions that are materially inconsistent with its

9 obligation to affirmatively further fair housing. (Gov. Code § 8899.50 (b)(1).)

150.

10 "Affirmatively furthering fair housing means taking meaningful actions that, taken

11 together, address significant disparities in housing needs and in access to opportunity, replacing

12 segregated living patterns with truly integrated and balanced living patterns, transforming racially

13 and ethnically concentrated areas of poverty into areas of opportunity, and fostering and maintaining

14 compliance with civil rights and fair housing laws." (Gov. Code 8899.50(a)(1).)

151.

15 The duty to affirmatively further fair housing applies to the County and extends to all

16 of its activities and programs relating to land use and planning and zoning decisions, including the
Project. (Gov. Code § 8899.50(b)(1).)

17 II.

18 Violations of the Duty to Affirmatively Further Fair Housing

152.

19 The Project will result in significant negative impacts on air quality in Bloomington,
as acknowledged in the Planning Commission Staff Report. Bloomington is already environmentally
20 burdened, and the Project will worsen these conditions, making homes and neighborhoods more

21 hazardous and less livable.

22 153.

23 The Project will decrease neighborhood and housing quality in the Bloomington

24 neighborhood, exacerbate environmental hazards, and displace existing residents without adequate
mitigation measures. These harms will disproportionately impact Hispanic or Latino residents and
25 lower-income households.

26 154.

27 The County has not engaged in any analysis of the Project's impact on members of

28 Hispanic or Latino and lower-income households or on any other protected classes under the Fair

33
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
CASE NO.

- Employment and Housing Act, nor has it taken any action to mitigate residents' direct or indirect

2 displacement or the loss of housing.

3 155. The County's actions violate its duty to affirmatively further fair housing and to

4 foster compliance with civil rights and fair housing laws.

5 156. The County has clear, present, ministerial duty to comply with its duty to

6 affirmatively further fair housing.

7 157. Bloomington Petitioners have a beneficial interest in the performance of the County's

8 duties.

9 158. Bloomington Petitioners also have an interest as citizens in the performance of the

10 County's public duties.

11 159. Unless compelled by this Court to comply with its legal obligations, the County and

12 Real Parties in Interest will proceed with the Project, destroy existing homes, cause displacement,

13 and harm the predominately Hispanic or Latino community and under-resourced community through
14 environmental degradation, violating the duty to affirmatively further fair housing.

15 160. Petitioner has no plain, speedy and adequate remedy at law other than that sought

16 herein.

20 161. Bloomington Petitioners hereby reallege and incorporate herein by reference the

21 allegations contained in the foregoing paragraphs.

22 Relevant Provisions of the Fair Employment and Housing Act

23 162. The Fair Employment and Housing Act makes it unlawful to discriminate through

24 public or private land use practices, decisions, and authorizations on the basis of enumerated

25 characteristics: race, color, religion, sex, gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual

26 orientation, familial status, marital status, disability, genetic information, national origin, source of

27 income, veteran or military status, or ancestry. Discrimination includes, but is not limited to,

28 restrictive covenants, zoning laws, denials of use permits, and other actions authorized under the

34

- Planning and Zoning Law (Title 7 (commencing with § 65000)) that make housing opportunities

3 163. The California Code of Regulations states that unlawful land use practices include

4 those that intentionally discriminate or have a discriminatory effect, such as those that:

5 a. Deny, restrict, condition, adversely impact, or render infeasible the enjoyment

6 of residence, land ownership, tenancy, or any other land use benefit related to

7 housing opportunities. (2 Cal. Code Regs., § 12161(b)(1).)

8 b. Result in the location of toxic, polluting, and/or hazardous land uses in a
9 manner that denies, restricts, conditions, adversely impacts, or renders

10 infeasible the enjoyment of residence, land ownership, tenancy, or any other

11 land use benefit related to residential use, or in connection with housing

12 opportunities or existing or proposed dwellings. (2 Cal. Code Regs.,

13 § 12161(b)(10).)

14 II. Violations of the Fair Employment and Housing Act

15 164. The Project will result in significant negative impacts on air quality in Bloomington,

16 as acknowledged in the Planning Commission Staff Report. Bloomington is already environmentally

17 burdened, and the Project will make these conditions worse, in turn making homes and
18 neighborhoods more hazardous and less livable.

19 165. The County has not engaged in any analysis of the Project's impact on members of

20 Hispanic or Latino and lower-income households, or on any other protected classes under the Fair

21 Employment and Housing Act, or taken any action to mitigate residents' direct or indirect
22 displacement or the loss of housing.

23 166. The Project will decrease neighborhood and housing quality in the Bloomington

24 neighborhood, will exacerbate environmental hazards, and will displace existing residents without

25 adequate mitigation measures. These harms will disproportionately impact Hispanic or Latino

26 residents and lower-income households.

27 167. The Project will result in significant negative impacts on air quality in the
28 surrounding area. Bloomington already has some of the worst environmental conditions in the

-

2 County, and the Project will make those conditions worse, in turn making homes and neighborhoods
more hazardous and less livable.

3 168.

4 The Project will eliminate housing stock and displace residents from their homes and

5 community in a predominately Hispanic or Latino community. The change in allowable use will also

6 impact homeowners' future ability to use, modify, finance, or sell their homes. The Specific Plan

7 does not include any plans to provide replacement housing and does not allow for any residential

uses.

8 169.

9 The Project does not propose physical developments or improvements at the Upzone

10 Site. Any development at the Upzone Site also requires the demolition of existing housing and the

11 displacement of current residents. The County has not assessed the tenure or affordability of the

12 homes that will be destroyed by the project, nor whether other housing in San Bernardino County
will be affordable to displaced residents.

13 170.

14 The County's failure to provide language access in the public participation process

15 for land use applications has a disparate impact on Bloomington's Hispanic or Latino residents

16 because these residents are more likely than others to have Limited English Proficiency.

171.

17 Hispanic or Latino residents of unincorporated Bloomington with limited English

18 proficiency are unfairly denied the opportunity to review documents and participate in the public

19 planning process when they are unable to respond to requests for information sent only in English.

172.

20 affluence. The County has not sited similar projects in or near racially concentrated areas of

23 174.

24 Bloomington Petitioners have a beneficial interest in the performance of the County's

25 duties and an interest as citizens in the performance of the County's public duties.

26 175. Bloomington Petitioners also have an interest as citizens in the performance of the
County's public duties.

27 176.

28 Bloomington Petitioners have no plain, speedy and adequate remedy at law other than
that sought herein.

H FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

2

3 (Ordinary Mandamus: Code of Civ. Proc. § 1085; Housing Crisis Act: Govt Code § 65589.5;

4 Violations of Housing Crisis Act of 2019: Failure to Prevent Net Loss in Residential Capacity.)

5 177. Bloomington Petitioners hereby reallege and incorporate herein by reference the
allegations contained in the foregoing paragraphs.

6 Applicable Housing Crisis Act of 2019 Requirements

7 178.

8 Where a jurisdiction adopts a planning and zoning decision that would result in

9 residential capacity, Government Code § 66300 requires that, in such instances, the jurisdiction take

10 concurrent action to change "the development standards, policies, and conditions applicable to other

11 parcels within the jurisdiction to ensure no net loss in residential capacity." (Gov. Code
0n 66300(i)(1).)

12 179.

13 The statute also requires replacement of any existing or demolished "protected units,"

14 defined as any of the following: covenanted affordable units; units subject to rent or price control in
the last 5 years; and units that are

15 or were rented by lower or very low-income households within the
past 5 years. (Gov. Code §§ (d)(2)(A), (d)(2)(F)(iv)(D)-(III).)

16 180.

17 In enacting the Housing Crisis Act, the Legislature declared, "it is the policy of the

18 state that this section be interpreted and implemented in a manner to afford the fullest possible

19 weight to the interest of, and the approval and provision of, housing." (Gov. Code
§ 65589.5(a)(2)(L).)

20 Il. Violations of Housing Crisis Act of 2019

21 181.

22 Beyond rezoning of the Upzone Site to allow for higher residential density, neither

23 the County nor Real Parties in Interest conducted analysis regarding whether any units in the project

24 area that they intend to be demolished to make way for the Project meet the definition of "protected

25 units," and do not identify any plan for replacement units as required under the Government Code.

182.

26 The County's approval and adoption of an Upzone Site north of the Specific Plan Site

27 changes the zoning in this area; no physical development or improvements are proposed there. The

28 superficial attempt to comply with Government Code $ 66300 is a mere paper exercise. Neither the

County nor Real Parties in Interest provide meaningful analysis of the development potential at the

37

CASE NO.

H

2 Upzone Site to accommodate higher density residential uses, including whether the site has realistic

3 capacity to accommodate housing uses; identification of barriers; or necessary changes to

4 development standards, policies, and conditions to reduce or eliminate such barriers.

183.

5 Act. The County has a clear, present, ministerial duty to comply with the Housing Crisis

6 184.

7 Bloomington Petitioners have a beneficial interest in the performance of the County's

8 duties and an interest as citizens in the performance of the County's public duties.

185.

9 Bloomington Petitioners also have an interest as citizens in the performance of the
County's public duties.

10

11 186. Bloomington Petitioners have no plain, speedy and adequate remedy at law other than
that sought herein.

12 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

13

14 187. WHEREFORE, Bloomington Petitioners pray for judgment as follows:

15 For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing Respondents to vacate and

16 set aside their approval of the Project and certification of the Final EIR, and adoption of findings of

17 fact and Statement of Overriding Considerations in connection with their approval of the Project;

188.

18 For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing Respondents to vacate and

19 set aside all permits reliant on the Final EIR for CEQA compliance;

189.

20 For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing Respondents to comply

21 with CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines, and to take any other action as required by Public Resources
Code § 21168.9 or otherwise required by law;

22 190.

23 For a temporary stay, temporary restraining order, and preliminary and permanent

24 injunctions restraining Respondents and Real Parties in Interest and their agents, servants, and

25 employees, and all others acting in concert with them or on their behalf, from taking any action (a) to

26 approve any permits, entitlements, licenses, or authorizations pursuant to the Bloomington Business

27 Park, or (b) to implement any portion or aspect of the Bloomington Business Park Specific Plan,

28 pending Respondents' full compliance with the requirements of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines;

38

2 For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing the County to publish any

3

4 future CEQA notices concerning the Project, as well as the executive summaries of any future EIRs
concerning the Project, in Spanish, as well as in English;

192.

5 For alternative and peremptory writ of mandate restraining the County from taking

6 actions that site the Project in a manner that denies, restricts, conditions, adversely impacts, or

7 renders infeasible the enjoyment of residence, land ownership, tenancy, or any other land use benefit

8 related to residential use, or in connection with housing opportunities or existing or proposed

9 dwellings, on the basis of national origin or any other protected characteristics.

193.

10 For alternative and peremptory writ of mandate directing the County to identify

11 "protected units," identify occupants of such protected units, and require provision of relocation

12 assistance in the manner required under compliance with Gov. Code § 66300;

194.

13 For declaratory relief that the County's approval of the Project is a violation of its

14 duty to affirmatively further fair housing;

195.

15 For declaratory relief that the County's approval of the Project has unlawful,

16 discriminatory impact based on protected characteristics as defined therein;

Re: California Public Resources Code Section 21167.5 Notice of Intent to File CEQA
Petition Challenging the Certification of the Final Environmental Impact Report for
the Bloomington Business Park Specific Plan Project (State Clearinghouse No.
2020120545)

Dear County Clerk Lynna Monell:

Please be advised that as required under California Public Resources Code section 21167.5, the Center for Community Action and Environmental Justice, People's Collective for Environmental Justice, the Center for Biological Diversity, and the Sierra Club (collectively "Petitioners") through this correspondence hereby provide notice of their intent to file a petition under the California Environmental Quality Act (*CEQA") against the County of San Bernardino ("Respondent"), and Tim Howard and Howard Industrial Partners, LLC ("Real Parties in
Interest"). (See Pub. Res. Code § 21000, et seq.)

Petitioners seek to challenge the Final Environmental Impact Report ("FEIR") for the Bloomington Business Park Specific Plan project (State Clearinghouse No. 2020120545) that
was certified on November 15, 2022, by Respondent. Petitioners will file this CEQA challenge based on the FEIR's failure to comply with CEQA requirements, including but not limited to the failure to adequately analyze environmental impacts, the failure to disclose or accurately
evaluate greenhouse gas emissions impacts, and the failure to adequately consider cumulatively considerable impacts. For these and other reasons, the certified FEIR is procedurally and substantively defective.

Additionally, Petitioners intend to include claims against the County alleging that, by approving and adopting the applications associated with the Bloomington Business Park Specific Plan project, the County has violated its duty to affirmatively further fair housing (Gov. Code § 8889.50), the Fair Employment and Housing Act (Gov. Code § 12955 et seq.), and the Housing
Crisis Act (Gov. Code § 65589.5).

Among other relief, Petitioners will request that the Court issue a writ of mandate to vacate the FEIR certification and to compel the recirculation and preparation of an EIR that conforms to

LOS ANGELES OFFICE 707 WILSHIRE BLVD., SUITE 4300 LOS ANGELES, CA 90017

CEQA requirements. Additionally, Petitioners will seek costs and attorney's fees. (Cal. Civ. Pro.
§ 1021.5.)

Based on the reasons outlined above, Respondent should immediately vacate the certification of
the FEIR and engage in an appropriate CEQA review process that results in an adequate EIR.

Most respectfully,
