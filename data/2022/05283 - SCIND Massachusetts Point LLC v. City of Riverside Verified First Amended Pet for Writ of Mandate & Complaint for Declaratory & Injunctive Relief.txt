Petitionet and Plaintiff SCIND Massachusetts Point, LLC, brings this Verified First
2 Amended Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint ("Petition") to challenge the creation by

3 Respondent and Defendant City of Riverside ("City") of its "Riverside Innovation District"
("Innovation District") and its "vision" plan for the Innovation District ("Innovation District
u Vision Plan"), and its adoption of the "Innovation District Overlay Zone" ("ID Overlay Zone")

6 covering Riverside's Historic Industrial District (as defined below) and its subsequent adoption of

7 the "Riverside Innovation District Triangle Master Plan" ("Triangle Master Plan"). These

8 discretionary acts were undertaken by the City without complying with the California
Environmental Quality Act (Pub. Res. Code, §§ 21000 et seq.; "CEQA"). In addition, the

10 ID Overlay Zone is unconstitutionally vague, ambiguous, and uncertain, both on its face and as

11 applied to Petitioner and conflicts with the City's General Plan.

12 THE PARTIES

13 1. Petitioner and Plaintiff SCIND Massachusetts Point, LLC ("Petitioner") is a

14 Delaware limited liability company, authorized to do and doing business in Riverside County,

15 State of California. Petitioner is in the business of developing industrial projects in Southern

16 California.

17 2. Respondent and Defendant City of Riverside ("City") is, and at all times relevant

18 hereto was, a municipal corporation located in Riverside County, and duly organized and existing

19 as a charter city under the Constitution and laws of the State of California.

20 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

21 3. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure

22 Sections 1094.5 and 1085. This Court also has jurisdiction to render judicial determinations and

23 to issue declarations under Code of Civil Procedure Section 1060, and to order injunctive relief

24 under Code of Civil Procedure Sections 525 and 526.

25 4. Venue is appropriate in this Court pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Sections

26 394 and 395, which authorize the filing of this Petition in the Riverside County Superior Court.

- GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

2 The City's Improper Planning and Rezoning Efforts in the "Innovation District"

3 5.

4 This lawsuit challenges the City's improper attempts to adopt land use plans for

5 and to rezone significant portions of the City in a piecemeal fashion, without complying with the

6 requirements of CEQA, and without providing required legal notice to affected landowners and
operators, including the Petitioner, among other errors.

7 6.

8 The City's "Innovation District" covers a relatively large area in the core of the

9 northern portion of the City and, as conceived, contains various potential future districts. One of

10 those districts -- the first 1o be rezoned - has been labeled by the City as the "Triangle District."

7.

11 The newly labeled Triangle District encompasses and is co-extensive with a

12 historically industrial area within the City, which is generally bounded by State Route 91 along

13 the western side, Highway 60 along the eastern side and 3rd Street along the southern side, and is
approximately 220 acres in size ("Historic Industrial District").

14 8.

15 Petitioner is informed and believes, and based upon such information alleges, that

16 for approximately the last 80 years, until October of 2021, the entire Historic Industrial District

17 was zoned general industrial. The City's General Plan designates the large portion of the Historic

18 Industrial District as Industrial, including the Property. The Historic Industrial District contains

19 heavy industrial uses, including, but not limited to, warehouse, manufacturing, and logistics uses,

20 some of which have been operating for decades. Recently, some of the owners of properties in

21 the Historic Industrial Area have sold, or agreed to sell, their properties to buyers intending to

22 redevelop the properties with new industrial developments similar to the historic industrial uses in
the area. Petitioner is one such buyer.

23 The Property

24 9.

25 Petitioner and its affiliate develop Class A warehouse and distribution facilities
throughout Southern California.

26 10.

27 Petitioner is the record owner of that certain real property located at 2626 Kansas

28 Avenue, 2069 Massachusetts Avenue, and 1989 Massachusetts Avenue in Riverside, California

DLA PIPER LLP (US) 92507 (the "Property"). The Property is located within the boundaries of the Historic Industrial

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
WEST \297913964.1

1 District, within the area that was previously zoned for industrial uses and that the General Plan

2 currently designates as Industrial. Petitioner purchased the Property on or about May 28, 2021.

3 11. Typical of many industrial properties, the Property was contaminated with

4 hazardous materials, and is currently undergoing remediation under the supervision of the

5 Regional Water Quality Control Board, Region 8 ("Regional Board"). 8 Petitioner has been advised

6 by the Regional Board that, at the conclusion of planned remediation, residential and other
sensitive uses will be prohibited on the Property pursuant to a deed restriction that must be

8 recorded against the Property, which is highly typical of hazardous waste cleanups on industrial-
zoned properties.

10 12. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based on such information and belief

: ~ alleges, that many other properties within the Historic Industrial District also contain
contaminated soil from historic industrial operations and, in addition, contaminated groundwater
13 that must be remediated prior to redevelopment, and that not all properties within the Historic

14 Industrial District that may be contaminated are subject to remedial actions and, therefore, may

15 not be remediated in the foreseeable future. Further, Petitioner is informed and believes, and

16 based upon such information and belief alleges, that properties within the surrounding area could,

17 like the Property, when or if remediated, also be subject to deed restrictions that would prohibit

18 the development of residential and other sensitive uses on them.

19 Petitioner's Efforts to Develop Its Property

20 13. Prior to purchasing the Property, from July 2020 through May 2021, Petitioner

21 performed due diligence on the Property, including, without limitation, a full review of the land

22 use and zoning requirements that applied to it. Petitioner's due diligence revealed that the land

23 use and zoning requirements that applied to the Property were suitable for the types of large

24 industrial projects that Petitioner builds, and for the particular Class A warehouse and distribution

25 industrial project that Petitioner intended to build at the Property (*Petitioner's Project").

26 14. During the period from July 2020 through May 2021, Petitioner engaged in

27 extensive dialogue with the City regarding Petitioner's Project, including approximately thirty

28 discussions and meetings with representatives of the City's Planning staff and City Council. The
4 DLA PIPER LLP (US)
LOs ANCELES
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
WEST \297913964.1

1 [City informed Petitioher that its briginally proposed project, consisting of one building of

2 approximately 320,000 square feet, was not acceptable because it would be located too close to a

3 local sensitive use- -a homeless shelter with supportive services. As a result, Petitioner

4 redesigned its project, at significant expense, to consist oftwo smaller buildings, each

5 approximately 100,000 square feet.

6 15. Over the course of those discussions and meetings, the City's Planning
Department informed Petitioner that the City was contemplating an overlay zone that would

8 affect the Historic Industrial District, but would not affect the existing underlying Industrial
zoning, and that even if the overlay zone were ultimately adopted, the Project could still be

10 developed pursuant to the existing Industrial zoning regulations since the contemplated overlay

11 zone was intended to be an "add-on" that would allow additional future uses, if/when landowners
12 pursued them. During those discussions and meetings, Petitioner informed the City that the
13 Property was contaminated, was being investigated and remediated for hazardous materials

14 contamination in the soil, soil vapor and groundwater under the supervision of the Regional

15 Board, and that the Regional Board had told Petitioner that following remediation, sensitive uses,

16 including, inter alia, residential, school, hospital and day care center uses, would be prohibited at

17 the Property.

18 16. Based on meetings and feedback from the City's Planning Department, on
19 March 30, 2021, Petitioner submitted a Conceptual Development Review application package for

20 Petitioner's Project.

21 17. On April 21, 2021, Petitioner presented Petitioner's Project to the City's

22 Development Review Committee and received positive feedback and support from the City.
23 18. On April 28, 2021, Petitioner received a Welcome Letter from the City wherein

24 each applicable City department affirmed the direction of Petitioner's Project.

25 19. Based on this strong support from the City for Petitioner's Project, Petitioner

26 purchased the Property on May 28, 2021, intending to develop Petitioner's Project at the Property

27 consistent with the Welcome Letter and Conceptual Development Review. Thereafter, Petitioner

28 participated in further discussions and meetings with the City, engaged third party consultants and
DLA PIPER LLP (US) 5
LOS ANCELES
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
WEST\297913964.1

worked with the City's Planning and Public Works Dapariments to further the development of

2 Petitioner's Projedt.

3 20. At no time after Petitioner's purchase of the Property, and in particular at no time

4 during the period when Petitioner was working with the City's Planning Department and other

5 City representatives to design Petitioner's Project, did Petitioner receive any written or other

6 notice from or on behalf of the City, or was Petitioner even made aware, that the City was
studying or considering the adoption of a land use plan or zoning for the Historic Industrial

8 District that would change the land use and zoning requirements for development within the
Historic Industrial District in general, and for the Property in particular, that would prohibit the

10 development of Petitioner's Project.

21. On January 26, 2022 - a mere eight months after receiving its Welcome Letter
12 from the City - Petitioner met with the City's Development Review Committee, during which

13 meeting representatives of the City abruptly changed course, stating that the City could not
14 support Petitioner's Project as proposed because Petitioner's Project is located in the Historic

15 Industrial District encompassed by the ID Overlay Zone where warehouse and distribution

16 industrial uses are now prohibited uses. Despite having worked with the City for over one and

17 one-half years on the concept and design of Petitioner's Project, on February 2, 2022, Petitioner

18 received written notice from the City that it would not support Petitioner's Project as proposed.

19 22. Had Petitioner, a developer of industrial projects, been aware of the City's

20 intention to change the zoning, Petitioner would not have expended the substantial time and

21 money that it did on designing its industrial Project with the City's Planning Department and

22 other City representatives, only to be told that the City had changed the land use and zoning

23 requirements for the Property, and the Historic Industrial District as a whole, to prohibit

24 Petitioner's Project and the type of industrial development projects that Petitioner builds.

25 The City's Innovation District, Triangle District Master Plan and ID Overlay Zone

26 23. According to the City's recitation of background events contained in the Triangle

27 Master Plan approved on February 1, 2022, as alleged below, on August 1, 2019, the City

28 initiated a "visioning process" for the Innovation District, which included a charette process
DLA PIPER LLP (US) 6
Los ANGELES
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
WEST\297913964.1

involving several meetings between August through October 2019 attended by "community

2 stakeholders" includipg City officials, representatives from the Greater Riverside Chamber of

3 Commerce and from the University of California Riverside and Riverside Community College,

4 but, notably, not property or business owners and not the Petitioner. That process ultimately

5 "identified shared vision by City leaders and stakeholders in Riverside," which was reported to

6 the City Council at its February 25, 2020 meeting. According to that shared vision, intense new

7 development is to be located in the Historic Industrial District/Triangle District.

8 24. While Petitioner was conducting its due diligence, then completing its purchase of

9 the Property, and then working with the City's Planning Department and other City

10 representatives to design its industrial distribution and warehouse Project to meet the applicable

11 City zoning and design requirements, but entirely unknown to Petitioner, the City was working

12 with a group of stakeholders" to create a "flexible" "mixed-use" land use plan for the Historic

13 Industrial District that would imminently change the types and designs of development projects

14 allowed within its borders. Such changes would include prohibiting the type of industrial

15 distribution and warehouse project that Petitioner was actively working with the City to develop,

16 which had been allowed by right in the area and on the Property for many decades.

17 25. On October 5, 2021, the City Council approved text and map amendments to

18 Title 19 (Zoning) of the Riverside Municipal Code ("RMC*), including, inter alia,

19 Chapter 19.170, the "Innovation District Overlay Zone."

20 26. On or about October 19, 2021, the City Council adopted Ordinance Nos. 7573 and

21 7574, by which these text and map amendments were adopted. Despite its title, the provisions of

22 the ID Overlay Zone in Chapter 19.170 imposed an overlay zone over the Historic Industrial

23 District/Triangle District, only. As stated in Section 19.170.020, Application, subsection B,

24 Relationship to ID Master Plan, "implements the intent and guidelines in the I[nnovation]

25 D[istrict] Master Plan document."

26 27. However, the City had not yet adopted any "Innovation District Master Plan

27 document at the time the City adopted the ID Overlay Zone.

[28.
N On October 5 2021, the City also berlified a Program Environmental Impact

3 Report for the City's Housing and Public Safety Element Updates and Environmental Justice

4 Policies (*Program EIR"). In the Executive Summary, at page ES-1, the Program EIR describes

5 the project as including "(1) adopting and implementing an update of the Housing Element for the

6 2021-2029 planning period; (2) adopting and implementing a Public Safety Element update;
(3) developing associated environmental justice policies; (4) updating the Zoning Code and

8 Specific Plans to address the requirements of the 6th Regional Housing Needs Assessment
(RHNA) cycle."

29.

10 In Chapter 1, at page 1-5, the Program EIR states that it is a program-level EIR

11 "that would not provide individual project approvals or entitlements for any specific private or

12 public development or infrastructure project." In Chapter 2, Project Description, at pages 2-4 and

13 2-5, the Program EIR describes the City's Innovation District as a new, cutting-edge mixed-use

14 district within its description of "Opportunity Sites" for new housing to meet its RHNA

15 allocation. Figure 2-5, Opportunity Sites within the Innovation District, delineates the Innovation

16 it District, showing that it encompasses the Historic Industrial District and areas south, east and
northeast of the Historic Industrial District.

17 30.

18 The Program EIR did not analyze, assess the significance of, consider alternatives

19 to, or identify mitigation measures for the potential environmental impacts of the City's creation

20 of its Innovation District or the Innovation District Vision Plan, or of the ID Overlay Zone or of

21 the Triangle Master Plan. The Program EIR did not include a copy of or make any attempt to

22 analyze the environmental effects created by the changes contemplated by the Innovation District

23 Vision Plan or the proposed Triangle Master Plan. The Program EIR also did not include a draft

24 the IDJOverlay Zone regulations or associated map or analyze the environmental impacts
created by the changes contemplated those documents.

25 31.

26 The only reference to rezoning in the Program EIR was at page 2-9 of Chapter 2,

27 Project Description, where it stated that rezoning would occur only within "Opportunity Sites" to

28 permit multi-family and mixed-use designations that would allow the City to meet its RHNA

LOs ANCELES allocation. The depiction of the rezoning in the Historic Industrial District in Figure ES-4 in

1 Executive Summary, and in Figure 2-7 in Chapter 2/ Project Description, showed that only small

2 areas, not including the Project site, would be rezoned to allow for residential development! The

3 areas allowed for residential development under the ID Overlay Zone and the Triangle Master

4 Plan exceed these smaller areas, which is further evidence of the City's failure to, at any point,

5 analyze the environmental impacts created in the Historic Industrial District/Triangle District by

6 the changes associated with the Triangle Master Plan and the Overlay Zone.

7 32. Notably, the Program EIR did not include any indication that the industrial uses

8 currently allowed in the Historic Industrial District, including, without limitation, the industrial
warehouse and distribution uses planned for the Project, would be prohibited by the ID Overlay

10 Zone if adopted. Thus, the Program EIR also did not put Petitioner or any other property owner
11 in the Historic Industrial District on notice of the proposed changes in land use regulations that
12 would later be adopted.
13 33. Even though the ID Overlay Zone purports to change the zoning on the Property,
14 as well in the Historic Industrial District generally, Petitioner did not receive legally required

15 notice of the October 5, 2021 City Council meeting, or the October 19, 2021 City Council

16 meeting, or of the pending adoption of the ID Overlay Zone, or of the Innovation District Vision

17 Plan. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based upon such information and belief alleges,

18 that numerous other property owners within the Historic Industrial Area also did not receive

19 notice of the October 5, 2021 City Council meeting, or the October 19, 2021 City Council

20 meeting, or of the pending adoption of the ID Overlay Zone, or of the Innovation District Vision

21 Plan.

22 34. Had Petitioner known of the October 5, 2021 City Council meeting and the City

23 Council's consideration of the ID Overlay Zone, and the overwhelming changes in the land use

24 and zoning regulations that would occur in the Historic Industrial District if the City Council

25 adopted the ID Overlay Zone, Petitioner would have appeared at that meeting to object to the

26 City's adoption of the ID Overlay Zone, including, without limitation, on the grounds that the

27 ID Overlay Zone could not legally implement a purported master plan that was still in draft form

28 and had not been adopted by the City Council, as well as on the other grounds that Petitioner

raised during the City Council's consideration of the Triangle Master Plan on February 1, 2022,

2 as alleged below.

3 35. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based upon such information and belief,
† alleges that, had other owners of property in the Historic Industrial District known of the

5 October 5, 2021 City Council meeting and the City Council's consideration of the ID Overlay

6 Zone, and the overwhelming changes in the land use and zoning regulations that would occur in
the Historic Industrial District if the City Council adopted the ID Overlay Zone, those other

8 property owners, the buyers for their properties, and their respective representatives would also
have appeared at that meeting to object to the City's adoption of the ID Overlay Zone, including,
10 without limitation, on the grounds they raised during the City Council's consideration of the
Triangle Master Plan on February 1, 2022, as alleged below.
Triangle Master Plan ~
13 36. According to the Triangle Master Plan, the City intends the Historic Industrial † District, which is wholly encompassed by the Triangle District, to be "transformed into a
15 walkable, mixed-use area that encourages transit-supported, high density residential through a

16 regulatory framework that is streamlined, flexible and predictable." "The Master Plan sets out the

17 vision for the Triangle District for location to house technology-based jobs and work, Research

18 & Development, education, the arts, housing, and transportation alternatives." The Triangle

19 Master Plan divides the Historic Industrial District/Triangle District into five mixed-use sub-

20 districts, each of which emphasizes one use (either residential, employment or industrial) while

21 allowing certain specified other uses.

22 37. As alleged above, the City's Innovation District Vision Plan is included in the

23 Triangle Master Plan. At pages 7 through 9 7 of the Triangle Master Plan, the Triangle Master Plan

24 is described as the master plan for a specific geographical place, referred to as "the 3rd Street

25 Industrial Area" or "Freestyle Industrial Area," within the larger Innovation District.
26 38. On January 28, 2022, a Revised Agenda was posted for the February 1, 2022 City

27 Council meeting. Item No. 8 on that Agenda was the City Council's consideration of the Triangle

28 Master Plan for adoption, which was attached to the Agenda along with a report from the City's
10 DLA PIPER LLP (US)
LOS ANCELES
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
WEST 297913964.1

Community and Economic Development Department ("CEDD Report"), a full-page depiction of
Z the Innovation District Vision Plan and a Presentation regarding the development of the Triangle

Master Plan.

39. Neither the Revised Agenda for the February 1, 2022 City Council meeting, nor u the staff report for the meeting from the Community and Economic Development Department

6 attached or referred to either a CEQA document assessing the Triangle Master Plan's potential
environmental effects under CEQA along with associated findings and other required documents,

8 or a statement that the Triangle Master Plan was exempt from CEQA.

40. On February 1, 2022, the City Council held its meeting on the proposed Triangle
10 Master Plan and took public comment. During his presentation, the City's planner in charge of
the Triangle Master Plan project stated that the Triangle Master Plan envisions transforming the
12 Historic Industrial District/Triangle District, over time, into an area that encourages transit

13 supported, high-density residential using innovative and freestyle regulations and development

14 standards. He explained that the cart came before the horse - in other words, that the ID Overlay

15 Zone was approved before the Triangle Master Plan, which the ID Overlay Zone was supposed to

16 implement - because the Housing Element Update "was moving faster than we were." He

17 acknowledged, however, that the Triangle Master Plan is the governing document, which the

18 ID Overlay Plan is intended to implement.
19 41. Petitioner, other property owners in the Historic Industrial Area/Triangle District

20 and other interested parties objected to the proposed adoption due to, inter alia, the City's failure

21 to comply with CEQA and the incompatibility of the uses required by the Triangle Master Plan

22 with the existing uses and existing conditions in the Historic Industrial District/Triangle District,

23 including hazardous waste contamination that had not been disclosed or analyzed in any CEQA

24 environmental analysis addressing the Triangle Master Plan. Among other comments, Petitioner

25 commented that the Regional Board had told Petitioner that its Property would not be remediated

26 to residential standards and, therefore, could not be redeveloped with residential uses in

27 accordance with a future deed restriction. Another owner of property within the Historic

28 Industrial District/Triangle District commented that its property is also contaminated, must also
11 DLA PIPER LLP (US)
LOS ANCELES
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
WEST\297913964.1

pe temediated, but also would not be remediated to residential standards and subject to a deed

2 restriction. A prospective owner of property located within the Historic Industrial

3 District/Triangle District commented that the groundwater contamination at the property it is
contracted to purchase will take decades to remediate and that the Regional Board has told it that,

5 even after remediation, title to the property will be encumbered with a restriction prohibiting its
development for residential, school and public park uses. A real estate broker commented that he

7 is familiar with and has sold properties located within the Historic Industrial District/Triangle

8 District, that many of them are contaminated and are not suitable for the residential, public park
and school uses called for by the Triangle Master Plan.

10 42. During the meeting, the City responded to Petitioner's and other comments by

11 claiming, among other things, that (1) because the Triangle Master Plan is a policy document, it is

12 not a "project" as defined by CEQA, § 21065(a) or CEQA Guidelines, § 15378(a), and therefore

13 no CEQA compliance was required prior to approval of the Triangle Master Plan, and (2) all soil

14 and groundwater contamination in the properties to be redeveloped in the Historic Industrial

15 District/Triangle District could assuredly be remediated to residential standards, despite the

16 information Petitioner and other property owners had received from the Regional Board to the

17 contrary regarding their respective properties, and even though the City is unaware of the actual

18 levels of contamination in the Historic Industrial District/Triangle District since the type and level

19 of contamination in that area has not been analyzed.

20 43. The City Council approved the Triangle Master Plan at its February 1, 2022

21 hearing, with one dissenting vote. In connection with the City's approval of the Triangle Master

22 Plan, no CEQA document was prepared by the City that assessed the Triangle Master Plan's

23 potential environmental effects, nor did the City find the Triangle Master Plan to be exempt from

24 CEQA. The City did not file a Notice of Determination or a Notice of Exemption following a its

25 approval of the Triangle Master Plan.

26 STANDING AND EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

27 44. Petitioner is the record owner of the Property, which is located within the Historic

28 Industrial District/Triangle District of the Innovation District and within the area encompassed by

[2] 45. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law

3 unless this Court grants the requested relief herein.
+n 46. Petitioner has exhausted all available non-judicial remedies by providing
comments, objections, and live testimony during the administrative approval process for the

6 Triangle Master Plan. No additional available administrative procedures are available to
Petitioner. Additionally, a true and correct copy of the letter served on the City giving written

11 required by California Code of Civil Procedure, Section 388 is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.

12 47. The City failed 1o provide proper notice of administrative hearings related to its

13 adoption of the ID Overlay Zone in violation of Government Code Section 60591 and RMC

14 Section 19.670.040. Accordingly, to the extent the City contends that administrative appeals are

15 or were available, Petitioner was prevented from exhausting its administrative remedies due to the

16 City's failure to provide notice as required by law.

17 PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL

18 48. In pursuing this Action, Petitioner has been forced to incur attorneys' fees and
19 other costs and expenses. In pursuing this Action, which involves the enforcement of important

20 rights affecting the public interest, Petitioner will confer a substantial benefit on the general

21 public and the citizens of Riverside County, and therefore is entitled to recover its attorneys' fees

3 and its effects become irreversible. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14 ["CEQA Guidelines"], § 15002,
4 subd. (d).)

51. CEQA applies 1o governmental action, including activities directly undertaken by

6 a governmental agency, such as the City. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15002, subd. (b)(1).)

52. CEQA and its implementing administrative regulations, the CEQA Guidelines,

8 "establish a three-tier process to ensure that public agencies inform their decision with
environmental considerations.... The first tier is jurisdictional, requiring that an agency conduct a

10 preliminary review to determine whether an activity" is a "project" as defined by CEQA. (Muzzy

11 Ranch Co. v. Solano County Airport Land Use Com. (2007) 41 Cal.4th 372, 379-380; CEQA

12 Guidelines, § 15060(c).)

13 53. CEQA Guidelines, Section 21065 defines a "project" as "an activity which may

14 cause either a direct or indirect physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable

15 indirect physical change in the environment, and which is any of the following: . . . (a) An

16 activity directly undertaken by any public agency."

17 54. CEQA Guidelines, Section 15378(a)(1) defines a "project" as "the whole of the

18 action, which has a potential for resulting in either a direct physical change in the environment, or

19 a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment, and that is any of the
20 following: . . . (1) An activity directly undertaken by any public agency including but not limited

21 to ... enactment and amendment of zoning ordinances, and the adoption and amendment of local

22 General Plans or elements thereof pursuant to Government Code, Sections 65100-65700." The

23 City's decisions approving the Innovation District and the Innovation District Vision Plan, and its

24 adoption of implementing documents including the ID Overlay Zone and Triangle Master Plan,

25 were all discretionary acts as defined by CEQA, and each is a "project" as defined by CEQA.

26 Further, all are part of a single discretionary project ("Innovation District Project") as defined by

27 CEQA.

55. As shown by the-City's Innovation District Vision, the Triangle Master Plan and
2 ID Overlay Zone, the Innovation District Project will fundamentally change the land uses,

3 density, intensity a and governing zoning regulations in a large area of Riverside. Looking just at
the Historic Industrial District/Triangle District, the Triangle Master Plan slates that District for

5 conversion to substantial residential use, stating "Housing would also be focused in this area to

6 help the City meet its Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) obligations that includes a
minimum of 18,458 units. Combined with the possible inclusionary housing policy, both market

8 rate and affordable housing could be realized in the Triangle [District]."

56. With respect to Petitioner's Property, the ID Overlay Zone would require a
10 minimum floor area of 2.0, which would in turn require a building of at least 1.2 million square
11 feet. Thus, at minimum, the ID Overlay Zone requires the development of a new building that is
12 Six times the size of Petitioner's Project.
13 57. Such fundamental changes will have significant adverse environmental effects that
14 the City was legally required to analyze and, if possible, mitigate before it approved any
15 component of the Innovation District Project. Yet, without any CEQA analysis, the City has
16 formulated policy and adopted plans and regulations that have entirely changed the land uses

17 allowed within the Historic Industrial District/Triangle District. Such actions have prohibited the

18 warehouse and distribution industrial use permitted for decades prior to the City's adoption of the

19 ID Overlay Zone. The City adopted these policies, plans and regulations, including, inter alia,

20 requiring that residential uses, schools and public open space and children's parks be located on

21 contaminated land previously occupied by industrial uses, without having ascertained the exact

22 nature and level of the contamination in the Historic Industrial District/Triangle District and

23 without having determined that the contamination would or otherwise feasibly could be

24 remediated to residential standards such that the City's policies and goals could be met.

25 58. For example, the Regional Board has informed Petitioner that its Property in the

26 Historic Industrial District/Triangle District would not be remediated to meet residential use

27 standards. Therefore, there is substantial evidence that the City's adoption of the Triangle Master

28 Plan and the ID Overlay Plan, which envision the development of primarily residential uses on
DLA PIPER LLP (US) 15
LOs ANCELES
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
WEST\297913964.1

Petitioner's Property, will have significant and unavoidable impacts on the environment impacts

2 that the City has not analyzed under CEQA.

3 59. Further, the condition of Petitioner's Property, the comments from other owners of
t property in the Historic Industrial District/Triangle District regarding the contamination of their
5 property, the Regional Board's conclusion that remediation will result in restrictions against

6 residential and other sensitive uses in the future, and the comments from persons knowledgeable

7 about the contaminated condition of properties in the Historic Industrial District/Triangle District

8 made at the February 1, 2022 City Council meeting also provide substantial evidence that the

9 Triangle Master Plan and the ID Overlay Plan, which allow the development of either primarily

10 residential uses or civic space for parks and schools on a substantial number of other properties in

11 the Historic Industrial District/Triangle District currently used for industrial uses, may also have

12 significant and unavoidable impacts on the environment, none of which impacts the City has

13 analyzed under CEQA.

14 60. Further, as the Triangle Master Plan and ID Overlay Zone disclose, the City plans

15 to convert the uses of the properties located within the Historic Industrial District/Triangle

16 District over time from industrial uses to, inter alia, sensitive uses such as residential, school and

17 park uses. That means that, for some number of years, if not decades, new sensitive uses would

18 co-exist adjacent to or near existing industrial uses. This juxtaposition of incompatible uses

19 provides additional substantial evidence that the City's adoption of the Triangle Master Plan and

20 the ID Overlay Plan may create potentially significant environmental impacts that the City has

21 not analyzed under CEQA.

22 61. The City's determination that the Triangle Master Plan was not a project under

23 CEQA was legal error.

24 62. The City's failure to analyze and address the potential adverse environmental

25 effects of the whole of the Innovation District Project, including the Innovation District Vision

26 Plan, the Triangle Master Plan and the ID Overlay Zone, under CEQA was legal error. The

27 City's adoption of the ID Overlay Zone, specifically intended to implement the Triangle Master

28 Plan, before adopting the Triangle Master Plan, and the City's failure to analyze and address the
DLA PIPER LLP (US) 16
LOS ANCELES
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

potential adverse environmental effetts of the Triangle Master Plan, as implemented by the
ID Overlay Zone, under CEQA prior to adoption was legal error. The City's failure to analyze
and address the potential adverse environmental effects of the Triangle Master Plan under CEQA

5 prior to its adoption was legat error. The City's failure to analyze and address the potential

6 adverse environmental effects of the ID Overlay Zone under CEQA prior to its adoption was legal

7 error. The City also improperly "pre-committed" to the Triangle Master Plan without having

8 conducted a valid CEQA analysis on its potential environmental impacts at the time it approved

9 the ID Overlay Zone. The City was required to analyze and address the potential environmental

10 effects of the whole of the Innovation District Project, including each of its components, before
creating or approving any component of the Innovation District Project, including, without

N limitation, the ID Overlay Zone, or the Triangle Master Plan, and, by failing to do so, the City
violated CEQA.
13 63.
14 The City's action adopting the Triangle Master Plan and the ID Overlay Zone

15 without having complied with CEQA, as alleged above, constitute a prejudicial abuse of
discretion under CEQA.
16 64.

17 Petitioner is entitled to, and seeks, the issuance of a writ of mandate, a temporary

18 restraining order and/or preliminary injunction and permanent injunction, each commanding the

19 City to set aside its approval of the Triangle Master Plan and its approval of the ID Overlay Zone;

20 to determine the appropriate CEQA document to analyze and address the potential environmental

21 impacts of the whole of the Innovation Project under CEQA; to properly describe the baseline

22 conditions and analyze all of the environmental impacts of the Innovation District Project; to

23 reach significance conclusions based on substantial evidence; to recommend feasible and

24 enforceable mitigation measures; and to follow all applicable legal requirements for full public

25 participation in the City's decision-making process; and, in addition, forbidding the City from

26 taking any action to approve or implement the Innovation Project, or any portion or component

27 thereof, including, without limitation, the ID Overlay Zone and Triangle Master Plan, until such

W †4n SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
(Writ of Mandate Pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure § 1085the ID Overlay
Zone is Unconstitutionally Vague)

6 (Against Respondent City of Riverside)

7 65. Petitioner refers to and incorporates herein by reference, as though fully set forth

8 herein, Paragraphs 1 through 64 of this Petition.

66. Petitioner has clear, present and beneficial interest in the issuance of a writ of
10 mandate by virtue of the facts set forth herein, in that it is adversely affected by the actions of the
Respondent and its adoption of the ID Overlay Zone. Petitioner has a beneficial interest in
12 ensuring that the ID Overlay Zone is not enforced so as to deprive it of its constitutional, statutory

13 and other rights.

14 67. In accordance with the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. and

15 California Constitutions, civil statutes "must be sufficiently clear as to give a fair warning of the

16 conduct prohibited, and they must provide a standard or guide against which conduct can be

17 uniformly judged by courts and administrative agencies." (Morrison V. State Bd. Of Ed. (1969)

18 Cal.3d 214, 231.)

19 68. The ID Overlay Zone is codified in newly adopted provisions of the City's zoning

20 code-RMC Sections 19.1.170.010 through 19.170.090. The ID Overlay Zone encompasses the

21 Historic Industrial District/Triangle District. (RMC Section 191.170.020(A).)

22 69. The City purportedly created the ID Overlay Zone to "[e]nable and encourage new

23 development in the Overlay Zone area." However, the ID Overlay Zone is impermissibly vague

24 and ambiguous, so as to cause confusion and uncertainty for property owners and frustrate their

25 efforts to redevelop their properties and thus discourages economic growth within the area

26 encompassed by the ID Overlay Zone. The ID Overlay Zone, on its face and as applied to

27 Petitioner, is unconstitutionally vague, ambiguous and uncertain in violation of due process of the

28 law. Therefore, it is void.

70.

2 For the reasons alleged below, the ID Overlay Zone is impermissibly vague,
ambiguous and uncertain, on its face and as applied, because it: (1) fails to identify any standards,
criteria or guidelines as to when it "may" or "may not" be applied; (2) fails to adequately identify
and define the properties located within each of the sub-districts and the regulations that apply to
those properties; (3) fails to define or explain key terms; and (4) fails to contain clear

7 implementation language and to reconcile its provisions and requirements with the provisions and
requirements of the Base Zoning.

8 The ID Overlay Zone Regulations are Unconstitutionally Vague As They Are

10 Permissive, Not Mandatory, Lack Standards or Guidelines, and Therefore Invite

= Arbitrary and Selective Enforcement

71.
12 RMC Section 19.170.020(A) provides, "[t]he Innovation District (ID) Overlay

13 Zone may be applied to the area bounded to the west by the State Route 91, to the north by State

14 Route 60/Interstate 215, and to the south by Third Street. The ID Overlay Zone may be applied in

15 combination with any existing Base Zone." (RMC § 19.170.020 (A) (emphasis added).)

16 According to RMC Section 19.060.030, when interpreting the language of the RMC, '[t]he words

"shall". "must". will .. are always mandatory .

17 and "may" is permissive." Therefore, RMC

18 Section 191.170.020(A) in fact provides that the regulations of the ID Overlay Zone may or may

19 not be applied to the properties within the Historic Industrial District/Triangle District and that

20 the regulations of the ID Overlay Zone may or may not be applied in combination with any
existing Base Zone.

21 72.

22 Due to the ID Overlay Zone's permissive language regarding the area to which the

23 regulations of the ID Overlay Zone apply, the City may exercise its discretion to determine

24 whether to apply, or not apply, and to enforce, or not enforce, the requirements of the ID Overlay

25 Zone on properties located within the Historic Industrial District/Triangle District. Yet, the

26 ID Overlay Zone regulations contain no standards or guidelines to assist the City, when

27 exercising its discretion, in determining when application of the ID Overlay Zone's regulations is

28 appropriate or required. As such, any decision made by the City to apply or not apply, and to

DLA PIPER LLP (US)
LOS ANCELES 19

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
WEST\297913964.1

enforce or not enforce, the requirements of the ID Oyerlay Zone on properties located within the
2 Historic Industrial Distridt/Triangle District is and will be, by definition, arbitrary.

3 73. Further, it is also impossible to determine under what circumstances, how or what
† portions of the ID Overlay Zone regulations would be "combined" with the existing Base Zoning

5 to regulate development of the properties within the Historic Industrial District/Triangle District,

6 as provided in RMC Section 19.170.020(A), and the language of the ID Overlay Zone contains no
standards or guidance to assist the City, when exercising its discretion, in "combining" the two.

8 As such, any decision made by the City to combine or not combine, and to enforce or not enforce,
the combined requirements of the ID Overlay Zone and the Base Zone on one or more properties

10 located within the Historic Industrial District/Triangle District is and will be, by definition,

11 arbitrary. In its application of the ID Overlay Zone and without any explanation, the City

12 declined to allow Petitioner to utilize Base Zoning for its Project.

13 74. Further, RMC Section 19.170.020(A) provides that the ID Overlay Zone does not

14 eliminate or replace the existing zoning, but instead is intended to overlay the Base Zoning or

15 work in combination with Base Zoning. However, the ID Overlay Zone and Base Zoning are

16 directly in conflict with one another and, as such, cannot be reconciled. For instance, the

17 Property's underlying Base Zoning is General Industrial (I), which expressly prohibits residential

18 uses. (RMC § 19.130.025 ["The following uses are specifically prohibited in any industrial zone:

19 1. Any residential use other than permitted caretaker housing . .."].) However, the Property
20 appears to be located within two different ID Overlay Zone sub-districts entitled Employment

21 Emphasis and Housing Emphasis, both of which promote and encourage residential uses. (RMC

22 §§ 19.170.030 -19.170.060.) The residential uses allowed at the Property under the ID Overlay

23 Zone's two sub-districts cannot be reconciled (either overlaid or combined) with the Base

24 Zoning's absolute prohibition against residential uses - particularly, as alleged above, when

25 residential uses will be prohibited at the Property even after the remediation at the Property has

26 concluded. For this reason, as well, the ID Overlay Zone is overly vague and ambiguous and

27 invites arbitrary application and enforcement.

28
20 DLA PIPER LLP (US)
LOS ANGELES
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
WEST\297913964.1

75. Further, according to RMC Section 191.170.020(B), the purpose of the ID Overlay
2 Zone is to "implement[] the intent and guidelines in the ID Master Plan document." However, as
alleged above, when the City adopted the ID Overlay Zone, it had not adopted the Triangle
Master Plan. Hence, the ID Overlay Zone was adopted to implement guidelines that did not yet
5 exist, or that existed merely in a draft form that was subject to change.

6 76. Accordingly, the language of the ID Overlay Zone, among other things, fails to
give Petitioner sufficient notice or reasonable certainty of the zoning regulations governing its

8 Property, how such regulations would be applied by the City, by who and under what standards.
Similarly, the language of the ID Overlay Zone, among other things, fails to give all other

10 property owners within the Historic Industrial District/Triangle District sufficient notice or

11 reasonable certainty of the zoning regulations governing their properties, how such regulations

12 would be applied by the City, by who and under what standards.

13 77. For each and all of these reasons, the ID Overlay Zone is unconstitutionally vague

14 both on its face and as applied.

15 The ID Overlay Zone Is Unconstitutionally Vague, Ambiguous, Uncertain and

16 Unintelligible for Failing to Clearly Delineate the Boundaries of the Sub-Districts It

17 Creates, and, Therefore, Failing to Give Property Owners Proper Notice of Which

18 Sub-Districts' Regulations Govern Their Properties

19 78. RMC Section 19.170.030 creates five sub-districts within the Historic Industrial

20 District/Triangle District encompassed by the ID Overlay Zone. However, because the

21 ID Overlay Zone does not clearly delineate the boundaries of these sub-districts, in many cases it

22 is impossible to determine in which sub-district a property is located and, therefore, which

23 regulations apply to it. For these reasons, too, the ID Overlay Zone is impermissibly vague,

24 ambiguous, uncertain and unintelligible.

25 79. While the City purported to amend its Zoning Map when it adopted the ID Overlay

26 Zone on October 19, 2021, under Case No. PR-2021-001058, the "map" included in the record is

27 unintelligible as it does not align with the legal lot lines of the properties located within the

28 Historic Industrial District/Triangle District encompassed by the ID Overlay Zone, including but
DLA PIPER LLI (US) 21
LOS ANGELES
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
WEST \297913964.1

not limited to Petitioner's Property. A true and correct copy of the map included in Ordinance

2 No. 7574 is attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference as Exhibit 3.

3 80. Among the defects in the sub-districts, the boundaries of the sub-districts are
arbitrary and, as a result, many lots are placed within multiple sub-districts. Pursuant to RMC
Sections 19.170.040 through 19.170.070, each sub-district has its own distinct permitted uses,

6 building intensity and location standards, development standards, and required land use

7 approvals. As alleged above, Petitioner's Property is an example of one lot that has apparently

8 been included it in two sub-districts, as it appears to be included in both an Employment Emphasis
sub-district and Housing Emphasis sub-district, both of which promote and encourage

10 residential uses, which will be prohibited on the Property following its remediation, but neither of

11 which allows warehouse and distribution facilities such as that proposed by Petitioner. (RMC
12 §§ 19.170.030 -19.170.060.) Therefore, in Petitioner's case, for example, it is impossible to

13 reconcile the conflicting permitted uses and development standards for the Employment

14 Emphasis sub-district and the Housing Emphasis sub-district, both of which apply to Petitioner's

15 Property. Given the uncertain boundaries of the sub-districts and the fact that those boundaries

16 appear to be set without regard to property boundaries, Petitioner's situation is not uncommon.

17 81. Confounding these problems, RMC Sections 19.170.30 and 19.170.040 provide

18 that the uses that are prohibited within the sub-districts are set forth in "Table 19.240.030" of the

19 RMC. However, "Table 19.240.030" in the RMC is an entirely unrelated section in the code that

20 instead governs Adult-Oriented Businesses.

21 82. Accordingly, the ID Overlay Zone creates "sub-districts" with undefined

22 boundaries and, therefore, with vague and unambiguous requirements for the properties within

23 the Historic Industrial District/Triangle District that are located in one or more of the sub-

24 districts. As such, the ID Overlay Zone fails to provide property owners with proper and

25 adequate notice of the sub-district in which their properties are located and of the particular

26 regulations that apply to their properties under the ID Overlay Zone.

27 83. For each and all of these reasons, the ID Overlay Zone is unconstitutionally vague,

28 ambiguous, uncertain and unintelligible on its face and as applied.

W 84. RMC Section 19.170.020(E) provides that "[t]he ID Overlay Zone authorizes
existing and entitled industrial and manufacturing land uses to continue and expand as legal,

6 conforming land uses until such time as they are converted to uses permitted in the applicable
ID Overlay Zone Sub-District as set forth in Section 19.240.040 (Permitted Uses)."

7 85.

8 It is unclear what is meant in RMC Section 19.170.020(E) by "existing and
entitled industrial land uses" and whether these terms refer only to existing and entitled

10 structures or to existing and entitled land uses. For example, it is unclear whether RMC

11 Section 19.170.020(E) allows Petitioner to expand the existing and entitled industrial land use at

12 the Property by redeveloping the Property with a new, wholly industrial project as a "legal,

13 conforming land use, or if RMC Section 19.170.020(E) only allows Petitioner to maintain or
expand the existing and entitled industrial structure{s] at the Property.

THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

(Writ of Mandate Pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure § 1085Violation of
Planning and Zoning Laws)
(Against Respondent City of Riverside)

5 89. Petitioner refers to and incorporates herein by reference as though fully set forth

6 herein Paragraphs 1 through 88 of this Petition.

7 90. The State Planning and Zoning Law and the City of Riverside Municipal Code

8 require that zoning ordinances and other land use decisions made by the City be consistent with

9 its General Plan. However, the City's ID Overlay Zone is inconsistent with and frustrates the

10 City's General Plan 2025 (the "General Plan"), prohibiting industrial land uses that are the

11 primary intent of the General Plan's applicable land use designation for the Property and

12 numerous other industrial properties in the Historic Industrial District.

13 91. Under the General Plan Land Use and Urban Design Element, the land use

14 designation that applies to the Property and various other properties in the core of the Historic

15 Industrial District is "Industrial." The General Plan Land Use and Urban Design Element states,

16 10 Table LU-3, that the Industrial designation's "primary intent" is "[m]anufacturing and

17 wholesaling" to "support commercial uses" and "limited large warehouse and distribution

18 facilities."

19 92. The City's ID Overlay Zone improperly conflicts with this applicable General Plan

20 designation by prohibiting the very industrial uses - manufacturing, wholesaling, warehousing

21 and distribution uses that are the primary intent of the General Plan designation to promote at

22 the Property and other similarly situation locations in the Historic Industrial District. As such, the

23 ID Overlay Zone is invalid as a matter of state law.

24 93. Moreover, the General Plan Land Use and Urban Design Element identifies

25 Citywide objectives and policies to preserve industrial land in order to encourage economic

26 growth, generate new jobs and avoid encroachments of incompatible land uses within the

27 proximity of industrial land.

28

DLA PIPER LLP (US) 24
LOS ANCELES
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
WEST \297913964.1

94. For instance, Policy LU-24.2 requires the City to "[s]utictly limit any
2 redesignations or rezoning of land from industrial use. Avoid encroachments of incompatible land

3 uses within clbse proximity of industrial land."

95. Additionally, Policy LU-24.4 requires the City 1o "[d]evelop a Citywide strategy
for the economic development of industrial land."

96. By rezoning the Historic Industrial District/Triangle District to preclude any
industrial use throughout most of that District and prohibit all heavy industrial uses throughout

8 the entire Historic Industrial District/Triangle District, the ID Overlay Zone directly conflicts with
these clear policies protecting industrial-zoned land and encouraging the economic benefits that

10 industrial uses on industrial land bring and discourages economic growth.

11 97. Based on the foregoing, the City's findings that the ID Overlay Zone is consistent

12 with the General Plan and other planning and zoning laws are not supported by substantial

13 evidence. The City erred and abused its discretion by adopting the ID Overlay Zone in

14 contravention of the law.

15 98. Accordingly, Petitioner requests that this Court issue writ of mandate setting

16 aside the City's adoption of the ID Overlay Zone, and enjoining the City, and each of its

17 respective elected and appointed officials, officers, employees, from implementing, enforcing or

18 seeking to enforce the ID Overlay Zone.

25 and Respondent concerning the respective rights, duties and obligations of the parties regarding

26 the validity and enforceability of the ID Overlay Zone, including as alleged above.

2 so vague and ambiguous that a person of ordinary intelligence must guess at its meaning and City

3 officials may apply or enforce the ID Overlay Zone in vague and subjective ways. Accordingly,
the ID Overlay Zone is unconstitutional on its face. On the other hand, the City denies

4 Petitioner's contentions.

5 102. Petitioner further contends that the ID Overlay Zone is invalid insofar as is it

6 implements an invalid Triangle Master Plan. On this basis, Petitioner seeks a judicial

7

g determination that the ID Overlay Zone is invalid, void and unenforceable. On the other hand, the
City denies Petitioner's contentions.

9 103.

10 A judicial declaration is necessary and appropriate at this time for Petitioner to
ascertain its rights and obligations with respect to the development of the Property.

S 104. Petitioner seeks a judicial declaration that the ID Overlay Zone is
unconstitutionally vague and there fore void, and is invalid, void and unenforceable on the

13

14 additional grounds that it implements the invalid Triangle Master Plan. Therefore, the City may

15 not enforce these provisions against Petitioner or other property owners within the ID Overlay

Zone area.

24 Court restrains Respondent through injunctive relief, Respondent's actions shall continue to

expose Petitioner to irreparable harm.

25 107.

26 Petitioner is entitled to a temporary restraining order, a preliminary injunction and

27 a permanent injunction enjoining the City, and each of their respective elected and appointed

28 officials, officers, employees from implementing and enforcing or seeking to enforce the

DLA PIPER LLP (US) ID Overlay Zone and Triangle Master Plan.

108.

2 Petitioner is likely to succeed on the merits of its claims because the ID Overlay

3 Zone is unconstitutionally vague, ambiguous and uncertain and is therefore void. In addition, as

4 alleged above, both were approved illegally by the City without having complied with CEQA.

109.

5 Unless this Court issues injunctive relief prohibiting the implementation and

6 enforcement of the ID Overlay Zone and/or the Triangle Master Plan, Petitioner will suffer
irreparable harm, including, without limitation, the loss of its constitutional rights, as well as

8 economic opportunities related to the development of its Property, and Petitioner and the public
will suffer irreparable harm in that the City will be implementing and enforcing plans and

5=3 it regulations that it has illegally adopted without having complied with CEQA.
SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION

(Writ of Mandate Pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure § 1085--Violation of

13 California Government Code Section § 65091 and RMC § 19.670.040)
(Against Respondent City of Riverside)

14 110.

15 Petitioner refers to and incorporates herein by reference, as though fully set forth
herein, Paragraphs through 109 of this Petition.

16 111.

17 Pursuant to California Government Code Section 65091, the City was required to

18 mail or deliver written notice to Petitioner of the October 5, 2021 City Council hearing related to
its approval of the ID Overlay Zone at least ten days prior to the hearing.

19 112.

20 Similarly, RMC Section 19.670.040 required the City to deliver or mail written

21 notice of the hearing to Petitioner because the hearing involved a zoning code amendment

22 "affecting the permitted uses or intensity of uses of real property," which affected less than
1,000 owners within the ID Overlay Zone area.

23 113.

24 Notwithstanding the notice requirements mandated by state and local law, the City

25 failed to mail or deliver written notice of its October 19, 2021 hearing, wherein it approved the

26 ID Overlay Zone, depriving Petitioner the opportunity to participate in the public process in
violation of due process.

27 114.

28 Petitioner has a beneficial interest in ensuring that the ID Overlay Zone is not

DLA PIPER LLP (US) enforced so as to deprive it of its constitutional, statutory and other rights.

115. At all times relevant to this action, Respondent had the ability to perform the

2 duties set forth herein, and has failed and refused to perform its legal duties. Respondent has

3 acted arbitrarily, capriciously, and without evidentiary support in refusing to carry out or

4 discharge its mandatory duties as alleged herein. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate

5 remedy at law and therefore requests writ relief 1o set aside the City's adoption of the ID Overlay

6 Zone.

7 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

8 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for relief against Respondent, as follows:
6 :50 1. For a peremptory writ of mandate, a temporary restraining order and/or
preliminary injunction and a permanent injunction, each commanding Respondent
City of Riverside to set aside its approval of the Triangle Master Plan and its
approval of the ID Overlay Zone; to determine the appropriate CEQA document to
analyze and address the potential environmental impacts of the whole of the
14 Innovation Project under CEQA; to properly describe the baseline conditions and
15 analyze all of the environmental impacts of the Innovation District Project; to
D! reach significance conclusions based on substantial evidence; to recommend
17 feasible and enforceable mitigation measures; and to follow all applicable legal
18 requirements for full public participation in the City's decision-making process;
19 and, in addition, forbidding the City from taking any action to approve or
20 implement the Innovation Project, or any portion or component thereof, including,
684 without limitation, the ID Overlay Zone and Triangle Master Plan, until such time,
if ever, as the City has adopted a CEQA-compliant document that analyzes all of
the potential adverse impacts of the whole of the Innovation District Project and
24 assesses their significance, and identifies feasible mitigation measures that

25 minimize its significant impacts;

26 2. That the Court a issue a peremptory writ of mandate directing Respondent City of

27 Riverside to set aside the City's adoption of the ID Overlay Zone, and enjoining

28 the City, and each of its respective elected and appointed officials, officers,

5 Government Code Section 65091 and RMC Section 19.670.040 in advance of any
6 hearing related to the ID Overlay Zone;
6Ñ=50 0 N 4. That the Court issue a declaratory judgment providing that the ID Overlay Zone is
unconstitutionally vague and therefore null and void, and is invalid, void and

enjoining the Respondent City of Riverside and its employees and agents from
implementing and enforcing the ID Overlay Zone and the Triangle Master Plan;
14 6. For a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to preserve the

16 7. For Petitioner's costs of suit and litigation expenses, including reasonable

17 attorneys' fees incurred herein under California Code of Civil Procedure,

19 law; and

20 8. For such other and further relief as this Court deems just and appropriate.
