Petition for Writ of Mandate

2

Petitioner, RIVERPARK COALITION ("Petitioner"), alleges through this Verified Petition for

4 Writ of Mandate ("Petition") as follows:

5
INTRODUCTION
6

7 1. Petitioner challenges the certification by Respondent City of Long Beach ("City" or

8 "Respondent") of an Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") and related discretionary approvals

9 including a Zone Change, Site Plan Review, Vesting Tentative Tract Map, Development Agreement

10 and General Plan Conformity Certification (together, the "Project Approvals") for the Riverpark

11 Planned Unit Development in the City of Long Beach ("Project"). The City violated the California

12 Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") by approving an EIR which inadequately analyzed a host of

13 impact areas, failed to identify significant impacts, failed to impose feasible mitigation measures and

14 failed to adequately respond to comments in violation of CEQA.

15 2. The Project is the development of a 226-unit residential Planned Unit Development

16 ("PUD") located on 15.53 acres of a 20.4-acre development site, with park to be developed on the

17 remaining 4.81 acres of the property. The 226 dwelling units consist of 74 two-story single family

18 detached units, 99 two-story row townhouses in 19 buildings and 53 three-story carriage townhouses

19 in eight buildings. Of the 53 carriage townhouses, 12 are proposed to be affordable to qualified very

20 low income households. The Project proposes a 4.81 acre park north of Baker Street adjacent to the

21 City's Baker Street Park.

22 3. During the administrative review process, several interested parties notified the City that the

23 EIR was deficient and failed to comply with the requirements of CEQA. In spite of these reasoned

24 comments in the record, the City granted the Project approvals and certified the EIR.

25 4. Petitioner requests that this Court vacate, set aside, rescind and void all of the Project

26 Approvals considered by Respondent, including rescinding any authorizations to proceed with
27 construction. The City failed to comply with the provisions of CEQA and therefore failed to proceed

28 in a manner required by law.
2
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

-

2 5. Petitioner seeks a Peremptory Writ of Mandate under California Code of Civil Procedure

3 section 1094.5, directing Respondent to vacate, rescind and set aside all Project Approvals and the
EIR because Respondent failed to comply with CEQA.

4

5 6. The City's approval of the Project will cause Petitioner irreparable injury for which

6 Petitioner has no adequate remedy at law. Petitioner and its members will be irreparably harmed by

7 the City's actions in approving the Project. Petitioner was harmed by, among other things, the failure

8 of the City to comply with the requirements of CEQA. Petitioner and its members will also be

9 irreparably harmed by the City's actions in granting the Project Approvals and certifying the EIR

10 including any authorization to proceed with construction based thereon.

11 7. The maintenance of this action is for the purpose of enforcing important public policies of

12 the State of California with respect to the protection of the environment under CEQA and

13 conformance with state law and local law. The maintenance and prosecution of this action will confer
a substantial benefit

14 upon the public by protecting the public from environmental and other harms

15 alleged in this Petition. Petitioner is acting as a private attorney general to enforce these public
policies and prevent such harm.

16

17 PARTIES

18

19 8. Riverpark Coalition ("Petitioner") is a nonprofit corporation which is a collection of

20 community groups and individuals including residents of western Long Beach. The Riverpark

21 Coalition works to promote public-serving open space in nature-deprived areas of western Long
Beach.

22

23 9. Petitioner and its respective members have a direct and substantial beneficial interest in

24 ensuring that Respondent complies with laws relating to environmental protection. Petitioner and its

25 respective members are adversely affected by Respondent's failure to comply with CEQA. Petitioner

26 has standing to assert the claims raised in this Petition because Petitioner and its members'

27 environmental interests are directly and adversely affected by Respondent's approval of the Project.

28 10. Respondent City of Long Beach is a municipal corporation and a charter city within the
State of California. The City is charged with the authority of regulating and administering local land
3
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

use and development within its territory in compliance with its General Plan as well as applicable

2 state laws including CEQA. The City is the lead agency under CEQA.
11. Petitioner is informed and believes and based thereon alleges that Real Party in Interest Oil

4 Operators Incorporated. is California corporation and the owner of the Project site.
12. Petitioner is informed and believes and based thereon alleges that The River Park Project

6 a Owner, LLC is a California limited liability company, the applicant for the Project entitlements and

7 the developer of the Project.

8 13. Petitioner is ignorant of the true names and capacities of Real Parties sued herein as DOES

9 1-25, inclusive, and therefore sues these Real Parties by fictitious names. Petitioner will amend this

10 Petition to allege the true names and capacities of fictitiously named Real Parties in Interest.

11 Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that each Respondent designated herein as a

12 DOE has some responsibility for the events and happenings alleged in this Petition.

13 14. Members of Petitioner and other interested persons made oral and written comments on

14 the Project and raised many of the legal deficiencies asserted in this petition.

15 JURISDICTION AND VENUE
16

17 15. This Court has jurisdiction over the writ action under section 1094.5 of the Code of Civil

18 Procedure, and sections 21168 and 21168.5 of the Public Resources Code.

19 16. This Court also has jurisdiction over the writ action under section 1085 of the Code of

20 Civil Procedure.

21 17. Venue for this action properly lies in the Los Angeles County Superior Court because

22 Respondent and the Project are located in Los Angeles County. Further, Venue is proper in this Court

23 pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Sections 393 and 394 because the Project is located in, and the

24 relevant events occurred in Los Angeles County.

25 PROJECT
26

27 18. The project site is located on the former Oil Operators Incorporated property at 712 Baker

28 Street, bounded by Wardlow Road on the south, Golden Avenue on the east, the San Diego Freeway

4
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

(I-405) on the north, and the Los Angeles County flood control channel parcels and the Los Angeles

2 River on the west. Baker Street bisects the project site from east to west, and this segment of Baker

3 Street is proposed to be vacated and incorporated into the Project. Baker Street currently functions as

4 a maintenance access road to the Los Angeles County-owned parcels to the west. The pedestrian,
cycling, and equestrian trails to the west of the project site are located on the Los Angeles County-

6 owned parcels and would be unaffected by the project. The City's Beach Baker Street Park is adjacent

7 to the east of the of the Project site. The City's Wrigley Heights Dog Park is adjacent to the southeast

8 of the proposed residential portion of the Project. Access to the Project site is taken from a driveway

9 directly on Wardlow Road, and from Baker Street west of Golden Avenue.

10 19. The north and west portion of the Project site is currently vacant, designated for 2-story
11 Founding and Contemporary Neighborhood (FCN) uses in the General Plan and zoned CS
12 (Commercial Storage). The east portion of the Project site is currently vacant, designated for 2-story

13 FCN uses in the General Plan, zoned CS and located within the Horse Overlay. The southwest portion

14 of the Project site is currently vacant, designated for 2-story FCN uses in the General Plan and zoned
15 R-1-N (Single Family Residential, standard lot).

16 20. East of the Project site is an existing residential small lot development designated for

17 2-story FCN uses in the General Plan and zoned R-1-S (Single Family Residential, small lot). North

18 of the Project site is the 405 Freeway. West of the Project site is the Los Angeles River and associated

19 trails. South of the Project site across Wardlow Road is an existing multifamily residential

20 development designated for MFR-L (Multiple Family Residential, Low Density) uses in the General

21 Plan.

22 21. Located immediately across the 405 Freeway from the Project site, the Project's census

23 tract in western Long Beach (census tract 6037572100) ranks worse than 89 percent of the rest of the

24 state for pollution burden, attributable to contaminated sites, solid waste and hazardous vehicle

25 emissions in the area. The Project area is also a designated "Disadvantaged Community" per

26 California Senate Bill (SB) 535. According to CalEnviroScreen 4.0, the area is a predominantly

27 Hispanic and Asian community that is over 76% people of color. The area has more people living
28 with asthma, emergency department visits for asthma symptoms, and deaths from asthma, than 92%

5
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

of census tracts throughout California.

2 22. The Project is the development of a 226-unit residential Planned Unit Development

3 ("PUD") located on 15.53 acres of a 20.4-acre development site, with a park to be developed on the

4 remaining 4.81 acres of the property. The 226 dwelling units consist of 74 two-story single family

5 detached units, 99 two-story row townhouses in 19 buildings and 53 three-story carriage townhouses

6 in eight buildings. Of the 53 carriage townhouses, 12 are proposed to be affordable to qualified very

7 low income households. The Project proposes a 4.81 acre park north of Baker Street adjacent to the

8 City's Baker Street Park.
23. The Project Approvals include the following:

10 Certification of the River Park Residential Project Environmental Impact Report
11 (EIR-07-20, SCH#2021020492);
Adoption of an ordinance approving a Zone Change (ZCHG20-002) from CS, CS (H),
12 and R-1-N to RP-15 and RP-15 (H);

13 Approval of Site Plan Review (SPR20-007) for construction of a new residential Planned Unit Development of 226 dwelling units consisting of 74 two-story detached
14 single-family homes on small condominium lots, 99 two-story row townhouses, and 53 three-story carriage townhouses, located on 15.53 acres of a 20.4-acre development
15 site, with a park to be developed on the remaining 4.81 acres of the property;

16 Approval of Vesting Tentative Tract Map No. 82712 (VTTM20-002) to create one master ground lot and 226 airspace lots, on a 20.4-acre development site;

17 Adoption of an ordinance approving a Development Agreement (DA20-001) between the City and Integral Communities, LLC; and,
18 • Adoption of a General Plan Conformity Certification (GPC21-003) for the vacation of

19 (1) Baker Street between Golden Avenue and the western edge of the project site, and (2) portions of unused right-of-way on Wardlow Road adjacent to the project site.

20 PROJECT BACKGROUND, ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW AND APPROVAL
21

22 24. On or about February 25, 2021, the City published the Notice of Preparation ("NOP"). The

23 comment period for the NOP closed on March 29, 2021. Twenty-six comments were received.

24 25. On or about March 24, 2021, the City held a scoping meeting for the EIR.

25 26. On or about January 18, 2022, the City published the Draft Environmental Impact Report

26 ("DEIR") for the Project. The publication period ended on or about March 21, 2022. Fifteen

27 comments were received.

28 27. On September 1, 2022, the Planning Commission voted 4 to to recommend to the City

6
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Council granting the Project Approvals and certifying the EIR. Members of Petitioner and numerous

2 members of the public submitted letters objecting to Project approval and identifying deficiencies in

3 the EIR.

4 28. On November 15, 2022 letter to City Council voted to grant the Project Approvals and

5 certify the EIR over the objections of members of Petitioner and other members of the public.

6
CEQA'S SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS
7

8 29. CEQA requires that an agency analyze the potential environmental impacts of its proposed

9 actions in an EIR (except in certain limited circumstances). (See, e.g., Pub. Resources Code, § 21100.)

10 The EIR is the very heart of CEQA. (Dunn-Edwards v. BAAQMD (1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 644, 652.)

11 "The 'foremost principle' in interpreting CEQA is that the Legislature intended the act to be read so

12 as to afford the fullest possible protection to the environment within the reasonable scope of the

13 statutory language." (Communities for a Better Environment v. Cal. Resources Agency (2002) 103

14 Cal.App.4th 98, 109 ("CBE v. CRA").)

15 30. CEQA has two primary purposes. First, CEQA is designed to inform decision makers and

16 the public about the potential, significant environmental effects of a project. (14 Cal. Code Regs.

17 ("CEQA Guidelines") § 15002(a)(1).) "Its purpose is to inform the public and its responsible officials
18 of the environmental consequences of their decisions before they are made. Thus, the EIR 'protects
19 not only the environment but also informed self-government.' (Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Board of
20 Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal. 3d 553, 564.) The EIR has been described as "an environmental 'alarm

21 bell' whose purpose it is to alert the public and its responsible officials to environmental changes

22 before they have reached ecological points of no return." (Berkeley Keep Jets Over the Bay V. Bd. of

23 Port Comm'rs. (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1344, 1354 ("Berkeley Jets"); County of Inyo v. Yorty (1973)
24 32 Cal.App.3d 795, 810.)

25 31. Second, CEQA requires public agencies to avoid or reduce environmental damage when

26 "feasible" by requiring "environmentally superior" alternatives and all feasible mitigation measures.
27 (CEQA Guidelines, § 15002(a)(2) and (3); See also Berkeley Jets, 91 Cal.App.4th at 1354; Citizens of

28 Goleta Valley, 52 Cal.3d at 564.) The EIR serves to provide agencies and the public with information

7
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

about the environmental impacts of a proposed project and to "identify ways that environmental

2 damage can be avoided or significantly reduced." (CEQA Guidelines, §15002(a)(2).) If the project

3 will have a significant effect on the environment, the agency may approve the project only if it finds

4 that it has "eliminated or substantially lessened all significant effects on the environment where

5 feasible" and that any unavoidable significant effects on the environment are "acceptable due to

6 overriding concerns." (Pub. Resources Code, § 21081; CEQA Guidelines, § 15092(b)(2)(A) & (B).)

7 32. While the courts review an EIR using an "abuse of discretion" standard, "the reviewing

8 court 1S not to 'uncritically rely on every study or analysis presented by a project proponent in support

9 of its position. A clearly inadequate or unsupported study is entitled to no judicial deference.'"

10 (Berkeley Jets, 91 Cal.App.4th at 1355 (emphasis added), quoting, Laurel Heights Improvement Assn.

11 V. Regents of University of California (1988) 47 Cal. 3d 376, 391 409, n. 12.)

12 33. The Court in Sierra Club V. Cty. of Fresno (2018) 6 Cal.5th 502, 510 (2018) also

13 emphasized at another primary consideration of sufficiency is whether the EIR "makes a reasonable

14 effort to substantively connect a project's air quality impacts to likely health consequences." (6

15 Cal.5th at 510.) "Whether or not the alleged inadequacy is the complete omission of a required

16 discussion or a patently inadequate one paragraph discussion devoid of analysis, the reviewing court

17 must decide whether the EIR serves its purpose as an informational document." (Id. at 516.) Although

18 an agency has discretion to decide the manner of discussing potentially significant effects in an EIR,

19 "a reviewing court must determine whether the discussion of a potentially significant effect is

20 sufficient or insufficient, i.e., whether the EIR comports with its intended function of including 'detail

21 sufficient to enable those who did not participate in its preparation to understand and to consider

22 999 (6 Cal.5th at 516, citing Bakersfield Citizens meaningfully the issues raised by the proposed project.

23 for Local Control v. City of Bakersfield (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1184, 1197.) "The determination

24 whether a discussion is sufficient is not solely a matter of discerning whether there is substantial

25 evidence to support the agency's factual conclusions." (6 Cal.5th at 516.)

26 34. In general, mitigation measures must be designed to minimize, reduce or avoid an

27 identified environmental impact or to rectify or compensate for that impact. (CEQA Guidelines

28 15370.) Where several mitigation measures are available to mitigate an impact, each should be
8
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

discussed and the basis for selecting particular measure should be identified. (Id. at

2 § 15126.4(a)(1)(B).) A lead agency may not make the required CEQA findings unless the
administrative record clearly shows that all uncertainties regarding the mitigation of significant

4 environmental impacts have been resolved.

5 35. Pursuant to CEQA, an accurate, stable and finite project description is the sine qua non

6 (absolutely indispensable requirement) of an informative and legally sufficient EIR. (County of Inyo v.

7 City of Los Angeles (1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 185, 193.) "A curtailed or distorted project description may

8 stultify the objectives of the reporting process." (Id. at pp. 192-193.)

9
EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES
10

11 36. During all phases of the Project's administrative review process, Petitioner commented to

12 the City that the Project failed to comply with CEQA.

13 37. As a result of these comments in the record, Petitioner exhausted its administrative

14 remedies within the meaning of Cal. Public Resources Code § 21177.

15 'IRST CAUSE OF ACTION
16

17 (Violation of CEQA)

18 38. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in their

19 entirety, as though fully set forth herein.

20

21 Biological Resources

22 39. The EIR claims, "While Southern Tarplant (Centromadia parryi) is known to occur in the

23 area, thorough surveys, conducted at different times of year, did not locate any specimens of this

24 specie." Further, the EIR did not even list it as a species with a likelihood of being found on the site.

25 The southern tarplant has a California Native Plant Society (CNPS) Rare Plant Rank of 1B.1 and is

26 considered a rare species under CEQA. The conclusions of the EIR's biological resources section are

27 curious, given that biological resources consultant LSA documented 830 individuals on the adjoining

28 property. During the environmental review process for the 3701 Pacific Place project, which would be

0
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

located next door to the Riverpark Project, LSA submitted an updated assessment of the tarplant

2 population. This assessment found, "when combining the results from 2019 and 2020, LSA has

3 estimated a total of approximately 830 southern tarplant individuals occurring within the project

4 limits, all of which would be permanently impacted by the proposed project." As a result of the EIR's

5 failure to disclose that Southern tarplant could potentially occupy the site, the Project fails to include

6 any mitigation for impacts to Southern tarplant individuals that may be present now or that could

7 colonize the site in the future. As the Department of Fish and Wildlife wrote in their comments on the

8 Notice of Preparation, "CDFW recommends avoiding any sensitive natural communities found on or

9 adjacent to the Project. CDFW also considers impacts to SSC [Species of Special Concern] a

10 significant direct and cumulative adverse effect without implementing appropriate avoid and/or

11 mitigation measures." CDFW continued, "The DEIR should include measures to fully avoid and

12 otherwise protect Sensitive Natural Communities from Project-related impacts. Project

13 implementation may result in impacts to rare or endangered plants or plant communities that have

14 been recorded adjacent communities as threatened habitats having both regional and local

15 significance." The EIR contains no such measures. The EIR must be revised to require
16 preconstruction surveys and measures to protect, in place, any tarplant individuals found.

17 40. The EIR failed to adequately address impacts or respond to comments regarding the

18 Burrowing Owl, bats and migratory birds. CA Fish and Wildlife requested more Burrowing Owl, bat

19 and migratory bird surveys be done. The City replied "their experts" said it was unnecessary. CDFW

20 letter also states: "Tree trimming and removal are also likely to impact bird species found to be

21 nesting or foraging among street trees. Habitat loss is one of the leading causes of native biodiversity

22 loss." Their advice was ignored.

23 41. The EIR failed to incorporate or adequately respond to comments from the Department of

24 Fish and Wildlife recommending a 3 to replanting ratio for removed native trees.

25 42. The EIR improperly concludes biological impacts would be less than significant because

26 the Project site consists of "disturbed vacant land." This response hides the ecologically significant

27 impact on the entire watershed of protecting this site from development. It would be mistake to

28 conceptualize empty lots as devoid of ecological values or habitat, as evidenced by the finding of
10
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Burrowing Owls (Athene cuniculara) - a California Species of Special Concern - in empty lots a mile

2 north and immediately adjacent to the Project site. The removal of ssome old foundations, roads, and

3 pipes [that] are still present on the site' could well destroy habitat for owls.

4
Hazards (Flooding)
5

6 43. The EIR omits adequate discussion of flood risk for the Project site. The Initial Study

7 indicates that the project site is not within a risk zone for a 100-year or a 500-year flood. FEMA have

8 been remapping stretches of the LA River to upwardly revise the flood risks. The EIR will need to

9 investigate whether there have been or are likely to be forthcoming changes to the thirteen-year-old

10 mapping that is currently published by FEMA for the area. The channelization of the Los Angeles

11 River was made necessary by developers building carelessly in the flood plain, yet the Project puts

12 people in harm's way. The EIR fails to address extensive litigation regarding flooding and flood

13 protection in recent years.

14
Land Use (Parks) 15

16 44. The EIR fails to disclose and analyze the Project's inconsistencies with land use plans
17 providing for parks development at the Project site. The Project site has been long designated as park

18 space by numerous land use plans, including the RiverLink Plan, Long Beach Department of Parks,

19 Recreation, and Marine Strategic Plan, West Long Beach Livability Implementation Plan, West Long
20 Beach I-710 Community Livability Plan, Los Angeles River Master Plan, and Lower Los Angeles

21 River Revitalization Plan.

22 45. RiverLink Plan. The RiverLink plan specifically stated for the "Wrigley Heights-South"

23 site that it "proposes that as much of the area as possible become an open space destination containing

24 a restored wetland, riparian woodland, pedestrian and bicycle paths, and a neighborhood park with a

25 playground, picnic areas, and other amenities (see Exhibit 21)." With the current proposed project and

26 others similar to it that put planned greenspace to other uses (such as the Riverwalk project in 2015),

27 RiverLink's designation of the site as public greenspace would never be achieved. Such an impact is

28 significant and must be disclosed in an EIR.

11
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

46. Long Beach Department of Parks, Recreation, and Marine Strategic Plan. According to the

2 Long Beach Department of Parks, Recreation of Marine's ("DPRM") 2003 Strategic Plan, the West
park district has only 1 acre of parkland per 1,000 residents, while the East park district has 16 acres

4 per 1,000 residents. To respond to this disparity, DPRM included Strategy 1.1 as part of its Strategic

5 Plan, which established a target of 8 acres per 1,000 residents. Strategy 1.1 identified 50 acres in

6 Wrigley Heights for park development. The City must maintain its commitment to provide much

7 needed park space in western Long Beach by reserving the Project site for park access.

8 47. West Long Beach Livability Implementation Plan. The West Long Beach Livability

9 Implementation Plan ("Livable West Long Beach") was adopted by the City in August 2015 as a

10 "comprehensive approach for achieving the community's vision for healthy, vibrant, attractive and

11 safe neighborhoods." The plan "identifies, prioritizes, and strategizes the implementation of projects

12 and initiatives that will provide a variety of neighborhood benefits including enhancements to the

13 community's physical environment . [and] a cleaner environment." Livable West Long Beach

14 identifies the Project site as the location of the Wrigley Heights Park Expansion and River Connector.

15 48. West Long Beach I-710 Community Livability Plan. The West Long Beach I-710

16 Community Livability Plan ("Livability Plan") was adopted in 2008 to address the environmental

17 impacts of the I-710 freeway on the neighborhoods within the I-710 corridor, including Wrigley

18 Heights. The plan designates the Project site as Wrigley Heights Park - South, as identified in the

19 Riverlink Plan.

20 49. Los Angeles River Master Plan. The final Los Angeles River Master Plan (LARMP),

21 which was updated in June 2022 and should have been reviewed while preparing the FEIR, also

22 designates the Project site as Wrigley Heights River Park, a "Planned Major Project."

23 50. Lower Los Angeles River Revitalization Plan. The Lower Los Angeles River

24 Revitalization Plan ("LLARRP") was the result of the Lower Los Angeles River Working Group, a

25 working group set forth by Assembly Bill 530 to develop a revitalization plan for the Lower Los

26 Angeles River watershed. The LLARRP identifies locations along the Los Angeles River for

27 revitalization. The LLARRP identifies the Project site -Wrigley Heights River Park - as the "gem of

28 the Lower LA River." The LLARRP calls the Project site a "blank canvas[] that present{s] a multitude
12
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

F of options for advancing the objectives of the plan elements. With its proximity to an unconfined

2 aquifer, this site has the potential for groundwater recharge - one of the few locations along the Lower

3 LA River where groundwater recharge is possible." The LLARRP identified the Wrigley Heights

4 River Park as an opportunity area for revitalization, and gave it a score of 98 out of 100 for potential.

5 The LLARRP also identified it as a "signature strategy" that is "exemplary of the multi-benefit,

6 community-driven planning process and capture the essence of the LLARRP."

7 51. General Plan. Under CEQA, lead agencies must analyze whether a proposed project is

8 inconsistent with applicable land use policies, such as the governing general plan. (Cal. Code Regs,

9 tit. 14 ("CEQA Guidelines") § 15125, subd. (d).) A significant land use impact requires disclosure

10 and mitigation in the EIR. The Project will conflict with the City's park goals and other key land use

11 plans, as described above in Section I. The Project must either be modified to eliminate these

12 conflicts, or the conflicts must be disclosed as significant land use impacts in the EIR. The EIR's

13 current failure to identify significant impacts on land use violates CEQA. The General Plan requires
14 implementation of these plans, as shown by the following implementation strategies:

15 LU-M-53: Continue to implement the Long Beach 1-710 Community Livability Plan
16 aimed at incorporating and prioritizing livability improvements in the I-710 freeway corridor neighborhoods.
17 LU-M-54: Continue to implement the West Long Beach Livability Implementation Plan to improve the quality of life in West Long Beach and to bring to fruition the 18 community's vision of a healthy, vibrant and livable neighborhood though land use planning and capital improvement projects. 19 LU-M-84: Increase parks and open space areas to meet the City standard of eight acres
20 of park land for every 1,000 Long Beach residents, particularly in neighborhoods where there is a deficiency in park space.
21 LU-M-85: Continue to implement and update the Department of Parks, Recreation and Marine Strategic Plan and the Open Space and Recreation Element. 22 LU-M-86: Update and implement the Long Beach Riverlink Plan to create a
23 continuous greenway of pedestrian and bike paths and linkages along the east bank of the Los Angeles River, as well as to connect to existing and future parks, open space
24 and beaches along western portions of the City.
LU-M-95: Reuse vacant properties as community amenities such as gardens, parks or 25 temporary green spaces to reduce blight and safety issues, increase residents' access to needed parks and open spaces, and spur additional investment in neighborhoods. 26

27 impact of new residents on 52. The EIR fails to provide adequate information to evaluate the

28 compliance with open space standards in the General Plan and other open space planning documents.
13
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

For example, the EIR fails to calculate the impact of 624 new residents on West Long Beach's park

2 ratio which is already substandard.

3
Greenhouse Gas
4

5 53. The Project is inconsistent with the newly adopted Climate Action and Adaptation Plan

6 ("CAAP") to mitigate climatic change. This lot is located in the extreme heat area and will increase

7 greenhouse gases. As the plan notes, North and West Long Beach are especially vulnerable to extreme

8 heat in large part because they lack the green space of other city regions- a result of the last century

9 of discriminatory housing policies, according to the CAAP. "Low-income communities of color were

10 historically excluded from neighborhoods with less environmental pollution and greater public

11 investment, and these practices partly explain why low-income communities of color today are still

12 concentrated in the portions of the city with the poorest air quality and environmental health

13 indicators." This project will continue to worsen the environmental discrimination on the west side.

14 54. The EIR failed to require the following feasible mitigation measures: (1) All homes shall

15 be built with solar plans, not just be solar ready. (2) All appliances shall be electric, no gas appliances

16 and preferably electric heat. (3) Irrigation water shall be recycled/gray water. (4) Require access to the

17 LA River bike and walking path with gate and walking path along Baker Street to the river to

18 increase alternative modes of transportation and maintain public access to the LA River bike path. (5)

19 Plant more trees and do not allow the use of artificial turf. (6) All garages shall be designed for

20 electric vehicle charging. (7) Create more common open space within the gated area of the project and

21 plant with grass and trees to reduce excessive heat. This can be achieved by reducing density and

22 creating green spaces at street ends along the west/east property lines where there is a continual row

23 of houses approximately 1,000 feet long without a break. (8) Reduce density thereby reducing exhaust

24 from cars, vehicle trips, energy consumption, water usage, and greenhouse gases.

25
Land Use (Equestrian Uses)
26

27 55. The EIR fails to analyze and disclose land use inconsistencies with equestrian uses and

28 plans for equestrian uses. A portion of the Project site falls within the City's horse overlay zone.
14
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

These horse overlay zones were approved to preserve and protect Los Cerritos' unique culture and

2 cherished community. The Project sits near one of the last remaining equestrian-zoned properties
within the City of Long Beach, located adjacent to the Los Angeles County Flood Control/Historical

4 Equestrian Trail. This area has specific and unique needs which incorporate utilization and access of

5 the existing sized strip of County Land parallel to the Flood Control region for ingress/egress,

6 emergency services, access to the Equestrian trail and preservation of the zoning and intended use of

7 residents' lands. Approving the Project would adversely impact equestrian-zoned properties and

8 adjoining trails. The Project as proposed does not appear to provide housing that would allow for

9 stables or corrals, pursuant to the horse overlay as codified in the Long Beach Municipal Code

10 ("LBMC"), sections 21.38.010 et seq.

11 56. The Project effectively forecloses the ability for equestrian use, because property owners

12 in the proposed development would not be able to meet these requirements. For example, the

13 maximum unit size of a unit within the proposed development is 2,244 square feet, which is much less
14 than the minimum lot size required under LBMC § 21.38.201. The EIR must analyze this as a conflict

15 with applicable zoning regulations.

16 57. The EIR failed to include adequate information on consistency with equestrian plans by

17 omitting discussion of (1) the history of Horse Overlays in Long Beach, including the EIR that was

18 part of the overlay establishment in the 1970s; (2) how many of the original six overlays/equestrian
19 communities remain intact and what the cumulative impacts would be to removing this one, in terms

20 of the land use character of Long Beach, and the protection of Long Beach's living equestrian history;

21 (3) the density allowed under a Horse Overlay compared to the density of the proposed project; (4)

22 the effects of the removal of the Overlay, and the construction of the housing development on both the

23 immediate equestrian community with open space and the trail, as well as linear connectivity for
24 horses and their riders between Long Beach equestrian districts, and indeed into the San Gabriel
25 River, the Rio Hondo, and north to Atwater and Burbank equestrian neighborhoods

26 58. The EIR further failed to adequately respond to comments regarding development over an
27 equestrian easement.

28

15
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Land Use (Freeway Incompatibility) and Noise

2 59. The Project would expose hundreds of residents to the freeway noise of two of Southern

3 California's busiest, and loudest, freeways. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has declared

4 that exposure to high noise levels presents a "health risk in that noise may contribute to the

5 development and aggravation of stress related conditions such as high blood pressure, coronary

6 disease, ulcers, colitis, and migraine headaches…Growing evidence suggests a link between noise and

7 cardiovascular problems. There is also evidence suggesting that noise may be related to birth defects

8 and low birth-weight babies. There are also some indications that noise exposure can increase

9 susceptibility to viral infection and toxic substances." Potentially deadly cardiovascular impacts can

10 be triggered by long-term average exposure to noise levels as low as 55 decibels. Studies on the use of

11 tranquilizers, sleeping pills, psychotropic drugs, and mental hospital admission rates suggest that high

12 noise levels cause adverse impacts on mental health.

13 60. High noise levels also have dramatic developmental impacts on small children, many of

14 whom will reside in the Project. Children who are exposed to higher average noise levels have

15 heightened sympathetic arousal, expressed by increased stress hormone levels, and elevated resting

16 blood pressure. As proposed, the Project would expose community members to levels of noise that are

17 unsafe for cardiovascular health, mental health, societal well being, and child development.

18 61. During the DEIR comment period, Caltrans wrote, "residential construction next to

19 freeways is an incompatible land use and local jurisdictions need to require soundwalls tall enough to

20 reduce traffic noise. To ensure compliance with established noise standards and guidelines, and to

21 protect future occupants from potential adverse effects associated with traffic noise levels exceeding

22 these standards, soundwalls need to be implemented in the zoning, architectural design, and

23 construction of units. Otherwise, future traffic noise controversy can be expected."

24 62. The FEIR essentially disregarded Caltrans' comments, writing in Response 1-4: (1) that

25 the residential units would be located slightly further from the freeways; (2) that noise measurements

26 did not exceed sound limit; and (3) that CEQA does not require this analysis anyway. Sound walls

27 will not be considered. The FEIR's response is inadequate. Caltrans, as the State's foremost expert on

28 freeways, was explicit in its comment that residences and freeways are incompatible land uses.

16
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

63. The DEIR's noise levels may be underestimated. The DEIR's noise analysis averaged

2 noise levels over 15-minute intervals, which obscures both short-term and impulsive noise that can be

3 most disturbing to residents. Noise levels were measured at noon and 3 pm, outside of the commute

4 hours when traffic noise would be highest. Additionally, the DEIR's noise measurements were taken

5 on February 3, 2021, a Wednesday morning before Covid vaccines were widely available and traffic

6 had fully rebounded to pre-Covid levels. In any case, nearly all of the recorded ambient noise levels

7 exceeded the 55 dBA level at which health impacts can occur, and site 5 exceeded 70 dBA, a level the 5

8 State of California deems "unacceptable" for residential use. The Project site's ambient noise also

9 exceeds the City's existing limits for residential uses and for other residential zones in the City.
10 Consequently, the Project would likely have a significant adverse impact on human beings by

11 exposing residents to noise they would otherwise miss, a CEQA impact that cannot be dismissed and

12 that must be disclosed, analyzed, and mitigated in the EIR. (CEQA Guidelines s. 15065.) Sound walls

13 should be considered in this analysis.

14
Traffic
15

16 64. CEQA prohibits the imposition of speculative mitigation measures. (Pub. Resources Code

17 § 21081.6(b) [must be "fully enforceable through permit conditions, agreements, or other

18 measures.")) Further, CEQA requires that mitigation measures be analyzed for efficacy and for

19 environmental impacts they may, themselves, create. (San Joaquin Raptor Rescue Center v. County of

20 Merced (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 645; CEQA Guidelines § 15126.4.)

21 65. The Project's main access driveway would be located on Wardlow Road. The Project's trip

22 generation would introduce new trips onto a road segment that has had an unacceptable Level of

23 Service of E since at least 1993. The EIR found the potential impact to be unsafe. Line-of-sight

24 analysis of vehicle movements at the proposed access driveway on Wardlow Road determined that

25 vehicles at the proposed driveway would lack adequate sight distance along Wardlow Road. This

26 could "substantially increase hazards." The EIR proposes to mitigate the impacts of these new trips

27 with a flashing light via Mitigation measure MM Trans-1. Per the final EIR, "This mitigation would

28 result in the installation of a traffic signal on Wardlow Road at the Project driveway." Without this
17
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 mitigation, the Project's impacts on traffic would remain significant and require the City to support

2 and approve a Statement of Overriding Considerations.

3 66. However, the City has considered a traffic signal at this location in the past. The City

4 specifically chose not to install a traffic signal at this location because it would be unsafe.

5 Environmental Impact Report No. 64-87, dated April 14, 1988, for a proposed, but never built

6 residential development in Wrigley Heights stated: "The City Traffic Engineer has previously

7 indicated that because of the elevation and geometrics, it is not possible to construct a new North/

8 South street to Wardlow." In 1988, there was no A-Train (Blue Line), there were no bollards on

9 Wardlow Road, and there was far less traffic. The City provides no support for any assertion that the

10 flashing light proposed by the Project will make the situation safe. The proposed mitigation measures

11 do nothing to improve the linc-of-sight for vehicles at the intersection. The only substantive change

12 appears to be flashing lights hanging from utility pole. At this location, Wardlow Road is both

13 curved and steep. Threshold TR-3 confirms that none of the measures related to the proposed traffic

14 signal at the new intersection improve the line-of-sight in any way. The EIR fails to even guarantee

15 which, if any, measures will be taken in conjunction with the new signal. The FEIR states, twice, that

16 the traffic signal related equipment may include a number of features.

17 67. The EIR fails to explain a how a traffic signal that was previously considered unsafe is now

18 acceptable. Traffic on Wardlow has doubled since 1993. Either the proposed mitigation measure MM

19 Trans-l remains unsafe and will not be installed, rendering it speculative, or the EIR proposes an

20 unsafe mitigation measure without disclosing, analyzing, and mitigating the significant impacts on

21 driver, pedestrian, and cyclist safety. Either way, the City's EIR violates CEQA. The EIR must be

22 revised and recirculated.

23
Tribal Cultural Resources
24

25 68. The EIR asserts it fulfilled its duties to analyze and mitigate impacts to tribal cultural

26 resources under AB 52. However, comments from Anna Christensen, Chair of the Sierra Club Los

27 Cerritos Wetlands Task Force, demonstrated that the EIR's analysis was inadequate and masked

28 significant unmitigated impacts. These comments are summarized below.
18
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

69. The project site has cultural and historic significance to tribal peoples. For thousands of

2 years, the Tongva village of Tevaaxaanga was located along the river here. Sacred objects (cogstones)

3 and other tribal cultural materials (obsidian flakes) have been unearthed nearby. As stated in LSA's

4 Cultural Resource Study for the nearby Pacific Place project, "Creeks and rivers are of importance to

5 humans - pre-contact populations included and archaeologists acknowledge that archacological sites

6 are often located near natural water sources....there is always a potential for archaeological resources

7 to be uncovered during grading activities, thus resulting in a potentially significant impact.....the

8 absence of specific site information in the sacred lands file database does not indicate the absence of

9 cultural resources."

10 70. The EIR omits the well documented history of the Tongva, a culture that has occupied the

11 project area for more than 10,000 years and had multiple villages, including Tevaaxaanga and

12 Tibahanga, along this section of the river in Long Beach. The highly significant cogstones found at

13 Rancho Los Cerritos should be referenced as should the Tongva's spiritual beliefs, skill in land

14 management, navigation and trade, and the the tribe's considerable status and influence on Southern

15 CA tribal culture.

16 71. The EIR fails to mention tribal life after invasion and colonization, including tribal

17 contributions to/suffering at Mission San Gabriel, Rancho Los Cerritos, Rancho Los Alamitos, and

18 into modern times. Nor is the history of tribal resistance to genocide, including that of contemporary

19 Tongva descendants who continue to maintain tribal lifeways, protect tribal lands, and advocate for
20 indigenous rights, acknowledged in the EIR.

21 72. There are multiple sources that document tribal culture in the immediate vicinity of the

22 project site at Rancho Los Cerritos, including the discovery of highly significant and rare cogstones.

23 Additionally both Rancho Los Cerritos and Rancho Los Alamitos have their own archives and

24 publications (ie Ancestor, Oh My Ancestor), documenting local tribal history. UCLA has a mapping

25 project of Tongva village sites, several in Long Beach. Additionally, there are interviews with tribal

26 historians and scholars - the problem is not a lack of information, it is the systemic refusal to consult

27 anything other than what someone dug up and decided to write about as an 'archaeological" find.

28 73. Furthermore, the EIR fails to adequately address cumulative impacts to tribal cultural
19
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

resources. The analysis of cultural resources neither acknowledges the existence of nor considers the

2 cumulative impact on these resources. According to CEQA, the importance of tribal cultural resources

3 is the value of the resource to California Native American tribes culturally affiliated with the Project

4 Area. Therefore, the issue that must be explored in a cumulative analysis is the cumulative loss of
tribal cultural resources. For tribal cultural resources that are avoided or preserved through dedication

6 within open space, no impacts would occur. However, if avoidance or dedication of open space to

7 preserve tribal cultural resources is infeasible, those impacts must be considered in combination with

8 tribal cultural resources that would be impacted for other projects.According to CEQA, the
importance of tribal cultural resources is the value of the resource to California Native American

10 tribes culturally affiliated with the Project Area. Therefore, the issue that must be explored in a

11 cumulative analysis is the cumulative loss of tribal cultural resources.

12 74. The cumulative impact of construction on unceded tribal lands, with or without salvage

13 archaeology, is the ongoing erasure of recognizable and ancient landforms that hold the history of the

14 first peoples and possibly their ancestors as well. Especially in urban areas, this is of little

15 consequence to private and public landowners and regulatory agencies who see land as without spirit,

16 without agency, without power. There is no mitigation for this lack of consciousness and the fact that

17 it continues to destroy tribal places and ways of life.

18 75. While the Lead Agency (the City of Long Beach) may not yet have determined that the

19 project site is eligible for Tribal Cultural Landscape Status, we ask that the City consider doing so and

20 set aside funds to purchase the property as park space in a park poor section of the city. The City of

21 Long Beach has not officially recognized any sites honoring the Tongva, not even the Puvungna

22 Village Site, listed National Register site of Places.

23 76. Nor, in spite of SB 18, has there been an effort to set aside known tribal cultural or

24 archaeological sites as protected/undisturbed public open space. Instead, it is routine to undervalue

25 and under report the significance of sites slated to be developed in terms of both existing and potential

26 tribal and archaeological resources.

27 77. The mitigations in the DEIR lack a basic commitment to tribal survival and continue to

28 rely on the power of the state over the lands and the culture of the indigenous peoples of California.
20
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

The LCWTF acknowledges the right of California's tribal peoples to define tribal culture and

2 determine the significance of certain places and tribal cultural resources.
78. The EIR's allowance of an archaeologist and/or property owner to determine mitigation
measures for tribal lands, human remains and objects itself denies tribal sovereignty. The NAHC

5 identifies a primary goal for Lead Agencies under AB 52 to "Build working relationships with tribes

6 that are traditionally and culturally affiliated to the project area or to your agency's geographic area of

7 jurisdiction." The City of Long Beach, most especially the Department of Development Services, has

8 failed to do so in the EIR.

9 79. No salvage archacology is proposed for this project. Therefore, the archaeologist and tribal

10 monitor can only hope to spot evidence of human occupation in soils as they are exposed, scooped up,

11 graded, and bulldozed by heavy machinery during construction itself. This practice fails to employ

12 feasible mitigation measures and masks significant impacts due to the loss of artifacts and human

13 remains.

14

15 Water Quality

16 80. The EIR failed to adequately analyze, disclose, or mitigate the Project's significant impacts
17 relating to hazardous materials and water quality. While CEQA does not require an analysis of the

18 environment's effects on a project, when. as here, project would exacerbate existing environmental

19 hazards "by bringing development and people into the area affected," there must be analysis of such

20 impacts. (California Building Industry Assn. V. Bay Area Air Quality Management Dist. (2015) 62

21 Cal.4th 369, 388.)

22 81. The FEIR recognizes that the site cannot be used for residential purposes until it is cleaned

23 up. Yet the EIR improperly defers analysis of the Project's exacerbation of hazardous impacts, and

24 leaves analysis of such impacts to be reviewed by the LARWQCB. Under CEQA, lead agencies are

25 not permitted to defer environmental analysis to a separate regulatory scheme. (Californians for

26 Alternatives to Toxics v. Department of Food & Agriculture (2005) 136 Cal.App.4th 1, 16-17.) The

27 EIR defers analysis of the Project's construction exacerbating soil and groundwater contamination,

28 instead concluding that "in the event" such contamination is encountered, it will be removed and/or

21
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 treated in accordance with the RAP and state, federal, and local regulations.

2 82. CEQA does not permit deferral of the analysis of environmental impacts, as "[a]

3 fundamental purpose of an EIR is to provide decision makers with information they can use in

4 deciding whether to approve a proposed project, not to inform them of the environmental effects of

5 projects that they have already approved." (Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. v. Regents of

0 University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 394.) Thus, environmental review must occur as early

7 as possible to provide meaningful information to the Planning Commission and the public. Further,

8 deferred mitigation violates CEQA. (Endangered Habitats League County of Orange (2005) 131

9 Cal. App. 4th 777, 793-94; CEQA Guidelines 15126.4(a)(1)(B).) Deferral is only permitted when

10 an agency commits itself to a mitigation measure with specific performance standards. (CEQA

11 Guidelines § 15126.4(a)(1)(B).)

12 83. The EIR relies on a RAP that is not even fully defined. The EIR states that the RAP itself

13 defers the preparation of a Groundwater Monitoring Plan which will specify the design and

14 implementation of groundwater monitoring, and will include a "contingency" for in-situ groundwater

15 remediation if LARWQCB later determines it is necessary. Additionally, the EIR recognizes that an

16 Operations, Maintenance, and Implementation Plan "is expected to be a component" of the

17 LARWOCB's approval. These mitigation measures are far too speculative and lack any specific

18 performance criteria or commitment, and thus violate CEQA.

19 84. Additionally, the Project relies on an engineered cap on the north side of the Project site

20 instead of soil remediation, where the site's limited open space uses are planned to be. The EIR does

21 not disclose the design or engineering details of this cap, which will be deferred until permitting. Nor

22 does the EIR disclose what would happen if the cap failed to contain the site's hazardous soils. The

23 EIR must analyze and disclose these impacts and project features prior to project approval.

24 85. The Project will also cause significant impacts to surface water quality as it will convert

25 over 60% of the site to impervious surface. Instead of addressing these impacts, the EIR merely states

26 that the Project would be required to prepare post-construction Best Management Practices (BMP)

27 and prepare an LID Plan. These BMPs and the LID Plan must be in place before the public and

28 decisionmakers review the Project; otherwise they are deprived of information essential to analyzing
22
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

the Project's impacts.

2 86. With regards to groundwater, the EIR should be recirculated to specifically review impacts
to groundwater, especially given the City's reliance on groundwater as surface water within the State

4 becomes more scarce.

5 87. Finally, the EIR appears to rely on Project Design Features to base its conclusion that the

6 Project would have no significant hydrology or water quality impacts, stating that such features would

7 "reduce potential Project and cumulative hydrology and water quality impacts to less than significant

8 levels." (DEIR, p. IV.I-30.) Reliance on Project Design Features improperly compresses the DEIR's

9 disclosure and analysis functions. (Lotus v. Department of Transportation (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th

10 645, 655-656.) A "mitigation measure cannot be used as a device to avoid disclosing project

11 impacts." (San Joaquin Raptor Rescue Center v. County of Merced (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 645,

12 663-664.) An EIR cannot incorporate "the proposed mitigation measures into its description of the

13 project and then conclude [] that any potential impacts from the project will be less than significant."

14 (Lotus, supra, 223 Cal.App.4th 645, 655-657.) The EIR's shortcut is "not merely a harmless

15 procedural failing…[it] subverts the purposes of CEQA by omitting material necessary to informed
16 decisionmaking and informed public participation." (Id. at 658.)

17 88. The EIR identifies impacts to the sufficiency of water supplies as a potentially significant

18 impact, yet fails to adequately mitigate this impact by failing to impose feasible mitigation measures

19 including rainwater recapture and/or greywater reuse. The EIR failed to adequately respond to
20 comments seeking these mitigation measures.

21
Inadequate Responses to Comments
22

23 89. The EIR failed to adequately respond to comments regarding the allegations above, in

24 many cases providing only cursory responses or summarily dismissing substantive comments

25 regarding air quality, biological impacts, land use inconsistency, hazards, noise, traffic, tribal cultural

26 resources and water quality.
