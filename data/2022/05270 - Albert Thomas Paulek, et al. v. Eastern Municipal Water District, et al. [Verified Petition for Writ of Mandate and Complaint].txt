I. INTRODUCTION
3

4 1. In this action, Petitioners and Plaintiffs Albert Thomas Paulek (Paulek) and the Friends of

5 the Northern San Jacinto Valley (FNSJV) challenge the December 15, 2021 Eastern Municipal Water

6 District (EMWD) Board of Directors Approval and Authorization of the Recycled Water Use

7 Agreement with the California Department of Fish And Wildlife (CDFW) for the San Jacinto Wildlife

8 Area (SJWA). The EMWD Board of Directors Approval and Authorization of the Recycled Water
9 Use Agreement for the SJWA violated the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), Public

10 Resources Code section 21000, et seq., and the CEQA Guidelines, 14 California Code of Regulations
11 section 15000 et seq. et

12
II. HISTORY OF THE SAN JACINTO WILDLIFE AREA
13

14 2. Managed by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW), the San Jacinto

15 Wildlife Area (SJWA), was established pursuant to the 1979 - MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT

16 [MOA] REGARDING MITIGATION OF STATE WATER PROJECT WILDLIFE LOSSES IN

17 SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. The 1979 MOA provided specific parcels of land [800 acres in front of
18 Lake Perris dam and 650 acres at the former San Jacinto borrow site used in the Lake Perris dam

19 construction] and sums of money [$ 8.0 million] to effect the establishment of the SJWA. The 1979

20 MOA was implemented in accordance with the requirements of the Davis-Dolwig Act obliging the
21 California Department of Water Resources (DWR) and the Metropolitan Water District of Southern

22 California (MWD) to satisfy the preservation obligations arising out of construction of the State Water
23 Project (SWP) facilities on formerly private lands in Southern California.

24 3. In 1981-82, the state Wildlife Conservation Board (WCB)' using the 1979 MOA funding
25 accomplished the initial land acquisition [approximately 4200 acres] establishing the SJWA. In the

26

27

28 The Wildlife Conservation Board (WCB) was created by legislation in 1947 to administer a capital outlay program for wildlife conservation and related public recreation.
2

Petition for Writ of Mandate

ensuing years the WCB has continued the SJWA land acquisition program; today resulting in the
2 SJWA comprising over 20,000 acres of critically important wildlife conservation habitat for numerous

3 plants and animals found in western Riverside County.

4
III. RECYCLED WATER AGREEMENT
5

6 4. The AGREEMENT BETWEEN STATE OF CALIFORNIA, DEPARTMENT OF FISH

7 AND GAME, AND EASTERN MUNICIPAL WATER DISTRICT FOR THE SAN JACINTO

8 WILDLIFE AREA RECLAIMED WATER SUPPLY PROJECT was made and entered into on the
18th day of August, 1987. Both the Department of Fish and Game? and Eastern Municipal Water
10 District recognized that while the initial term of the 1987 Agreement was twenty-five (25) years,
11 providing water for the San Jacinto Wildlife Area was a long-term mutually beneficial program for
12 both public agencies. The 1987 Agreement recognized the reclaimed water would result in the
13 production of valuable wildlife habitat that would support resident and migratory populations of
14 wildlife and provide long term benefits to the public. DFW and EMWD also recognized that wildlife
15 populations and public benefits would become dependent upon habitat supported by the reclaimed
program to be a 16 water delivery program. In recognition thereof, CDFW and EMWD considered the

17 long-term commitment to be extended beyond the initial term of the agreement. In good faith and
18 consistent with their respective legal authority CDFW and EMWD intent was to periodically extend

19 the agreement by amendments as necessary to insure that reclaimed water remains available to the

20 San Jacinto Wildlife Area.

21
IV. FEDERAL AND STATE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACTS
22

23 5. EMWD, the CEQA Lead Agency for the renewal of the 1987 Recycled Water Use
24 Agreement for the SJWA, continues to fail to recognize/acknowledge that the federal Endangered
25 Species Act (ESA) prohibits the "take" of endangered or threatened species. In like manner, the
26 California Endangered Species Act (CESA) prohibits the "take" of endangered or threatened species
27
N
28 In 2012 the State Legislature changed the name of the Department of Fish and Game (DFG) to the Department of Fish and Wildlife (DFW).
3

Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 listed by the California Fish and Game Commission ["take" means hunt, pursue, catch, capture, or
2 kill, or attempt to hunt, pursue, catch, capture, or kill] (Fish and Game Code § 86). Under the 2004

3 Western Riverside County Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan (MSHCP) the "take" of 146
plant and animal species is permitted for 75 years throughout western Riverside County. The "take"

5 of 146 plant and animal species is allowed in exchange for the assembly and management of
coordinated MSHCP Conservation Areas, the most prominent being the now 20,000-acre CDFW
7 San Jacinto Wildlife Area. (emphasis added)

8 6. Both the federal and state endangered species statutes provide exceptions to their "take"
9 prohibitions. The federal exception requires applicants to submit a Habitat Conservation Plan [the

10 MSHCP]. If approved by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service the applicant will be issued an incidental
11 "take" permit. Under California law the "take" exception is authorized pursuant to the Natural
12 Community Conservation Planning Act (NCCP Act - Fish and Game Code §§ 2800 • 2835). After
13 approval of a NCCP Act Conservation Plan, the CDFW permits the "take" of any MSHCP/NCCP
14 Covered Species whose conservation and Management is provided for in the NCCP approved by the
15 CDFW. The NCCP Act section 2826 provides: "Nothing in this chapter exempts a project

16 proposed in a natural community planning area from Division 13 (commencing with section

17 21000) of the Public Resources Code [CEQA] or otherwise alters the applicability of that

18 division." The holding of the California Supreme Court bolsters this legislative intent: "CESA can be

19 harmonized with CEQA". (Mountain lion Found. v. Fish & Game Comm'n (1997) 16 Cal.4th 105,
20 111).

21
V. SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF THE AGREEMENT 22

23 7. The implementation of the initial 25-year term of the 1987 Reclaimed Water Agreement has
24 resulted in the creation/restoration of numerous wetland and riparian associated habitats. These
25 restored wildlife habitats are now providing habitat for multiple endangered, threatened or Special
26 Status species [ 65 to 70 of the 146 MSHCP/NCCP Covered Species occur on the SJWA] including
27 but not limited to the Least Bell's vireo, Tricolored blackbirds, American bittern, White-faced ibis,
28 Western spadefoot toad, San Bernardino kangaroo rat, San Jacinto salt bush and Coulter's goldfield.
4

Petition for Writ of Mandate

- The potential for wildlife habitat restoration at the SJWA has not been fully realized and the

2 maintenance of the existing habitats and restoration of additional habitat for endangered, threatened
and MSHCP/NCCP Special Status species is dependent on obtaining an adequate, dependable and

4 affordable source of reclaimed water as outlined in the 1987 Reclaimed Water Agreement.

5 8. When members of the public challenged the Approval and Authorization of the new

6 Recycled Water Use Agreement for SJWA, EMWD claimed at the December 15, public hearing at the
7 action under consideration was not a CEQA Project. This ruse was presented to cover the EMWD

8 failure to analyze the CEQA Project direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts on endangered,
proceed as the law 9 threatened, and MSHCP/NCCP Covered Species. In doing so EMWD failed to

10 requires.

11
VI. JURISDICTION AND VENUE
12

13 9. This Court has jurisdiction over matters alleged in this Petition pursuant to Code of Civil

14 Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5, 187, and 526 and sections 21168 and 21168.5 of the Public

15 Resources Code.

16 10. Venue for this action properly lies in Riverside County Superior Court because the

17 Recycled Water Agreement for the SJWA is proposed for implementation in Riverside County,
18 Respondent EMWD approved the Agreement in Riverside County, and the environmental harm

19 caused by the Agreement will be felt in Riverside County. As such, venue is proper in this Court
20 because the cause of action alleged in this Petition arose in Riverside County.

21
VII. THE PARTIES
22

23 11. Petitioner/Plaintiff ALBERT THOMAS PAULEK (Paulek) is a retired Department of Fish

24 and Wildlife Associate Wildlife Biologist and was the area manager of the Department's San Jacinto
25 Wildlife Area (SJWA) from 1991 to 2006. Paulek is a Certified Wildlife Biologist [The Wildlife
26 Society] having extensive Knowledge and experience working with the wildlife resources and

27 conservation programs of western Riverside County and the state of California. Paulek participated in
28 the December 15, 2021 EMWD Board of Directors public hearing that granted Approval and
5

Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 Authorization for the new Recycled Water Use Agreement for the SJWA as an individual and as the

2 Conservation Chair for the Friends of the Northern San Jacinto Valley. Petitioners seek to compel
EMWD to both recognize and correctly implement its CEQA duties to avoid and/or mitigate Project

4 impacts to endangered, threatened, and MSHCP/NCCP Covered Species in order to conserve existing

5 and future wildlife habitat resources and public uses at the San Jacinto Wildlife Area.

6 12. Petitioners/Plaintiff the FRIENDS OF THE NORTHERN SAN JACINTO VALLEY

7 (Friends) is a California non-profit conservation group dedicated to preserving and protecting the
8 northern San Jacinto Valley, the San Jacinto Wildlife Area and surrounding environmental resources.

9 Friends members reside and recreate in the San Jacinto Valley area of Riverside County. The
10 organization sponsors nature walks, periodically publishes a Newsletter, and conducts restoration
11 activities at the SJWA, Mystic Lake and the Northern San Jacinto Valley.
12 13. Petitioners presented written comments and oral objections at the December 15, 2021
13 EMWD Board of Directors public hearing on the matter being challenged in this Petition. Petitioners
14 and their members would be directly, adversely and irreparably affected if the project proceeds.
15 Petitioners would continue to be prejudiced by the project and its components, as described herein,
16 until and unless this Court provides the relief prayed for in this petition.
17 14. Respondent EASTERN MUNICIPAL WATER DISTRICT (EMWD) was organized as a
18 Municipal Water District in 1950 for the primary purpose of importing Colorado River water to its
19 service area in order augment water supplies. Today EMWD receives approximately half of its water
20 from the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD) via the Colorado River Aqueduct
21 and the State Water Project. EMWD is the water, wastewater service and recycled water provider to
22 more than 850,000 people living and working within 555-square mile service area in western
23 Riverside County. It is California's sixth-largest retail water agency. The five-member board of
24 directors comprise the governing body of EMWD. Directors are elected to four-year terms by the
25 registered voters in five geographic divisions. Directors must reside within their elected division. The

26 EMWD Board of Directors are responsible to the members of the public in their respective division
27 and general public within the EMWD service area, for proper conduct of EMWD affairs.

VIII. PETITIONERS' OBJECTIONS
21

22 18. Petitioners hereby reallege and incorporate the allegations set forth in paragraph 1 through
23 17 inclusive.

24 19. The initial 25-year term of the 1987 Reclaimed Water Agreement was set to expire in
25 August 2014. The Newsletter for the Friends of the northern San Jacinto Valley began advocating for
26 the equitable renewal of the 1987 Reclaimed Water Agreement and the necessary CEQA review of
27 this important wildlife conservation agreement. The first Newsletter article occurred two years before
28

Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 the initial 25-year term for 1987 Agreement was set to expire and continued after EMWD sought to

2 avoid the 1987 Agreement and prior to the EMWD proposed new Agreement in 2021. Friend's

3 Newsletter chronicled below and can be reviewed: northfriends.org>Newsletter

4 October 2012: "Lifeblood of the San Jacinto Wildlife Area"
5 October 2013: "Lifeblood of SJWA Circling the Drain"
6 February 2014: "SJWA Reclaimed Water - Going Down The Drain"
7 September 2014: "SJWA Reclaimed Water - A Temporary Reprieve"
8 November 2015: "EMWD/CDFW Reclaimed Water Shenanigans Continue"
9 Spring 2018: "Flashback to October 2012 - Lifeblood of the San Jacinto Wildlife Area
10 - Fast Forward to 2018"

11 20. The Friend's Newsletter articles prior to the 2014 expiration of the initial 25-year term of the 1987

12 Agreement sought to alert the public to the importance, public benefit and essential nature of the

13 reclaimed water delivery to the SJWA. Water was said to be "the lifeblood of the San Jacinto Wildlife

14 Area" without the reclaimed water delivery... "the miles of riparian habitat and the bulk of the

15 wetland areas found on the wildlife area would not exist." The October 2013 Newsletter advised the

16 public the 1987 Agreement for the delivery of up to 4500 acre-feet of reclaimed water to the SJWA

17 was set to expire in 2014 and EWWD and CDFW were currently in negotiations for the renewal of

18 that all important reclaimed water contract. "The importance of the future water contract to the public

19 cannot be overstated. The quantity, timing and cost of water delivery to SJWA will, without question,
20 determine the future look and value of the of the wildlife habitats maintained on the Wildlife area."

21 The October 2013 Newsletter also documents the Petitioners request to receive notification and
22 opportunity to participate in the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) review of the

23 "Project."

24 21. In anticipation of the expiration of the 1987 Agreement EMWD and CDFW continued

25 negotiating the SJWA Reclaimed Water Agreement behind closed doors. After emphatic protest by
26 members of the public and calls for transparency, two EMWD Draft agreements were released to the

27 public. The latter Draft was presented by EMWD/CDFW at the April 2014 public workshop. EMWD
28 sought to reduce the annual reclaimed water delivery to SJWA by roughly one half, increase the price,
8

Petition for Writ of Mandate

and eliminate the CDFW reserved capacity right in the pipeline delivering reclaimed water to the
2 wildlife area. Moreover, should the contract be terminated EMWD would retain the pipeline

3 easements on the SJWA public lands. Apparently the CDFW negotiator was willing to concede to

4 these EMWD renewal terms [Note: the state Wildlife Conservation Board (WCB) provided 1.1

5 million dollars to partially fund the EMWD pipeline construction}.

6 22. The CEQA document for each of the 2014 draft agreements was a Notice of Exemption.
7 (CEQA Guidelines section 15062).

8 23. The April 2014 public workshop concluded with more public protest and renewed calls for
9 the necessary environmental review for this "Project" pursuant to CEQA. With the original 25-year
10 term set to expire on June 30, 2014, EMWD General Manager Paul Jones consented to the first one-
11 year extension of the Reclaimed Water Agreement for SJWA that would incorporate all the original
12 terms of the 1987 Agreement. The first one-year extension was justified by EMWD to allow CDFW
13 time to complete its long-term land management plan for the SJWA. (Friends Newsletter September
14 2014)

15 24. The EMWD Board of Directors subsequently approved eight (8) sequential one-year
16 extensions to the existing 1987 Agreement. The seven (7) previous amendments extended the terms

17 and conditions of the 1987 agreement without any revisions beyond extending the expiration date.
18 The seventh (7th) amendment was set to expire on June 30, 2021. In order to support on-going
19 reclaimed water service to the SJWA, EMWD executed and eighth (8th) amendment for a six-month
20 extension of the 1987 Agreement until December 31, 2021.
21 25. A notice of Exemption was filed for each of the eight one-year extensions. On August 24,
22 2015, Petitioners Paulek and Friends filed a CEQA petition for Writ of Mandate alleging that a notice
23 of exemption was not the proper CEQA document for the 2nd one-year extension (RIC 1510156). The
24 case was dismissed by petitioners on 09/23/2015 for personal reasons unrelated to the merits of the

25 complaint or any agreement with EMWD.

26 26. Petitioners November 26, 2021 to email to the EMWD Public Affairs Officer requested:
27 "Can you provide a status update regarding the Renewal of the 1987 Reclaimed Water Contract for
28 the San Jacinto Wildlife Area (SJWA) and the manner of CEQA review this important wildlife
9

Petition for Writ of Mandate

conservation project will undergo." On December 8, 2021 the EMWD Public Affairs Officer

2 responded indicating: "EMWD's E6 Board of Directors will be considering the updates to the agreement

3 during EMWD December 15th Board meeting. »

IX. THE DECEMBER 15, 2021 ACTION
5

6 27. The EMWD December 15, 2021 Board of Directors meeting Agenda Item V.B. ACTION

7 CALENDAR announced:

8 B. Approve and Authorize Recycled Water Use Agreement with California
9 Department of Fish and Wildlife - San Jacinto Wildlife Area (Voelz Alexander)

10 The staff Recommendation to the Board of Directors for Agenda Item V.B. stated:
11 Approve and authorize the following:
12 Execution by the General Manager, or his designee, of the California Department of
13 Fish and Wildlife General Terms and Conditions agreement and associated contract forms, subject to non-substantive changes, for the delivery of recycled water to the San
14 Jacinto Wildlife Area; and
Execution by the General Manager, or his designee, of the Ninth Amendment to the 15 Recycled Water Agreement with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife for the San Jacinto Wildlife Area, if needed, with an amended expiration date of February 28, 16 2022 and the updated CDFW rate per the previously approved 2022 recycled water rate schedule.
17

18 28. The EMWD staff report and presentation to the Board of Directors at the December 15, 2021

19 public meeting proposed : new agreement contrary to and at odds with the original 1987 Reclaimed
20 Water Agreement [ Paragraph 27 supra refers to the new agreement as "General Terms and
21 Conditions agreement"]. Petitioners raised objections to the proposed new agreement at the public
22 meeting [oral testimony and December 14, 2021 written comment letter] indicating EMWD sought to
23 nullify/modify the CDFW 20 acre-foot/day reserved capacity right in the Reclaimed Water pipeline.
24 to EMWD sought to modify the 1987 Reclaimed Water fee schedule by imposing a 20 percent per year
25 "ramp up" fee on the reclaimed water effectively rendering it unaffordable forcing elimination/
26 reduction in the 4500 acre-foot per year CDFW reclaimed water allocation. The proposed new
27 EMWD Agreement seeks to nullify/modify existing pipeline replacement provisions to insure
28 reclaimed water remains available to the SJWA in the long term to support resident and migratory
10

Petition for Writ of Mandate

populations, including numerous threatened, endangered and Special Status Species [MSHCP

2 Covered Species] presently found on SJWA as a result of CDFW implementation of the 1987

3 Reclaimed Water Agreement. Petitioners stated these impacts to Biological Resources are significant

4 and must be addressed in the appropriate CEQA document.

5 29. EMWD the CEQA lead agency for this discretionary action: "Approve and Authorize

6 Recycled Water Use Agreement with California Department of Fish and Wildlife - San Jacinto
7 Wildlife Area" provided no CEQA documentation for the Approval. The new Agreement proposed by
8 EMWD and presented to the public and the EMWD Board of Directors at Section L [EMWD new
9 Agreement Page 9 of 9] incorrectly defers Project CEQA review to a unknown future date after the
10 December 15, 2021 Approval and Authorization of the Project as follows:

11 "L. CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT (CEQA)
12

13 1. In their performance of the duties and obligations under this Agreement CDFW and the District will each be responsible for complying, in whatever manner each entity
14 deems necessary, with the California Environmental Quality Act."

15 30. In Save Tara v. City of West Hollywood (45 Cal. 4th 116,121) the California Supreme Court
16 determined that under similar circumstances an agency's agreement to allow an action conditioned on
17 future compliance with CEQA constitutes approval of the project within the meaning of Pub. Res.
18 Code §§ 21100 and 21151.

19 31. Pursuant to CEQA Guideline § 15065 - Mandatory Findings of Significance this
20 project has the potential to: Substantially degrade the Quality of the environment; substantially
21 reduce the habitat of a fish and wildlife species; cause a fish or wildlife population to drop below self-
22 sustaining levels; threaten to eliminate a plant or animal community; substantially reduce the number
23 or restrict the range of an endangered, rare or threatened species. EMWD's disregard/avoidance of
24 its CEQA Duties and obligations on this project is a failure to proceed as the law requires.
25 32. Petitioners have exhausted all administrative remedies by submitting written and oral
26 objections regarding issues raised in this Petition to the in EMWD Board of Directors public meeting of
27

28

11

Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 December 15, 2021 to request compliance with CEQA and the completion of a full and adequate
2 environmental review. All issues raised in this petition were raised before Respondents by Petitioners,
3 other members of the public, or public agencies prior to the approval of the project.
4 33. Petitioners have complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.5 by prior service
5 upon the Eastern Municipal Water District (EMWD) Board of Directors indicating its intent to file
6 this petition. Proof of Service of this notification with the notification, is attached as Exhibit A.
7 34. Petitioners will file a request, pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.6, that
8 respondent public agency EMWD prepare and certify the record of proceedings. Notification of the
9 request to prepare the record of proceedings and Proof of Service of that notification to the public
10 agency EMWD is attached as Exhibit B.

11 35. Petitioner have served copy of this Petition on the California Attorney General's Office
12 to give notice of petitioner's intent to bring this proceeding as a private attorney general under the
13 Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5 which notice is attached as Exhibit C.
14 36. Petitioners have filed and served a request for Hearing and thus complied with Public
15 Resources Code section 21167.4. A copy of that notice is attached as Exhibit D.
16 37. This Petition is timely filed in accordance with Public Resources Code section 21167 and
17 CEQA Guidelines § 15112.

18 38 . Respondents have abused their discretion and failed to act as required by law in the
19 following ways:

20 X. FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
21 VIOLATION OF CEQA (PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE § 21000, et seq.) 22

23 The Eastern Municipal Water District (EMWD) Did Not Comply with CEQA

24 39. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth above.
25 40. In enacting the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) the legislature declared it is
26 the policy of the state to: "prevent the elimination of fish and wildlife species due to man's activities,
27 insure that fish and wildlife populations do not drop below self-perpetuating levels, and preserve for
28 future generations representatives of all plant and animal communities..." (Pub. Resources Code,
12

Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 21001, subd. (c)). "..Public agencies should not approve projects if there are feasible alternatives or
2 feasible mitigation measures, which would substantially lessen significant environmental effects of
3 such projects, and the procedures required by this division are intended to assist public agencies in
4 systematically identifying both significant effects of the proposed project and feasible alternatives
5 or feasible mitigation measures which will avoid or substantially lessen such significant effects."
[emphasis added] (§ 21002) "The purpose of an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) is to identify the
7 Significant effects on the environment, to identify alternatives to the project, and to indicate the
8 manner in which those significant effects can be mitigated or avoided." [emphasis added]
9 (§ 21002.1, subd. (a) . "Each public agency shall mitigate or avoid the significant effects on the
10 environment of projects it carries out or approves whenever it is feasible to do so. [emphasis added]
11 (§ 21002.1, subd. (b).

12 41. CEQA requires a lead agency for a project to prepare an EIR that complies with the
13 requirements of the statute. A CEQA lead agency must also provide for public review and comment
14 on the project and associated environmental documentation. An EIR must provide sufficient
15 environmental analysis such that decision makers can intelligently consider environmental
16 consequences when acting on proposed projects. The Eastern Municipal Water District (EMWD)
17 Approval and Authorization of the Recycled Water Use Agreement with the California Department of
18 Fish and Wildlife was made without any CEQA documentation whatsoever. EMWD's Board of
19 Directors willful disregard of their CEQA duties with respect to the Approval and Authorization
20 constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion. *…..the policy of the state that noncompliance with the
21 information disclosure provisions of this division [CEQA] which precludes relevant information
22 from being presented to the public agency or noncompliance with substantive requirements of this
23 division, may constitute a prejudicial abuse of discretion...." [emphasis added] (Pub. Resources Code,
24 § 21005, subd. (a).

25 42. The EMWD Board of Directors claim that the Approval and Authorization of the Recycled
26 Water Use Agreement with the California Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) for the San Jacinto Wildlife
27 Area (SJWA) was not a project, and therefore not subject to CEQA is in error. Public Resources Code
28 section 21065 defines a project. Under section 21065 an activity is a project if it "may cause either a
13

direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the
2 environment" and is subject to agency control in some way [e.g., undertaken by the agency itself,

4 Patients, Inc. v. City of San Diego (2019) 7 Cal. 5th 1171)

5 43. The discretionary curtailment/elimination of reclaimed water delivery to the SJWA as

6 proposed in the new EMWD Recycled Water Agreement will result in the elimination of existing
7 plant and animal habitats [e.g. riparian and wetland habitats] and the extirpation of endangered,
8 threatened or MSHCP Covered Species now occurring on the SJWA as a result of the original 1987
9 Reclaimed Water Agreement. CEQA Guideline section 15065, provides a "potential substantial
10 impact on endangered, rare or threatened species is per se significant. (Vineyard Area Citizens for
11 Responsible Growth v. City of Rancho Cordova (2007) 40 Cal.4th 412, 449; Pub. Resources Code,
12 § 21001, subd. (c)). CEQA Guideline section 15065 MANDATORY FINDINGS OF
13 SIGNIFICANCE provides:

14 (a) A lead agency shall find that a project may have a significant effect on the
15 environment and thereby require an EIR to be prepared for the project where there is substantial evidence, in light of the whole record, that any of the following conditions
16 may occur:

17 (1) The project has the potential to: substantially degrade the quality of the environment; substantially reduce the habitat of a fish or wildlife species; cause a fish
18 or wildlife population to drop below self-sustaining levels; threaten to eliminate a plant or animal community; substantially reduce the number or restrict the range of an
19 endangered, rare or threatened species; ...

20 (3) The project has possible environmental effects that are individually limited but cumulatively considerable. "Cumulatively considerable" means that the incremental
21 effects of an individual project are significant when viewed in connection with the effects of past projects, the effects of other current projects, and the effects of probable
22 future projects.

23 (bX 1) Where, prior to the commencement of public review of an environmental

24 document, a project proponent agrees to mitigation measures or project modifications that would avoid any significant effect to point where clearly no significant effect on
25 the environment would occur, lead agency need not prepare an environmental impact report solely because, without mitigation, the environmental effects at issue would have been significant. 26

27 44. "The preparation and circulation of an EIR is more than set of technical hurdles for agencies
28 and developers to overcome. The EIR function is to ensure that government officials who decide to
14

Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 build or approve a project do so with a full understanding of the environmental consequences and,

2 equally important, that the public is assured these consequences have been taken into account.

3 (Vineyard Area Citizens for Responsible Growth v. City of Rancho Cordova, supra, 40 Cal.4th at p.

4 449). Petitioners request this Court vacate the EMWD December 15, 2021 Approval and

5 Authorization of the Recycled Water Agreement for the SJWA and suspend the project until the

6 EMWD has complied with CEQA.

7 XI. SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

Injunctive and Declaratory Relief Against Respondent and Real Party in Interest (CITATION)

10 45. Petitioner hereby allege and incorporate herein by reference the allegations contained in
11 the foregoing paragraphs.

12 46. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law. Unless enjoined, Respondent
13 and Real Party in Interest will implement the Project despite its lack of compliance with CEQA.
14 Petitioners will suffer irreparable harm by Respondent's failure to take the required steps to protect
15 the environment and the implementation of the project. Injunctive Relief is appropriate under Code of
16 Civil Procedure section 525 et seq. and a writ of mandate is appropriate under Code of Civil
17 Procedure section 1085 et seq. and 1094.5 and under Public Resources Code section 21168.9 to

18 prevent irreparable harm to the environment.

XII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

21 WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for judgment as set forth below:
22 A. For a Writ of Mandate or Peremptory Writ of Mandate issued under the seal of this Court

10 approvals issued in reliance on the Approval and conducting the environmental review process that

11 complies with CEQA requirements as set forth herein.

12 C. For Petitioners' fees and cost, including reasonable attorneys' fees and cost, as authorized
