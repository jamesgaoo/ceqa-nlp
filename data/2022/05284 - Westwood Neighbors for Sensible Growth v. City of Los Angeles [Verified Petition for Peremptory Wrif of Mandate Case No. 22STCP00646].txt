VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- INTRODUCTION|

2 1. In or

3 about LDecember, 2021 and February, 2022, Respondent CITY OF LOS

4 ANGELES (City") approved development entitlements including an Eldercare Permit, a

5 Conditional Use Permit, Site Plan Review and Vesting Tract Map for a 12-story, 176,580 square
foot Eldercare Facility containing up to 53 senior independent housing units, 77 assisted living

6

7 care housing guest rooms, 46 Alzheimer's/dementia care housing guest rooms, and associated

8 residential amenity and service areas; a new 2,520 square foot fellowship hall; and a new 19,703

9 square foot childcare facility and administrative office space/multi-purpose group space
(collectively, "the Project") at 10822 Wilshire Boulevard and 10812 Ashton Avenue.

10 2.

11 In approving the Project the City erroneously found that the Project presented

12 sufficient evidence that the strict application of the land use regulations on the subject property

13 would result in practical difficulties and unnecessary hardships inconsistent with the general

purpose

14 and intent of the zoning regulations; that the Project will not create an adverse impact on

15 street access or circulation in the surrounding neighborhood; and that the Project's location, size

16 height, operations and other significant features will be compatible with and not adversely affect

17 or further degrade adjacent properties, the surrounding neighborhood or the public health,
welfare, and safety.

18 3. The City further erroneously determined that a Sustainable Communities

19

20 Environmental Assessment ("SCEA") was the appropriate environmental clearance for the
Project under the California Environmental Quality Act (*CEQA").

21 4.

22 As set forth herein, the City's findings and analysis with regard to the Project

23 entitlements, including the SCEA, are incorrect; are not unsupported by substantial evidence and
law; and violate both state law as well as the City's own Municipal Code ("LAMC").

24 5.

25 For all of the reasons set forth herein, the City's approvals of the Project, including

the SCEA, should be set aside.

26 JURISDICTION

27 6. This Court has jurisdiction over the instant action under $$1085 and 1094.5 of the

28 Code of Civil Procedure, and §§21168 and 21168.5 of the Public Resources Code.

13 STATEMENT OF FACTS

14 14. The Project IS proposed on an approximately 1.62-acre site located at 10822 W.

15 Wilshire Boulevard and 10812 W. Ashton Avenue within the Westwood Community Plan area

16 of the City (the "Project Site").

17 15. The northern portion of the Site, at 10822 Wilshire Boulevard, is located within

18 the boundaries of the Wilshire-Westwood Scenic Corridor Specific Plan (*Specific Plan"), which

19 establishes development standards that supersede the LAMC. Such northern portion, fronting

20 Wilshire Boulevard, is currently improved with an existing church sanctuary, preschool,

21 administrative offices, a fellowship hall, ancillary spaces, and surface parking areas.

22 16. The southeastern portion of the Project Site, at 10812 Ashton Avenue, is improved

23 with a church-owned single-family residence and additional surface parking areas.

24 17. The Project proposes demolition of the existing preschool, administrative offices,

25 fellowship hall, paved parking areas, and the single-family residence in order to construct the

26 proposed Eldercare Facility and Childcare Facility. The existing church on the northern portion

27 of the Project Site is proposed to remain.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 18. On or about June 14, 2018, Real Parties filed applications Case Nos. ZA-2018-
2 3422-ELD-CU-DRB-SPP-SPR and VTT-82107 ("Project Entitlement Cases") with the City's

3 Department of City Planning (*Planning Department") seeking various entitlements required by

4 law to develop the Project. Real Parties' application included entitlement requests for (i) a

5 Eldercare Facility Unified Permit including deviations from LAMC and Specific Plan

6 requirements; (ii) a Conditional Use to allow a preschool and church administrative offices within

7 the R1 Zone; (iii) a Conditional Use for a list of deviations in connection with the proposed

8 preschool, including a maximum building height of 34 feet in lieu of 28 feet, reduced side yard

9 setbacks, and a residential floor area of 19,567 square feet in lieu of the 7,442 permitted; (iv) Site

10 Plan Review for the development of 50 or more dwelling units or guest rooms; (v) Design Review

11 and Project Permit Compliance under the Specific Plan; (vi) and a Vesting Tentative Tract Map

12 to create three ground lots and multiple commercial condominium units (the "Project

13 Entitlements").

14 19. In connection with the Project Entitlement Cases, Real Parties also filed a separate

15 application in Case No. ENV-2018-3423-EAF seeking environmental review and approval of the

16 Project under CEQA.

17 20. On or about November 12, 2020, the Planning Department issued a Notice ofT

18 Availability of the SCEA, the City's proposed environmental documents under CEQA, providing

19 a for a public comment period until December 14, 2020.

20 21. The Initial Study and Environmental Analysis portions of the SCEA identified

21 several substantive environmental issues of which the Project had the potential to negatively

22 impact the environment, including cultural resources and noise. The SCEA also conclusively

23 determined less than significant impact on several environmental issues, including aesthetics and

24 transportation.

25 22. The Planning Department concluded that the Project qualified as a "transit priority

26 project" that satisfied the requirements of Sections 21155 and 21155.2 of the Public Resources

27 Code ("PRC"), and/or a qualified "residential or mixed use residential project" that satisfied the

28 requirements of Section 21159.28(d) of the PRC. and although the Project could have a potentially

5
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 significant effect on the environment. there would not be a significant effect because the SCEA

2 identified measures that either avoided or mitigated to a level of insignificance all potentially

3 significant or significant effects of the Project.

4 23. On or about December 14, 2020, Petitioner, through counsel, submitted a comment

5 letter outlining several deficiencies of the SCEA.

6 24. In or about February 2021, the City prepared and published an Erratum to the

7 SCEA to make minor technical corrections and clarifications to the SCEA. The City determined

8 that these modifications clarified and refined the SCEA and provided supplemental information

9 to City decision-makers and the public. The City further determined that the information added

10 pursuant to the Erratum did not disclose any new significant environmental impact that would

11 result from the Project, nor identified any new or different mitigation measures resulting in new

12 significant effects.

13 25. On or about May 4, 2021, the Planning and Land Use Management Committee

14 ("PLUM Committee"), a standing committee of the City Council, met at a regularly scheduled

15 hearing to consider the SCEA. Members of the public, including Petitioner, through counsell

16 appeared and spoke against the Project and the SCEA. After taking testimony and closing the+

17 public hearing, the PLUM Committee recommended approval of the SCEA, the Erratum dated

18 February 2021, the Mitigation Monitoring Program prepared for the SCEA, and the

19 Environmental Findings for the Project.

20 26. On or about May 18, 2021, the City Council adopted the PLUM Committee's

21 recommendation.

22 27. On or about June 9, 2021, the City's Deputy Advisory Agency and the Office of

23 Zoning Administration jointly held a telephonic public hearing regarding the Project. The purpose

24 of the hearing was to obtain testimony from affected and/or interested persons regarding the

25 Project. The hearing was conducted by Associate Zoning Administrator Henry Chu for Case No.
26 ZA-2018-3422-ELD-CU-DRB-SPP-SPR and CEQA No. ENV-2019-5735-SCEA (the SCEA

27 document adopted by the City Council), and the Deputy Advisory Agency for Case No. VTT-

28 82107.

6
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- 28.

2 LPetitioner, Petitioner's counsel and impacted neighbors and Westwood residents

3 appeared at the June 9, 2021 hearing and spoke in opposition to the Project, the inappropriateness

4 of the requested deviations from the LAMC and Specific Plan; that the required legal findings for

5 the Project could not be made with supporting substantial evidence; that the Project's approval

6 violated both state, including CEQA, and City laws; and the adverse impacts it would have on the
adjacent and surrounding community.

29.

8 On or about July 21, 2021, the Advisory Agency approved the Vesting Tentative

9 Tract Map for the merger and re-subdivision of six-lots into three, as requested in VTT-82107
and the Office of Zoning Administration approved the entitlements requested in ZA-2018-3422-
10 ELD-CU-DRB-SPP-SPR.

11 30.

12 On or about August 5, 2021, Petitioner filed timely appeals of the entirety of the

13 City's July 21, 2021 determinations to the City Planning Commission. In the appeals, Petitioner

14 contended that the legally required findings for the Project could not be made with substantial

15 supporting evidence and that the proposed SCEA was inadequate as a matter of law.

31.

16 On or about November 4, 2021, the City Planning Commission met to consider

17 Petitioner's appeals of the Project. Again, numerous concerned members of the public, including

18 Petitioner, appeared and testified against the Project, its many adverse impacts, and the adequacy

19 of both the legally required findings under the Municipal Code and the proposed SCEA.

32.

20 After taking testimony and closing the public hearing, the City Planning
Commission approved the Project.

21 33.

22 On or about December 2, 2021, the City Planning Commission issued a Letter of
Determination regarding its November 4, 2021 actions.

23 34.

24 On December 9, 2021, the City Planning Commission issued a corrected Letter of

25 Determination regarding its November 4, 2021 actions relating to Case No. ZA-2018-3422-ELD-

CU-DRB-SPP-SPR.

26 35.

27 On or about December 10, 2021, Petitioner filed a timely appeal of the Tract Map

28 approval in VTT-82107 to the City Council. In the appeal, Petitioner again contended that the
proposed SCEA was inadequate as a matter of law; that the findings for Tract Map could not be

7
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 made with supporting substantial evidence.

2 36. On or about February 15, 2022, the PLUM Committee considered Petitioner's

3 appeal. Petitioner, through counsel, appeared and testified against the Project, and the inadequacy

4 of both the SCEA and the findings for the Tract Map. After taking testimony and closing the

5 public hearing, the PLUM Committee denied Petitioner's appeal, thereby sustaining the

6 determination of the Los Angeles City Planning Commission.

7 37. On or about February 22, 2022, the City Council adopted the PLUM Committee's

8 report and recommendation without further public hearing.

9 38. The City's actions, as set forth hereinabove, constitute a final action of the City to

10 approve the Project Entitlements and adopt the SCEA.

11 39. As set forth above, Petitioner objected to the Project entitlements and proposed

12 SCEA during the administrative process, including submitting letters, filing appeals, and

13 testifying during public hearings, thereby exhausting of its administrative remedies.

14 40. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law

15 unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate and injunctive relief.

16 41. Unless the City and Real Parties are restrained and enjoined from the issuance of

17 grading and building permits as well as any construction of the Project before the Court's

18 determination on the merits in this action, Petitioner and the general public will suffer great and

19 irreparable harm. Further, without injunctive relief, Petitioner would be denied its rightful

20 remedies if the Project was allowed to proceed with development and thereafter the Court

21 determines that the SCEA and Project approvals shall be set aside on any of the grounds asserted

22 herein.

23 42. Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code §21167.5 by providing the

24 City with notice of intention to commence the within action. [Exhibit A].

25 43. Petitioner requests that Respondents prepare the administrative record [Exhibit B].

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

2 FINDINGS NOT SUPPORTED BY SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE

3 44. Petitioner repeats, realleges and incorporates by reference each and every

4 allegation contained in Paragraphs 1-41, inclusive, as though fully set forth herein.

5 45. In taking action on any discretionary project, including the within Project, the City

6 must proceed in accordance with law, provide a fair hearing, and support its decision with findings

7 which are supported by substantial evidence.

8 46. The City's actions in approving the Project were arbitrary and capricious and an

9 abuse of discretion because, among other reasons, the City's findings are not supported by

10 substantial evidence.

11 47. Pursuant to the LAMC, in order to grant an Eldercare Facility Unified Permit, the

12 City must find that strict application of the land use regulations on the subject property would

13 result in practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships inconsistent with the general purpose and

14 intent of the zoning regulations.

15 48. The City's findings of "practical difficulties" or "unnecessary hardships" are not

16 supported by substantial evidence. The City's finding that the existence of the Zoning Code and

17 its requirements are, in and a of itself, a hardship does not pass muster under the law. The financial

18 feasibility study submitted by the Applicant and adopted by the City is premised on an explicit

19 admission that the analysis was based upon an underlying presumption of financial infeasibility.

20 At best, the City has accepted a self-imposed argument of hardship made by the Real Party in

21 Interest, which is, again, not allowed under the law.

22 49. Pursuant to the LAMC, in order to grant an Eldercare Facility Unified Permit, the

23 City must also find that the Project will not create an adverse impact on street access of circulation

24 in the surrounding neighborhood. Relying narrowly on CEQA thresholds rather than the evidence

25 of adverse impacts on Malcom and Ashton Avenues, both small residential streets that will serve

26 as primary access to the Project, the City made the finding in the affirmative. The City's finding
27 is not supported by substantial evidence.
28 /l/

9
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

50. To grant an Eldercare Facility Unified Permit, Conditional Use Permit, and Site

2 Plan Review for the Project, the LAMC requires the City to make similar findings regarding

3 compatibility with adjacent and surrounding properties: (i) that project's location, size, height,

4 operations and other significant features shall be compatible with and shall not adversely affect

5 or further degrade adjacent properties, the surrounding neighborhood, or the public health,

6 welfare, and safety; (ii) that the project provides for an arrangement of uses, buildings, structures,

7 open spaces and other improvements that are compatible with the scale and character of the

8 adjacent properties and surrounding neighborhood; and (iii) that the project consists of an

9 arrangement of buildings and structures (including height, bulk and setbacks), off-street parking

10 facilities, loading areas, lighting, landscaping, trash collection, and other such pertinent

11 improvements, that is or will be compatible with existing and future development on adjacent

12 properties and neighboring properties.

13 51. Here, testimony by adjacent and surrounding property owners establishes that the

14 Project's size and proposed operations will be incompatible with and will adversely impact the

15 adjacent properties, the surrounding neighborhood, and the public health, welfare, and safety. In

16 order to make contrary findings in the affirmative, the City ignored all such evidence of such

17 impacts. The City's findings are not supported by substantial evidence.

18 52. To grant all of the entitlements for the Project, including the Eldercare Permit,

19 Conditional Use, Site Plan Review and Vesting Tentative Tract Map the City must further find

20 that project iS in substantial conformance with the purposes, intent and provisions of the General

21 Plan, applicable community plan (Westwood Community Plan), and any application specific plan

22 (Wilshire-Westwood Scenic Corridor Specific Plan).

23 53. The City's findings with regard to the General Plan, Westwood Community Plan,

24 and Wilshire-Westwood Scenic Corridor Specific Plan are not supported by substantial evidence.

25 The City's findings ignore all inconsistencies and evidence of inconsistencies of the Project to

26 the General Plan, Westwood Community Plan, and Wilshire-Westwood Scenic Corridor Specific

27 Plan.

28 ///

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

2 NONCOMPLIANCE WITH CEQA

3 54.

4 Petitioner repeats, realleges and incorporates by reference each and every
allegation contained in Paragraphs 1-41, inclusive, as though fully set forth herein.

5 55. CEQA, as set forth in Public Resources Code §§21000-21177, was enacted to

6

7 ensure that the long-term protection of the environment, consistent with the provision of a decent

8 home and suitable living environment for every Californian, shall be the guiding criterion for
public decisions.

9 56.

10 CEQ requires that prior to approval of any discretionary project, the environmental
effects of that project be evaluated on the existing environment.

11 57.

12 58. CEQA requires strict compliance with the procedures and mandates of the statute.

13 CEQA is not merely a procedural statute. It imposes clear and substantive

14 responsibilities on agencies that propose to approve projects, requiring such agencies not to

15 approve projects that harm the environment unless and until all feasible mitigation measures are
employed to minimize that harm.

16 59.

17 Failure to comply with the substantive requirements of CEQA or to carry out the +

18 full CEQA procedures so that complete information of a project's impacts is developed and

19 a publicly disclosed constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion that requires invalidation of the

20 public agency action regardless of whether full compliance would have produced a different

result.

21 60.

22 In taking the actions set forth herein, including the determination that the Project's
approvals may rely on an SCEA, the City has erred and/or abused its discretion.

23 61.

24 Specifically, the Project, as proposed, does not qualify as a Transit Priority Project,

25 does not maintain the requisite residential uses and is not eligible for a SCEA under the pertinent
PRC requirements.

26 62.

27 The Project is also not consistent with the General Land Use designation, density,

28 building intensity and applicable policies specified in the RTP/SCS prepared by the Southern
California Association of Governments ("SCAG") and therefore is not eligible for a

11
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 SCEA.

2 63. The SCEA further provides a Project description which is inadequate and a

3 discussion of transportation impacts which is not supported by substantial evidence. The SCEA's

4 finding of no impact with regard to whether the Project would substantially increase hazards due

5 to a geometric design feature (e.g., sharp curves or dangerous intersections) or incompatible uses

6 (e.g., farm equipment) is conclusory and completely devoid of any, let alone substantial, evidence

7 and ignores all of the evidence to the contrary presented to the City.

8 64. For all of these reasons, the actions of the City in approving the Project based upon

9 the SCEA constitutes error and an abuse of discretion, not supported by substantial evidence, and

10 warrant a writ of mandamus setting aside the SCEA and the Project approvals.

11 65. As a result of the City's CEQA violations, Petitioner, other members of the public,

12 and City decision-makers have been harmed, and will continue to be harmed unless this Court

13 grants the requested relief, as they were not fully informed about the significant environmental

14 impacts of the Projects prior to the City's approval of the Project and adoption of the SCEA.

15 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

16 VIOLATIONS OF CITY LAW

17 66. Petitioner repeats, realleges and incorporates by reference each and every

18 allegation contained in Paragraphs 1-41, inclusive, as though fully set forth herein.

19 67. LAMC §12.24.F provides, in pertinent part, that in approving a conditional use for

20 a project, the decision-maker may impose conditions related to the interests addressed in the

21 findings set forth in LAMC § 12.24.E and may state that the height and area regulations required

22 by other provisions of the Zoning Code shall not apply to the conditional use approved.

23 68. For the Project, the City granted two deviations under LAMC §12.24.F authority:

24 a Conditional Use to permit side yard setbacks of 5 feet in lieu of the setbacks and building plane

25 break dimensions otherwise required for the proposed childcare center by LAMC $12.08 C.2 and

26 LAMC $12.21 C.3; and a fence height of up to six feet in lieu of three and one-half feet otherwise

27 allowed by LAMC §12.22 C.20(f)(2) in the front yard of an R zone, and up to eight feet in lieu

28 of six feet otherwise required by LAMC §12.22 C.20(f)(3) in the required easterly side yard of

12
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 an R zone.

2 69. LAMC §12.24.F does not provide any authority for the Zoning Administrator to

3 approve either a setback deviation in connection with the conditional use request, or a fence height

4 adjustment. Accordingly, the City's action is in error and violated its own Municipal Code.

5 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for judgment against Respondents and Real Parties, and

6 each of them, as follows:

7 First Cause of Action

8 1. That this Court issue an alternative and peremptory writ of mandate directing the
City to set aside its approvals of the Project and reconsider the Project in light of the Court's

10 opinion and judgment;

11 Second Cause of Agtion

12 2. That this Court issue an alternative and peremptory writ of mandate directing the

13 City and its departments, to set aside and vacate the adopted SCEA for the Project;

14 3. That this Court issue an alternative and peremptory writ of mandate directing the

15 City and its departments to set aside and vacate all Project approvals which are based upon the

16 inadequate SCEA;

17 Third Cause of Action

18 4. That this Court issue a Writ of Mandamus directing the City to set aside its

19 approval of the Project and reconsider the Project in light of the Court's opinion and judgment,

20 including all City and State laws and regulations;

21 All Causes of Action

22 5. For a temporary restraining order, and preliminary and permanent injunctions
