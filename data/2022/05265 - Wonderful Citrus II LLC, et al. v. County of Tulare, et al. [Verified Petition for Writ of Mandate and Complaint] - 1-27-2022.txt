1 INTRODUCTION

2 1. In violation of state and local law, Real Party in Interest Touchstone Pistachio

3 Company, LLC, has transformed a small, local pistachio processing facility into a regional

4 pistachio processing facility on prime farmland in Tulare County. The original facility was

5 approved by the County of Tulare more than 25 years ago (in 1996) as a small processing
6 operation, limited to no more than 10 employees and a requirement that at least half of the
7 pistachios processed at the facility also be grown on-site.

8 2. Touchstone Pistachio Company, LLC (*Touchstone Pistachio"), which calls itself

9 "one of the largest Grower-Processors of California Pistachios in the industry," acquired the

10 facility less than two years ago. Touchstone's public announcement touted expanding the

11 facility to a "capacity of 50+ million LBS and developing further." (Exhibit 1 - June 30, 2020,

12 letter)

13 3. The County of Tulare's most recent approval, challenged here, increases the on-

14 site storage (and, in turn, associated capacity) by nearly 40 million pounds - almost double the

15 existing processing capacity. Yet the County completed no environmental review under the
16 California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"). Remarkably, the County deemed the near
17 doubling of the facility's number of 50-foot tall silos categorically exempt under CEQA

18 Guidelines Class 2 Section 15302(b) for Existing Facilities and Class 3 Section 15303 for New

19 Construction and Conversions of Small Structures. The use of these categorical exemptions was

20 inappropriate.

21 4. Touchstone Pistachio's acquisition of the facility was preceded by and has been
22 followed with the County's illegal issuance of various approvals to allow a facility intended to

23 process locally grown product to become a plant processing pistachios grown up to one hundred

24 miles away and from across the entire San Joaquin Valley.

25 5. The County has allowed the facility's expansion to proceed unabated despite the

26 County's failure to conduct any environmental review. Located along Avenue 88 near Terra

1 Bella, between Avenue 96 and Queen B Road in an unincorporated area of Tulare County (the

2 "Project Site"), the facility's most recent expansion effort requires additional discretionary

3 approval from Tulare County. The County is required to comply with its own Code and CEQA

4 before issuing any approvals that further the facility's construction. Touchstone Pistachio knows

5 this. The County knows this. But the County and Touchstone Pistachio continue to ignore the

6 law.

7 6. As shown in the image below from 2004, as originally permitted, the modest facility

8 consisted of a couple of buildings, four small silos, and limited exterior equipment and storage.

19 7. More recently, however, through a series of piecemealed, illegally issued building
20 permits and other approvals, this small local facility has transformed into a major regional

21 processing plant, removing swaths of prime farmland from agricultural production in the process

22 and thereby reducing the amount of on-site growing capacity this facility is required to have

23 under its existing Special Use Permit. As shown in the following 2022 image, hundreds of
24 pistachio trees were cleared to provide additional staging areas and the facility's main building
25 substantially expanded.

(Project Site in 2022) 9
8. Touchstone Pistachio is again expanding the facility through the construction of 10
16 new storage silos, a second truck scale, and a refurbished huller line (the "Project"). On or 11
about December 20, 2021, the County issued Minor Modification No. 21-054 authorizing the 12

13 addition of a new truck scale, 16 new silos (for 36 total), and an upgraded huller line system in

14 violation of the County Code and CEQA.

9. Despite the County Code's (including its Zoning Ordinance) and CEQA's 15

16 mandates, the County approved Minor Modification No. 21-054, without complying with the
required administrative review process or conducting any environmental review. Additionally, 17

18 the County is currently processing multiple building permits in furtherance of the Project with
full knowledge that the Minor Modification that these approvals purport to rely upon is not yet 19
final.
20
10. Although Petitioners appealed the County's illegally-issued Minor Modification 21

22 on January 3, 2022, the County has refused to act on that appeal or even schedule a hearing.

11. The County knew that it was required to comply with its Code and CEQA prior to 23
the issuance of any discretionary approvals in furtherance of the Project. Notwithstanding this 24

25 knowledge, the County has illegally issued the Minor Modification approving new construction

26 activities in furtherance of the Project and ignored its violations of the County Code, including
its Zoning Ordinance. 27
12. Touchstone's industrial agricultural operation will have irreversible adverse 28

1 impacts on the environment. Yet the County has not completed any environmental review prior

2 to issuing the Minor Modification. The County has violated CEQA by issuing the Minor
3 Modification and continuing to process applications for additional building permits for
4 construction work with potentially severe environmental impacts prior to completing any of the

5 required analyses of those impacts. Continued expansion activities at the Project Site will result

6 in irrevocable adverse environmental impacts and render the County's compliance with CEQA a

7 mere post-hoc rationalization for approving the Project-i.e., a meaningless paperwork exercise.

8 PARTIES

9 13. Petitioner Wonderful Citrus II LLC (a "Petitioner" or "Wonderful Citrus") is a

10 Delaware limited liability company that owns citrus farms in the County, including roughly 132

11 acres of citrus fields within two miles of the Project Site (bounded by Road 192, Avenue 80, and

12 Avenue 74). Petitioner is committed to farming in a manner that minimizes environmental

13 impacts by employing sustainable farming practices including responsible water management,

14 careful soil maintenance, and a responsible integrated pest management program, including
15 employment of bio-rational pest control measures. Petitioner also owns and operates processing
16 facilities and employs people who live and work within the area under the jurisdiction of the San

17 Joaquin Air Pollution Control District (or "Air District"), including in the County of Tulare.

18 Wonderful Citrus' employees travel on the same roads used by Touchstone's trucks and face

19 increased traffic, risk of accident, and exposure to pollution as a result of the increased truck
20 traffic that the County's approvals create. Similarly, Wonderful Citrus' property and its

21 employees are exposed to increased emissions and pollution as a result of these truck trips and

22 increased operations at Touchstone's facility. Petitioner uses groundwater resources for
23 purposes of irrigating its crops in Tulare County generally and specifically at its approximately

24 132-acre property located less than two miles from the Project Site. Touchstone's increased
25 processing capacity will require an increase in the amount of water used. This water is drawn
26 from the same groundwater resource that Wonderful Citrus utilizes. Further, an increase in the

27 amount of water used for processing increases the amount of wastewater that will be stored in the

28 facility's 13-acre wastewater pond. Odors from these wastewater ponds have the potential to

1 impact Wonderful Citrus' employees and Wonderful Citrus' operations at its property.

2 14. Petitioner The Wonderful Company LLC (also a "Petitioner" or "The Wonderful

3 Company") is a Delaware limited liability company that coordinates with related entities to farm

4 and process pistachios in the Central Valley. The Wonderful Company is a related entity to

5 Wonderful Citrus. The Wonderful Company-related entities own or operate nearly 4,500 acres

6 of land in Tulare County. Like Wonderful Citrus, The Wonderful Company is committed to

7 farming in a manner that minimizes environmental impacts by employing sustainable farming

8 practices including responsible water management, careful soil maintenance, and a responsible

9 integrated pest management program, including employment of bio-rational pest control

10 measures. The Wonderful Company's employees access the Tulare County properties using the

11 same roads used by Touchstone's trucks a and, as a result, face increased traffic and exposure to

12 pollution as a result of the increased truck traffic associated with the facility's continued
13 expansion. The Wonderful Company has demonstrated its commitment to Tulare County by

14 donating millions of dollars to non-profit organizations and schools that address, among other

15 issues, child health and welfare issues. The Wonderful Company also owns and operates food
16 processing facilities and employs people who live and work within the area under the Air

17 District's jurisdiction, including within the County of Tulare. Touchstone's increased processing

18 capacity will require an increase in the amount of water used and may potentially impact the

19 local groundwater basin. This water is drawn from the same groundwater resource that The
20 Wonderful Company utilizes to service its property, threatening the long-term viability of

21 agricultural uses on these properties.

22 15. Respondent and Defendant County of Tulare and its Resource Management

23 Agency (collectively the "County") has land use jurisdiction over the unincorporated areas of the

24 County, including the Project Site.

25 16. Real Party Touchstone Pistachio Company, LLC, is a California Limited Liability
26 Company. On information and belief, Touchstone Pistachio Company applied for Minor
27 Modification No. 21-054 on December 17, 2021, which the County issued on December 20,

28 2021.

6 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

7 18. This Court has jurisdiction to issue the relief requested pursuant to Code of Civil
8 Procedure sections 526, 1085, and 1094.5 and Public Resources Code sections 21168 and

9 21168.5.

10 19. Venue in this court is proper pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 393

11 and 394, as the Project Site is located in the unincorporated area under the County's land use

12 jurisdiction.

13 20. Petitioners have performed all conditions precedent to filing this Petition,

14 including, but not limited to, exhausting all administrative remedies or otherwise being excused

15 therefrom such requirement by futility, lack of jurisdiction, and/or unavailability of any other

16 timely review. Pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.5, Petitioners provided

17 Respondent County with notice of intent to file this action on January 3, 2022. A true and

18 accurate copy of that notice is attached hereto as Exhibit 2. Petitioners complied with the Public

19 Resources Code Section 21167.5 by providing Respondent with notice of intention to commence

20 the action. (attached as Exhibit 3.) Petitioners complied with the Public Resources Code Section

21 21167.7 by serving a copy of this Petition on the California Attorney General. (attached as

22 Exhibit 4.)

23 21. Petitioners have standing to assert these claims because Petitioners are directly
24 impacted by the impacts the Project will create and Petitioners have a material interest in

25 ensuring that the County properly analyzes and mitigates the effects associated with the Project

26 and otherwise complies with the law. Petitioners seek to vindicate the substantial public interest

27 in protection of the environment and other interests alleged herein. Petitioners have no plain,

28 speedy, or adequate remedy at law.

LATHAM&WATKINSLP
ATTORNEYS AT LAM VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

LOs ANGELES AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- LEGAL BACKGROUND

2 22. Under state law, the County is

3 legal subdivision of the State and "may exercise

4 its powers only through the board of supervisors or through agents and officers acting under
authority of the board or authority conferred by law." (Govt. Code, §§ 23002, 23003, 23005.) A
5 county's powers include legislative powers to enact ordinances and resolutions and to "do and

6 perform all other acts and things required by law

7 or which are necessary to the full discharge

8 of the duties of the legislative authority of the county government." (Id., § 25207; see generally
id. §§ 25200 et seq.)

9 23.

10 Notwithstanding their standing as a legal subdivision of the State with legislative

11 and other powers, as the Supreme Court has explained, "Public entities have, inter alia, a
mandatory duty to obey legislative enactments

12 (Ramos v. County of Madera (1971) 4

13 Cal.3d 685, 696.) Indeed, "It is elementary that public officials must themselves obey the law."
(Wirin v. Parker (1957) 48 Cal.2d 890, 894.)

14 24.

15 This elementary requirement of municipal law requires that a public entity or
public official exercise their discretion (if any) under a proper interpretation of law. (See, e.g.,
16 Common Cause v. Board of Supervisors (1989) 49 Cal.3d 432, 442 ["Mandamus may issue,
17 however, to compel an official both to exercise his discretion (if he is required by law to do so)

18

19 and to exercise it under a proper interpretation of the applicable law."]; see also Valley Advocates
V. City of Fresno (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 1039, 1061-63 ['"a prejudicial abuse of discretion
20 occurs when a public agency 1S misinformed regarding its discretionary authority and, as a result,

21 does not actually choose whether to exercise that discretionary authority"].)

22 25.

23 The County of Tulare, through its County Code, including its Zoning Ordinance,

24 has prescribed both procedural and substantive requirements for the issuance, modification, or
revocation of permits and other approvals governing land use and development, including, for
25 example, special use permits, minor modifications, and building permits.

26 26.

27 Accordingly, the County of Tulare, though vested with the authority to enact the

28 County Code, including its Zoning Ordinance, must follow the County Code.

27. Similarly, CEQA, a state law, imposes clear and substantive responsibilities on

LATHAM&WATKINS.P 8

ATTORNEYS AT LAV
LOs ANGELES VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 public agencies and is not merely : procedural statute. CEQA generally requires that public

2 agencies not approve projects that harm the environment unless and until all feasible mitigation

3 measures are employed to minimize that harm. (Pub. Resources Code §§ 21002, 21002.1, subd.

4 (b).) Agencies shall not undertake actions that could have a significant adverse effect on the

5 environment, or limit the choice of alternatives or mitigation measures, before complying with

6 CEQA. (Guidelines § 15004, subd. (b)(2).)2

7 28. Accordingly, public agencies may not "take any action" that furthers a project "in

8 a manner that forecloses alternatives or mitigation measures that would ordinarily be part of

9 CEQA review of that public project." (Save Tara v. City of West Hollywood (2008) 45 Cal.4th

10 116, 138.)

11 29. Thus, CEQA does not permit the postponement of environmental review "to the

12 point where the 'bureaucratic and financial momentum™ has built up "irresistibly behind a

13 proposed project thus providing a strong incentive to ignore environmental concerns." (Save

14 Tara, supra, 45 Cal.4th at 135.)

15 30. Failure either to comply with CEQA's substantive or procedural requirements so
16 that complete information as to a project's impacts is not developed and publicly disclosed
17 constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion that requires invalidation of the public agency action

18 regardless of whether full compliance would have produced a different result. (Pub. Resources

19 Code § 21005.)

20 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

21 A. Project Site

22 31. The Project Site is located at 19570 Avenue 88, just west of the County's Terra

23 Bella community. The Project Site is under the County's land use jurisdiction. The Project Site

24 is located less than one mile west of the Friant-Kern Canal and is immediately surrounded by

25 farms and other currently fallow farmland and orchards.

26 32. The Project Site is zoned AE-40. The AE zone, or Exclusive Agricultural Zone,

1 limits allowable uses to agricultural uses and uses that are a "necessary and integral part" of

3 the AE-40 zone is 40 acres.

4 33. The Project Site subject to the San Joaquin Air Pollution Control District's and

5 the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board's jurisdiction. The Project Site is also

6 located within the Tule Sub-basin of the San Joaquin Groundwater Basin.

7 B. 1996 Special Use Permit

8 34. As explained in Special Use Permit No. 96-074, the facility's packing component

9 was originally constructed in 1983 to serve an on-site pistachio grove. In 1983, no use permit

10 was required for this operation. In 1986, however, the County amended its Zoning Code to

11 require uses engaging in curing, processing, packaging, packing, storage, and shipping of

12 agricultural products to obtain a special use permit. Thus, since 1986, the Zoning Code (section

13 9.7) requires a Special Use Permit for curing, processing, packaging, packing, storage, and

14 shipping of agricultural products in the AE Zone.

15 35. In or around 1996, the previous owner illegally commenced construction of new
16 processing facilities in violation of the County Code. In response, the County required a Special

17 Use Permit to "bring an existing agricultural packing facility into conformance [with the Code]

18 and allow an expansion to said use The County issued Special Use Permit No. 96-074

19 (attached as Exhibit 5).

20 36. Although the County issued Special Use Permit No. 96-074 for the 1996

21 expansion of the facility, Special Use Permit No. 96-074 was premised on strict limits on where

22 the processed product originated and the number of facility employees. Specifically, Finding

23 No. 2 states that "the Zoning Administrator is authorized to approve or deny requests for special

24 use permits for expansion of ag processing facilities where more than one-half of the product is

25 produced on site and less than 10 persons are employed."

26 37. Special Use Permit No. 96-074's findings further note that the "applicant has

27 requested a Special Use Permit to bring an existing agricultural packing facility into
28 conformance and allow expansion of the facility on approximately 3.8 acres of a 78.48 acre site."

ATTORNEYS AT LAW VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

LOs ANGELES AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 At the time of the Special Use Permit's approval, the facility was an ancillary use to the existing
2 pistachio farming operation.

3 38. Likewise, the conditions of approval for Special Use Permit No. 96-074 limited

4 the duration and longevity of this use permit. Condition No. 11 states that "This Special Use

5 Permit shall automatically expire and become null and void two (2) years after the use for which

6 it was granted is discontinued or abandoned."

7 C. In 2015, A Piecemealed, Exponential Expansion of the Facility Begins

8 39. Between 2004 and 2015, the Project facilities appear to have remained generally

9 unchanged and largely consistent with the Special Use Permit, comprising a cluster of buildings,

10 four small silos, and limited exterior equipment and storage.

11 40. However, starting in 2015, the County allowed the facility to commence a

12 piecemeal expansion of the facility that, put together, would allow for a massive expansion of the

13 originally permitted facility.

14 41. On March 27, 2015, the County issued a "Special Use Permit Minor
15 Modification," No. 15-006, that purported to approve the construction of an additional receiving

16 unit and three additional "48' diameter" storage silos (over 50 feet tall). In terms of storage

17 capacity (by number of storage silos), this "minor modification" represented a 75% increase

18 above what Special Use Permit No. 96-074 permitted. Despite this substantial increase in

19 capacity, the County asserted that this expansion was exempt from CEQA under its Class 1,

20 Class 2, and Class 3 categorical exemptions for minor alterations to existing structures,

21 reconstruction of existing structures, and new construction of "small facilities or structures,"

22 respectively.

23 42. On July 6, 2017, the County issued a second "Minor Modification," No. 17-034,

24 to allow for the addition of seventeen storage silos, along with an additional receiving pit and

25 twelve 26-foot tall pistachio dryers. In terms of receiving capacity (number of receiving pits),

26 the 2017 "minor modification" doubled the capacity on top of the 2015 approval. In terms of

27 storage capacity, the County, with this 2017 approval and its 2015 approval, had approved a

28 500% increase above what had been originally permitted by Special Use Permit No. 96-074.
11
LATHAM&WATKINSLP
ATTORNEYS AT LAW VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

LOs ANGELES AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 Despite this massive increase in capacity, the County asserted that this expansion was exempt

2 from CEQA under the Class 3 categorical exemption, even though the Class 3 exemption, by its

3 own terms, applies only to "limited numbers of new, small facilities or structures," such as one

4 single-family residence or the addition of 2,500 square feet to a store or office structure. The

5 area approved for new construction for the seventeen new storage silos alone (not including the

6 additional receiving pit and twelve new drying facilities) exceeds 123,000 square feet.

7 43. Less than a year later, on February 5, 2018, the County issued yet another "Minor
8 Modification," No. 18-009, this time to permit the addition of a 13-acre (over 565,000 square

9 feet), 184 acre-feet capacity wastewater treatment pond. As with the prior "minor
10 modifications," the County asserted this approval was exempt from CEQA under its Class 3

11 exemption (for limited numbers of new, small facilities) and its Class 4 exemption (minor

12 alterations in the condition of land, water, and/or vegetation). The County also boldly asserted

13 that this new 13-acre wastewater pond had "no reasonable possibility that [it] may cause a

14 significant effect on the environment

15 44. In May and June 2020, the County issued two building permits authorizing
16 construction that was beyond the scope of the Special Use Permit and Minor Modifications.

17 45. In December 2021, the County issued Minor Modification No. 21-054 to the

18 facility's Special Use Permit No. 96-074 which authorizes the addition of a new truck scale, 16

19 new silos, and an upgraded huller line system.

20 46. If an additional 16 silos are built, Petitioners are informed and believe that the

21 Project will have the capacity to process up to 90 million pounds of pistachios per year. In

22 contrast, when Special Use Permit No. 96-074 was approved in 1996, the facility's processing

23 capacity was approximately 225,000 pounds per year.3 Petitioners are also informed and believe

24 that the Project, if developed as proposed, will potentially result in significant, adverse impacts

25 to the environment that have not been analyzed, disclosed, or mitigated in any way. These

26

27 3 Special Use Permit No. 96-074 limited processing capacity to twice the on-site capacity. Assuming an average production capacity of approximately 2,805 pounds of pistachios per acre
28 of trees, 112,200 pounds could come from the adjacent 40-acre parcel and another equal amount that could legally come from off-site.

1 potential impacts include but are not necessarily limited to the following.

2 a. Air quality due to, among other things, the addition of a truck scale, which

3 will double the current number of scales on-site and will accommodate more trucks

4 moving on and off the property, and the addition of 16 new silos which will increase on-

5 site storage by 44%, both of which will increase truck traffic from hauling product from

6 off-site locations up to approximately 150 miles away to the Project Site for processing,

7 which will result in injury to public health as well as to the health of Petitioner's

8 employees who live and work close to the Project Site and under the jurisdiction of the

9 Air District.

10 b. Groundwater supply from the San Joaquin Groundwater Basin, Tule Sub-

11 Basin, which is designated as a High Priority Basin under the Sustainable Groundwater

12 Management Act and is in a state of critical overdraft, due to, among other things, the

13 Project's increased demand for production water as evidenced by its new 13-acre

14 wastewater treatment pond; and

15 C. Increased noise disturbance due to the 24-hour a day processing of

16 pistachios at the expanded plant.

17 47. The County's continued failure to conduct any environmental review or monitor

18 operations at the expanded facility could result in reverberating impacts across the pistachio

19 industry. The Touchstone facility has undergone a haphazard, exponential expansion, without

20 any environmental review and no meaningful oversight from the County, despite a history of

21 prior health and safety measure violations. The County's failure to require Touchstone to

22 undergo even the most basic environmental review threatens the integrity of California's entire
23 pistachio processing industry.

24 D. The County Illegally Issues Minor Modification No. 21-054 for the Project's

25 Expansion

26 48. The County knew about the Project's collective scale and the requirements for

27 discretionary review and approval prior to the filing of this lawsuit.

28 49. Under the County Code and Zoning Ordinance, the issuance of Minor

10 established, operated, or maintained contrary to the provisions of any statute, any

11 provision of this Code, or any other ordinance adopted by the Board" and "Anything

12 which is injurious to health . .. so as to interfere with the comfortable enjoyment of life or

13 property."

14 50. As described in more detail below, the County issued Minor Modification No. 21-

15 054 authorizing expansion of the facility that exceeded the scope of the permitted uses at the

16 Project Site and also violated the law in other ways.

17 E. The County Continues to Allow Piecemeal Expansion of the Facility

18 51. The County issued the Minor Modification No. 21-054 on December 20, 2021,

19 authorizing the addition of 16 storage silos, one truck scale, and a refurbished huller line.
20 (attached as Exhibit 6.)

21 52. On December 22, 2021, the County issued a Notice of Exemption associated with

22 its approval of Minor Modification No. 21-054, noting that the Project was exempt from CEQA

23 pursuant to CEQA Guidelines Section 15302 (Class 2 - Existing Facilities) and CEQA

24 Guidelines Section 15303 (Class 3 - New Construction and Conversions of Small Structures).

25 (attached as Exhibit 7.)

26 53. On January 3, 2022, Petitioners appealed, in writing, the County's issuance of

27 Minor Modification No. 21-054 to the County of Tulare, pursuant to County Code. A true and

28 correct copy of this letter is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.

1 54. On January 14, 2022, Petitioners submitted a letter to the County requesting that

2 the County deny the pending building permit applications due to the pending appeal and
3 investigate whether the facility was operating in compliance with Special Use Permit No. 96-

4 074. A true and correct copy of this letter is attached hereto as Exhibit 8.

5 55. Real Party has filed two new building permit applications with the County which

6 are under review as of January 25, 2022. Application No. A2200068 would permit an upgraded

7 huller, and Application No. A2200069 would add 16 storage silos. (attached as Exhibit 9.)

8 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

9 (Violation of CEQA Public Resources Code §§ 21000, et. seq.

10 Illegal Piecemealing)

11 56. Petitioners incorporate by reference each of the allegations contained in the
12 preceding paragraphs in their entirety.

13 57. Under CEQA, the "lead agency" is the public agency that has the principal
14 responsibility for carrying out the project and determining, in consultation with other relevant
15 state agencies, whether an environmental impact report, a negative declaration, or a mitigated
16 negative declaration will be prepared for a project. (Pub. Resources Code §§ 21067; 21080.1,

17 subd. (a); 21083, subd. (a).)

18 58. At all times relevant to this action, Respondent County was the lead agency

19 responsible for reviewing the Project pursuant to CEQA.

20 59. Work authorized under Minor Modification No. 21-054 is in furtherance of the

21 Project. The County is aware that both the previous owner of the facility and now Touchstone

22 Pistachio have been seeking to expand the facility and that such expansion efforts are subject to

23 CEQA. The County's approval of Minor Modification No. 21-054 was a discretionary act under

24 CEQA and the County Code.

25 60. The Project is a "project" under CEQA. The Guidelines define a project as "the

26 whole of an action, which has a potential for resulting in a either a direct physical change to the
27 environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment"
28 (Guidelines, § 15378 subd. (a)) and require that "all phases of project planning, implementation,
15
LATHAM+WATKINS4P
ATTORNEYS AT LAM VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

LOs ANGELES AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 and operation" must be considered in the Initial a Study for a project (Guidelines, § 15063 subd.

2 (a)(1)) prior to issuing discretionary approval.

3 61. Accordingly, "There is no dispute that CEQA forbids 'piecemeal' review of the

4 significant environmental impacts of a project. This rule derives, in part, from section 21002.1,

5 subdivision (d), which requires the lead agency ... to "consider[] the effects, both individual and

6 collective, of all activities involved in [the] project.™"* (Berkeley Keep Jets over the Bay Com. v.

7 Board of Port Commissioners of the City of Oakland (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1344, 1358.)

8 62. In addition, the potential applicability of a CEQA exemption does not relieve a

9 public agency from the requirement under CEQA to evaluate the "whole of : project" for
10 potentially significant environmental effects. If any component of a project is not exempt, then it

11 must undergo further environmental review under CEQA. (See, e.g., California Farm Bureau

12 Federation v. California Wildlife Conservation Bd. (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 173, 192-96.)

13 63. The County violated CEQA by failing to complete the required CEQA

14 compliance prior to issuing Minor Modification No. 21-054, which is a discretionary approval

15 under the County Code. The County has continued to ignore CEQA by issuing piecemealed
16 approvals that together authorize an exponential expansion of an industrial-scale pistachio

17 processing facility. CEQA analysis, including any EIR, "should be prepared as early in the
18 planning process as possible to enable environmental considerations to influence project,
19 program, or design." (Bozung v. LAFCo. (1975) 13 Cal.3d 263, 282.) CEQA review and the
20 application of CEQA procedures must be followed at all stages of project consideration, to carry

21 out the legislative intent "to compel government at all levels to make decisions with
22 environmental consequences in mind." (Id. at 283.)

23 64. Where an approval is "an essential step leading to ultimate environmental impact

24 [] it is therefore ... a 'project' within the scope of CEQA. (Fullerton Joint Union High School

25 Dist. v. State Bd. of Education (1982) 32 Cal.3d 779, 797.)

26 65. "[T]he later the environmental review process begins, the more bureaucratic and

27 financial momentum there is behind a proposed project." (Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. V.

28 Regents of the University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 395.)
16
LATHAM&WATKINSLP
ATTORNEYS AT LAM VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

LOs ANGELES AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 66. CEQA Guidelines section 15004 subd. (b)(2)(B) provides that public agencies

2 should not "take any action which gives impetus to a planned or foreseeable project in a manner

3 that forecloses alternatives or mitigation measures that would ordinarily be part of CEQA review

4 of that public project."

5 67. While "[m]inisterial projects are exempt from the requirements of CEQA"

6 (CEQA Guidelines section 15268, subd. (a)), "[w]here a project involves an approval that

7 contains elements of both a ministerial action and a discretionary action, the a project will be

8 deemed to be discretionary and will be subject to the requirements of CEQA." (Guidelines JO

9 15268, subd. (d).)

10 68. A discretionary project is "a project which requires the exercise of judgment or

11 deliberation when the public agency or body decides to approve or disapprove a particular

12 activity." (Guidelines, § 15357.) "Approval" is defined as "the decision by a public agency

13 which commits the agency to a definite course of action in regard to a project intended to be

14 carried out by any person." (Id., § 15352, subd. (a).) CEQA requires that "[b]efore any approval

15 of a project subject to CEQA" that the lead agency shall consider final CEQA determination.

16 69. Minor Modification No. 21-054 purported to authorize the construction of 16

17 storage silos, one truck scale, and a refurbished huller line on the Project Site that are part of the

18 Project.

19 70. The issuance of Minor Modification No. 21-054 is a necessary component of the
20 County's discretionary review of the Project.

21 71. The County violated CEQA and failed to proceed in the manner required by law,

22 committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion, and acted arbitrarily and capriciously in its issuance

23 of Minor Modification No. 21-054 because, without limitation, the County failed to subject

24 Minor Modification No. 21-054 and the Project to additional environmental assessment as

25 CEQA requires.

26 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

27 (Violation of CEQA - Public Resources Code §§ 21000, et. seq.

28 The Project is Not Exempt)
17
LATHAM&WATKINSUP
ATTORNEYS AT LAW VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

LOs ANGELES AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 72. Petitioners incorporate by reference each of the allegations contained in the
2 preceding paragraphs in their entirety.

3 73. If applying an exemption, "The agency bears the burden of showing that

4 substantial evidence supports its finding that a particular CEQA exemption applies." (Bus Riders

5 Union v. Los Angeles County Metro. Transp. Agency (2009) 179 Cal.App.4th 101, 107.)

6 74. Similarly, where an environmental impact report or negative declaration has

7 already been prepared and certified, CEQA requires the agency to make specific findings and, if

8 necessary, conduct additional environmental review or study, regarding the continuing validity

9 of the existing CEQA documentation prior to approving changes or modifications to the Project.
10 (Guidelines, §§ 15162, 15164.)

11 75. The County issued a Notice of Exemption stating that the Project was

12 categorically exempt under CEQA Guidelines Class 2 Section 15302(b) for Existing Facilities

13 3 and Class 3 Section 15303 for New Construction and Conversions of Small Structures.

14 76. The Class 3 exemption exempts "construction and location of limited numbers of

15 new, small facilities or structures; installation of small new equipment ... and conversion of
16 existing small structures." (Guidelines, § 15303.)

17 77. The CEQA Guidelines discuss the application of this exemption to small

18 residential developments, limited commercial development within urbanized areas, and

19 accessory structures. (Id.)

20 78. Minor Modification No. 21-054 permits an 80% expansion of the existing

21 facility's storage capacity, in turn increasing the production capacity. The facility, which

22 previously had a capacity of 50 million pounds of pistachios, will balloon to a capacity of 90

23 million pounds of pistachios with the addition of the 16 silos authorized by Minor Modification

24 No. 21-054.

25 79. The expansion authorized by Minor Modification No. 21-054 is well beyond the
26 scope of the "small structures" intended to be exempted under a Class 3 categorical exemption.

27 The Project was not exempt from CEQA and additional analysis is required.

28 80. Further, the Project is not exempt from CEQA because of the various exceptions
18
LATHAM&WATKINS.
ATTORNEYS AT LAW VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

LOs ANGELES AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 to categorical exemptions. The Project, when evaluated in conjunction with other nearby

2 development has the potential to result in cumulative impacts, meaning the use of an exemption

3 is inappropriate. (Guidelines, § 15300.2(b).) Additionally, a categorical exemption for the

4 Project is inappropriate because there is a reasonable possibility that the Project will result in

5 significant environmental effects, because of unusual circumstances - namely, the serial

6 expansion of the facility that was initially permitted as a modest processor of on-site and local

7 pistachios. Because the Project falls within numerous exceptions to categorical exemptions, it is

8 not exempt from CEQA and the Count is required to analyze the Project's environmental

9 impacts.

10 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

11 (Violation of Tulare County Code and Zoning Ordinance - Ultra Vires Action)

12 81. Petitioners incorporate by reference each of the allegations contained in the
13 preceding paragraphs in their entirety.

14 82. The Zoning Code only allows the Planning Director to approve Minor
15 Modifications of Special Use Permits "provided that any minor modification shall not
16 substantially change or alter the use approved or conditions imposed." (Zoning Ordinance, §

17 16.)

18 83. Similarly, the Zoning Ordinance requires that the Resource Management Director

19 "first request[] the body which took final action on the use permit . . . to determine if such

20 change constitutes a minor modification" prior to authorizing a Minor Modification to a Special

21 Use Permit issued by another decision-maker. (Zoning Ordinance, § 18.)

22 84. The addition of 16 new silos will increase the on-site storage capacity from
23 approximately 50 million pounds of pistachios to an estimated 90 million pounds of pistachios -

24 a 80% increase in capacity.

25 85. The addition of a new truck scale will increase the speed at which trucks can

26 unload raw product and load processed pistachios, further increasing production capacity.

27 Further, while not specified in the application, the replacement of the huller line may also result

28 in an unknown increase in processing capacity.
19

ATTORNEYS AT LAM VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

LOs ANGELES AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 86. Together, the improvements authorized by Minor Modification No. 21-054
2 represent a substantial expansion of the existing use.

3 87. Because Minor Modification No. 21-054 authorizes such a substantial increase in

4 processing capacity, the Zoning Ordinance required that the Resource Management Director

5 request that the Zoning Administrator, or a higher decision-maker like the Planning Commission,
6 determine whether the proposed changes constitute a Minor Modification, or if another use

7 is approval is required. This consultation did not occur.

8 88. The Resource Management Director approved Minor Modification No. 21-054

9 without this required consultation. Accordingly, approval of Minor Modification No. 21-054
10 violated the County Code.

11 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

12 (Violation of Tulare County Code and Zoning Ordinance -

13 Illegal Reliance on Special Use Permit)

14 89. Special Use Permit No. 96-074 states that "the Zoning Administrator is authorized

15 to approve or deny requests for special use permits for expansion of ag processing facilities
16 where more than one-half of the product is produced on site and less than 10 persons are

17 employed." On information and belief, the scope of Minor Modification No. 21-054 will result

18 in facility of such size that the on-site farming activities will not generate sufficient product to

19 meet the one-half requirement and that will require more than 10 employees to operate.

20 90. Similarly, Special Use Permit No. 96-074 states that the "Director is authorized to

21 approve minor modifications in the approved plans upon a request by the applicant ... as long as

22 said modifications do not materially affect the determination of the Zoning Administrator." (See

23 also County Zoning Code, Section 18.) However, Minor Modification No. 21-054 authorizes the

24 exponential expansion of the processing use authorized by Special Use Permit No. 96-074 and

25 materially affects the originally approved use.

26 91. ARO previously announced that the facility can now process 50 million pounds of

27 pistachios per year, and, with the added silo capacity, that number will increase to 90 million

28 pounds of pistachios. (Exhibit - June 30, 2020, letter.)
20
LATHAM&WATKINSLP
ATTORNEYS AT LAM VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

LOs ANGELES AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 92. Further, prior to the approval of the Minor Modification's additional capacity, the

2 applicant admitted that more than 100 employees will be employed on-site. (Exhibit - June 30,

3 2020, letter.)

4 93. Accordingly, in authorizing the expansion through a Minor Modification, the
5 Resource Management Director exceeded the authority Special Use Permit No. 96-074 and the
6 County Code delegate to him. The County has a ministerial duty to ensure that the County Code

7 is fully implemented. The County has failed to do so.

8 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

9 (Violation of Tulare County Code and Zoning Ordinance -

10 Special Use Permit No. 96-074 Is Void and Cannot Support Minor Modification No. 21-

11 054)

12 94. Petitioners incorporate by reference each of the allegations contained in the
13 preceding paragraphs in their entirety.

14 95. County Code section 7-15-1040 requires the Resource Management Director or
15 authorized representative to determine, among other things, that "the proposed construction and

16 property comply with all of the provisions of Ordinance No. 352 as amended (commonly known

17 as the Zoning Ordinance of Tulare County)," prior to the issuance of a Minor Modification.

18 96. County Zoning Ordinance sections 9.7 and 16 provide that the Project, which is

19 an establishment for the "curing, processing, packaging, packing, storage and shipping of
20 agricultural products," is allowed only "subject to such conditions and safeguards as the

21 authority granting the permit shall specify" in a Special Use Permit.

22 97. Under its own terms, Special Use Permit No. 96-074 "become[s] null and void

23 two (2) years after the use for which it was granted is discontinued or abandoned."

24 98. On information and belief, operations under Special Use Permit No. 96-074 were

25 discontinued for a period of time such that this special use permit could not have supported the
26 County's issuance of Minor Modification No. 21-054.

27 99. The California Regional Water Quality Control Board for the Central Valley

28 Region's Waste Discharge Requirement Order R5-2016-0052 stated that "ARO Pistachios, Inc. a

2 Processing Facility (Facility) at 19570 Avenue 88 in Terra Bella" and that the prior WDR order
3 authorizing operations at the Facility under the jurisdiction of the Regional Board was rescinded

4 in 2003. Accordingly, as the operations were either not commenced within a two-year period of

5 approvals being issued or were discontinued for a period of at least two years, Special Use

6 Permit No. 96-074 could not have supported the County's issuance of Minor Modification No.
7 21-054.

8 100. The County had no valid underlying approvals to rely upon in issuing Minor

9 Modification No. 21-054. Because Special Use Permit 96-074 expired on its own terms, Minor

10 Modification No. 21-054 is void and must be set aside.

11 SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION

12 Violation of Tulare County Code and Zoning Ordinance -

13 Silos Illegally Cross Property Line

14 101. Petitioners incorporate by reference each of the allegations contained in the
15 preceding paragraphs in their entirety.

16 102. Tulare Zoning Code Section 9.7.G requires projects in the AE-40 Zone to
17 maintain a minimum side yard setback of ten feet.

18 103. Tulare Zoning Code Section 16.I requires that a Variance be obtained to deviate

19 from the "strict and literal interpretation and enforcement of the provisions" contained within the
20 Zoning Code. Only after an application a for a Variance is submitted, does the County's Planning

21 Commission have the authority to act on the request. (Tulare Zoning Code § 16.I.A.)

22 104. There is no evidence that the applicant applied for or obtained a Variance for

23 relief from the Zoning Code's side yard requirement.

24 105. The 16 new storage silos authorized by Minor Modification No. 21-054 do not

25 comply with the County Code's side yard setback requirement because four of the new silos
26 traverse the property line and 12 of the new silos are fully contained on the neighboring property.

27 106. A Variance was required to permit these new silos. The County did not issue a

28 Variance. Thus, the County violated its Zoning Code by approving Minor Modification No. 21-

County of Tulare
2500 W. Burrel Avenue
Visalia, California 93291
Email: clerkoftheboard@tularecounty.ca.gov

Re: Appeal of Minor Modification No. 21-054 and Related CEQA Exemption
Determination

Dear Mr. Britt:

On behalf of our client, The Wonderful Company, Wonderful Citrus II LLC, and related
entities, we hereby appeal the County's issuance of Minor Modification No. 21-054 for the addition of sixteen storage silos, a truck scale, and a refurbished huller line at Touchstone's
commercial pistachio processing facility operated at 19570 Avenue 88 near Terra Bella.

We separately appeal the County's determination that the Minor Modification was exempt from review under the California Environmental Quality Act pursuant to sections 15302
and 15303 of the CEQA Guidelines.

We request that the County rescind issuance of Minor Modification No. 21-054 and refrain from issuing additional approvals for new construction at the Touchstone facility until the County complies with the County Code and Zoning Code and completes all necessary environmental review for the proposed expansion.
This appeal is brought on the following separate and independent grounds thus far.

1. The County Issued MIM 21-054 In Error. The County violated the County
Code and Zoning Code in approving Minor Modification No. 21-054 to the facility's Special Use Permit for the following separate and independent reasons:

a. The Minor Modification improperly authorizes building silos across the
property line onto adjacent property because no variance has been obtained
authorizing the siting of silos within the minimum 10-foot side yard setback required for Projects in the AE-40 Zone.

b. The Minor Modification was issued in violation of the Tulare County
Zoning Code because the Director lacked the authority to authorize with a Minor Modification an expansion which would nearly double the facility's storage
capacity.

C. The Minor Modification permits the addition of a truck scale, which will
increase processing intensity on-site, increasing traffic, and is contrary to the
statement in the Minor Modification.

d. The Minor Modification will substantially modify the original conditions
of approval in the Special Use Permit by continuing to expand the facility in
violation of the limitation upon which the Special Use Permit was issued.

e. Special Use Permit No. 96-074 authorizing the pistachio processing use is expired and void by its own terms and cannot serve as the basis for the Minor
Modification.

2. The Minor Modification Is Not Exempt from CEQA. The County violated
CEQA in finding the project was exemption from environmental review for the following separate and independent reasons:

a. The Minor Modification is not exempt from CEQA because the new huller system will increase capacity and support nearly a doubling of the number of silos, and this is an improper expansion of capacity in violation of CEQA Guidelines Section 15302(b).

b. The Minor Modification is not exempt from CEQA because it authorizes a
substantial expansion of use by adding sixteen new silos which will permit the facility to process an additional 40 million pounds of pistachios in addition to its
current processing capacity of 50 million pounds.

C. The County failed to adequately analyze the potential environmental impacts associated with the Minor Modification.

d. There is a reasonable probability that approval of the Minor Modification
to allow an 80 percent increase in the silo storage capacity result in significant
environmental impacts under Section 15300.2(c).

e. Pursuant to Section 15300.2(b), the identified potential environmental
impacts could result in cumulative impacts, which would except the Minor
Modification from either of the stated categorical exemptions.

***:

We request that the County rescind issuance of Minor Modification No. 21-054 and refrain from issuing additional approvals for new construction at the Touchstone facility until the
County fulfills its obligations under the County Code and all applicable requirements of CEQA.

This appeal is based on the publicly-available information online and the text of Minor
Modification No. 21-054. Therefore, we reserve all rights to supplement this appeal once we
have been able to review the County's full administrative record.
Please advise of any fee associated with this appeal so that we may promptly pay it, and
do not hesitate to contact me with any questions at (213) 891-7540.

Very truly yours,

ATTACHMENT A

The County issued Minor Modification 21-054 in error. The County also erred in
determining that the proposed modifications were exempt from CEQA pursuant to CEQA
Guidelines Sections 15302(b) and 15303.

A. History of ARO Pistachio's Operations
In 1996, the County issued Special Use Permit 96-074 after the facility had illegally
begun construction of additional facilities in violation of the County Code.
The 1996 Special Use Permit was premised on strict limits on where the processed
product originated and the number of facility employees. Specifically, the Special Use Permit assumed that more than one-half of the product would be produced onsite and that less than 10
persons would be employed.

The Special Use Permit also states that it expires two years after the authorized use is
discontinued.

More than twenty years after the County issued the Special Use Permit, ARO Pistachios applied for and the County granted a series of "Minor Modifications" (Nos. 15-006, 17-034, and
18-009) to allow ARO Pistachios to expand its facility substantially. It is not clear whether the facility was continually operating from 1996 through 2015.
Prior to the Minor Modifications, we understand that the facility consisted of a cluster of
buildings, four small silos, and limited exterior equipment and storage. In contrast to the modest original facility, from 2015 to 2018 the Minor Modifications collectively authorized the development of 20 new 48-foot silos, two receiving pits, 12 dryers, and an anaerobic pond. This represented a major expansion of the existing processing facility.
On or about December 21, 2021, the County issued Minor Modification 21-054
authorizing the addition of a new truck scale, 16 new silos, and an upgraded huller line system.
The Minor Modification was issued by the Director, without any public notice or public hearing.
This appeal timely followed.

B. The Approval and Issuance of Minor Modification 21-054 Violated County
Code

Issuance of Minor Modification 21-054 was improper. Minor Modification 21-054 does
not comply with the County Code.

The County's online permit portal incorrectly listed the facility's address at 19570 Avenue 80,
instead of the correct address of 19570 Avenue 88.

1. Minor Modification 21-054 Illegally Authorizes Development On an Adjacent Property & In a Required Yard Setback
Minor Modification 21-054 illegally authorizes development of silos across the eastern
property line and on the neighboring parcel. It is our understanding that the adjacent property,
identified by Assessor Parcel Number 319-130-023, is not commonly owned or tied to the site.

Projects in the AE-40 Zone must maintain a minimum side yard setback of ten feet.
(Tulare Zoning Code § 9.7.G.) The Zoning Code requires that a Variance be obtained to deviate
from the "strict and literal interpretation and enforcement of the provisions" contained within the Zoning Code. (Tulare Zoning Code § 16.I.) Only after an application for a Variance is
submitted, does the County's Planning Commission have the authority to act on the request.
(Tulare Zoning Code § 16.I.A.)

There is no evidence that the applicant applied for or obtained a Variance for relief from
the Zoning Code's side yard requirement. The 16 new silos authorized by Minor Modification
21-054 do not comply with the County Code's side yard setback requirement. (see Exhibit
MIM 21-054, Exhibit A, showing four of the new silos traversing the property line and 12 of the
new silos fully contained on the neighboring property.) A Variance was required to permit these
new silos. The County did not issue a Variance. Thus, the County violated its Zoning Code by
approving Minor Modification 21-054 and authorizing development of structures within the
site's required side yard. Minor Modification 21-054 must be set aside.

2. Approval of Minor Modification 21-054 Exceeds the Director's
Authority Under the Tulare County Zoning Code
The Zoning Code only allows the Planning Director to approve Minor Modifications of Special Use Permits "provided that any minor modification shall not substantially change or alter
the use approved or conditions imposed." (Zoning Ordinance, § 16.) Minor Modification 21- § 054 will exponentially increase the facility's annual processing capacity, resulting in an increase of the number of truck trips and associated employees.
The addition of 16 new silos will increase the on-site storage capacity from
approximately 50 million pounds of pistachios to an estimated 90 million pounds of pistachios -
a 80% increase in capacity.
The addition of a new truck scale will increase the speed at which trucks can unload raw product and load processed pistachios, further increasing production capacity. Further, while not specified in the application, the replacement of the huller line may also result in an unknown
increase in processing capacity. Together, the improvements authorized by Minor Modification
21-054 represent a substantial expansion of the existing use.
Because Minor Modification 21-054 authorizes such a substantial increase in processing
capacity, the Zoning Ordinance required that the Resource Management Director "first request[] the body which took final action on the use permit…to determine if such change constitutes a
minor modification." (Zoning Ordinance, § 18.) In other words, the Resource Management Director was required to present the Minor Modification first to the Zoning Administrator or a

higher body, such as the Planning Commission. That did not occur. Accordingly, approval of Minor Modification 21-054 violated the County Code.

3. Minor Modification 21-054 Will Increase Traffic

Contrary to Minor Modification 21-054's Finding No. 2, the additional processing capacity authorized will increase processing intensity on-site, and result in increased traffic.
The addition of a truck scale, which will double the current number of scales on-site, will
accommodate more trucks moving on and off the property to deliver raw product and haul
processed product. This will increase traffic.

The addition of 16 new silos will increase the on-site storage capacity by 44%, which will
in turn allow for additional raw and process product to be moved to and from the site during the
harvest and processing season. This will increase traffic.
The replacement of huller line with a modern system will likely increase processing efficiency and resulting capacity. That, coupled with the additional truck scale and 16 new silos will increase processing capacity and require additional staff to service the processing facility
during harvest. This will increase traffic.

4. Minor Modification 21-054 Substantially Affects the Original
Conditions of Approval
Contrary to Minor Modification 21-054's Finding No. 3, the Minor Modification will substantially affect or revise original conditions of approval. Special Use Permit 96-074 was predicated on a finding that "the Zoning Administrator is authorized to approve or deny requests for special use permits for expansion of ag processing facilities where more than one-half of the product is produced on site and less than 10 persons are employed." Special Use Permit 96-074 explains that the Zoning Administrator was only empowered to approve it because "more than
one-half of the product is produced on site and less than 10 persons are employed."

Under the Building Permits, ARO will operate the facility in violation of these limits.
ARO previously announced that the facility can now process 50 million pounds of pistachios per year, and with the added silo capacity that number will increase to 90 million pounds of
pistachios. (Exhibit 2 - June 30, 2020 ARO Letter.) In contrast, when Special Use Permit 96- 074 was approved in 1996, the facility's processing capacity was approximately 225,000 pounds per year.2 Further, the applicant has admitted that more than 100 employees will be employed
on-site, prior to the approval of the Minor Modification's additional capacity. (Exhibit 2 - June 30, 2020 ARO Letter.) Minor Modification 21-054 results in ARO exceeding Special Use
Permit 96-074's limit on employees to "less than 10 persons." Thus, because Minor Modification 21-054 allows ARO to operate in violation of the Special Use Permit, it was issued

2 Special Use Permit 96-074 limited processing capacity to twice the on-site capacity. Assuming an average production capacity of approximately 2,805 pounds of pistachios per acre of trees,
112,200 pounds could come from the adjacent 40-acre parcel and another equal amount that
could legally come from off-site.

in error, and must be set aside. (See, e.g., County Code, § 7-15-1040, subds. (b), (d); Zoning
Ordinance, §§ 9.7, 16.)

1. The Special Use Permit Is Void; Minor Modification 21-054 Was
Issued in Error

Special Use Permit 96-074 provides that the permit expires and is null and void two years after the authorized use is discontinued. If the facility stopped operating for a two-year period at
any time since 1996, then the Special Use Permit expired and is void under its own terms. Without a special use permit, the facility cannot operate. (E.g., Zoning Ordinance, §§ 9.7, 16; County Code, § 7-15-1040, subds. (b), (d).)

Federal and state records show that the facility stopped operations for at least six years
since 1996, specifically from at least 2004 to 2010.
2004: "Mehdi Orandi closed the processing plant";

- 2010: "Mr. [Adam] Orandi said he began processing pistachios in 2010."

(Exhibit 3 - FDA records [emphasis added; omissions in original].)
FDA records note that the "[Plant Manager] stated that in 2011, the firm started hulling and shelling pistachios," indicating that processing activities were restarted after a lapse in operation. (Exhibit 3 - FDA records; see also Exhibit 4 - WDR Order R5-2016-0052.) Air District records also show no reported emissions during this same time period. (Air Resources Board Records [Air Resources Board database shows no reported emission from 2001 to 2013].)
Thus, Special Use Permit 96-074 expired two years after "Mehdi Orandi closed the
processing plant" in 2004.

Special Use Permit 96-074 is void because operations were discontinued for more than
two years. Therefore, the County could not issue Minor Modifications to the Special Use Permit
or the Building Permits.

The Building Permits could not issue, and cannot issue, absent a valid Special Use
Permit.

C. The Issuance of Minor Modification 21-054 Violated CEQA

1. CEQA Requires the County to Analyze the Expansion's
Environmental Impacts
The County has not conducted any environmental review of the potential impacts associated with the significant increase in operations from the facility's overall proposed expansion. There is clear potential for the expansion to result in impacts to agricultural
resources, air quality, noise, traffic, hazards, utilities, and potentially other impact areas.
(Exhibit 5 - Ramboll Report.)

In fact, the facility's operation already results in environmental impacts. In fall of 2019
numerous complaints were filed with the Air District regarding odors, flies, and fires associated
with operations at the ARO facility. (Exhibit 6 Air District Complaints.) Inspectors confirmed that the dumping of waste materials and processing debris was causing a foul odor and drawing flies to the area. Without a detailed analysis of potential impacts, including those that are already occurring because of the improper expansion of the ARO facility, it is impossible for the County to determine what mitigation is required.

2. Minor Modification 21-054 Is Not Exempt As A Replacement of
Existing Facilities

The Minor Modification purports to authorize the replacement of the existing huller system that has been in operation since 1980. The new huller system will increase capacity and support nearly a doubling of the number of silos. The Minor Modification is not exempt from CEQA under CEQA Guidelines Section 15302(b), because the Minor Modification authorizes an
expansion of capacity, not just a replacement of existing equipment.

3. Minor Modification 21-054 Is Not Exempt As Construction of A Small
Structure

The additional truck scale and 16 silos are not small structures, but large, industrial scale pistachio processing equipment that will significantly increase the processing capacity of the facility. The 48-foot silos have the capacity to hold up to 2.5 million pounds of pistachios per silo, for a total capacity of approximately 40 million pounds of pistachios. As compared to the facility's currently approved capacity of approximately 50 million pounds, the Minor
Modification's authorization of the 16 new silos represents a 44% increase in capacity to 90
million pounds of pistachios. This is a substantial expansion of the existing use. The silos are
not comparable to a single family residence or structure not exceeding 2,500 square feet in floor area, as contemplated by CEQA Guidelines Section 15303.

4. Minor Modification 21-054 Is Excepted From A Categorical
Exemption

Pursuant to CEQA Guidelines Section 15300.2(c), there is a reasonable possibility that
the approval of the Minor Modification to allow an 80% increase in the silo storage capacity will
result in significant environmental impacts. As detailed in the attached report from Ramboll, the recent expansion of the processing facility, and further expansion authorized by the Minor Modifications, could result in significant impacts associated with air quality, hazards, noise, traffic, and water quality. Further, pursuant to CEQA Guidelines Section 15300.2(b), the identified potential environmental impacts could result in cumulative impacts, which would
except the Minor Modifications from either of the stated categorical exemptions.

5. The County & Applicant Improperly Piecemealed the Project
The serial authorization of additional construction at the facility is improper
piecemealing. The Minor Modification, when reviewed together with the previously approved
Minor Modifications, represent an exponential increase in the facility's capacity (increasing silo

capacity alone by at least 1,000 percent, if not far more) as compared to what was originally authorized by the Special Use Permit. The failure to consider the full environmental impacts of this large-scale expansion as a whole constitutes improper piecemealing in violation of CEQA.

CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines, and long-standing precedent make clear that CEQA
review must precede public agency action to move forward with a planned project. a The CEQA Guidelines define a project as "the whole of an action, which has a potential for resulting in either a direct physical change to the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment" (Guidelines §15378 subd. (a)), and require that "all phases of project planning, implementation, and operation" must be considered in the Initial Study for a project (Guidelines, §15063 subd. (a)(1), emphasis added). CEQA review and the application of CEQA procedures must be followed at all stages of project consideration, to carry out the legislative intent "to compel government at all levels to make decisions with environmental consequences in mind." (Bozung v. LAFCo. (1975) 13 Cal.3d 263, 283.)
The timing of the requests for the Minor Modifications, including Minor Modification 21-054, indicate that a larger expansion was planned and then individual modifications were requested for portions of the overall expansion - a classic case of piecemealing. The County cannot avoid its obligation to evaluate the environmental impacts of this major expansion by
parsing the review and approvals in this manner.
Under CEQA, neither a lead agency nor a project applicant can piecemeal a single, integrated development into smaller parts to avoid conducting a comprehensive CEQA
assessment of the entire project. Where, as in the case here, a project applicant makes clear that it has a comprehensive development plan, the lead agency is required to analyze the whole of that project before authorizing construction.

BEFORE THE ZONING ADMINISTRATOR

COUNTY OF TULARE, STATE OF CALIFORNIA

IN THE MATTER OF SPECIAL USE PERMIT
DECISION NO. 2028
APPLICATION NO. PSP 96-074 (ZA)
Decision of the Zoning Administrator of the County of Tulare approving a Special Use Permit requested by Mehdi Orandi, 19570 Avenue 88, Terra Bella, CA 93270 to bring an existing agricultural packing facility into conformance and allow an expansion to said use on approximately 3.8 acres of a 78.48 acre site in the AE-40 (Exclusive Agricultural 40 acre minimum) Zone on property located on the north side of Avenue 88, 1/2 mile east of Road 192, west of Terra Bella.
The Zoning Administrator hereby determines the following findings were relevant in evaluating this application:

l. An application for a Special Use Permit has been filed pursuant to the regulations contained in Section 16 of Ordinance No. 352, the Zoning Ordinance.

2. Under Board of Supervisors' Resolution No. 83-459, as amended, and Section 16 of the Tulare County Zoning Ordinance, the Zoning Administrator is authorized to approve or deny requests for special use permits for expansion of ag processing facilities where more than one-half of the product is produced on site and less than 10 persons are employed.

3. Staff has given notice of the Zoning Administrator's intention to consider the granting of a Special Use Permit as provided in Section 16 of said Ordinance No. 352 and as provided in Section 65905 of the Government Code of the State of California.

4. Staff has performed necessary investigations, prepared a written
report and recommended certain conditions of approval if this application is approved by the Zoning Administrator.

5. A public hearing was conducted on December 12, 1996, in Room 109 of the Planning and Development Department Offices in order to receive public testimony on the proposed application. No one appeared to speak regarding this project at the public hearing.

6. The applicant has requested a Special Use Permit to bring an existing agricultural packing facility into conformance and allow expansion of the facility on approximately 3.8 acres of a 78.48 acre site in the AE-40 (Exclusive Agricultural-40 acre minimum) Zone. The site is located on the north side of Avenue 88, 1/2 mile east of Road 192, west of Terra Bella. APN 319-130-19 Sec. 2, T 26 E, MDB&M 23 S, R

7. The site is zoned AE-40 and contains an existing packing facility and pistachio grove. The properties to the north and south are zoned AE-40 and contain orchards and fallow land. The l1and to the

Decision No. 2028
Zoning Administrator
Page 2

east is zoned AE-20 (Exclusive Agricultural-20 acre minimum) and is planted in a vineyard and the Friant-Kern Canal is also to the east. West of the subject site is an orchard and packing facility on property zoned AE-40.

8. The site is not within any Urban Area Boundary and is therefore,
subject to the Rural Valley Lands Plan policies which state that some agricultural industries are allowed to support the agricultural
products.

9. The proposal is consistent with the Tulare County General Plan.

10. The site is within Agricultural Preserve No. 2527 , a contracted pre- serve. Because the use is existing, serves the adjacent agricultur- al crop and does not remove any additional land from agricultural production, the findings can be made that the use is consistent with all principles of compatibility as set forth in Government Code Section 51238.1.

11. The packing facility has direct access to Avenue 88, a 50-foot wide, County-maintained right of way. The ultimate right of way is 60-
feet. Due to the traffic generated by the packing facility, it is found that a five-foot dedication of right of way is appropriate across the portion of the site having frontage for the packing facility.

12. The applicant has constructed a 5,075 sq. ft. addition between the two existing buildings for storage and shipping of pistachios grown on-site. This expansion was commenced without use permit approval, however, the applicant obtained a building permit (A9602611) on September 30, 1996 with the notice that they could proceed at their own risk. This special use permit was filed on September 17, 1996. Approval of this use permit will bring the use into compliance with zoning requirements.

13. The packing facility was originally constructed in 1983 to serve their pistachio grove which was planted in 1976. In 1983, no special use permit was required. On August 5, 1986, the AE-40 Zone was amended by Ordinance No. 2720 to add establishments for the curing, processing, packaging, packing, storage and shipping of agricultural products to the list of uses requiring a special use permit. Upon adoption of said ordinance amendment, existing facilities became non-conforming uses, however, expansions of non- conforming uses require approval of a special use permit.

14. A Negative Declaration was prepared for the project and approved for public review by the Environmental Assessment Officer indicating that the project will not have significant effect on the environ-
ment.

SPECIAL USE PERMIT MINOR MODIFICATION

NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN that pursuant to Section 18 of the Tulare County
Zoning Ordinance (Ordinance No. 352, as amended), the County Administrative Officer and the
Economic Development & Planning Director of the County of Tulare have reviewed the request
of the applicant (Touchstone Pistachio CO., LLC, 1396 West Herndon Avenue #110, Fresno,
CA, 93711. Agent: Jeffrey Roberts) for a minor modification to Special Use Permit No. 96-074,
which brought an existing agricultural packing facility into conformance and allowed for
expansion of use at 19570 Avenue 88, Terra Bella in the AE-40 (Exclusive Agricultural - 40-
Acre Minimum) Zone. The requested minor modification to Minor Modification No., MIM 18-
009 which was recorded on April 11, 2018, as document number 2018-0018681; Minor
Modification No., MIM 17-034 which was recorded on February 2, 2018, as document number
2018-0005130; Minor Modification No., MIM 15-006 which was recorded on April 8, 2015, as
document number 2015-0017895; and Special Use Permit No. PSP 96-074, decision number
2028 which was approved by the Tulare County Zoning Administrator and recorded on June 14,
2001 as document number 2001-0044615, is to allow for sixteen (16) additional storage silos,
one truck scale, and refurbish the "huller line". This will allow for greater efficiency, and is
described and depicted, respectively, in attached Exhibits "A" and "B" which are made a part
hereof.

Based on a review of all of the relevant facts and circumstances relating to this request, it

is hereby found and determined as follows:

(1) Pursuant to Section 18 of the Tulare County Zoning Ordinance, the requested
modification is minor in nature, will not result in a substantial change or alteration
to the use approved or any conditions imposed in connection with Special Use
Permit No. PSP 96-074, and is in conformance based on the following grounds:
The request will not change will not alter the original intent of the project site
(Pistachio Processing Facility) and all addition will occur on the already approved
site.

(2) Modifying the originally approved site development plan does not add any
additional uses to the site and may result in increased in traffic.

(3) The requested modification does not compromise the integrity of conditionally
approved Minor Modification No. MIM 18-009, Minor Modification No. MIM
17-034, Minor Modification No. MIM 15-006 or, Special Use Permit No. PSP 96-
074, as the proposed modification does not substantially affect or revise any of the
original conditions of approval.

(4) The minor modification, and all activities conducted, continues to comply with
Tulare County Development Standards as they pertain to the subject site. The
applicant is not in violation of conditions of approval of Minor Modification No.
MIM 18-009, Minor Modification No. MIM 17-034, Minor Modification No.
MIM 15-006 or, Special Use Permit No. PSP 96-074, nor any applicable federal,
state or local law.

(5) CEQA Review: The proposed activities are excluded or exempt from the
California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") on the following separate and
independent grounds:

(a) To the extent that any local permits (e.g., building or encroachment permits)
are required to be obtained by Waterman Valve or their designees, it is
concluded that these permits are exempt from CEQA on the grounds that
these permits encompass activities involving ministerial authority (Public
Resources Code Sections 21080(b)(1); and 14 Cal. Code Regs. Section
15302 pertaining to Replacement or Reconstruction and Section 15303
pertaining to New Construction.

(b) All of the activities contemplated herein would be exempt from CEQA
pursuant to Replacement or Reconstruction (14 Cal. Code Regs. Section
15302) and New Construction (14 Cal. Code Regs. Section 15303). A
Notice of Exemption (NOE) shall be filed with the Tulare County Clerk
evidencing the CEQA exemptions expressed herein and Touchstone
Pistachio Co., LLC shall pay the filing fees for such NOE.

(6) This minor modification shall be a part of Special Use Permit No. PSP 96-074
and any violation of this modification by the applicant (including any person
acting in concert therewith) shall be subject to all remedies allowed by law,
including, but not limited to, the remedies set forth in Sections 16 and 18 of the
Tulare County Zoning Ordinance.

(7) Indemnity: The applicant, Touchstone Pistachio Co., LLC, agrees to hold
harmless, defend and indemnify Tulare County, its agents, officers and employees
from and against any liability, claims, actions, costs, damages or losses of any
kind arising out of the activities of the owners and operators, or its agents, officers
and employees, under this Minor Modification. This indemnification obligation
shall continue beyond the term of this minor modification as to any acts or
omissions occurring under this minor modification or any extension of this minor

modification.

Based on the foregoing findings, determinations, facts and circumstances in relation
hereto, the requested minor modification of Special Use Permit No. PSP 96-074 is hereby
approved and is described and depicted, respectively, in attached Exhibits "A" and "B." The
original use permit is attached as Exhibit "C." This minor modification shall be duly recorded
forthwith in the records of the Tulare County Clerk/Recorder.

Re: Permits Associated with Minor Modification 21-054

Dear Mr. Schenke:

On January 3, 2022, we filed an appeal of the County's issuance of Minor Modification No. 21-054 on behalf of our clients, the Wonderful Company, Wonderful Citrus II, LLC, and
related entities.

Minor Modification No. 21-054 purports to modify Special Use Permit No. 96-074 to allow for the addition of sixteen storage silos, a truck scale, and a refurbished huller line at Touchstone Pistachios, Inc.'s commercial pistachio processing facility operated at 19570 Avenue 88 near Terra Bella. We understand that the County is currently processing the appeal and will
be scheduling a hearing on the matter soon.

It has come to our attention that your Agency is currently processing building permit applications (Nos. A2200068 and A2200069) for upgrades to a huller system at the Touchstone Pistachio facility pursuant to Minor Modification No. 21-054. (Minor Modification No. 21-054, Attachment A [listing "Replacement of older equipment and components for huller line"].)
Minor Modification No. 21-054 has been appealed and is not final. Therefore, the County cannot rely on Minor Modification No. 21-054 to issue Building Permit Nos. A2200068
and A2200069 or any other building permits.

The Touchstone Pistachio facility lacks the underlying land-use approval required by the
County's Zoning Ordinance to authorize the requested permits and any building permits issued in reliance on Minor Modification No. 21-054 must be revoked.

For these reasons, we respectfully request that the County not issue any permits predicated on Minor Modification No. 21-054.

January 14, 2022 Page 2

We look forward to County's consideration of our appeal to Minor Modification No. 21-
054.

Sincerely,
