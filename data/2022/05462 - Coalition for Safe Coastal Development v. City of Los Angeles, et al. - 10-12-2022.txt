VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Petitioner, COALITION FOR SAFE COASTAL DEVELOPMENT ("Petitioner"),
2 alleges through this Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate ("Petition"), as follows:

INTRODUCTION 3

l. Petitioner challenges the Respondent City of Los Angeles' ("City" or
5 / "Respondent") adoption of a Notice of Exemption from the California Environmental Quality

6 Act ("CEQA"), and the related discretionary approvals in June 2022 (together, the "Project
7 Approvals') for the Reese Davidson Community Project (the "Project"). This lawsuit is filed
8  prophylactically due to an inability to obtain a stipulation and court order allowing the
9 allegations contained in this Petition to be added via a Third Amended Petition for Writ of
10 Mandate in the current case styled Coalition for Safe Coastal Development v. City of Los
11
8 Angeles, Case No. 22STCP00162.
Channel Law d71 'dnoJg 4LZ06 AA0S VPNE SI!H Aueneg 12 2. As detailed herein, the Project fails to qualify for the CEQA exemption claimed in

13 connection with additional Project approvals issued by the City in June 2022. These failures

BuIJUS|!M €888 14 resulted in substantial prejudice by precluding informed public participation and fatally
15 impairing the decision-making of the City's approving bodies, including the City Planning
16 Commission, and the City Council itself.
17 3. The proposed Project Site is located between two one-way streets: North Venice
18 Boulevard on the north, and South Venice Boulevard on the south, and is bounded by Dell
19 Avenue on the east, and South Pacific Avenue on the west. The Project Site is bisected by the

20 historic Grand Canal, a part of the larger Venice Canal system. Public parking is currently
21 located on the western and eastern portions of the Project Site. The eastern portion of the Project
22 Site also contains two-story, four-unit residential structure and a boat launch area which serves
23 as access for recreational boating and vital maintenance of the entire Venice Canal system.
24 4. Currently, the Project Site is one of the largest publicly owned City of Los
25 Angeles parking lots for users of the very popular Venice Beach. City records show that the
26 parking revenue from this lot (Lot 731) represents approximately 5% of all parking revenue from
27

2 28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 all City parking lots. The portion of Lot 731 west of Grand Canal contains approximately 40
2 percent of the public parking on the Project Site immediately adjacent to Venice Beach. The
3 larger portion of Lot 731 to the east of Grand Canal contains approximately 60 percent of the
4 public parking for the Project Site. The combined area of Lot 73l is low-lying and zoned for
5 Open Space. As a practical matter, Lot 731 functions as a protective containment area for high
6 tidal flooding, and even for tsunami inundation flood waters and, if developed as proposed, could
7 divert flood or tsunami waters into the adjoining Venice Canals area, thus exacerbating property
8 damage and threatening the safety of area residents.
9 5. The Project requires the demolition of Lot 731 (containing 196 vehicular parking
10 spaces) and demolition of a two-story, four-unit residential apartment structure owned by the

Channel Law Group, d77 8 11 City (all units are occupied by senior/low-income residents), and the construction, use and

Beverly Hills, 14 structure east of Grand Canal (the "East Site") consisting of a total of 140 residential dwelling
15 units (136 restricted affordable dwelling units and 4 unrestricted Manager Units), 685 square feet
16 of office uses, 2,255 square feet of retail uses, 810 square feet of restaurant uses with 500 square
17 feet of outdoor Service Floor area, and 3,155 square feet of community arts center/art studio uses
18 distributed in both structures. This only describes the habitable portions of the project. In the
19 middle of the West and East Sites, the habitable portions wrap around two additional parking
20 garage structures. The one on the West Site will house parking for residents, retail users,
21 restaurant users, art studio users, and only two parking spaces for recreational users of the
22 Venice Canal. The one on the East Site will house parking to replace the demolished 196 public
23| parking lot spaces by the destruction of the existing Open Space publicly owned facility, and
24 additional Beach Impact Zone and other parking spaces. The Project is most accurately described
25 a as a residential housing/commercial mixed-use Project with approximately 111,800 square feet
26 of parking garages. Thus, the combined effect on the environment is the construction of

feet of structures crammed onto the former open space, and approximately 215,940 square
2 without any widening of critical beach access sidewalks.

6. The structure on the West Site would be three stories and 35 feet high with a 59
foot-tall architectural campanile with a roof access structure located at the northwest corner of

feet. The structure on 5 the Project Site, resulting in a five-story structure at that location in excess of 67 feet in height.

6 The campanile will include a roof top deck of approximately 685 square

7 the East Site would be three stories and well in excess of 35 feet in height, up to at least 45 feet

8 in places because of the height of automatic lift parking structures and solar panel structures
permanently affixed to the roof of the parking structures. The two residential structures would

10 wrap, in the words of one community observer, "Texas donut style," around two parking

11 structures located in the center of the West Site and East Site. Real Parties in Interest Hollywood 8 d11 'dnojg MET jeuueuO -LZ06 12 Community Housing Corporation and Venice Community Housing Corporation would develop
13 the residential housing/commercial mixed-use project on a legal subdivision of City-owned land 8 GUNS PAIE BJJYSIIM E8E8 'SIl!H ÁUeAEg 14 | underlying the parking lots on a 99-year land leasehold. The leasehold area would be the
15 "donut" rings of the Project on the West Site and East Site, and the Los Angeles Department of
16 Transportation ("LADOT*)-owned land on the East Site will be the "donut" hole of land the
17 public parking garage will be built upon.

19 secrecy, primarily by reason of the ongoing refusal by the LADOT to release public documents 18 7. The precise details of the parking structures to be developed remains shrouded in

20 related to the development, construction, ownership and operation of the East Site public parking
structure. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges that the East Site public
22 parking structure would be independently owned, constructed, financed, developed, and operated 21

for LADOT. Alternatively, Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges that an
24  undisclosed public/private partnership entity, would somehow obtain and exercise dominion over 23 by or

25 the portion of the land use entitlements granted to Real Parties Hollywood Community Housing
26 Corporation and Venice Community Housing Corporation related to the East parking structure.

4 27

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 In other words, the Project description in officially released documents grants entitlements to
2 Hollywood Community Housing Corporation and Venice Community Housing Corporation, but,
3 in reality, those entities would not develop, build, own or operate the East Site public parking
4 structure located on the "donut hole" land. Additionally, Petitioner is informed and believes, and
5 thereon alleges that the City and Real Parties have structured the project description and land use
6 entitlement recipients to attempt to rationalize characterizing the "Texas donut"
7  residential/commercial mixed-use buildings and the "Texas donut hole" East Site public parking
8 structure project as a single project completely exempt from environmental review.
9 8. Plans submitted to the City show that the combined non-public and public parking
10 structures will provide a total of 360 on-site automobile parking spaces comprising of 61
11 residential spaces, 42 commercial spaces, 196 public spaces (replacing the current parking spaces 8 d77 dnois MET jeuueuc LLZ06 12 of Lot No. 731), 23 Beach Impact Zone (BIZ) spaces and 38 non-required spaces; and 136
8 eHNS "pAjS BJJYSUM €888 13| bicycle parking spaces (19 short-term and 117 long-term).
Beverly Hills, 14 9. The combined residential project and parking structure project would require the
15 export of 9,100 cubic yards of building material and soil; the removal of 24 on-site trees and 11

16 non-protected street trees; and substantial modifications to the canal access boat ramp at the
17| Grand Canal. The City's project description fails to distinguish how much soil/debris removal,
18 and what tree removals are attributable to the East Site public parking structure developed by
19 LADOT versus the residential/commercial mixed-use and non-public parking components of the
20 Project developed by Hollywood Community Housing Corporation and Venice Community
21 Housing Corporation throughout the Project Site.
22 10. The unit mix of the residential component of the Project underscores that only a
23 portion of the Project is to include housing units occupied by formerly homeless residents
24 receiving supportive housing services. In fact, the Developer is providing the absolute bare
25 minimum of supportive housing units required by law. The Developer provided this summary:
26 "The residential component of the Project will consist of 68 units reserved for low-income
27

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

formerly homeless households (permanent supportive housing); 34 affordable units for low-
2 income artists, including live/work studios on the ground floor; 34 affordable units for lower- 1

3 income households; and 4 units for on-site property management staff." Accordingly, a majority
of the units of the Project are not committed to permanent supportive housing to help alleviate
homelessness, yet it is the homelessness components that are touted to the public, press, and
6 decision makers as rationalizing such additional unnecessary commercial land uses injected into
7 the middle of a formerly residential and open space/public facility community.

8

Controller in two official audits and by others that the City's Proposition HHH affordable 11. The City's actions and the Project Approvals come amid alarms rung by the City

10 housing program is mired in obscenely high costs per unit developed using the ground up
11 construction method chosen by the City, instead of faster and less costly alternatives like
-1706 OSAAY GROLA euns "pALa BJIIySIM €888 MET ¡BuueyO 12 adaptive redevelopment of existing hotels, motels, and former commercial or industrial

8 13 buildings. Indeed, Petitioner estimates, based in part upon the developer's own data, that each
SIlH ÁLeAeE 14 460 square foot unit of Supportive Housing in the Project will cost as much as $824,448, not
15 including possible overage costs common in such construction projects. These high costs
undermine the public's confidence in the City's affordable housing strategies, especially when
17 built to house the disabled and formerly homeless persons in sensitive, high-water table zone, 16

18 FEMA Special Flood Hazard Zone, Methane Gas Hazard Zone, and tsunami inundation zone
19 without any environmental review showing methane mitigation systems would work if

20 confronted with potentially catastrophic ground water and sea level rise.
21 12. In fact, as first reported by the Westside Current website, due to concerns about
22 the boondoggle aspects of the Project, in October 2021, Sonya Reese Greenland, great
23 granddaughter of Arthur Reese, a Black visionary involved with Abbot Kinney in the creation of
Venice Beach, demanded in a letter to Venice Community Housing Corporation that her
25 grandfather's name be removed from the Project. Ms. Reese Greenland contended in her letter 24

26 that "her grandfather would oppose the project, among other reasons, because of its cost and the
27

6 28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 large amount of space it will occupy, arguing it would create congestion and infringe on public
2 access to the beach."

3 13. Also as noted by the Westside Current, after Reese Greenland's letter was

4 published, Evan Hines, the son of Gregory Hines - a Tony Award-winning choreographer,
5 dancer and actor who lived in Venice and was intended to be the namesake of the project's

6 commercial land use community arts center -also demanded the removal of that family name.
7 The facile paternalism exhibited by Councilmember Bonin and other proponents of the Project
8 by exploiting the names and legacies of Mr. Reese and Mr. Hines without obtaining (or even
9 seeking) the permission of their families speaks volumes.

10 14. While Councilmember Mike Bonin and entitlement counsel for the developers

d11 'dnojg MeT jeuueua 4IZ06 0gL eyns "PAIS EJJUSIM €8E8 11 claim the opponents to the Project are a "small group," the list of prominent opponents has
12 grown exponentially, with more than 1,000 people submitting objection letters to the Project
13 8 during the administrative process, and thousands more signing petitions to recall City Council
SIIIH AuOADE 14 member Mike Bonin due in part to his obsessive efforts to spend nearly $100 million of taxpayer
15 monies to build this Project on one of the lowest and most flood vulnerable sites available within
16 the City. When the City Clerk recently announced the recall allegedly fell just short of enough
17 signatures to trigger a recall election, Mr. Bonin announced he would not run for reelection. If
18 that sounds odd, Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that actually there were
19 sufficient signatures for a recall and that City Hall operatives agreed to aggressively disqualify
20 more signatures to "save face" if the Council member agreed to not run for reelection.
21 Accordingly, the community will be left with the legacy of the "vision" of a failed lame duck
22 politician as he continues to force his ill-conceived ideas about where to site supportive housing
23 in Venice in the face of such vocal objections.
24 15. Petitioner seeks a Peremptory Writ of Mandate under California Code of Civil
25 Procedure §1094.5 and § 1085 from this Court commanding Respondent to vacate, set aside,
26 rescind and void the adoption of the Notice of Exemption from CEQA, and all of the Project

24 making. It ensures that decisionmakers, project proponents, and the public know of the
potential short-term, long-term, and maybe permanent environmental consequences of a 25

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 83. In correspondence erroneously dated January 12, 2020 (was actually submitted to
2 the Advisory Agency on January 12, 2021) Venice Vision specifically pointed out that the
3 request of the developer to include land uses in the project unrelated to the provision of
4 supportive housing were not qualified for exemption from CEQA. Petitioner is informed and

5 believes, and thereon alleges that other public testimony and correspondence objecting on these

6 grounds occurred throughout the administrative process but were ignored by the City.

7 84. The extent of the General Plan Amendments were not required for supportive

8 housing. The Project sought a general plan amendment of the Venice Community Plan to change
9 the land use designation on the general plan map from Open Space/Low Medium II Multiple
10 Family Residential to Neighborhood Commercial. But to further the minimal supportive housing
11 proposed for the Project, the land use designation only needed to be changed to a Residential 8 d11 'dnoJg MET jeuueyo - LZ06 È A PNE BL A S I A S O CO Beverly 12 Land Use Designation - not a commercial one. Thus, to the extent the Project proposed General
13 Plan Land Use Designations greater than that required to "further supportive housing," it
14 exceeded the narrow scope of the statutory CEQA exemption granted by the City.
were also amended in order to 15 85. Similarly, the ertified Land Use Plan and maps
16 place the commercial use spot plan amendment into the existing open space and residential uses

17 of the community.

18 86. Additionally, instead of only changing the base zoning of the property from Open

19 Space to R3 residential to accommodate a typical supportive housing project, the Developer
20 sought, and the City Council granted, base zoning change to C-2 zoning - injecting into the
21| long-established open space residential portion of the community the laundry list of disclosed
22 and undisclosed commercial land uses unnecessary to develop a supportive housing project.
23 87. The same could be said of the revisions of the Venice Coastal Zone Specific Plan,

24 a more restrictive zoning plan adopted for the sensitive coastal zone where the Project also lies.
25 Not only did the Project as proposed violate the Specific Plan (contrary to community promises
26 made by the City in the RFQ/P process), it constituted a massive spot zone on the plans and

7 parties are not part of any statutory definition of supportive housing, because supportive housing 6

8 focuses on provision of sensitive mental health, addiction and substance abuse and similar
9 services. Creating a party space for alcohol use is in fact contrary to the supportive housing
10 activities.

90. SIl!H Auenes 14 In fact, even the live/work units of the Project, allegedly targeted to "low income"
15 artists, are commercial land uses because these lofts, according to the Developer, will include
16 roll up industrial type doors to enable the conduct of coordinated "art walks" along the exterior
of the building. Additionally tied to the unauthorized art walk commercial land use is the
18 approximately 3,000 square foot art studio, which is unrelated to the is supportive services for 17

19 mental health and substance abuse rendered at another location in the building complex.

21 none of which are in furtherance of supportive housing. These commercial land uses might be

Supportive Housing Eligibility Requirements Are Not Met

project to be eligible for the exemption.

Re: Challenge to Approval of Development Project Known As "Venice Dell Community" located in Venice Community in the City of Los Angeles; Coalition for Safe Coastal Development v. City of Los Angeles

Honorable Attorney General Bonta:

PLEASE TAKE NOTICE, under Public Resources Code §21167.7 and Code of Civil
Procedure Section §388, that on October 6, 2022 Coalition for Safe Coastal Development, filed a
petition for writ of mandate against the City of Los Angeles (*Respondent" or "City"). The lawsuit has been filed in the Los Angeles County Superior Court. The petition alleges, among other things, that the City incorrectly determined that the proposed development project known as the "Venice Dell Community" ("Project") was exempt under the California Environmental
Quality Act ("CEQA"). The Project is located in the neighborhood of Venice and is located at 2102-2120 S. Pacific Avenue, 116-302 E. North Venice Boulevard, 2106-2116 S. Canal Street and 319 B. South Venice Boulevard.

Sincerely, 9-Alap
Jamie T. Hall
