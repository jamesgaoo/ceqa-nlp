VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- Petitioner California Sportfishing Protection Alliance hereby alleges as follows:

2 INTRODUCTION

3

L 1. Petitioner seeks a writ of mandate directing the Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control

5 Board to set aside their decision to approve a National Pollution Discharge Elimination

6 System (*NPDES") permit for the Tahoe Keys Property Owners Association ("TKPOA").

7 an exemption to the aquatic pesticide discharge prohibition in the Water Quality Control
Plan (*Basin Plan") for the Lahontan Region, and certification of the final environmental

8

9 impact report ("EIR") and the mitigation monitoring and reporting program (collectively,
hereafter the "Herbicide Project").

10

11 2. Petitioner seeks an order of the court compelling Respondent to vacate and set aside the

12 Herbicide Project, and any and all approvals rendered pursuant to and/or in furtherance of
the implementation of said Herbicide Project.

13 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

14

15 3. The Court has jurisdiction over this matter in accordance with Water Code section 13330.

16 Code of Civil Procedure sections 1094.5, and Public Resources Code sections 21168 and

21168.5.

17 4.

18 Venue is proper in County of El Dorado because the Herbicide Project, which is at issue
in this case, is located within the County of El Dorado.

19

20 5. This complaint is timely filed within any and all applicable statutes of limitations.

THE PARTIES

21

22 6. California Sportfishing Protection Alliance (*CSPA") is a non-profit public benefit

23 corporation dedicated to the preservation, protection, and defense of the environment.

24 wildlife, and natural resources of California waters. Members of CSPA reside in California

25 and use and enjoy California's numerous rivers. including the Lake Tahoe Basin, for

26 recreational, educational, scientific, conservation, aesthetic, and spiritual purposes.

27 7. CSPA and its members have been involved in the administrative proceedings leading up

28 to the final decision to approve the Herbicide Project and allow pesticide use in the Tahoe
Keys, including submitting comments and presentations to the Regional Board, and

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

petitioning for State Water Resources Control Board review of the Regional Board's

2 decision.

agency created under the laws and co 8. Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board is an
D regulations of the State of California to regulate water quality within the Lahontan region
n of the State of California.

6 9. The Tahoe Keys Property Owners Association is the project proponent and applicant, and

7 recipient of the approved NPDES permit.

8 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

9 10. CSPA has performed all conditions precedent to this filing and participated in the

10 administrative process. Petitioner actively participated in the administrative process by

11 submitting comments outlining the claims contained herein and petitioning the State

12 Board to review the Regional Board's decision to approve the Herbicide Project and allow

13 pesticide use in the Tahoe Key pursuant to Water Code ยง 13320.

14 11. A petitioner who has unsuccessfully sought review by the State Board has exhausted its

15 administrative remedies and may seek judicial review even if the Regional Board held no

16 hearing in respect of the decision or order. (Schutte & Koerting, Inc. v. Regional Water

17 Quality Control Bd. (2007), 158 Cal.App.4th 1373. As such, Petitioner has fully exhausted

18 its administrative remedies. to the extent such remedies exist and to the extent that

19 exhaustion of administrative remedies is legally necessary.
20 12. Petitioner possesses no other remedy to challenge Respondent's of discretion and failures

21 to comply with applicable laws and regulations.

22 PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL DOCTRINE

23 13. Petitioner brings this action as a private attorney general pursuant to California Code of

24 Civil Procedure section 1021.5, and any other applicable legal theory, to enforce important
25 rights affecting the public interest.

26 14. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will confer significant benefits on the

27 general public, and result in the enforcement of important rights affecting the public

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

interest, by, among other benefits and rights, upholding existing protections for water

2 quality in the Lahontan region and Lake Tahoe.

3 15. The necessity and financial burden of enforcement are such as to make an award of

4 attorneys* fees appropriate in this proceeding. Absent enforcement by Petitioner, the

5 Regional Board's decision might otherwise be deemed valid despite its legal and factual

6 a inadequacies, and, as a result, cause significant, adverse environmental effects that might

7 otherwise have been prevented.

8 LEGAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND

9 16. The Regional Board's decision to approve the Herbicide Project and allow pesticide use

10 in the Tahoe Keys was improper because it violated the Basin Plan, the California

11 Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), and the Clean Water Act ("CWA").

12 17. Pesticide use in the Tahoe Keys has been banned under the Basin Plan, subject to narrow
exemption criteria that have not been met here.
13 18. The Basin Plan exemption is based on an EIR that includes an impermissibly narrow
14 project description, and omits discussion of reasonably foreseeable consequences, in
15 violation of CEQA.

16 19. The final decision does not comply with the CWA because the NPDES permit has

17 inadequate monitoring, which will degrade outstanding national resource waters

18 (*ONRW") and fails to ensure monitoring sufficient to determine whether the discharge
complies with the NPDES permit.
19 20. These issues were presented to the Regional Board by Sierra Club. California Sportfishing
20 Protection Alliance, and others, prior to the Regional Board's approval of the Herbicide
21 Project.

22 A. Background

23 21. TKPOA applied to the Regional Board for an NPDES permit and a Basin Plan exemption

24 to conduct the Tahoe Keys Lagoons Aquatic Weed Control Methods Test ("CMT") using
aquatic herbicides in conjunction with non-chemical treatment methods. The purpose of
25 the CMT project is to test chemical and non-chemical methods that could reduce and
26 control the abundant growth of target aquatic weeds in the Tahoe Keys Lagoons.
27

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

22. After an initial study under CEQA was performed in 2017, a determination to conduct a

2 full CEQA analysis was made. TKPOA then withdrew its initial application and submitted

3 a second individual NPDES application and Basin Plan exemption in July 2018.

4 23. There were extensive comments to the Draft EIR and a two-day long hearing after the
Final EIR was released. Despite clear violations to the Basin Plan, CEQA, and the Clean
5 Water Act, The Board approved both the NPDES permit and the Basin Plan exemption-
6 along with the underlying final EIR and mitigation monitoring and reporting program.
7 B. The Herbicide Project Violates the Basin Plan

8 24. The Regional Board's decision to permit pesticide use in the Tahoe Keys to test controls
of aquatic invasive species ("AIS*) violates the Basin Plan Pesticide Prohibition

10 Exceptions.
25. The nature of the project itself, to test herbicides and non-chemical methods
11 simultaneously, does not fall within the letter or intent of the Basin Plan Pesticide
12 Prohibition Exceptions. In addition, there is no substantial evidence that the non-chemical
13 methods are infeasible. Finally, the nature of the test itself makes future repeat pesticide
14 applications foreseeable and likely and establishes a dangerous precedent for future

15 project applications.

16 1. The Basin Plan exemption criteria do not permit this herbicide test.

17 26. The Pesticide Prohibition Exception lists mandatory criteria that must be satisfied before
any pesticide application to waters can be permitted. For "projects that are neither
18 emergencies nor time sensitive," such as this, the Basin Plan exemption lists seven (7)
19 mandatory criteria. Criterion requires a
20 Demonstration that non-chemical measures were evaluated and found

21 inappropriate/ ineffective to achieve the project goals. (Alternatives to pesticide use must be thoroughly evaluated and implemented when
22 feasible (as defined in CEQA Guideline 15364: "Feasible" means
capable of being accomplished in a successful manner within a
23 reasonable period of time, taking into account economic,
environmental, legal, social, and technological factors.)

25 27. The staff report and draft findings claim that using non-chemical methods alone would be
infeasible to meet the project goals. However, the Regional Board based this incorrect 26 conclusion on an unduly narrow project goal to "[e]valuate the effectiveness of multiple
27 AIP treatment methodologies, including chemical and non-chemical methodologies and
28

4
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 combinations of both โฆ.* (Exemption to the Aquatic Pesticide Discharge Prohibition Staff

2 Report, Pg 2-44) The Exemption Staff Report contends that,
In order to compare the effectiveness of the different AIP treatment 3 methodologies with minimal variability in testing conditions, it is
4 important that all AIP treatment methodologies being considered for future use be evaluated at the same time in the same or very similar 5 environment. That is why both chemical and non-chemical treatment methodologies identified in the CMT project need to be evaluated 6 concurrently. Failing to do so, will fail to meet the project's goalsโฆ (Exemption to the Aquatic Pesticide Discharge Prohibition Staff Report. 7 Pg 2-48).
8 28. Having a project component that per se requires use of pesticides for testing violates the
o Basin Plan, because it would always render alternatives without pesticides infeasible to
achieving that goal, making the exemption criteria requirement to use feasible alternatives 10
meaningless. This narrow interpretation of the project goal is simply incorrect. The 11 Regional Board, when amending the Basin Plan, plainly did not intend for Lake Tahoe to
12 be a testing ground for pesticide use.
13 29. Instead, under this first exemption criterion, "project goals" must be understood to mean
14 the goal of controlling AIS, not the goal of testing herbicides.

15 30. This interpretation finds support in other provisions. For example, exemption criterion 3

16 requires the minimum chemical application necessary for "effective treatment." Criterion
6 also supports an interpretation of project goals to mean the goal of controlling AIS 17 because it refers to "the treatment goals," showing that the only intent for the exemption
18 was treatment, not testing.
19 31. During public comment at the hearing on the Project, three former Regional Board staff
20 all commented in agreement, that the exemption criteria had not been satisfied, and that
21 the intent of the Basin Plan amendment was not to test herbicide use where non-chemical

22 methods were potentially feasible.
32. Harold Singer, the former Regional Board Executive Office who oversaw the Basin Plan 23 amendment adding the exemption criteria; Laurie Kemper, the former Assistant Executive
dG Officer during that time: and Bruce Warden. former staff who worked on the Basin Plan
amendment and oversaw the TKPOA WDR; each commented that the exemption criteria 26 had not been satisfied.
27 33. Indeed, the 2011 staff report for the Basin Plan amendment exemption clearly states that
grant an 28 "[t]he proposed pesticide waste discharge prohibitions allows the Water Board to
exemption to the prohibition.  [to] apply aquatic pesticides to surface waters for purposes
5
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

of controlling AIS," not for simply testing whether or how herbicides work. (2011 Staff

2 Rpt. at 10 [emphasis added]).

3 34. Testing herbicides to see if they work and using herbicides when all other methods are

4 infeasible are two completely different actions.
35. Similarly, the 2011 staff report to the Basin Plan Prohibition exemption says that "[w]here
5 it can be demonstrated that pesticide use is the only feasible alternative to control AIS.
6 impacts within the treatment area may be justified . . ." (2011 Staff Rpt. at 10 [emphasis
7 added]). This has not been established here. The CMT project would apply the herbicides

8 at lower than the recommended rate (Proposed NPDES Permit, Pg 2-323,), and it is
therefore unknown even if the proposed herbicide use would effectively treat AIS. The

10 mere fact that CMT is testing herbicides is evidence that it has not been established
herbicides are the "only feasible alternative" to control AIS. There is no evidence in the 11 exemption adoption record that the Board intended Tahoe to be a testing ground for
12 pesticides.'
13 36. Further, as quoted above in the Exemption Staff Report, "it is important that all AIP
14 treatment methodologies being considered for future use be evaluated at the same time in

15 the same or very similar environment." (Exemption to the Aquatic Pesticide Discharge

16 Prohibition Staff Report, Pg 2-48).

17 37. However, this is not the case here. The herbicides will be used along the shoreline and
around the piers. while the UV will be tested in the deeper centers of the lagoons. 18 38. By testing the treatment methodologies in different environments, the Herbicide Project
19 will not collect useful test results from the non-chemical methods, undermining the
20 ostensible project purposes itself, and all but guaranteeing that future herbicide

21 applications will be proposed and approved.

22 2. There is no substantial evidence that non-chemical methods are infeasible.
39. There is no substantial evidence that the non-chemical methods are infeasible. However, 23 there is evidence supporting that the non-chemical methods are feasible.
24 40. This means that under the Basin Plan, the non-chemical alternatives to pesticides should
25 be implemented first. Instead. the Board approved the CMT project proposing to test

2 chemical methods first, and compare them to non-chemical methods, violating the Basin
Plan-concluding that the non-chemical methods alone are infeasible. (January 12-13,

3 2022 Lahontan Regional Board Meeting, Response to Comments, Pg 2-518).

4 41. Infeasibility findings must be supported by substantial evidence in the record of the

5 agency's proceedings. Pub Res Code ยง 21081.5; 14 CCR ยง 15091(b).

6 42. For CEQA, "substantial evidence" is "enough relevant information and reasonable

7 inferences that a fair argument can be made to support a conclusion, even though other

8 conclusions might also be reached." Save Panoche Valley v. San Benito Cty., 217 Cal.
App. 4th 503, 514 (2013) (citing CEQA Guidelines, ยง15384, subd. (a)).

9 43. Substantial evidence may include facts, reasonable assumptions predicated upon facts, and

10 expert opinion supported by facts. Sierra Club v. Cty. of Napa, 121 Cal. App. 4th 1490,

11 1503 (2004) (citing San Franciscans v. City & County of San Francisco, 102 Cal.App.4th

12 656 (2002)). Substantial evidence does not include arguments, speculation,

13 unsubstantiated opinion, or clearly erroneous evidence. Id.

14 44. The information and inferences the Board bases its infeasibility finding on fall short of
supporting a reasonable conclusion.

15 45. It is undisputed that all evidence in the record indicates that UV light and laminar flow

16 aeration ("LFA") have been effective in the times and places used. (Draft EIR, Pg 2-19,

17 2-22).

18 46. The Regional Board speculates, without any evidence, that the scale of the Tahoe Keys

19 may render UV and LFA infeasible, when compared to the scales at which these non-
chemical methods have previously been tested.
20

21 47. TKPOA's LFA installation actually had promising results-increased dissolved oxygen
levels and diminished muck layers in sediment. (Draft EIR, Pg 3.3.4-43).

22 48. When analyzing the efficiency of bottom barriers, however, the evidence is skewed by the

23 fact that TKPOA left installation and removal to the individual homeowners rather than

24 being responsible itself-but for this deficiency, there is no evidence that barriers are

25 infeasible. (Draft EIR, pg 2-39).

26 49. These studies show that the Board has not sufficiently shown that the infeasibility finding

27 of non-chemical methods alone is supported by reliable facts or reasonable assumptions
predicated upon facts. (Exemption to the Aquatic Pesticide Discharge Prohibition Staff

28 Report, 2-47 to 2-48).

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

-

2 50. Indeed, the EIR itself includes a Project alternative relying solely on non-chemical

3 methods (Alternative 1) as a potentially feasible alternative. See 14 Cal. Code Regs ยง

4 15126.6(a). Not only does the EIR consider the non-chemical method to be potentially

5 feasible, the EIR deems Alternative 1 to be the environmentally superior alternative. when

6 compared to the proposal to use herbicide treatments. These factors strongly undermine
and contradict the Regional Board's conclusion that non-chemical methods are infeasible,

7 where the EIR has already determined a non-chemical alternative to be potentially

8 feasible, and environmentally superior to the Herbicide Project.

9 51. The Regional Board's failure to rely on substantial evidence when it rejected non-chemical

10 methods as infeasible violated the Basin Plan and CEQA. C.f., Laurel Heights

11 Improvement Ass'n v. Regents of Univ. of Cal.. 47 Cal. 3d 376, 404-6 (1988) (agency must

12 explain in meaningful detail facts supporting a decision that an alternative is infeasible).

13 52. Further, testing the chemical and non-chemical methods as part of the same project will
taint the testing results, and fail to provide data regarding the effectiveness of non-

14 chemical methods, alone.

15 53. Indeed, contrary to the Basin Plan, the Herbicide Project would apply and test chemical

16 treatment methods first, in conflict with the Basin Plan's requirement to implement

17 feasible non-chemical methods first. Worse still, any and all data gathered regarding the

18 non-chemical methods being tested will be predicated on use of herbicides first, thus

19 failing to provide any information about non-chemical methods alone, and virtually
ensuring that future projects rely on herbicide treatment.

20 54. Moreover, there are no performance standards for the non-chemical methods. For

21 example, no information has been provided on the UV system that indicates how its
effectiveness will be evaluated.

22

23 55. There is no rush to use pesticides because this project is neither time sensitive nor an

emergency.

Ce 56. Consistent with the Basin Plan, non-chemical methods must be employed before
pesticides are discharged into the Tahoe Keys.

26 57. The Herbicide Project directly contradicts the letter and spirit of the Basin Plan's limited

27 exemption for pesticide applications to waters, and the only evidence in the record

28 regarding the non-chemical methods being employed shows that they work.
58. Petitioners respectfully request the State Water Board remands this matter to the Regional
Board with direction to implement the EIR Alternative 1.
8
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 C. The Herbicide Project Approval Violates CEQA

2 59. The Regional Board's approval of the Herbicide Project should be reversed and remanded

3 to the Regional Board due to violations of CEQA.

4 60. First, the Herbicide Project is based on an unduly narrow project description that impeded
any meaningful consideration of project alternatives that would reduce or avoid the 5 Project's adverse environmental effects.
6 61. Second. the EIR does not include any analysis about the reasonably foreseeable repeat use
7 of pesticides in future years.

8 62. For each of these failures to proceed in a manner required by law, and the Project should
be sent back to the Regional Board.

10 Unduly Narrow Project Description
63. The Herbicide Project description requires the use of chemical methods, which 11 automatically prohibits the use of non-chemical methods.
12 64. Project objectives should not be SO narrowly defined that they preclude consideration of
13 reasonable alternatives for achieving the project's underlying purpose; here. ostensibly to
14 control aquatic invasive species.
15 65. A lead agency may not give a project's purpose an artificially narrow definition. North

16 Coast Rivers Alliance v. Kawamura, 243 Cal.App.4th 647, 668 (2015). For example, in

17 North Coast Rivers Alliance, the agency's project objective called for "eradication." of
pests, leaving out of the EIR an analysis of pest "control" as a reasonable alternative to 18 the eradication program. Id. Because the project description was artificially narrow, the
19 EIR left out the pest "control" alternatives, to which the court found reasonable and
20 consequently violated CEQA.

21 66. Similarly, the Herbicide Project is based upon a project objective to use herbicides that

22 impermissibly disqualifies reasonable alternatives, including the otherwise feasible

23 environmentally superior alternative.

24 67. Therefore, the Herbicide Project description violates CEQA because it maintains an
25 unduly narrow project objective that precludes non-chemical methods from achieving the
true project goal of controlling invasive weeds.
26 ii. The EIR Fails to Analyze Reasonably Foreseeable Consequences
27 68. Repeated use of pesticides is a reasonably foreseeable effect of the Herbicide Project, since

28 the project itself fails to gather evidence regarding the efficacy of non-chemical treatment
methods alone, and fails to address any of the underlying conditions that have caused the
9
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

weed infestation problem, such that the weeds will continue to grow year after year. (Sierra

2 Club NPDES Permit Comment, Pg 2; Sierra Club Draft EIR Comment, Pg 10).

3 69. An EIR must include reasonably foreseeable consequences that will result from a project's
approval. 14 CCR ยงยง15126, 15378; Laurel Heights Improvement Ass'n v Regents of Univ. 4
of Cal. 47 Cal. 3d 376, 396 (1988). Failure to disclose and analyze reasonably foreseeable 5 consequences violates CEQA. Id. The Laurel Heights court established a two-pronged test
6 to apply in determining whether consequences are reasonably foreseeable:
7 We hold that an EIR must include an analysis of the environmental effects of future expansion or other action if: (1) it is a reasonably 8 foreseeable consequence of the initial project; and (2) the future expansion or action will be significant in that it will likely change the scope or nature of the initial project or its environmental effects.
10
70. Applying this test, the Court in Laurel Heights, found that the University's occupancy of 11 an entire building was a reasonably foreseeable consequence that would likely change the
12 scope or nature of the proposed initial project and its environmental effect. The University
13 planned to move its school of pharmacy science research units a to a portion of an office
14 building in a residential neighborhood. Despite the University's argument to the contrary,

15 evidence in the record indicated that the University intended to occupy the entire building

16 once another agency's lease in the building expired. Therefore, the EIR should have
discussed and analyzed the consequence of occupying the entire building. 17 71. Similarly, repeated pesticide use in the Tahoe Keys is a reasonably foreseeable 18 consequence that will likely change the scope or nature of the proposed initial project and
19 its environmental effect.

20 72. The Herbicide Project approval plans to administer a one-time use of herbicides followed

21 by non-chemical methods.

22 73. Despite TKPOAs argument to the contrary, evidence in the record indicates that the CMT
project fails to address the root causes of weed growth-excessive nutrients in the 23 140 sediments and flowing into the warm, stagnant lagoon waters from surrounding homes of
the Tahoe Keys-making a long-term weed removal solution necessary. (Sierra Club
NPDES Permit Comment, Pg 2; Sierra Club Draft EIR Comment, Pg 10).
74. The CMT project's focus is on removing the weeds that are currently there, rather than

grow, and 27 stopping weeds from growing altogether. Therefore, the weeds will continue to

28 if TKPOA finds the pesticides to work, then the use of pesticides may very well be used
routinely in the ONRW of the Tahoe Keys.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

p 75. Repeat pesticide use will likely change the scope or nature of the proposed initial project

2 and its environmental effect.

3 76. Therefore, the EIR should have discussed and analyzed recurring pesticide applications.

4 77. Further, failure to review a foreseeable extension of a temporary project violates CEQA.

5 78. In City of Santee v. County of San Diego, the court applied the Laurel Heights test in its

6 review of an EIR for proposed construction of temporary jail facilities. City of Santee V

7 County of San Diego, 214 Cal.App.3d 1438, 1440 (1989). Based on evidence in the record

8 indicating a reasonable possibility that the temporary jail would remain in operation longer
than the county had projected, the court found the EIR's project description deficient. Id.

9 79. Similarly, the Tahoe Keys matter is framed as a pilot project but could just as easily

10 become something permanent based on the CMT results, rendering repeated chemical

11 applications likely and essentially proposed. The CMT is a test project to see which

12 methods are successful at addressing the weed infestation in the Tahoe Keys.

13 80. Successful methods can potentially be used again in the future-meaning that future year

14 pesticide applications are clearly contemplated. And as discussed in the previous
paragraph, repeat use of pesticides will likely be found necessary since the root causes of

15 the weed growth are not being dealt with.

16 81. The final EIR is inadequate and violates CEQA because it is based on a narrow project

17 objective that precludes reasonable alternatives and the reasonably foreseeable

18 consequence of recurring pesticide use is not analyzed.

19 82. Because the Basin plan exemptions rests on the certification of this defunct EIR. it should
not have been approved.
20 D. The Final Decision Violates the Clean Water Act

21 83. The final decision violates the Clean Water Act because the NPDES permit fails to require

22 adequate monitoring to determine whether the Herbicide Project complies with the permit

23 limits. 40 C.F.R. 8ยง 122.41(j)(1) ("Samples and measurements taken for the purpose of
monitoring shall be
24 representative of the monitored activity"). 122.48(b)
(*AIl permits shall specify
25 Required monitoring including type, intervals. and

26 frequency sufficient to yield data which are representative of the monitored activity").

27 Additionally, the monitoring is inadequate to ensure that there is no discharge into an
ONRW.40 C.F.R. ยง 131.12(a)(3).

28 i. The NPDES permit fails to require monitoring sufficient to determine whether
the project complies with permit limits.
11
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

84. The NPDES permit fails to require proper monitoring for permit limits because sampling

2 is untimely and too limited testing.

3 85. First, sampling does not start until a week following application of the herbicides.

4 86. The Permit requires sampling to commence one week after an herbicide application and
to demonstrate compliance within 21 days within the treatment area. (Proposed NPDES 5 Permit, Pg 2-66).
6 87. This sampling schedule will not capture exceedances of the Receiving Water Limitations
7 for the specified herbicides for one tรฒ three weeks.

8 88. The monitoring thus fails to capture the Herbicide Project's effects. This is a clear
allowance to exceed permit Limitations for a specified period.
89. There is limited testing to assure 10 water quality is compliant.
90. The Basin Plan requires that the permittee verify compliance with receiving water limits 11 and water quality objectives.
12 91. However, the number of parameters monitored does not include all the Water Quality
13 Objectives (WQOs) in the Basin Plan.
14 92. Many of the WQOs in Chapter 3 of the Basin Plan for all waters and for Lake Tahoe are

15 not tested. Sampling of electrical conductivity, toxicity (acute and chronic), total nitrogen,

16 total dissolved solids (TDS) and chlorophyll a (for the algal growth potential WQO) is not

17 required in the draft permit.
93. Sampling of these parameters and all of the WQOs listed in the Basin Plan should be
18 required for verification that beneficial uses are protected (Sierra Club NPDES Permit
19 Comment, Pg 12).
20 94. Therefore, compliance with the NPDES permit requirement regarding the water quality

21 objectives which apply to surface waters cannot be met:

22 The discharge to receiving waters of residual aquatic herbicides, Rhodamine WT and lanthanum-modified clay must not cause a
23 violation of water quality objectives for the surface waters of the South Tahoe Hydrologic Area and the Tahoe Lake Body Hydrologic Area... 24 (Proposed NPDES Permit, Pg 2-66)
25 95. Even the State Board's Pesticide General Permit requires sampling of more parameters
26 like electrical conductivity, to provide more representative data of the monitored activity.
27 The current parameters are not sufficient to ensure compliance with the NPDES permit

28 and antidegradation of the ONRW.
ii. The Monitoring fails to Ensure no discharge to ONRW.
12
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- 96. The monitoring program is required to but fails to ensure that the ONRW of the Tahoe

2 Keys is not degraded.

00 T 97. Any degradation of ONRW is prohibited. 40 CFR $131.12(a)(3).
98. As described in the preamble to the Water Quality Standards Regulation, "States may
allow some limited activities which result in temporary and short-term changes in water
quality," but EPA guidance explains that such changes in water quality should not impact
6 existing uses or alter the essential character or special use that makes the water an ONRW.
7 99. The EPA guidance discusses acceptable short-term projects, such as building a road in a

8 park with temporary construction effects.

9 100. The intentional and direct application of herbicides to ONRW is nothing like the short-

10 term effects contemplated by EPA's guidance.
101. The Herbicide Project is a test project to see which methods are successful. (January 11 12-13, 2022, Lahontan Regional Board Meeting, Pg 2-3). Successful methods have the
12 potential to be used again in the future-meaning that future year pesticide applications
13 are clearly contemplated. Id.

14 102. Pesticide use does not solve the issue of weed growth so its perpetual use will be

15 required if this method is found successful. (Sierra Club NPDES Permit Comment. Pg 2;

16 Sierra Club Draft EIR Comment. Pg 10; Sierra Club Power Point, Slide 9).
103.
17 Further, pesticide residues can last at least (6) months. (Proposed NPDES Permit, Pg
2-170).
18 104. Pesticide use combined with the already present nutrients contributing to aquatic weed
19 infestations and harmful algal bloom outbreaks will only perpetuate the problem-
20 creating long-term negative effects to the water quality of the ONRW that does not qualify
21 for any short-term ONRW anti-degradation exemption.

22 105. The approved mitigation monitoring and reporting program contains inadequate

23 monitoring to ensure the ONRW is in turn not degraded.
106. The sampling locations are insufficient to enable a scientifically valid evaluation of 24 each method's effectiveness.
25 107. The Statewide General Permit requires the event monitoring samples be collected
26 "immediately outside the treatment areas."

27 108. Here, however, only one monitoring location, far from the treatment area, is required

28 in the receiving water between two (2) herbicide treatment areas in the lagoons. (Proposed
NPDES Permit, Pg 2-103).

. herbicides to receiving waters is expected to be minimal and below acceptable levels.

5 (January 12-13, 2022. Lahontan Regional Board Meeting, Response to Comments. Pg 2-
339). However, without additional sampling closer to the treatment area, there is no way
to confirm that.

7 The sampling frequency is inadequate to evaluate method effectiveness. Only one

& sample is required from each monitoring location. (January 12-13. 2022. Lahontan
Regional Board Meeting, Response to Comments, Pg 2-441).
111.

o
10 This is not frequent enough to ensure that the ONRW is not degraded. The very few

11 sampling sites and low frequency of sampling does not ensure that herbicides won't reach
Lake Tahoe or a drinking water supply intake.

14 This is based on Section A, Receiving Water Limitations, and Section C. Aquatic

15 Pesticide Application Plan, (Proposed NPDES Permit. Pg 2-66, 2-71). Table 4 under

16 Section A states that the discharge must not cause an exceedance of the following
limitations in the receiving waters:

4
115. Despite these requirements, the discharge of herbicides to Tahoe at the MCL is not
5 addressed.

6 116. The very purpose of "testing" aquatic pesticides in the Herbicide Project is to
7 determine whether they should be used again in the future.

8 117. Monitoring of a project designed to test control methods for potential future use on
Tier 3 ONRW should be monitored much more intensively.

10 118. The monitoring program relies mainly on qualitative visual assessments and does not

11 define a process by which the methods can confidently be applied in the future.
119. This monitoring program is simply inadequate to prevent degradation of the Tahoe
12 Keys, in violation of the Clean Water Act.

14 (Violations of Basin Plan)

15 120. CSPA incorporates by reference each and every allegation contained in Paragraphs

16 through 118 as though fully set forth herein.

17 121. The Regional Board's approval of the Herbicide Project is contrary to the spirit and

18 letter of the Basin Plan's pesticide discharge prohibition, as more fully set forth. above.
19 The nature of the Herbicide Project itself, to test herbicides and non-chemical methods

20 simultaneously, does not fall within the letter or intent of the Basin Plan Pesticide

21 Prohibition Exceptions. In addition, there is no substantial evidence that the non-chemical

22 methods are infeasible.

23 122. Accordingly, the Regional Board's approval of the Herbicide Project failed to proceed
24 in a manner required by law, failed to rely on sufficient findings or evidence, and must be
25 set aside.
