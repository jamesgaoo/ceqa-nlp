INTRODUCTION 1

2 1. This action challenges the September 30, 2021 decision of The Regents of the

3 University of California ("Regents") and the University of California at Santa Cruz ("UCSC" and

4 collectively, the "University") to approve the 2021 Long Range Development Plan (*2021 LRDP)

5 for the University of California Santa Cruz campus ("Project') and to certify the final environmental

6 impact report ("EIR") for the Project. Implementation of the 2021 LRDP will have significant

7 impacts to the City and its residents that have been neither evaluated nor addressed by the EIR. The
8 2021 LRDP should not have been approved by Respondents due to environmental impacts that have
9 not been adequately evaluated or mitigated. For these reasons, the 2021 LRDP and EIR violate the
10 requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") and its Guidelines.
2 The 2021 LRDP and EIR assume the UCSC campus population will increase to
12 28,000 full time equivalent (*FTE") students - an additional 9,482 students from current 11 2.

%6 6017-LOLL6 VINGOLIIVO 'VNEGYSVd 0S8 ILINS 'OAVAEINO8 OGY8O109 '3 06L KeHDYM uHIwsußiH 'ouon;uDIoo enrollment - and 5,000 faculty and staff - an additional 2,200 employees ---- by 2040. The
14 Legislature has found the expansion of campus enrollment and facilities may negatively affect the 13

surrounding environment. "Consistent with the requirements of the California Environmental
16 Quality Act (CEQA), it is the intent of the Legislature that the University of California sufficiently 15

17 mitigate significant off-campus impacts related to campus growth and development." (Ed. Code,

18 con 67504, subd. (b)(1).) Despite the Legislature's mandate and the University's dramatic increase in
19 student and faculty population, the 2021 LRDP and EIR omit any guaranteed housing
20 accommodations or appropriate, feasible mitigation measures to ease the impact on the surrounding
21 City and its residents. The EIR asserts, and the impact analyses assume, that UCSC will
22 accommodate 100 percent of the additional students and 25 percent of the additional faculty and
23 staff in on-campus housing. To reach this goal, though, UCSC would need to house approximately
24 17,783 students -but currently only offer on-campus housing for 9,283 of those students. The 2021
support this growth projection. The 25 LRDP and EIR lack any definitive plans for infrastructure to
26 University's failure to provide specific development or project-level details of where, how, and

27 when additional on-campus housing will occur flies in the face of its CEQA obligations.
28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 275197.3

1 3. Neither the 2021 LRDP nor EIR include any binding commitment by the University
2 to meet its lofty housing objectives. Because of the 2021 LRDP and EIR's built-in, unsupported
3 assumption that USCS will be able to house 100 percent of its new students on campus, the EIR fails

4 to properly evaluate several significant environmental impacts:

5 The University fails to properly assess and evaluate severe housing displacement

6 impacts. The EIR does not consider off-campus housing impacts on the City and the

7 already challenging rental and real estate market should UCSC fail to fully house

8 students and faculty on campus. Nor did the University implement feasible mitigation
measures, including tying increased enrollment to actual available on-campus housing

10 and development.
& 11 Given the EIR's "vehicle miles traveled" ("VMT") analysis for traffic impacts relies

12 60LZ-LOL16 VINGOSIIVO 'YNHGVSVd 098 BLINS 'GAVABINOR OGV80109 '3 06L *Kelldym gUNwsyBIh 'OUOnjudIos on these same dubious on-campus housing assumptions, it is also inadequate. The

13 University's claimed decrease in total campus VMT per capita is premised entirely on

14 the assumed increase in on-campus housing. And feasible, common-sense mitigation
like restricting student and staff private vehicle usage on 15 measures were ignored

16 campus, and again awaiting actual housing availability.

17 The EIR fails to analyze impacts associated with water supply unavailability resulting

18 from historic drought conditions, water scarcity, and rationing resulting from

19 implementation of the 2021 LRDP. Even the 2005 LRDP recognized that population

20 increase could impact our State's highly vulnerable water supplies. Yet, the 2021

21 LRDP fails to confront the implications for an already constrained water supply with

22 the addition of many more students and staff, and increased resulting demand on the

23 City's infrastructure.

24 4. The 2021 LRDP's impacts exceed the University's disclosure, evaluation, and
25 mitigation of them. The 2021 LRDP would allow campus growth beyond what has been actually
26 planned for, with significant negative impacts on the City and its housing, water supply, traffic, and
27 other public services in place to support its residents. The University's proposed enrollment growth,
28 put simply, has not been thought through as CEQA requires. The growth under the 2021 LRDP of

3
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 275197.3

over 9,000 more students and 2,200 more staff will unleash demand for off-campus housing and City

2 services that will drive up housing demand and costs throughout the community, and burden the
3 City's public services, infrastructure, and traffic. All of this was required to be thoroughly evaluated,
4 assessed, and mitigated in the EIR, but was not. The University's cookie-cutter approach, failing to
5 consider the specific impacts on this community and its services now and for the next 20 years, is

6 improper and in violation of CEQA.

7 5. The City seeks a writ of mandate setting aside, a declaration invalidating, and an
8 injunction forbidding implementation of Respondents' 2021 LRDP and EIR, and associated Findings
9 regarding Impacts and Mitigation Measures, Mitigation Monitoring Program, and Statement of
10| Overriding Considerations, pending Respondents' full compliance with CEQA.

*6 13 State of California and the City Charter and located in the County of Santa Cruz. The developed
Colantuono, Highsmith 14 portion of the University is largely located within the City's boundaries. The City is

15 disproportionately impacted by the unanalyzed and unmitigated impacts of the Project. The City as a
16 whole has been, and will continue to be, impacted by the University's dramatically increased
17 enrollment, which taxes the City's provision of public services and utilities and exacerbates the
18 City's already severe housing crisis. The City is both directly and indirectly impacted by the EIR's
19 failure to evaluate and mitigate for several potentially significant environmental impacts that will
20 result from implementation of the 2021 LRDP, in violation of CEQA. The City of Santa Cruz thus

21 has a direct and beneficial interest in Respondents' compliance with CEQA and the CEQA
22 Guidelines. These interests will be directly and adversely affected by implementation of the 2021
23 LRDP and final EIR, which violate provisions of law as set forth in this Petition for Writ of Mandate
24 and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief ("Petition") and which would cause substantial
25 and irreversible harm to the health and welfare of Santa Cruz residents. The maintenance and

26 prosecution of this action will confer a substantial benefit on the public by protecting the public from

19 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

20 I. THE 2021 LRDP

21 23. A long-range development plan ("LRDP") is "a physical development and land use

22 plan to meet the academic and institutional objectives for particular campus or medical center of
23 public higher education." (Pub. Res. Code, § 21000 et seq.) The Legislature has found the expansion
24 of campus enrollment and facilities may negatively affect the surrounding environment, and thus
25 mandates that "[c]onsistent with the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act
26 (CEQA), it is the intent of the Legislature that the University of California sufficiently mitigate
27 significant off-campus impacts related to campus growth and development." (Ed. Code, § 67504,
28 subd. (b)(1).) Approval of a long-range development plan must be considered in an EIR, which must

7 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 275197.3

1 analyze the "[e]nvironmental effects relating to changes in enrollment levels," among other things.
2 | (Pub. Resources Code, § 21080.09, subd. (a)(2) & (b); Ed. Code, § 67504, subd. (a)(1).) The

3 approval of a project on a particular campus is also subject to CEQA, and may be addressed in a

4 tiered environmental analysis based on an LRDP EIR. Each University of California campus is

5 required to develop periodically a LRDP to guide the campus's physical development, including land

6 use designations, the location of buildings, and infrastructure systems, for an established time

7 horizon.

8 24. In 2005, the University developed its 2020 LRDP to guide its growth and

9 development from 2005 through 2020. The 2005 LRDP was driven by several broad objectives,
10| including initially to accommodate student enrollment of 21,000 by 2020. However, based on
8 9 6017-L01L6 VINOJVO 'VNEGVSVd 11 comments to the draft LRDP and draft EIR, the University adopted an EIR Reduced Enrollment 790 E. COLORADO BOULEVARD, SUITE E AeHDum g u4wsybih 'ouonjudiog 12 Growth alternative, only projecting an FTE on-campus student population of 19,500.

13 25. In its sixth LRDP, the 2021 LRDP, the University plans for campus development and
14 growth to support the academic mission of UC Santa Cruz through 2040.1 (See Pub. Resources
15 Code, § 21080.09, subd. (b).) Its goal is "to aid the campus in achieving its education, research, and
16| public service mission and goals while informing capital plans to manage resource expenditures."
17 (2021 LRDP at p. 17.) Because it guides all development on the UCSC campus, it plays a pivotal it
18 role in shaping the future of the campus. (Id.)

19 26. As the LRDP acknowledges, this planning process is "also an opportunity to update
20 campus strategies in an ever-changing world, to focus thinking around sustainable development and

in the face of current and 21 resource conservation, and to enhance the resilience of the campus
22 predicted challenges." (Id. at p. 17.) But instead of actually thinking through and implementing these
23 sustainability and growth strategies, the 2021 LRDP continues down the same path of unchecked

24 growth and development. Indeed, as recognized in the Chancellor's introduction, while the plan
25 proposes to add 5.6 million assignable square feet to support needs of the increased campus
26 population, this is largely for academic and support facilities, not housing. (Id. at p. 101.)

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 275197.3

27. The 2021 LRDP projects significant student and staff population growth for the next

2 20 years. While the 2005 LRDP the last completed anticipated enrollment of 19,500 students,

3 the current plan projects the potential addition of about 8,500 students for a total projected, on-
4 campus, full-time equivalent of 28,000 students. Faculty and staff are projected to increase by 2,200
5 full-time employees, for a total of 5,000 on-campus faculty and staff to support projected student
6 growth. (Id. at pp. x, 95.) This student and staff population growth is reiterated in the EIR. (Final

7 EIR at 4-56 [ projecting an additional 9,482 students, for a total of 28,000, and a an additional 2,200
8 staff and faculty, for a total of 5,000].)

9 28. The 2021 LRDP assumes that UCSC will accommodate this projected increased
10 student and faculty enrollment (id, at p. 17), though the LRDP does not "constitute a commitment to
2
Vhatley, by UC Santa Cruz to enrollment growth or a certain amount of development." (Draft EIR, p. 2-1.)

% PASADENA, CALIFORNIA 91101-2109 098 ILINS 'GAVA3INOS 00V8O100 '3 06L 11 any specific project, construction schedule, or funding priority, nor does it constitute a commitment

12

13 However, its approval paves the way for development to occur. If the LRDP, for example, did not
4HwsySIH 'ouonjudjoo 14 assume that Respondents were obligated to accommodate a projected student enrollment of 28,000
15 FTE students, and instead directed that growth elsewhere, such growth at the Santa Cruz campus
16 would not be permitted. By approving an LRDP that includes a horizon year of 2040 with a
17 projected increase in student enrollment of approximately 9,000 students over that in the prior

18 LRDP, the 2021 LRDP paves the way for this campus expansion. (2021 LRDP at pp. 17, 43.)

19 29. The University started exploring housing development options on the campus,
20 specifically the Student Housing West ("SHW") Project. This Project, however, would only add
21 3,000 student beds at two sites the Heller site and the Hagar site - on the UCSC campus, with
22 construction originally proposed to commence in or after 2019. (2021 LRDP at p. 71.) Construction
23 has still not commenced on that project, and is currently the subject of litigation.

24 Il. THE EIR AND THE CITY'S COMMENTS

25 30. The University of California released a Notice of Preparation of an Environmental
26 Impact Report for the UCSC 2021 LRDP on February 25, 2020.

27 31. In January 2021, UCSC released the Draft 2021 LRDP, and on January 20, 2021,
28 released a Draft EIR for public review and comment. In the Draft EIR, Respondents used the Final

275197.3 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Proposed Land Use Map that was released on December 2, 2019, and proposed housing 100 percent
2 of all new students on the main campus. The Draft EIR analyzed the potential environmental impacts

3

4 of implementing the 2021 LRDP and was circulated for review and comment by the public and other

5 interested parties, agencies, and organizations from January 7, 2021 to March 8, 2021. Public 7,

6 hearings were held on February 3 and 4, 2021 to receive verbal input from agencies and the public
on the Draft EIR. After close of the public comment period, responses to written and oral comments
7 on environmental issues were prepared.

8 32.

9 The City Planning and Community Development Department provided a comment
letter on the Draft EIR on March 8, 2021. In essence, the City objected that infrastructure mitigation

& 10 measures, specifically for housing, must be in place before student enrollment increases, not after, to

11
Whatley, 12 minimize negative impacts to the environment, the City, and its residents. For instance, the City

66 objected that increasing the number of students, faculty, and staff without a coinciding increase in

Colantuono, Highsmith 60 LZ-LOLL6 VINJOSIIVO 'VNECYSVd 13 on-campus housing capacity would have different impacts than those studied under the Draft EIR:

14

15 While the project anticipates providing housing for 100% of its FTE students over 19,500 and up to 25% of its additional 2200 staff and faculty, UCSC does not

16 control where anyone chooses to reside. The DEIR has not studied the impacts under a scenario where less than 100% of new enrollment lives on campus or a

17 significantly smaller portion than 24% of faculty and staff choosing to live off- campus. Additionally, while increases in FTE students, faculty, and staff are

18 analyzed, the number of part time students, faculty, and staff and their impact is unknown. Additional scenarios addressing these issues should be studied.
19 The City also commented on the deficiency in the Draft EIR of impacts of the LRDP on such
20 environmental issues as air quality, hydrology and water quality and supplies, population and
21 housing, public services, recreation, transportation, and utilities and service systems. With regard to

23

24 (2) the Draft EIR's failure to tie timing of development and provision of on-campus housing to

25 immediate increases in student and faculty population, and that neither the Draft EIR nor LRDP

26 mandates that housing be built and occupied prior to enrollment growth; (3) lack of consideration of
contribution to the City's Affordable Housing Trust Fund to offset increased housing demand from

2 33. UCSC released the final EIR on September 15, 2021.2 This included responses to the

3 City's and County's comment letters. The final EIR simply incorporated the draft EIR, with the

4 addition of a chapter 4 listing its revisions.

5 34. The LRDP EIR is identified as a program EIR, from which UCSC intends to "tier" its

6 environmental review of future projects proposed under the LRDP. The EIR states that:

7 subsequent projects that are proposed consistent with the 2021 LRDP will be reviewed using an environmental checklist to determine whether they are within 8 the scope of the Program EIR. If no new significant effects would occur, the
9 subsequent project is considered to be within the scope of the Program EIR, and additional environmental analysis is not required.

4HWsyßIH 'ouOn;uDIOO 6017-LOLL6 VINROJIIVO 'VNEGVSVd Significantly, the City commented that the assumption in the EIR that USCS will achieve the
14 LRDP's on-campus housing objectives is not supported by substantial evidence. Despite its stated
15 commitment to provide housing for 100 percent of on-campus FTE enrollment growth over the
16 19,500 from the 2005 LRDP, the EIR acknowledges that "[n]o specific development is proposed as
17 part of the 2021 LRDP, and no project-level details have been developed regarding where, how, or
18 when development under the 2021 LRDP would occur." (Final EIR, p. 2-20 [Master Response 9].)
19 And, the City noted that neither the LRDP nor EIR actually includes any binding commitment to
20 meet these identified housing objectives:
21 Despite this, the entire analysis in the EIR is based upon the unsupported
22 assumption that UCSC will house 100-percent of its new students on campus. As a result, the EIR grossly underestimates the potential off-campus impacts of the 23 proposed enrollment growth if students, faculty, an staff, in fact are not housed on
24 campus.
The City also commented that tiering does not excuse the University from adequately analyzing 25
reasonably foreseeable significant environment impacts of the Project, including projections of 26
annual development. "Without binding commitments to meet housing objectives, the assumption that 27

UCSC will meet the LRDP's on-campus housing goals to keep up with enrollment is not supported
2 by substantial evidence, as required by CEQA." The City also outlined in detail the potential

3 environmental impacts that will result in the likely event UCSC does not meet the LRDP's housing

4 objectives, including but not limited to the potential to contribute to housing displacement in the City
5 and vehicle-miles-traveled (VMT) impacts if final buildout is not achieved. Finally, the City outlined

6 its position on feasible mitigation measures that the University failed to consider. A true and correct

7 copy of the City's September 26, 2021 comment letter is attached hereto as Exhibit F.

10 any action was taken on the final EIR or Project.

Vhatley, 60LZ-LOLL6 VINHOJITVO 'VNECYSYd 790 E. COLORADO BOULEVARD, SUITE 850 11 The 2021 LRDP and final EIR were presented to the Regents at their September

12 meeting on September 29 and 30, 2021. The Regents approved the 2021 LRDP, certified the final

d8 13 EIR, and adopted a Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program, a Statement of Overriding
4HWs46IH 'ouOnjUDIOE 14 Considerations, and Findings at its regularly scheduled meeting on September 30, 2021.

15 38. The Regents then submitted, and the Governor's Office of Planning and Research

16 posted, the Notice of Determination ("NOD") for the 2021 LRDP on September 30, 2021.

17 39. The 2021 LRDP as approved would allow for on-campus "enrollment of 28,000
18 students which, if realized, would be an increase of 9,482 students over the 2018-19 baseline."

19 (NOD at p. 1.) It would also authorize "[a]n additional 2,200 full time equivalent (FTE) on-campus

20 faculty and staff a for a total on-campus employee FTE projection of 5,000." (Id.) This increase by
21 more than half of existing on-campus faculty and staff will have a significant impact on the housing
22  market and environment. As the NOD acknowledges, the 2021 LRDP projects approximately 3

23 million gross square feet of additional total campus space. (Id.) Such a vast expansion of the campus
24 would have numerous, significant impacts that could not be mitigated to insignificance.

25 40. The 2021 LRDP allows unbridled campus growth despite its exacerbation of the
26 ongoing housing crisis in the area. The community around UCSC has traditionally been a "very tight

27 housing market, especially as it relates to rental housing." (DEIR at p. 3.13-5.) The "housing market

28 is influenced by several factors, including proximity to major job centers, low for-sale inventory, and

12

275197.3 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 an "extremely tight' rental market." (DEIR at p. 3.13-5.) The EIR asserts, and the impact analyses
2 assume, that UCSC will accommodate 100 percent of the additional students and 25 percent of the

3 additional faculty and staff in on-campus housing. To reach this goal, UCSC would need to house
4 approximately 17,783 students

5 a substantial increase compared to the existing on-campus housing
capacity of approximately 9,283 students. The EIR projects only 25 percent of new employees will
6 be housed on campus, and no matter how much housing the campus provides, a substantial

7 percentage of students will still seek less expensive off-campus apartments. (2021 LRDP at p. 98.)
8 Historically, this number has approximated 50 percent of students.

9 41. CEQA requires that public agencies do not adopt a project where there are feasible
10 mitigation measures available which would substantially lessen the significant environmental effects

86 Colantuono, Highsmith Whatley, PC 790 E. COLORADO BOULEVARD, SUITE 850 60LZ-LOLL6 VINJOHIIVO 'VNäGVSVd 11 of the project. (Pub. Resources Code § 21002; CEQA Guidelines, § 15002, subd. (a).) The
12 University's 2021 LRDP, and its environmental documents released during the planning process, all

13

14 fail to identify or appropriately analyze mitigation measures to mitigate housing and environmental

15 impacts. For example, to mitigate for potential VMT and air quality impacts, UCSC should have
considered restricting private vehicle usage on campus for new students, faculty, and staff. The final
16 EIR summarily dismissed this measure, stating that UCSC "cannot control the vehicle choices of
17 private citizens." This is misleading at best since UCSC already disallows students from bringing

18 their vehicles to campus through its regulation of on-campus parking permits. First- and second-year
19 students with less than 90 units who reside in University housing facilities, including University
20 | Town Center, are restricted from purchasing permits for on-campus parking. Additionally, the

21 University provides that "[b]ecause parking is such a limited resource at UCSC, it is strongly
22 recommended that students who are not eligible to purchase an on-campus parking permit not bring

23 vehicles to Santa Cruz." Respondents have offered no evidence that expanding this policy to all new
24 students would be infeasible, and the Regents should have considered this measure.

25 42. To mitigate for potential impacts related to housing displacement, the Regents should
26 have considered a mitigation measure which ties increases in enrollment growth to the actual
27 construction and availability of on-campus housing.

5 entirety. Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in their

6 44.

7 Respondents violated CEQA by certifying an EIR that is inadequate and fails to

8 comply with the requirements of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines in multiple respects. The EIR's

9 analysis of impacts assumes that the housing objectives of the 2021 LRDP of housing 100 percent of

10

% new students on campus will be met, and the EIR is clear that the University is not required to meet

Whatley, 60L7-LOLL6 VINGOJIVO 'VNIGVSVd 11 them. Without this commitment, the EIR's analysis fails to fully inform the public about potential
significant impacts of the 2021 LRDP, and more significantly, fails to consider feasible and adequate

8 12 mitigation to those impacts. This is a fundamental inadequacy of the EIR.
13

Colantuono, Highsmith 45. CEQA mandates that the EIR adequately analyze a project's effects to foster
14 informed decisionmaking and allow the public to understand those impacts. Pub. Resources Code
15

16 § 210021; CEQA Guidelines §§ 15121, 15126, 15126.2. Where possible, the lead agency must

employ feasible mitigation measures that could minimize the project's significant adverse impacts.
17 Pub. Resources Code § 21002; CEQA Guidelines §§ 15121, 15126.4. The informational purpose of
18 CBQA is not satisfied by simply stating in the EIR that information will be provided in the future,
19 | but rather must serve

20 as an "analytically complete and coherent" document. (Vineyard Area Citizens

21 for Responsible Growth, Inc. V. City of Rancho Cordova (2007) 40 Cal.4th 412.) The University's
EIR suffers from failure to adequately discuss and mitigate impacts, including, but not limited to, the
22 following:

23 Housing Impacts

24 46. The 2021 LRDP objectives include providing on-campus housing for 100 percent of
25 additional students and at least 25 percent of additional faculty and staff. The EIR likewise assumes
26 that UCSC will provide housing for 100 percent of the increased students and 25 percent of the
27 additional 2,200 anticipated faculty and staff members. But the LRDP does not propose any specific
28 development, nor have any project-level details been developed regarding where, how, or when the

275197.3 14 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 additional housing development would occur. And neither the LRDP nor the EIR includes any
2 binding commitment to meet these housing objectives. Without this binding commitment for on-

3 campus housing, the EIR must analyze the potential impacts of the project based on the assumption

4 that no new on-campus housing will be constructed. It has not.

5 47. An EIR is required to consider the "reasonably foresecable future activities related to

6 the proposed project." (Vineyard Area Citizens for Resp. Growth, Inc. V. City of Rancho Cordova

7 (2007) 40 Cal.4th 412, 428.) The EIR failed to consider off-campus impacts due to the reasonable

8 foreseeability that UCSC will not be able to house 100 percent of additional students and 25 percent
of additional employees prior to increased enrollment on campus. Where economic impacts would

10 result in physical impacts, they must be analyzed pursuant to CEQA. (Bakersfield Citizens for Local
098 JlInS 'GaVAJInOS 0GV80100 '3 06L Control v. City of Bakersfield (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1184.) In addition, an EIR is required to
Colantuono, Highsmith & Whatley, 60L7-LOLL6 VINJONIVO 'YNIGVSVd 11

12 consider both the direct and indirect effects of a project, including displacement of residents due to
13 high rental rates. (Aptos Council v. County of Santa Cruz (2017) 10 Cal.App.5th 266.) The EIR

14 neglected to include any information on these potential impacts, which in-and-of itself is a clear

15 violation of CBQA.

16 48. Historically, the University has failed to meet its housing objectives. It failed to meet
17 its 1988 LRDP objective to house 70 percent of additional students on campus. However, as the
18 University acknowledged in the 2005 LRDP and associated documents, it did not meet this
19 | objective. Similarly, as disclosed in the 2019 Student Housing West (SHW) Draft EIR, the
20 University states, "The 2005 LRDP estimated that a total of approximately 3.18 million gsf [gross

21 square feet] of academic buildings, support facilities, and student housing would be required to

22 support a total future enrollment level of 19,500 students. [However] only a small percentage of the
23 planned building space has been developed on the campus since 2005." The 2018 SHW DEIR
24 estimated that only 5.6% of the infrastructure gross square feet that was proposed in the 2005 LRDP
25 was ever actually realized. Indeed, the only instance where the University actually achieved its on-
26 campus housing objective it was legally compelled to do so - through its comprehensive settlement
was only met by turning single rooms 27 agreement on a CEQA challenge to the 2005 LRDP. And that

28 into double, doubles into triples, and lounges into quads, as well as rehabilitating existing dorms.

15 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 275197.3

1 49. Thus, the assumption in the 2021 LRDP and resulting EIR of meeting its objective to
2 house 100 percent of new students on campus, and 25 percent of new staff, is thus speculative at
3 best. Based on the University's admitted past experience, it is not reasonably foreseeable that the
4 University will meet the on-campus housing objective in the 2021 LRDP, and the University has
s offered no substantial evidence to support this assumption. On the other hand, the University was
6 presented with substantial evidence that if it does not meet its on-campus housing objectives, there

7

8 will at a minimum be significant housing and traffic impacts to the City.

50.

9 The University has declined to evaluate the possible environmental impacts of the
2021 LRDP should the housing objectives not be met, which is reasonably foreseeable, and therefore

g 790 E. COLORADO BOULEVARD, SUITE 850 Colantuono, Highsmith & Whatley, 66 60L7-LOLL6 VINJOSIIVO 'VNJGVSVd 10 has consequently failed to fully inform the public about the potentially significant effects of the 2021
11 LRDP and declined to consider feasible and adequate mitigation to those impacts as required by

12 CEQA.

13 51. Because the EIR concluded that the project will have a significant and unavoidable
14 impact related to directly or indirectly inducing substantial unplanned population growth and

15 housing demand, CEQA requires that UCSC adopt all feasible mitigation measures that will
16 substantially lessen the significant impact. The City, the County, and other commenters suggested
17 that UCSC implement a mitigation measure tying increases in enrollment to the availability of on-

18

19 campus housing. This measure allows for the University's projected growth while mitigating the
known impacts such growth will have on the surrounding community. In response to comments,
20 UCSC stated that "linking housing and enrollment in lockstep with each other" is not possible
21 because "housing cannot be provided on a scale of individual beds or even dozens of beds," and "it
22| is infeasible to 'tie' enrollment to housing production, simply from the perspective of timing."
23 UCSC has failed to demonstrate that the proposed mitigation measure is actually infeasible. UCSC
24 could very easily "tie" enrollment to housing production by simply ensuring that housing is already
25 constructed and available before approving increases in enrollment.

26 52. UCSC has also failed to fully analyze the impact, and potential mitigation measures,
27 of displacement of City residents based on increased numbers of students and faculty seeking off-
28 campus housing. The EIR finds the LRDP's impact on housing displacement to be less-than-

275197.3 16
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

significant. However, this finding is inadequate because the EIR does not analyze the possible
displacement of people living in the City resulting from proposed enrollment growth should the
University not achieve their housing objectives, which again is reasonably foreseeable.

53. It is no secret the housing market has been in the midst of upheaval, with low

6 inventory and exorbitant prices per-square-foot. This is especially is true in Santa Cruz, which has one
of highest average sale-to-list ratios in the nation. High demand from students for off-campus rental
7 units has contributed to a rental crisis, particularly in light of other pandemic-related factors. (E.g.,
8 https://www.santacruzsentinel.com/2021/09/30/ucsc-professors-studying-santa-cruz-housing-crisis-
9 look-to-eviction-moratorium-expiration/ [noting extreme rise of average fair-market rent in 2008 of

0 10 $1,965 to $3,138 in 2022].) The Guardian recently described Santa Cruz as the "least affordable"

Colantuono Highsmith & Whatley, as 60L7-LOLL6 VINäOJIIVO 'VNEaVSVd 790 E. COLORADO BOULEVARD, SUITE 850 11 small metropolitan area in the county, by some measures. Added demand exacerbates those

12

13 numbers. In fact, due to insufficiency of on-campus housing, UCSC has resorted to "housing"
students in City hotel rooms, which of course also has the negative impact on the City of reducing
14 hotel rooms available for tourists and the negative impact of reducing transient occupancy taxes.

15 (E.g., https://housing.ucsc.edu/gradhousing/alternative-option.html.)The EIR fundamentally fails to
16 assess any of these displacement impacts on the City.

17 Transportation Impacts

18 54. Impacts on transportation go hand-in-hand with housing impacts - increased off-
19 campus housing results in commuter traffic, increased emissions levels, and parking challenges
20 around the UCSC campus.

21 55.

22 For example, given that the EIR's "Vehicle Miles Traveled" ("VMT") analysis relies
on inadequate on-campus housing assumptions, it is likewise inadequate under CEQA. The EIR
23 utilized a threshold of significance of 15 percent VMT below baseline. The EIR concluded that
24 implementation of the LRDP will result in a decrease in total campus VMT per capita from 9.1 to

25 7.9 miles, primarily due to the assumed increase in available on-campus housing. Because the
26 availability and certainty of on-campus housing is unsupported, so too is the claimed reduction in
a 27 VMT as a result of on-campus housing. Since neither the 2021 LRDP or EIR contain binding

28

275197.3 17
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

commitment to provide housing to students and faculty, either as a mitigation measure or otherwise,

2 the EIR is grossly inadequate and severely underestimates impacts to the City.

56. Mitigation Measure 3.16-2 requires UCSC to prepare and implement a Transportation
4 Demand Management (TDM) program which includes performance standards to demonstrate
annually that UCSC is reducing VMT per capita to 15 percent below baseline. The TDM program is
6 required to include annual monitoring and adaptive management of campus-related VMT. The
7 measure also includes a list of potential TDM measures, including parking management tools such

8 as establishing "no net new commuter parking." UCSC is required to initiate preparation of the TDM
9 program within three months of adoption of the LRDP. The measure allows for flexibility regarding
10 how to manage implementation, so long as UCSC is meeting the VMT performance standards. With
2 11 mitigation, the EIR concludes that VMT impacts will be less than significant.
Colantuono, Highsmlth & Whatley, 60LZ-LOLL6 VINROJIIVO 'VNEGVSVd 3LINS 'GAVAIINO8 0GV80100 '3 06L 12 57. The VMT analysis is flawed because it relies on the Regents' unrealistic on-campus
13 housing assumptions. Without a more realistic analysis of the impacts of a growing university
14 without the requisite on-campus housing, the EIR is flawed as an informational document, and
15 UCSC could not have determined that the mitigation measure is adequate to reduce the impact to
16 less than significant.

17 58. Further, CEQA prohibits public agencies from adopting a project where there are
18 "feasible mitigation measures available which would substantially lessen the significant
19 environmental effects" of the project. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21002; CEQA Guidelines, § 15002,
20 subd. (a).) Because UCSC has failed to adopt reasonable mitigation measures related to VMT and

21 other transportation impacts, CEQA requires that the LRDP not be adopted.

22 Water Supply

23 59. The EIR fails to analyze potential impacts, including health, air quality, and
24 recreational impacts, from water supply unavailability due to drought, water scarcity, and rationing
a 25 as a result of the LRDP. The Final EIR states that the EIR did not analyze these potential impacts
26 because they are "speculat[ion] that the LRDP will increase the exposure of individuals to drought
27 conditions." (Final EIR, p. 2-143 [Response L7-158].) Even the 2005 LRDP acknowledged that "[i]n
28 normal and wet years, the water supply system is capable of meeting the needs of the current

18 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 275197.3

1 | population, but even without population increases, the system is highly vulnerable to shortages in

2

3 drought years." (2005 LRDP, p. 25.) The drought and thus water supply conditions are that much
more dire almost 20 years later

4 indeed, the worst in twelve centuries.

5 https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/14/climate/western-drought-megadrought.html)

60. As residents of Santa Cruz County and the state are experiencing right now, drought
6 is an increasingly common condition and will get worse as the climate changes. More frequent
7 shortages are the reasonably foresecable scenario and the LRDP EIR must confront the implications
8 for an already constrained water supply under more frequent drought scenarios with the addition of

Nhatley, The EIR determined that, although there will be adequate water supply from the

12 City's existing water sources in normal water years, during dry water years there will be a

d
4HWsy6IH 'ouonIuDjoS PASADENA, CALIFORNIA 91101-2109 790 E. COLORADO BOULEVARD, SUITE 85 substantial gap between demand and available supplies, which would require the City to secure a

13 new water source. The EIR concluded that the impact is therefore significant. In addition, due to the
14 ongoing dispute regarding whether UCSC is legally entitled to water service to portions of the LRDP
15 outside the City's current water service area, the EIR analyzed alternative water sources to serve
16 those areas of campus and considered how the LRDP would be curtailed if no water source is

17 secured.

18 62. Mitigation Measure 3.17-1a requires UCSC to implement specified measures if and
19 when the City implements drought emergency management measures. Mitigation Measure 3.17-1b
20 requires that, within one year of approval of the LRDP, UCSC must consult with the City regarding

21 the scope of, and initiate, an engineering audit of campus water use. The audit must assess existing
22 | campus water uses, identify opportunities for reducing water consumption, prioritize feasible
23 improvements, and recommend top priority measures for implementation. The measure also
24 provides a list of what must be included in the audit and requires an additional internal audit

1 alternative water sources and the impacts that climate change and drought will have on UCSC's

2 water supply. Again, more frequent shortages are the reasonably foresecable scenario, and the LRDP

3 EIR must confront the implications for an already constrained water supply. This issue is also, again,
4 tied to increased enrollment. As a reasonable mitigation measure, UCSC must link increased

5 enrollment to demonstrating additional water supplies or savings achieved through the audits and

6 improvements in efficiency described in Measure 3.17-1b. Furthermore, as noted in the County's

7 comment letter, the Final EIR does not provide sufficient analysis of the impact the LRDP will have
8 on the karst aquifer and advocates for further analysis in Section 3.10, specifically on water quality
for downstream users. The County urged, despite not being subject to municipal regulations, that
10 karst protection zone standards be considered in the LRDP.
Od 'AeHDuM Wildfire Risks 60L7-LOLL6 VINJOJIIVO 'VNHGYSVd 790 E. COLORADO BOULEVARD, SUITE 85 11

12 64. The EIR failed to adequately analyze or mitigate for potential wildfire risks for the

dd 13 LRDP's proposed development in UCSC's north campus, which is in state-designated high fire
4Hwsy6IH 'ouon;uDIoS 14 hazard severity zone ("HFHSZ"). Given the increased wildfire risk from locating a substantial

15 number of people and new development in a HFHSZ and the increased difficulty in safely

16 evacuating those people, there must be a comprehensive review and revision of the LRDP and/or
17 UCSC's Emergency Response Plan and Emergency Evacuation Plan. Any update to the campus

18 evacuation plan needs City and County input to develop a competent strategy for full campus

19 evacuation.

20 65. UCSC's reliance on Mitigation Measure 3.9-4 to address emergency access and

21 evacuation routes in the event of a wildfire is wholly unacceptable, and, as Morgan Bostic with the
22 Santa Cruz City-County Task Force on UCSC Growth Plans stated, "[s]imply requiring, as
23 mitigation, site specific but unspecified, traffic management plans is inadequate." Further, the City
24 agrees that UCSC must also prepare and adopt a north campus wildfire protection plan prior to any

25 development in the north campus subarea.

26 66. In Section 3.18, "Wildfire," UCSC concludes, without supporting evidence, that its
27 EIR accords with the thresholds of significance based on Appendix G of the State CEQA Guidelines
28 and that development under the 2021 LRDP would not substantially exacerbate wildfire risks or

20 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 275197.3

1 expose project occupants to pollutant concentrations from wildfire or the uncontrolled spread of

2 wildfire. The EIR boldly asserts that adopting a vegetation management plan would reduce the
potentially significant impact of wildfire risk to less than significant. The City agrees that UCSC's
4 Vegetation Management Plan, while necessary, is inadequate to mitigate the impact of the LRDP on 3

5 wildfire risks. The EIR must provide a more robust analysis of alternatives to mitigate these

6 increased risks, as well as the need for emergency access to and evacuation from new development

7 in the north campus subarea.

8 67. A project that will have significant environmental effects may not be approved under

9 CEQA unless the lead agency makes "written findings for each of those significant effects,

20 significant effects the agency shall state in writing the specific reasons to support its action based

21 on the final EIR and/or other information in the record." CEQA Guidelines § 15093(b). It, too. Must

22 be supported by substantial evidence in the record. Id.

23 69. In approving the 2021 LRDP, the University adopted Findings and a Statement of
24 Overriding Considerations that are inadequate as a matter of law in that they are not supported by
25 substantial evidence in the record. As described above in detail, the EIR's Findings fail to meet these
26 legal criteria by failing to appropriately and completely analyze impacts of the University's
27 increased enrollment. The EIR failed to adequately consider the growth-inducing impacts of the
28 Project and increased enrollment, with no adequate plans for immediate development of on-campus

21
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 275197.3

1 | housing, on the City and surrounding areas. The Findings do not provide the reasoning, or analytic
2 route, from facts to conclusions, as required by law.

70. In approving the 2021 LRDP, the University failed to make legally required findings
that certain mitigation measures suggested by the City and other commenters were infeasible, even

5 though those measures could have reduced the Project's admittedly significant impacts to population
6 and housing, as well as other resources.

7 71. The University's verride findings were inadequate and unsupported by substantial
8 evidence. The findings assert that the benefits of the Project outweigh its unavoidable adverse
9 impacts to population and housing, as well as the City's already constrained housing market, but this
10 ignores the true impacts of the increased enrollment on the City and surrounding areas. Additionally,
Whatley, D GE EI IE08 8 4JwsybIH 'ouonjuDIOO 11 60LT-LOLL6 VINEOJIIVO 'VNHGYSVd just as the EIR is fundamentally flawed for its reliance on an unsupported and unreasonable

12 assumption that the University will be able to house 100 percent of its new students on campus to
13 accommodate growth, SO too are the Findings, consideration of mitigation measures, and Statement

14 of Overriding Considerations improper, incomplete, and flawed.

15 72. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion
16 and failed to proceed in the manner required by law by certifying an EIR, making findings, and
17 taking related actions that do not comply with the requirements of CEQA. As such, Respondents'
18 certification of the EIR and approval of the Project must be set aside.
SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION 19

20 (Code of Civil Procedure Sections 1085 and 109.5, as to All Respondents)

21 73. Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in their
22 entirety.

23 74. Respondents proceeded in excess of their jurisdiction and abused their discretion in
24 purporting to approve the 2021 LRDP and its EIR because such approvals violate the University's

others: 25 duties under CEQA in the following respects, among

26 a. Such approvals were not granted in accordance with the procedures required
27 by law;

28 b. Such approvals were not based on the findings required by law;

1 C.

2 Such approvals were not based on, or were contrary to, the evidence in the
record before the University;

3 75. The University ailed to proceed in the manner required by law because it violated
4 | CEQA as alleged herein;

5 76.

6 The University's actions in approving the 2021 LRDP without complying with the
procedures required by CCP section 1085, et seq., exceeded its jurisdiction and constitute a
7 prejudicial abuse of discretion, and therefore are invalid and must be set aside.

8 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

10 (Violation of Education Code, as to All Respondents)

Q (Educ. Code § 67504)

11 77.
Vhatley, 12 entirety. Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in their

8 13 78.
Colantuono, Highsmith 60L7-LOLL6 VINHONIVO 'VNEGVSVd Education Code section 67504(b)(1) provides that the expansion of campus
14 enrollment and facilities may negatively affect the surrounding environment. Thus, this section
15 emphasizes the legislative intent that the University of California sufficiently mitigate significant
16 off-campus impacts related to campus growth and development.

17 79. Respondents violated Section 67504(b)(1) of the Education Code by failing to
18 identify, analyze, and mitigate the significant off-campus impacts of the substantial increase in

19 enrollment. In particular, Respondents violated these provisions by:

20 a.

21 failing to identify the increase in enrollment as part of the Project.

22 b. failing to analyze the impacts of the increased enrollment on the City and the
surrounding area.

23 C.

24 80. failing to mitigate the impacts of the increased enrollment.
Despite the legislative intent expressed in Education Code section 67504(b)(1) that
25 the University sufficiently mitigate the significant off-campus impacts related to campus growth and
26 development, the University failed entirely to consider or adopt mitigation measures to reduce the

27 magnitude of the impacts of its increase in enrollment.

7 An actual controversy and dispute exists between Petitioner and Respondents

8 regarding the nature of the Project at issue, the obligation of Respondents to mitigate the impacts of

7 and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, pursuant to Public Resources Code §§ 21000 et

8 seq. and Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1060, 1085, and 1094.5, against respondents the Regents of the

9 University of California, the University of California at Santa Cruz ("UCSC") President Drake, and
10 Chancellor Larive, to require, among other things that Respondents comply with the California
g 11 Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"). The City challenges Respondents' approval of the 2021
Whatley, 12 Long Range Development Plan ("LRDP") for the UCSC campus (*Project") and certifying of the

d5 13 final environmental impact report ("EIR") for the Project. The City also challenges Respondents'
4IWsyßIH 'OUonUDjOO 60 LZ-LOLL6 VINMOJIIVO 'VNEGVSVd 14 failure to adequately assess the housing displacement impacts from increased enrollment on the
15 UCSC campus, which will result in the likely event that UCSC does not meet the LRDP's housing

16 objectives. The City challenges the unsupported assumption in the LRDP that UCSC will be able to
17 house 100 percent of its new students on campus, and thus contends the EIR fails to properly

18 evaluate several environmental impacts.

19 The CEQA petition may seek any or all of the following relief: alternative and peremptory
20 writs of mandate directing Respondents to vacate and set aside certification of the final EIR;
21 alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing Respondents to comply with the requirements
22 of CEQA and Education Code § 67504, and to take any other action as required by Public Resources

25 under the LRDP, pending full compliance with the requirements of CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines,
26 and State law; a judicial determination and declaration from the court that Respondents' actions in

TOLLING AGREEMENT

This Tolling Agreement ("Tolling Agreement") is entered into this 28th day of September, 2021, by and between the CITY OF SANTA CRUZ, a California municipal corporation ("CITY"), the County of Santa Cruz, a political subdivision of the State of California ("COUNTY"), and The Regents of the University of California, a California public corporation, on behalf of the University of California, Santa Cruz, one of its ten campuses (collectively "UC"). CITY, COUNTY, and UC are sometimes referred to hereinafter individually as "Party" and collectively as "Parties." This Tolling Agreement is entered into by the Parties, by and through their respective legal counsel.

Reçitals

The Parties are entering into this Tolling Agreement with reference to the following facts:

A. On September 29 and 30, 2021, the University of California, Santa Cruz ("UCSC") will submit for approval its 2021 Long Range Development Plan (LRDP) and seek certification of a Final Environmental Impact Report (FEIR) prepared for the LRDP (collectively "the Project").

B. CITY and COUNTY may seek to assert that the Project will have impacts in CITY and COUNTY that have not been addressed properly and may contend that the Project should not be approved by UC on the grounds that the environmental impacts have not been adequately evaluated and disclosed or that the Project otherwise violates the requirements of contract, law or regulation, including but not limited to, the California Environmental Quality Act, Cal. Pub. Res. Code§ 21000 et seq. ("CEQA"), and the CEQA Guidelines (14 Cal. § Code Reg. § 15000 et seq.). UC denies such assertions and maintains that
the Project is adequate and in full compliance with CEQA and other applicable laws and regulations. UC further maintains that, in the course of planning, analyzing and seeking approval of the Project, UC conducted extensive public outreach, attended carefully to the concerns expressed by both on- and off- campus commenters, and incorporated many suggestions and considered options for certain suggestions that could not be feasibly accommodated. The Parties seek to discuss potential resolution of this dispute
and engage in mediation.

C. Subject to applicable law, the statute of limitations for the filing of a lawsuit under CEQA, assuming UC approves the LRDP and certifies the FEIR, may expire as early as October 30, 2021.
The Parties wish to continue to explore the possibility of resolving any such disputes and believe that the possibility of resolution will be enhanced if the Parties have time to engage in alternative dispute resolution before litigation is filed. The Parties therefore wish to toll the running of the applicable statutes of limitations to allow time to pursue informal resolution. At the same time, the Parties, and cach of them, wish to preserve all of their rights and defenses relating to potential litigation regarding the Project, approval of the LRDP and certification of the FEIR by UC.

Apreement

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and conditions set forth in this Tolling
Agreement, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby

1754877vl Page 1 of 5

acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows:

1. This Tolling Agreement shall be effective as of September 30, 2021, or the date the Project is certified, or the date a Notice of Determination concerning the Project is posted or filed, whichever is earlier ("Bffective Date").

2. The Parties hereby toll, for the period from the Effective Date through and including the
earlier of January 24, 2022, or termination of this Tolling Agreement under the terms of this Agreement (the "Tolling Period"), the running of time of any and all legal or equitable statutes of limitations, statutes
of repose, periods of limitation, laches, waiver, estoppel, delay, or any other statutory or equitable time
limitations (collectively 'Statutes of Limitations") arising out of and/or applicable to claims CITY and/or
COUNTY may have against UC (collectively, the "Claims"), associated with or related to the Project. This Tolling Agreement shall be applicable for purposes of any and all Statutes of Limitation during the
Tolling Period and shall preclude any and all defenses based upon the lapse of time occurring during the
period tolled by virtue of this Tolling Agreement. The Parties agree that, as a result of the Tolling
Agreement, the Tolling Period shall not be counted for any purpose in determining the amount of time
that has elapsed before the filing of judicial proccedings on any Claims, and that none of the Parties will seek to assert a statute of limitations defense, or any similar defense, based on the passage of time
during the Tolling Period. If no legal action covered by this Agreement has been filed by the date this Agreement expires or is terminated, either automatically or by written notice of any Party, as provided herein in Section 6, or if this Agreement and the Tolling Period have not been further extended as
provided in Section 7 of this Agreement, any and all applicable statutes of limitations and/or other time
bars begin to run again, but the Tolling Period will not be counted for purposes of calculating any Statutes
of Limitations.

3. This Tolling Agreement is entered into pursuant to section 360.5 of the Code of Civil
Procedure and the authority of Salmon Protection and Watershed Network v. County of Marin (2012) 205
Cal.App.4th 195,

4. This Tolling Agreement does not revive any claims or defenses that may have already expired prior to the date of this Tolling Agreement. In addition, except while tolled during the Tolling
Period, nothing in this Tolling Agreement shall be construed to otherwise limit or relieve any Party of any
applicable duty to exhaust its administrative remedies in connection with any litigation brought relating to

Subject: LRDP NOP Comments

Dear Ms. Carpenter,

The City of Santa Cruz (City) continues to value the partnership it has with the University of California,
Santa Cruz (UCSC) and the many amenities, opportunities, and benefits that UCSC itself and the larger UCSC community bring to the City. As UCSC considers expansion, the City appreciates the opportunity to offer feedback on how said expansion may impact the City, its residents, and its visitors. The City has L9-1
reviewed in the information provided in the UCSC Long Range Development Plan (LDRP) Draft
Environmental Impact Report (EIR) and provides comments as follows.

General Comments.

The timing of proposed mitigations is imperative to minimize negative impacts of future development.
Prior to increasing student enrollment and additional faculty/staff, the EIR should clearly note that the
necessary transportation and housing mitigations, along with other infrastructure needs, will be in place
prior to said increases, not afterwards, so that negative impacts to the environment, the City, and City L9-2
residents are minimized. For instance, increasing the number of students, faculty, and staff without a
coinciding increase in on-campus housing capacity would have different impacts than those studied
under this Draft EIR. While the project anticipates providing housing for 100% of its FTE students over 19,500 and up to 25% of its additional 2200 staff and faculty, UCSC does not control where anyone
chooses to reside. The DEIR has not studied the impacts under a scenario where less than 100% of new enrollment lives on campus a or a significantly smaller portion than 25% of faculty and staff choosing to live off-campus. Additionally, while increases in FTE students, faculty, and staff are analyzed, the number of part time students, faculty, and staff and their impact is unknown. Additional scenarios L9-3
addressing these issues should be studied. Given this need for further analysis, this Draft EIR should further analyze the impacts of the LRDP on such environmental areas as Air Quality, Hydrology and Water Quality, Population and Housing, Public Services, Recreation, Transportation, and Utilities and Service Systems.

Impact-Specific Comments. The following comments relate to the proposed impact analysis sections. I L9-4

3.1 Aesthetics

The City's General Plan states that "views toward Monterrey Bay and the Pacific Ocean provide
orientation and strong sense of identity" and that coastal terraces such as the ones home to UCSC
"afford panoramic views of the city and Monterrey Bay". A view looking south from approximately Viewpoint Location #6 is noted in the City's LCP document (see Attachment 1) as Scenic View location L9-5
and should be analyzed further in the EIR to ensure any impacts to this view are considered.

3.3 Air Quality

As noted above In the general comments, the impacts related to different percentages of students, faculty, and staff living off-campus have not been fully analyzed. If student enrollment increases precede L9-6
increases in on-campus housing capacity, there would be further impacts also not analyzed in this Draft EIR. Additionally, the amount of new housing, if any, built at the Westside Research Park is unknown and that may also affect the air quality analysis as this in a separate location from the rest of the main campus studied in the Draft EIR. It would be ideal to maximize employment on this site and house only L9-7
individuals employed on this site and the Marine Lab campus.
One specific comment relates to Mitigation Measure 3.3-2 and electric vehicle (EV) charging. The Plan's
impact on air quality is significant so the Plan should commit to a specific amount of EV charging stations
constructed at parking lots and should build all new parking spaces as EV charger-ready. These actions L9-8
would better support electric vehicles and cleaner air.

3.5 Biological Resources

The Plan includes 119.1 acres of Redwoods within the possible development zone which is high
number. There is substantial acreage for other sensitive areas as well. With potentially significant F
impacts with respect to biological resources, including many sensitive habitats, what analysis was done L9-9 to minimize development in biologically sensitive areas and maximize development in areas that do not carry the same potential for significant impacts on sensitive habitat?
While the report states that the probability of impacting Burrowing Owls is low, the mitigations are not sufficient to adequately address potential impacts. Namely, one mitigation measure calls for providing a 100-foot buffer between active Burrowing Owl sites and development, and that distance is typically larger to ensure that impacts are mitigated. Biologists typically require significantly larger buffers, L9-10
around 500 feet, so the EIR should increase this buffer to a larger distance in the unlikely event that active Burrowing Owl sites are identified near construction.

Mitigation Measure 3.5-3b in the Draft EIR states that the mitigation would result in no net loss of that compensatory practices resulting in no net loss of habitat of habitat function and the City agrees
function is a vital mitigation measure. However, one possible mitigation option under 3.5-3b is to L9-11
preserve existing sensitive natural communities of equal or better value through a conservation easement at a sufficient ratio to offset the loss of habitat function. Further analysis should be included

on this mitigation option. Does it relate to both plant and animal life? If so, an environmental easement
may work better for some species more than others. An additional mitigation could also include L9-11
providing funds to non-profit organizations whose work can also directly compensate for habitat loss cont.

and impacts.

3.10 Hydrology and Water Quality
While the DEIR provides a fairly detailed discussion of historic karst geologic and hydrogeologic issues, it T is relatively silent on recent developments in natural resource protection planning related to karst. Since
the previous environmental review process related to the UCSC LRDP, the San Lorenzo River has been
listed for temperature impairment under the Clean Water Act, the City has become obligated to provide
additional instream flow for the protection of special-status species, and development of County of L9-12

Santa Cruz Karst Protection Zone policies has begun.
Specifically, the following issues should be further evaluated in the Final EIR:
Relationship of the area proposed for potential groundwater development to the regional karst - aquifer dynamics warrants more discussion in Chapter 3.10 of the DEIR. The DEIR states: "the assignment of surface water runoff to particular watershed is based on topographic features
of the main residential campus; however, flows captured by the natural subsurface karst aquifer
drainage system or by the UC Santa Cruz storm water drainage system may be transferred from
one watershed to another in some cases." This is a very important and valid point that
understandably exacerbates the evaluation of impacts of the proposed project. On a related note, there have been several significant rainfall years (1998, 2017) and surface runoff from the University has likely changed dramatically since the hydrogeologic investigation in 1989. There is
the potential that subsurface flow dynamics have also changed since that time. Furthermore, it L9-13
also appears that the historic hydrogeologic studies did not identify all karst features in the vicinity; therefore, the evaluation of karst-related impacts is incomplete. For example, seeps at
the headwaters of Redwood Creek - a significant lower San Lorenzo River tributary - do not
appear to be identified. Finally, there were field and mapping studies performed in order to
support recent County of Santa Cruz karst protection efforts that may provide additional background on hydrogeologic dynamics in the region (Nolan 2016). Reference to them in Chapter 3.10 should be included, if only for completeness' sake.
Water pollution impacts related to stormwater discharge into the karst aquifer and receiving
waters' water quality and increased stormwater discharge effects on karst aquifer morphology T
and flow paths warrant further evaluation in Chapter 3.10. The DEIR clearly states that "New
development under the 2021 LRDP could potentially cause new runoff to be diverted to
sinkholes." Discharge of any additional runoff could be considered significant in the context of
karst protection - especially since some new development is proposed for the area immediately
upgradient of the Pogonip Springs. While the DEIR focuses on erosion, additional flow into sinkholes can cause significant changes to flow patterns underground. Communication with L9-14

surface flow to the karst aquifer is very similar to surface water system - whereby polluted runoff is effectively directly discharged to receiving waters. Given the aforementioned difficulty in understanding subsurface hydrogeologic dynamics and incomplete data on karst features, the analysis of impacts - specifically with regard to the lower San Lorenzo River and its associated beneficial uses needs further evaluation.

County of Santa Cruz Karst Protection Zone policies warrant exploration in Chapter 3.11. These policies - while in their infancy - have recently begun to be implemented in the County code and should be evaluated for relevance to the project. For more information please see the L9-15
following link:
http://santacruzcountyca.iqm2.com/Citizens/Detail_LegiFile.aspx?ID=2578&highlightTerms=kar
st
Potential use of karst-derived groundwater warrants exploration in Chapter 3.11. As the DEIR
correctly states repeatedly, karst groundwater often flows through solution channels. Given the
stark differences in production potential of the various wells (as reported in the DEIR and also as anecdotally accounted by Dr. Gerald Weber), it is quite likely that monitoring wells identified for groundwater extraction potential on the campus are located within these solution channels. Given that California Water Law requires valid water rights in order to put water that flows L9-16
through confined channels into beneficial use, the status of the San Lorenzo River and tributaries as a fully-appropriated system (with regard to water rights), and the potential impacts on other, senior water rights holders in areas affected by reduction in flow from the
karst aquifer underlying the University (such as the City of Santa Cruz), evaluation of the University's water rights obligations seems appropriate. Groundwater extraction impacts on lower San Lorenzo River biotic resources warrants further evaluation in Chapter 3.5. Dry season and dry year hydrology, as well as dry season water temperatures in the lower river can be limiting to special-status species such as coho salmon and steelhead trout. Again, given the aforementioned difficulty in understanding subsurface L9-17
hydrogeologic dynamics and incomplete data on karst features, the analysis of impacts - specifically with regard to the lower San Lorenzo River instream flows and temperature dynamics - needs further evaluation.
Impacts on the City of Santa Cruz water system related to potential reduction in karst springs discharge to the lower San Lorenzo River also seems warranted in Chapter 3.17. Again, the San Lorenzo River is a fully-appropriated stream (with regard to water rights) during the dry season. Reduction in flow from Pogonip and Redwood Creeks (as well as smaller karst-derived tributary
flows to the lower San Lorenzo River) could have negative effects on the City's ability to divert at L9-18
our primary diversion at Tait Street (also known as the Tait Diversion or Crossing Street Diversion). While it may be that the proposed use of groundwater on campus is ultimately determined to have negligible effects on San Lorenzo River flows and water quality, it is not clear from the existing analysis that is so.

Statistical Approach to Water Years T
Much of the DEIR's statistical analysis related to groundwater and surface water monitoring is based on
averaging water monitoring data across all years and calculating standard deviations around these comprehensive averages. While averaging available data is useful for comparing annual data to a standard (e.g. rainfall, groundwater levels, stream flow), it is not a good measure of how highly variable
systems operate.
L9-19 Historically, rainfall in California is highly variable from year to year. In the 124 years that the State has collected rainfall data, only two of those years have exhibited "average" rainfall. California precipitation tends to fluctuate between wet water years that recharge groundwater and dry water years where little or no groundwater recharge occurs. Further, climate science research from UC Berkley Lab (and elsewhere) indicates that California's already variable rainfall patterns are likely to become even more variable in the future.

We recommend the DEIR's analysis of existing groundwater and surface water monitoring data include
additional analysis that is grouped and analyzed by water year (wet, normal, dry and very dry). This
additional analysis will provide a more nuanced range of groundwater levels and insight into their interrelationship with surface water by water year types. This more nuanced analysis will provide L9-19

greater insight into the extremes for rainfall and runoff, greater insight into the management of cont.

groundwater levels, and how the management of groundwater pumping changes surface water flows and the habitats that depend on interconnected springs and streams.

We also recommend the DEIR's proposed mitigation measures for groundwater pumping monitoring be
revised to rely on these recommended water year calculations. Specifically, we request that any
potential groundwater pumping strategy and mitigation monitoring be based on analysis of available historic data by water year type as it corresponds to the current water year (e.g. wet water year
pumping is compared to wet water year statistical averages). This will ensure that the analysis of potential groundwater pumping in wet years fits within the standard deviations for wet water years, rather than the artificially low average that incorporates wet and dry years. This will also allow L9-20
additional pumping in dry water years based on the mean average and standard deviations for dry water
years. This revised pumping and mitigation monitoring strategy would be less likely to impact surface
water flows beyond what is experienced during natural climate processes. The goal being to ensure that the proposed project incorporates groundwater and surface water monitoring protocols as mitigations
that are protective of the natural systems that rely on groundwater, including areas with interconnected surface waters located within the City.

Impact 3.10-3 Alteration of Drainage Patterns and Increased Runoff
The DEIR provides average rainfall data on p. 3.10-9 but does not include an appendix to support this rainfall analysis. As discussed above, rainfall in California is highly variable and planning for runoff in an
average year is different than planning for runoff in a wet year. While flooding is not expected in this
area of the City, the DEIR should include its rainfall analysis including the statistical approach used to L9-21
analyze this rainfall data. More detailed information is needed for wet years to determine more if there
is adequate stormwater retention and storm drain capacity to handle wet year flows, especially since
climate change is projected to lead to more rainfall variability and more severe storms.

Impact 3.10-4 Flood-Related Impacts
The DEIR identifies karst geology on the central and lower campus and states that the natural karst sinkholes and swallow holes convey surface flows to off-campus springs. The analysis of potential flooding on campus relies on these natural features to address potential flood impacts and on state required rainfall retention related to new construction to limit runoff. The DEIR also relies on drainage
improvements made since above normal rainfall events in 2003 & 2004 to divert storm flows away from
certain sinkholes and swallow holes where flooding had occurred on campus during those 2003/2004
storm events.
L9-22
The DEIR states that additional LRDP related construction on campus will lead to additional storm related runoff. The DEIR goes on to state that, "..regulatory compliance and programmatic elements in place for new development in the LRDP area are designed to reduce runoff, peak flows and impacts to water quality and, therefore, implementation of the 2021 LRDP would result in a less-than-significant impact."

UCSC is located on a hill within the City of Santa is Cruz and is tied into City provided wastewater and stormwater infrastructure. The 40 to 50 sinkholes and swallow holes are also connected to springs and

seep fed streams located off campus within the City and unincorporated County. While the DEIR
discusses potential impacts on campus, it does not provide information on increased runoff that would
flow into the City as surface runoff, into its wastewater or stormwater infrastructure, or to the
interconnected springs and streams. L9-22
cont.
The DEIR should be revised to include runoff projections for storms from wet water years that would
allow the City to evaluate the potential impacts in the City from additional runoff related to the
proposed project's potential impact on City infrastructure.

Karst Aguifer Management
The DEIR should recommend mitigations that increase the knowledge needed to properly manage any
potential groundwater pumping in this karst aquifer: (1) the DEIR should recommend mitigations that
will expand understanding of the interrelationship between groundwater and surface springs that would
inform and improve resource management, (2) the DEIR should evaluate biological resources that
depend on the interconnected springs/streams supported by groundwater and potentially impacted by L9-23
groundwater pumping both on and off campus, and (3) the DEIR should recommend a process to
develop groundwater sustainability standards that are protective of surface water resources. This
process should include the City of Santa Cruz and the County of Santa Cruz, where interconnected
springs/streams are located. The process should also identify any relevant resource agencies and other
partner agencies involved in protecting the identified biological resources.

Groundwater Mitigation Measures
Based the complex geology involved in karst aquifers, the DEIR recommends groundwater and spring
monitoring that is inadequate to protect groundwater and surface water resources from potential
groundwater extraction related to the proposed project. The DEIR recommends annual groundwater
monitoring of the production well only when groundwater is actually being produced.

In karst systems, continuous monitoring is often used to understand water levels, static reserves, and
groundwater recharge. If water is extracted from the karst aquifer, the DEIR monitoring program should include continuous monitoring to confirm that any water extracted from the karst aquifer during the dry
season (static reserves) is regularly replenished during periods of aquifer recharge. This continuous
monitoring is necessary to adequately understand the karst aquifer, groundwater pumping's effects on L9-24

static water levels, the sustainability of the karst system to recharge naturally during sustained and/or
periodic groundwater withdrawals in order to protect this groundwater resource from depletion. It
would also provide information that could be useful to develop the karst aquifer as a storage reserve
when excess water is available.

The DEIR should be revised to include continuous groundwater monitoring that is reviewed at least
quarterly to increase understanding of the complex karst aquifer system as it responds to potential groundwater pumping and recharge in both wet and dry years.

Spring Monitoring and Interconnected Streams
The DEIR should be clarified to discuss the type and location of ongoing surface water monitoring proposed, should include data collection that address both water quality and water quantity at these interconnected springs. This mitigation monitoring should include biological assessment of the habitat L9-25
values supported by groundwater at interconnected springs and streams located both on campus and off campus. These mitigations should be based upon statistical information developed based on the separate analysis of data from wet water years and dry water years, as discussed above. This is

especially important because the biggest shortfalls are likely to occur during single and multi-year
droughts. L9-25

Significance Criteria for Groundwater and Surface Water Depletions cont.

The DEIR'S identified significance thresholds for the depletion of groundwater and interconnected surface water states: "If monitoring of water levels and spring flows indicates that UC Santa Cruz -

extraction of groundwater is contributing to a net deficit in aquifer volume, as indicated by a substantial
decrease in average base flow water levels in any monitored wells or a substantial reduction of base
flows in monitored springs, the campus will terminate or reduce its use of groundwater from the aquifer.
A substantial decrease shall constitute observations of a continual decreasing trend in base groundwater
water levels over a 3-5 year period that includes both wetter and drier years coupled with a decrease in
spring base flow conditions, beyond the standard deviation for any given spring, for a corresponding
rainfall season. The average base water levels and base flows in springs will be defined through a
statistical analysis of historic data, with consideration of associated seasonal rainfall." (emphasis added).

The Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) provides a comparable legal framework to
analyze significance criteria related to groundwater pumping and surface water impacts, which L9-26

addresses both groundwater and surface water sustainability planning. The SGMA allows for the local
identification of significance criteria when defining what is sustainable to protect an identified resource. However, these locally defined significance criteria must actually be protective of the resource(s) in
question.

The significance criteria for groundwater and surface water depletions should be linked to the protected
resources. For groundwater, water levels are linked to the resources supported, this could be local well users to ensure that their well continue to produce after the university begins pumping the aquifer. For
surface water it is related to the human and biological systems that use the water.

The DEIR should be revised to propose mitigations that will both identify existing water uses and users
and develop significance criteria that protects those uses.

The Biological Resources section of the DEIR provides no information on the plants and animals
supported by interconnected springs off campus, in the City and County areas, that could be impacted
by on campus groundwater production. Biological mitigations recommend "Project-Level Biological
Reconnaissance for Sensitive Species and Habitats Surveys" to understand and protect the sensitive
species potentially impacted by the proposed project.

These types of biological surveys should also be included at section 3.10-5b as mitigation to evaluate L9-27

surface water resources and protect the habitats and species that rely on these interconnected springs.
This additionaf detail is needed to determine if the significance criteria outlined in the DEIR is likely to be
protective of the resources in question. This is especially important considering that groundwater
extraction is most likely during single and multi-year droughts when surface water resources are least
available to natural systems.

3.13 Population and Housing

Additional information regarding the University's commitment to providing housing for faculty and staff
is needed. The Draft states that 100% of new students enrolled beyond 19,500 and up to 25% of the
2,220 full time equivalent faculty/staff members will be housed on-campus. Despite the Draft EIR
studying these percentages of groups being housed on-campus, it fails to adequately evaluate the
impacts of all new students, faculty, and staff being housed off-campus. UCSC does not currently have
mandatory on-campus residence requirements, so students, faculty, and staff can live wherever they L9-28 like despite the analyzed percentages. When students, faculty, and staff are not housed on-campus, they create more impacts in the City on such things as transportation, housing demand/cost, water use, etc. In order to adequately assess the impacts of the project, the percentage of students, faculty, and
staff living on-campus will need to be clearly established, such as through on-campus living mandates, or
alternative percentages of on-campus residents should be analyzed, which would likely result in new or
different impacts.

The Draft EIR also does not propose tying the development and provision of on-campus housing to increases in students, faculty, and staff. There could be a large gap (possibly many years) between L
student, faculty, and staff growth and on-campus housing development, and neither the EIR nor the
LRDP mandates that housing be built and occupied prior to enrollment growth. This scenario would L9-29
create impacts to the City of Santa Cruz that have not been analyzed or mitigated. UCSC should commit
to providing a specific amount of on-campus housing prior to expansions of students, faculty, and staff
members, as this will allow for a more accurate assessment of the project's impacts.
The Draft EIR states that proposed and entitled housing development in the City's pipeline adequately
mitigates for the housing demand created by students, faculty, and staff that choose to live off-campus.
Some housing developments have been approved for years, but have not been constructed (e.g., the 32-
unit, mixed use project at the southeast corner of Soquel and Hageman Avenues was approved four
years ago but has not yet pursued building permits). The construction of most projects is out of the City's control and cannot be guaranteed. While significant percentages of new units produced in the City are affordable (due in large part to City inclusionary requirements coupled with the City's support for 100% affordable projects), students are not as likely to live in new, market-rate housing due to cost. While some filtering can occur as newly constructed housing becomes available, this process can take L9-30
years and relies on continuous production of housing both within the City and regionally, something that cannot be guaranteed, so more affordable housing may not be readily available to meet the needs of
student growth just because new housing development is in the pipeline. This scenario could place further demand on housing in the City, particularly on the limited supply of affordable housing. An
ongoing contribution to the City's Affordable Housing Trust Fund should be provided to offset the
increased housing demand from students, faculty, and staff in the City, particularly to offset the demands for affordable housing stock in the City.

The Draft EIR presents conflicting viewpoints on vacancy. Given that the City of Santa Cruz is the closest city to UCSC, using the County-wide 2020 Department of Finance (DOF) vacancy rate of 7.8% does not
study). That accurately reflect the housing pressure on the City itself (a lower rate of 5.6% in the same study also does not take into account the loss of approximately 1,000 units in the County due to the CZU Fire Complex. Additionally, HUD data from 2019 is also referenced and shows a vacancy rate of 1.9% in L9-31
the County. The report states that based on a number of factors including vacation home counting, the DOF vacancy rate is possibly not accurate and that is the vacancy rate is likely lower. The current American Community Survey (ACS) data estimates a County of Santa Cruz rental vacancy rate of 2.0% and a

homeowner vacancy rate of 0.4%, similarly low as the HUD data provided. The HUD and ACS data shows
an extremely low housing vacancy situation that could be given more weight than the DOF vacancy rate
in the Draft EIR analysis. The Draft EIR uses the higher DOF vacancy rate to support its position that there is a less than significant impact on off-campus housing when there is lower vacancy data from two other sources. Increases in student, faculty, and staff populations coupled with low vacancy rate places
further pressure on housing, especially when housing that might be available for students may not be L9-31
affordable. These potential housing shortages could force students to live further from campus, cont.
increasing impacts to transportation and air quality. Housing shortages could be further compounded if UCSC does not tie on-campus housing to its enrollment growth, because if it the two are not linked, there could be years where there is no on-campus housing available for new students, despite additional enrollment and associated demand for housing. This would create additional growth
pressure in the City.

The increase in students, faculty, and staff will create increased demand for housing off-campus. Most of that demand will fall on nearby cities, especially Santa Cruz. While this demand for housing may generate a housing market response and the construction of new housing, as mentioned above, there
will likely be times when housing development and demand are not in sync. These will be times of far
greater demand and pressure on the Santa Cruz housing market. This could have impacts on existing
residents due to rent increases to meet the increased demand. Rent increases or even the construction
of new housing could also cause displacement. These impacts should be addressed in the Draft EIR.

The exact location of the new housing is unknown, so it is difficult to assess specific impacts. For
instance, housing located at the Westside Research Park could have different impacts to transportation
and parks than housing located on the main campus. Studies also show that employment and housing in closer proximity generates less travel demand. Further, jobs in proximity to transit support transit ridership more so than housing in proximity to transit, due in part to the "last mile quandary," which
speaks to people being able to drive to a transit starting point but having more challenges in navigating L9-32

the transit-station-to-destination end point. Given the Regional Transportation Commission's recent
vote to support rail transit along the rail corridor and the adjacency of the Westside Research Park to
said rail line, the City encourages UCSC to maximize employment opportunities on the Westside
Research Park as a means to promote future transit use. If housing is considered at that location in
addition to the employment uses, then the occupants should be limited to employees and students who
work at or study at the Westside Research Park and the nearby marine lab as a means to maximize
active transportation options (biking, walking, etc.) for those residents. Similarly, the provision of faculty and staff housing on-campus that houses greater than 25% of the new faculty and staff growth could result in fewer negative environmental effects experienced by the City and its residents, and the
EIR should consider a project or alternative that provides on-campus housing for a higher percentage a of
its workforce.

The types of housing to be developed for students, faculty, and staff are not outlined in the Draft EIR either. Mixed-use housing with additional amenities on the ground will likely reduce trips and overall impacts. Even horizontal mixed-use development would allow for an increased relationship between where students, faculty, and staff may live and work. This could be especially true for the Westside L9-33 Research Park area which is more isolated from many campus amenities. The EIR should clearly specify the details of the potential residential uses, how/by whom they will be used, and the resulting environmental impacts.

The Draft EIR speaks to analysis of full time equivalent (FTE) students and FTE faculty/staff and a
definition of FTE is provided in Footnote 1. However, it is not clear how this definition considers F
students, faculty, staff who are not full time. Students, faculty, and staff working part time are more likely to live off-campus which may create greater impacts. For instance, two students that are half-time
and commuting into the main campus may have generate greater impacts to traffic, air quality, etc. than L9-34
one student living on campus even though they are both considered 1 FTE. The EIR should clearly identify how impacts from all new students, faculty, and staff are assessed. If the FTE analysis does not address this discrepancy in potential impacts, an alternative measure should seek to quantify the
increase in impacts under such a scenario and include an evaluation of the impacts in the EIR.

3.14 Public Services

As discussed in the Housing and Population section, the Draft EIR should further analyze potential
impacts caused by off-campus population increases by students, faculty, and staff of UCSC. While housing may be provided for 100% of new student enrollment over 19,500, it does not address
alternatives where fewer than 100% of new students live on campus, as is likely, especially if on-campus housing growth is not tied to enrollment and if on-campus living is not required of certain students.
For instance, the Draft EIR only addresses potential impacts to emergency services due to the increase in the number of vehicles on-campus while there could be further impacts off-campus as well. With an
increase in campus population and concurrent increase in traffic congestion, emergency vehicle access
could be affected and in an increase in response times could result. To mitigate this impact, the Public
Services section of the EIR should address the following access and response needs:
All traffic signals installed on campus shall be outfitted with a Santa Cruz City Fire Department
compatible Opticom Emergency Vehicle Traffic Pre-Emption (Opticom) system. This applies to future signals as well as the existing traffic signals already in use on campus. Bicycle/pedestrian paths should be wide enough and strong enough to support emergency
vehicles. Currently there are a number of paths that do not a support Emergency Vehicle Access L9-35 (EVA), which significantly delays emergency response.
Provide for EVA to all new and renovated buildings. Allow adequate approach and egress routes
as determined by the Fire Marshal.
Ensure elevators installed in new and renovated buildings are large enough to accommodate a
medical gurney in the flat/level position along with the emergency response personnel.
Turnouts, turn pockets, cut outs, lane widths, number of lanes, islands, and lane separators
should all be evaluated in terms of emergency vehicle requirements.
Address the impact of radio coverage and discuss the need for in-building radio and cellular communications for emergency response.
The existing on-campus fire station has reached end-of-life for functionality and will not accommodate additional staffing or equipment. The City does not own the station, nor has a new fire station site been identified on campus. The construction of a new fire station should be tied to specific development and the EIR should address the criteria that will be used for the discussion of mitigating the impacts of development.

3.15 Recreation

In addition to world-class education, students, faculty, and staff are drawn to UCSC because of its access to world-class recreation activities. Hiking, beaches, and countless opens spaces are located near the university and many of these facilities are maintained by the City. Whether students, faculty, and staff live on campus or not, an increase in these populations will result in an increase in City park usage. This increase in park usage will have deleterious effects on the park system if this impact is not properly mitigated.

The Draft EIR states that there is a less than significant impact to recreation and that UCSC has no obligation to mitigate any impacts as they would be paid through off-campus development fees. This is not a satisfactory analysis of the impacts. For one, any students living on-campus are still highly likely to L9-36
use City-maintained parks, especially trails located near campus and beaches, so simply providing additional recreation space on-campus does not mitigate this off-campus impact to City recreation facilities. Additionally, students living off-campus are more likely to establish themselves in crowded living situations beyond the original intent of the housing unit (for instance, two or three individuals to a bedroom). The effect is two-fold: 1) a crowded living situation increases the need for one to seek open space, and 2} any park impact fee derived from off-campus development fails to mitigate for a higher density of people living in a unit than originally intended. The increase in campus population will impact the City park system beyond what the Draft EIR has analyzed and therefore, a more complete analysis in the EIR is required.

Given the importance of properly maintaining parks for UCSC students, faculty, and staff, as well as residents of the City of Santa Cruz, the City has determined that a City park impact fee on new residential development should be required. Funds from this impact fee would be used for a City parks system that serves all residents of the area, including students who live both on- and off-campus.
UCSC should evaluate how an impact fee could be incorporated into student fees or some other manner to support the maintenance of existing parks and services. Students currently pay a recreation fee as part of their tuition. This support on-campus recreational amenities, facilities, and programming (via OPERS or now called Athletics and Recreation). The City would like the opportunity work with UCSC on a Joint Powers Authority (JPA) or similar mechanism that would clearly define the UCSC scope of recreation facilities and services and define the City's scope. Students currently pay fees to UCSC but use City amenities, perhaps even more than those on campus. Impact fees could help development of new park assets potentially needed for increased park demand. Currently, the real need is funding to L9-37
maintain the existing park system, which will be used more with an increase in UCSC students, faculty,
and staff, so a parks impact fee to the City represents a reasonable mitigation request. Below are some
ways this fee could be instituted:
O University of California allows individual campuses to establish unique compulsory fees per the following policy: PACAOS-80: Compulsory Campus-Based Student Fees (ucop.edu). There is a set process similar to public ballot measure, but within the UCSC system only.
O It is common for universities in California and other states to incorporate a fee for a specific purpose (e.g., building a new rec center or for athletics, etc.). Perhaps it could be deemed an "environmental preservation fee" as part of tuition fees.
• The National Recreation and Parks Association (NRPA) sets standards for Parks and Recreation services: nrpa-agency-performance-review.pdf. If UCSC or the University of California system has parks and recreation standards, a nexus between the population increases and park and

recreation service could be more easily determined. The City has parks and recreation service L9-37
standards that will be affected as the result of increased population and use of City parks. cont.

3.16 Transportation

A key transportation goal (M2) in the City's General Plan is to provide... "A safe, sustainable, efficient,
adaptive, and accessible transportation system". The increase in student, faculty, and staff populations will have impacts on transportation, in a broader environmental sense and on the City's ability to achieve and maintain that goal.

While SB 743 eliminates Level of Service (LOS) as a CEQA impact, the City still maintains some LOS L9-38
policies in order to maintain a safe and efficient transportation system. UCSC should coordinate with the City to determine critical intersections impacted by the LRDP and analyze LOS impacts at those critical intersections in addition to the Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) analysis. The previous LRDP included
mitigation measures in this same way to provide traffic impact fees to the City and institute a
monitoring program and should continue to do so.

As mentioned in other sections, the impacts of different proportions of increased student population living off-campus has not been adequately analyzed especially if on-campus housing growth is not tied to enrollment and if on-campus living is not required of certain students. The Draft EIR states that
providing housing for all new students on campus would reduce traffic concerns. However, the
transportation analysis provided indicates that the trip generation rate for resident students is higher than that of commuter students. This is in conflict with the comments made that providing housing for
all new students would reduce traffic concerns. The analysis also identified a significant impact in the L9-39

VMT analysis per worker with TSM mitigation as proposed in response. While the University has done a
good job to date implementing strategies to reduce trips, the City believes these measures may have
reached their maximum potential. Please provide additional analysis to support the TSM measures as a
satisfactory mitigation response.

The expansion of students, faculty and staff, as well as facilities, special events (open lectures, sporting
events, etc.), and new classes may attract more individuals who enroll/participate in continuing
education, who visit those living on campus, who attend the special events, or who otherwise are drawn
to the campus as a result of its expansion. The methodology utilized in the EIR should analyze not only L9-40
the impacts of additional students, faculty, and staff but should also analyze any impacts (e.g., vehicle
trips) associated with the above-described potential additional usage.

The transportation analysis does not fully consider areas outside of the main campus such as Westside Research Park. In focusing only on the main campus, system-wide travel associated with UCSC growth is not described. It is also not clear whether the employment numbers used in the analysis apply only to the campus or if they reflect the total UCSC employment which is disaggregated to various areas in the
County such as at the Research Park, Coastal Science center, and Scotts Valley offices. This shift in L9-41
employment location has been a major reason why the traffic volumes at the main entrances to the University have been reduced over the years. If the actual employee volume on the main campus is in fact less, then the trip generation rate used for employees would be higher and affect the subsequent analysis.

The City has had previous concerns with the trip generation rates established by the University. The transportation analysis in the Draft EIR refers to a 2017 Tool developed by UCSC which established trip F
is generation rates. This tool is not included in the appendices, so the City is unable to review these trip
generation rates and determined if they are improved over ones previously used. This information L9-42
should be included in the EIR. Additionally, signal is proposed for the intersection of Western Drive and
High Street and there is no analysis provided to warrant such a proposal. Please provide this in the EIR.

Finally, the City would like more analysis on whether the LRDP growth in transit in demands conflicts with
Metro Plans. A near 50% increase in transit demand to the main campus will significantly affect Metro
service and coordination is needed to ensure service levels meet the increased demand. The LRDP
proposes identification of new trail connections south of the main residential campus to provide access L9-43
to Westside Research Park and Coastal Science Campus as a proposed improvement and those are not identified in the Draft EIR.

3.17 Utilities and Service Systems

We understand the conclusion of significant and unavoidable impact to water supply because, Water Supply Impacts

although there is adequate water supply from the City's existing water sources in normal water years, during single and multiple dry water year conditions, there is a potential gap between demand and available supply, which would require the City to secure new water sources. As you are aware, the City is
is planning for new sources of water and is currently implementing the Water Supply Augmentation Plan that was developed by the Water Supply Advisory Committee. It is important to understand that the is L9-44
City's need to secure new sources of water is not dependent on growth of the UCSC campus or future projected demand increases. Even if demand were not forecast to increase, new sources of water are
needed to address existing potential shortages during dry years. Furthermore, demand associated with this project, or additional growth in local demand, is not a significant factor in sizing of such future projects because sizing of these projects is being primarily driven by climate change and associated
uncertainty surrounding future hydrological conditions.

Additionally, the City is in the process of preparing the 2020 Urban Water Management Plan which will
incorporate demand projections from the 2021 LRDP into overall projected City demands. It is noted F
that the UCSC demand forecast in the 2021 LRDP is significantly lower than that projected in the 2005 LRDP which was used as the basis of the 2015 Urban Water Management Plan. We appreciate the
commitment that University leadership has made to ongoing water conservation, including working with L9-45
the City water department to develop an engineering analysis to further reduce water demand.
We recommend an ongoing and collaborative effort between the City and UCSC to identify the most
efficient ways to use, reuse, recycle, and store water so that the proposed project is as water efficient as
possible.

The section referring to the "The Water Rights Conformance Project for Water Rights and Entitlements", Water Supply Constraints

should reference the Santa Cruz Water Rights Project. An Initial Study and Notice of Preparation for the Santa Cruz Water Rights Project were released is in 2018, and a Draft EIR is expected to be circulated for L9-46
public review in spring 2021. The scope of this project extends beyond direct diversion for the City's Felton and Newell Creek water rights. Because the City's water rights were granted more than 50 years

ago, they are out-of-date with current needs and lack flexibility that would ensure the Water Department can provide supply reliability, protect fish populations, and partner with neighboring water L9-46
cont. agencies to improve regional water supply reliability.

Water Supply Augmentation Plan
The City continues to pursue and make progress on the implementation of the Water Supply Augmentation Plan developed by the Water Supply Advisory Committee. A report detailing progress on implementation of the Water Supply Augmentation Plan is presented quarterly to the City Water Commission, with the most recent quarterly report presented at the Water Commission meeting L9-47
January 4, 2021. The report can be found beginning on page 15 of the PDF here:
https://ecm.cityofsantacruz.com/OnBaseAgendaOnline/Documents/Downloadfile/Water_Commission
1607 Agenda Packet 1 4 2021 7 00 00 PM.pdf?documentType=5&meetingld=1607&isAttachment=
True.

Water Shortage Contingency Plan Please note that the City adopted an Updated Interim Water Shortage Contingency Plan in February 2021, replacing the 2009 Water shortage Contingency Plan referenced in the Draft EIR. The Plan is L9-48
available here on the City's website here:
https://www.cityofsantacruz.com/home/showpublisheddocument?id=83118.

Mitigation Measure 3.17-1a: Require Implementation of Measures Consistent with City Drought
Measures
The DEIR recommends water conservation and reuse measures to reduce project impacts relate to its demand for potable water from the City of Santa Cruz. However, the DEIR links these proposed
mitigation measures to a time, "If and when the City of Santa Cruz implements drought emergency
management measures..."

Mitigation Measure 3.17-1a should be revised to tie water conservation, reuse, and recycling measures to project design and implementation, not the City's implementation of water emergency management measures. Water conservation and water recycling measures are best implemented when incorporated L9-49
into the facility design stage, when it is easiest to provide water efficient fixtures, sustainable/native landscape materials, and separate pipes to carry potable and recycled water.
Mitigation Measure 3.17-1a should also be revised to provide more detail regarding monitoring and reporting related to development and use of on campus groundwater. Use of the existing groundwater supply well in Jordan Gulch, if undertaken, should comply with the recommendations for biological monitoring at interconnected springs both on and off campus, and groundwater/surface water monitoring protocols discussed at Mitigation Measure 3.10-5b above.

Please see the following comments on the Water Supply Assessment The DEIR includes a Water Supply Assessment (WSA) to stand in for the WSA that the City would ordinarily be required to prepare as the public water system that will supply [at least a portion of] the proposed project. (Wat. Code § 10910(a)-(c).) WSA's are required under state law for a variety of development projects that are likely to increase water demand on the public water system serving the L9-50
project (Wat. Code § 10912(a)). WSA's are required to assess the projects water demand, available water supplies, and if water is not available for the project, the cost to obtain and develop the additional supplies required to serve the proposed project.

Because a portion of the UCSC campus where development is proposed is outside the City's existing
water service boundary, it is not clear that the WSA was prepared following the law. Under state law, when a proposed project is outside the boundaries of water service agency the WSA must be prepared
after consultation with the Local Agency Formation Commission, and any public water system adjacent
to the proposed project site. (Wat. Code § 10910(b).)

The DEIR should be revised to indicate whether and how UCSC consulted with the City, other L9-50

neighboring water agencies, and the Local Agency Formation Commission in relation to the preparation cont.

of its WSA as required when an entity other than the water service provider prepares the WSA for an
area outside the boundaries of an existing water system.

This concludes the comments from the City of Santa Cruz. We look forward to working with you to
resolve the points contained herein. Feel free to reach out to us should you have any questions.

Sincerely,

Lee Butler
Director of Planning & Community Development

Regents of' the University of Califomia

Re:

Dear Chair Estaluno and
Sepiember 26, 2021 Bourd of Regents.

This letter provides written comments on agenda item number F4 at the Scptember 28-30, 2021 mecting of the Regents of the University of California. Thank you for providing the City with the Final Environmental Impact Report (EIR), ineluding responses to our March 8, 2021 comment leuter, for the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) 2021 Long Range Development Plun (2021 LRDP or LRDP). In our comment letter on the DraN EIR, we described o multitude of concerns relating to the project. Unfortunately, the Final EIR does not resolve our concemns, and the EIR remains deficient under the Californta Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) (Pub. Resources Code. $ 21000 et seq-).

Aa an initial matter, the City respectfully requests that UCSC defer action on certification of the EJR to u luter date, in order to provide sufficient time for the City nnd othere to thoroughly review and consider the Final EIR, including responses to comments. UCSC provided the City with the Final EIR, which consists ofover 1,400 pages, on the afternoon of Wednesday, September 15, 2021, just two weeks prior to the University of California Board of Kegents' (Board of Regents) scheduled hearing vn the projuct Additionally, the Board of Regents Guidelines for Public Comment indicate that, with regaxd to written communications,
"[ejorrespondence addressing items on the agenda of the Board of Regents ... must be received
by the Office of the Sceretary and Chief of Stafl no less than Torty-eight (48) hours in advance of
the scheduled start time of te lirst session of a Bourd meeting. ..." The first session of the Board meeting is scheduled for Tuesday, September 28, 2021. Comments are therefore required to be submitted prior to Sunday, September 26, 2021, at 2:00 p.m., just seven business days alter the Chy received the Final EIR. Given the complexity of the outstanding defects in the EIR, ond the importance of resolving the issues explained further herein, the City sincerely hopes the Board of Regents will grant this request.

Duc to the limited timeframe within which to provide comments on the Final EIR, the City reiterates and incorporates herein by reference cach ofour prior comments contained in our March 8, 2021 letter. In addition, we emphosize that the EIR still dues not adequately disclose, evalunte, and mitigole for several polenially significant environmental impacts that will result from the implementation of the 2021 LRDP, in violation of CEQA. In fact, components of the EIR are "so fundamentally and basically inadequate and conclusory in nature that meaningfut public review and comment are precluded." (CEQA Guidelines, § 15088.5, subd. (a)(4); see also Fineyard Area Chizens for Responsible Growth, Inc. City of Rancho Cordove (2007) 40 Cal.4th 412, 447--449 (Vineyand).) The City provides the following comments for the Board of Regents' consideration.

I. The assumption in the EIR that UCSC will achleve the LRDP's on-campus housing objectives is not supported by substantial evidence.

The 202J L.RDP provides a list of oujectives, including the following: Expand campus Cacilities and infrastructure to nccommodate projected increases in student enroliment throngh 2040 based on statewite public oducational needs and acudemic mission, including housing for 100 percent of new FWS nhree-quarter averuge) FTE on-campus enroliment (abuve the 200S LRDP total of 19,500 FTE students) in both colleges and studest housing developments and commensurate
acudemic and support space.

Increase on campus housing opponunities for faculty oud staff at the main residential campus und the Westside Research Park to allow at least 25 percent of faculty and staff. based on demand, so be housed on cempus.
(2021 LRDP, p 93, italics added.) The LRDP states that UCSC is "committing to provide housing for 100 percent of on-campus FTE enrollment growth over the 19,500 planned in the
2005 LRDP, that is for the entire 8,500 additional studenta." (2021 L.RDP. p. 98.) Ihe plan
further explains that "[t]his housing will help moderte demand for housing ofl campus in the community, as well as reduce the number and lengtb of vehicle trips to campus." (Ibid.) The EIR
likewise recognizes and relies on the assumption that UCSC pluns "to provide on campus housing for 100 pergent of the increase in student enrollment ... und up to 25 percent of the additional anticipated 2,200 FTE facultyistaff members." (Final EIR, p. 2-7-2-8 [Master Response 2]; see also p. 2-21 [Master Response 9].)

But "[n]o specific development is proposed as part of the 2021 LRDP, and no project- level detuils have heen developed regarding where. how, or when development under the 2021 LRDP would oceur." (Final EIR, p. 2-20 [Master Response 91.) And, neither the LRDP nor the EIR actually includes any binding commitment to meat these identified housing objectives. Despite this. the entire analysis in the ETR based upon the unsupported assumption that UCSC will house 100-percent of its new students on campus. As a result, the EIR. grossly underestimales the potential off-campus impacts of the proposed enrollment growth il students, faculty, and stalf, in fact are not housed on campus.
In the Final EIR, UCSC responds to comments regarding deficiencies in the analysis of off-compus impacts related to housing with the following:
It would be spoculative to assert the sequence of development, much like it woutd be for the City of Santa Cruz's (or any city's) General Plaa; therefore, the EIR examines buildout of the 2021 L.RDP. The Draft ETR is not required to analyze cvery conceivable scenario that could occur during LRDP implementanion, hur instead relies on evidence-based assumptions to determine whut impacts are
reasonably foresecnble.
(Finul EIR. p. 2-160 [Response L9-6]; see also p. 2-20 [Master Response 9].) CEQA requires that *[}iering does not exeuse the lead agency from adequately unalyzing reasonably foresceable significami environmental impacis of the project and does not justify deferring such analysis to a later fier EIRL-J* (Tneyard, supra, 40 Cal.4th al p. 431, quoting CEQA Guidelines, § 15152, subd. (b).) "Tiering is properly used to defer unalysis of environmental impacts and mitigntion measures to later phases when the impaets or mitigation measures are not detennined by the first-tier approval decision but are specilic to later phases." (bid.)
But projecting annual development is reasonubly foresceuble, as UCSC ucknowledges elsewhere in the Final EIR. For example, Response L7-54 provides that: "[w]hile the programmatic nature of the IEIR hmits the specilicily in analyzing the level of construction uctivity thut would occur over the buikd out period of the 2021 L.RDP, the Draft EIR provides u reasonable analysis of foreseenble levels of construction during the implementation period based upon hislorie and projected development levels..."
It is common sense that UCSC might not be able 1o meet these lofty housing goals. The housing market in Santa Cruz is signilicantly struined, and UCSC has a history of difliculty in mecling housing construction goals. For example, in the 1988 UCSC Long Range Development Pian, UCSC outlined its proposal to house 70-percent of its students, but the cumpus didl nol mneet this objective. (See, e.g., UC Santa Cruz Student Housing West Draf El, p. 3.0-33-3.0- 34, nvallable ot hwps/edinfiles.ucsw,.eduppcienvdorSHW_DEIR_Yol20Lreluced-beutcr.pdf

*The 2005 KDP esumated that a total ol appruximately 3.18 million gsf of nuudemic buildings, support facilities, and student housing would be required to sappori a total futre enralimemt level of 19.500 students. .. |O]nly a small percentage of the planned bulding space has been developed on campus sace 2005."}; UICSC 2005 L.RDP, available at hwzalcdo.usac.sds.tinal2005tndp/200Stoln.pdf.)Inercased housing demand. "coupled with limited supphes and a shortage of vacant land" in Santa Croz "make bousing supply and affordability critical issles for the entire region." In addition, the 2005 LRDP acknowledged that "UCSC growth increases the pressure on housing supply, and high housing costs make it more diffcult to recrunt students, laculty, and statt* (UCSC 3405 LRDP, p. 25.)
Without hinding commitments to meet housing objectives, the assumplion that UCSC will meet the 1 RDP's on-cumpus housing goots to keep up with cnroltmem es aol supported by substanual evidence, as required by ( 1:QA

II. The EIR fnlla to evaluato potentiad environmentol impacts that will result in the llkely event that UCSC dues not mect the LRDP's bousing objectives.
As a result of the unsupported ussumption that UCSC will be able to house 100-percent of its new studemts on campus, the EIR fails to evalunte several potential environmental impacts.
The following two sechous provide examples of potential environmental impacts that the FIR must consider, but they are not ell-inclusive. In addiuon to these potential impacts, the EIR must include an analysis of ull potential of-campus impacts as a result of'incrcasing enrollment on
campus.

1 The EIR must eraluote the I RDP's potential to contribute to hosing
displucement

The EIR concludes that the LRDP's impaet on housig displucement would be less than significant, but that conclusion is based on the erroneous assumption thai UCSC will achieve full buildout of the L.RDP prior to increases in ensolluinent. For example, the Final EiR states that there would not "be any actions that would displace substantial numbers of existing people" because the I.RDP "mcludes a sobsiantial addition of new houing: if existing student housing is demolished. it would be replaced by an equsl or greater amount of new housing.™ The Final EIR
also provides:

Further, the 2021 RDP does nol propose development ou lands uwned by the City of Santa Cruz.... |Tfhe Draft EIR cvaluates the whole of the setion, evaluating ressonably foresceable impacts based on reasonable asstmptions. The 2021 1 RDP is a land use plan that does not actually propose any specilic development or govern enrollment decisions." But UCSC cannot make this tinding. beeause the E.IR. does not analyze the possible displacenient of people living in the City of Santa Cruz resulting from pmposed enrollment growth under the LRDP.

B The ETR must consider TVT tmpacts if "final buildout" is not achieved.

A stated objective of the 2021 LRDP is to:

tesw-than-aignificant because te I RDP would reduce the momber of" per-capita velucutar trips to and from the main residential cnmpus due to additional planned on-campus housing. (Sce. e g. Final ETR, p. 2-139 [Response L7-143, «toting in response to comments that the EIR should analyze potenual VMT impacts if full buildout is not ochieved, 1ha "[t]he Drofi EIR is not required to anulyze every conceivable scenario that could occur during I.RDP implementation, but instead relies on evidence-based assumptions to determine what impacts are reasonably foresccable. "].) Bu again, u is reasonably foresceable that UCSC will not achieve the on-campus bousing objcetives prior to increasing enrollment. The poteatial (and likely signiticant) VMI impacts of thai scenario, therefore, must be fully analyzed

Il. The Regents of the Board must consider feasible mitlgation measures thut woald

To mitigate for potential impacts related to housing displacement, the Regents of the

TV. IdentiNcation of eight prehistoric archacolngical sltes by the Amab Mutwr Tribal Band lo alguifleant new lalormation thut requires UCSC to recireulate the EIR.

CEQA requires recircutation of a Draft HIR when significans new information is added alter public review bui before certification. (Pub. Resources Code, 21092.1, CEQA Guidchns, * 1508% 5. subdl. (a)(4) ) "Significant information" includes where "ltbe drall ETR WO% S fundamentally and basically inadequate and conclugory m nature that meaningful public revicw and comment were pracluded."(C7-QA Gudelines, $ 15088 subd. (a)(4).) Revirculation is required when information not provided m a dran EIR "reveals, for example, a new substantial tupaci or a sobuantialty mereased impuct on the cuvironment." (Jnrerd, supra, 40 Cal.4th m p. 447.)

Alter cuculation of the Draft EIR, the Amah Mmsun Tribal Band identiled eight specitic prehistoric archacological sites on the UC Santa Cruz main residental campus, within the L.RDP area. (Final EIR. pp 2-299-2-300 (Comument and Response 010-613 The Finnt FIR states tiat identification of uese sites is not "significant new information" because they ure nol in proposed development arcas. The ideutified sibs, though, ane kacated on the maus campus, and moreased campas growth could certainly impact them

Perhaps more important, the Final EIR includes revisions to Mitigalian Measure 3 4-2 "for clarity." (Final EIR, Pp. 2-184 -2-186 [Response L.12-21) But those revisions do nut actually protect the newly-identitied resources UCSC musi recirculalc the ElR so as to aliow the public, including the Amah Mutsun Tribal Band, the opportunity w mview and comment on the new information provided in the FIR wluch reveals the new or substantially increased impact on these eight historie resounces.

V. The EIR daes nut snalyzo the Impacts assuclated with waler sopply anavallabibly resulting from drought conditions, water scareky, and rationing.
The ENR fails to aualyze potential impacts, including heulth. air qualny, and recrcational impacts. from water supply unavailabiliny due to drought, water acorcily, and ratiening as a resul of the I.RDP. The Tinal EIR states that the EIR did not onalyee these polential impacts beeause nhey are "specularion) tat the LKDP will incrense the exposure of idividuals to drough conditions." (Finol EIR, p. 2-143 (Response 1.7-158).) The Final ElR abo provides that:

the Drant +IR acknowledges ancertaudtien regandnng tuzure water supphes. dascUlases, alternauve walet sources (to the extent informution us knowa), und
discloser the potenttal envurcamental impacts of cach alteroalive water source, such that water supplies could he reasonably mamtamed to prevent adverse conditons. Torshermure. t1C Santo Cour has comphed with the provisions of the Caly's Waier Shorge Contingency Plan and, as required by Miligation Measure 3 17-1a. would implement further measures that are consisient with the Ciry's drought emergancy measurex, in ensure in the safety and hrealth of the local populaton, as it pentains to drought conditions.
f1 maal F FR. p 2-141 |Response 1.7-158] )
But the F.IR doe9 noi evaluste the impact on public helth and other envirnmental rewuoces il thow cmerency measures are unsuocessful. Gwen the nncertamty of alternalive water sources and the real impacis that chimate change and deouuht will have un the ity of Santa Cou's watter supply, the HIR must flly evalumte the potental water supply impucts.
The 2005 RDP explamed that "Is  normnal and wel years. the water supply system in capable of mccung the needs of the current population. bui even without population mcreases. the aystem is highly vuluerable to shortages m drought years" (2005 LRDP. p 25.) As the residents of this Ciry and the wule arc experiracing, right nw. drought is becoming an increasingly common condition in recent years, and will get woise es the climate changes. More frequent shortages are the reasonably foreseeablc scenario and the LRDP BIR must contront the wplications for an alrendy constrained water supply under mws frequent drought seenarios with the addition of many more students. faculry and staff incresving the demand on campus and in the Cny.
Whte te City appreviate; the anclusion of Miugation Meaure 3.17ola and 3 17-1b in the Mhtigation Momiiuriag and Reporting Program, the Regents should also consider hnking increased cnrollment to demonstratons of addiuonal water supplies or savings achieved through the audits and improvements in efliciency described mt Measure 3.17-1b. It is not enough to vuuply hope that water cin be saved: UC SC must do its part to avoid further burdening a constramed waet supply with additunal users anless addstional water cun he allocuted or saved through repurs and umprovements in efficiency.

VT. (nnclusion

In swmmary. the madequacies in the Draft I'TR have not been addressed in the Fural ElR. and the l.IR contmucs to be madequale under CEQA Thc City strongly urges the Bound of
Regents not to cenify the EIR or approve the 2021 LRDP ontil the faial flaws are addressed in a
revised 11R and the document is recirculated for addaional public comment.
