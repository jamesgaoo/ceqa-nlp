4 STATE OF CALIFORNIA, COUNTY OF ORANGE

5
I am employed by the law office of Rutan & Tucker, LLP in the County of Orange, State 6 of California. Iam over the age of 18 and not a party to the within action. My business address is 18575 Jamboree Road, 9th Floor, Irvine, CA 92612. My electronic notification address is 7 mslobodien@rutan.com.

8 On January 13, 2022, I served on the interested parties in said action the within:

NOTICE OF RESPONSIBLE AGENCIES PURSUANT TO

10 PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE ยง21167.6.5

as stated below:
11 X
12 (BY MAIL) by placing a true copy thereof in sealed envelope(s) addressed as shown on the attached service list.

13 In the course of my employment with Rutan & Tucker, LLP. have, through first-hand personal observation, become readily familiar with Rutan & Tucker, LLP's practice of collection
14 and processing correspondence for mailing with the United States Postal Service. Under that practice, deposited such envelope(s) in an out-box for collection by other personnel of Rutan & 15 Tucker, LLP, and for ultimate posting and placement with the U.S. Postal Service on that same day in the ordinary course of business. If the customary business practices of Rutan & Tucker, 16 LLP with regard to collection and processing of correspondence and mailing were followed, and am confident that they were, such envelope(s) were posted and placed in the United States mail at 17 Irvine, California, that same date. I am aware that on motion of party served, service is presumed invalid if postal cancellation date or postage meter date is more than one day after date of deposit 18 for mailing in affidavit.

19 X (BY E-MAIL - ELECTRONIC SERVICE through One Legal, LLC) Based on the Court's requirements that documents must be filed electronically in this action, the parties must
20 also serve documents and accept service of documents electronically from all other parties

21 which are not required to be personally served. I affected electronic service by submitting an electronic version of the document(s) to One Legal, LLC, through the user interface at

22 www.onelegal.com, which caused the documents to be sent by electronic transmission to the person(s) at the electronic service address(es) listed on the attached Service List.

23 Executed on January 13, 2022, at Irvine, California.

24 declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of California that the foregoing is true and correct.
