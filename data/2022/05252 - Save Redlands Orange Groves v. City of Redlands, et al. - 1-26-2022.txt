25 INTRODUCTION

26 Petitioner SAVE REDLANDS ORANGE GROVES (*Petitioner") alleges as follows:
1. Petitioner challenges certain land use decisions made by respondent CITY OF
27 REDLANDS ("City" or "Respondent"). Specifically, Petitioner challenges Respondent's approval
28 of the application submitted by real parties in interest REDLANDS PALM INVESTMENT, LLC,

-1-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

2

3 a California limited liability company managed by DIVERSIFIED PACIFIC DEVELOPMENT GROUP,

4 LLC, a California limited liability company (collectively, "RPI"), seeking the approvals and
entitlements needed to develop a 28-home Planned Residential Development (the "Project") on

6 a historic orange grove property in the City located at the southeast corner of West Palm Avenue
and Alvarado Street (the "Property" as well as the mitigated negative declaration ("MND") that
the City's consultant prepared for the Project.
2.

9 Petitioner contends that Respondent's preparation and approval of a MND for the

10 Project, and its approval by the City's elected City Council, violate specific provisions of the

11 California Environmental Quality Act (Pub. Resources Code §§ 21000, et seq.: "CEQA") and

LEIBOLD McCLENDON Z MANN 12 the Guidelines for Implementation of CEQA (Title 14, Cal. Code Regs., §§ 15000, et seq.: the

A PROFESSIONAL CORPORATION 13 "Guidelines"), a statutory and regulatory framework often referred to as the "Holy Grail" of
California's environmental laws.

dg 3.

14

15 Petitioner is challenging the Project because (among other things) it is a project
that may result in significant impacts on the environment that have not been adequately assessed
or mitigated in accordance with CEQA and the Guidelines. Respondent ignored fair arguments
16 supported by expert opinion and substantial evidence that the development and operation of the
17 Project upon the Property would cause significant unmitigated impacts on the environment.
18 4.

19

20 In refusing to prepare and certify a legally adequate environmental impact report

21 that fully disclosed and analyzed all of the potential impacts that will result from the Project,

22 refusing to consider feasible and environmentally superior alternatives to the Project, and failing

23 to make all mitigation measures fully enforceable, Respondent has disregarded or treated as a
mere formality the specific and substantive requirements of CEQA and the Guidelines.

5.

24 Planning and Zoning Law (Gov. Code §§ 65000, et seq.: the "PZL") as well as the City's own
25 Petitioner also contends Respondent's approval of the Project violates California's

27 laws because (among other things) the Project is inconsistent with the City's General Plan and
26 a voter-enacted initiative known as "Measure U."

6. Petitioner requests that this Court vacate and set aside Respondent's approval of
28 the Project and the MND by issuing a writ of mandate under Code of Civil Procedure sections

1085 and/or 1094.5, directing Respondent to vacate and set aside its approval of the Project and
2 the MND. These claims are based on the following allegations:

4 7. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

5

6 This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to sections 1085, 1094.5, and
187 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and section 21168 of the Public Resources Code.

8.

7 because Respondent, the Property and the Project are located in San Bernardino County.
8 Venue for this action properly lies in the San Bernardino County Superior Court

9. PARTIES AND BENEFICIAL INTEREST

10

11 Petitioner is a grassroots unincorporated association composed of and supported

LEIBOLD McCLENDON z MANN 12 by City residents and others devoted to the preservation of the environment and the City's unique

13 historical resources. Many of these individuals previously formed an ad hoc group named Save

dg A PROFESSIONAL CORPORATION the Redlands Orange Grove to oppose the City's approval of the Project. After the City Council
approved the Project, these individuals and others formed Petitioner for the purpose of

14 representing the interests of the public in assuring the City's compliance with the State's
15 environmental and land use laws as well as the City's general plan and ordinances. On behalf
16 of Petitioner's members, their respective constituents, and other City residents, Petitioner
17| challenges Respondent's approval of the MND and the Project.
18 10. Petitioner has associational standing to bring this action and is a party beneficially
19 interested in the issuance of the requested writ of mandate (i) because in accordance with Public
20 Resources Code section 21177(c), Petitioner is an organization formed after the approval of the
21 Project to maintain an action against Respondent under CEQA; (ii) because certain members of
22 Petitioner- -including individuals who supported Save Redlands Orange Grove complied
23
24 administrative remedies by timely commenting on and objecting to the contents and adequacy
25 with subdivisions (a) and (b) of Public Resources Code section 21177 and exhausted their

27 of the Project and the MND both orally and in writing; and (iii) because the environmental
26 impacts of Respondent's decision to approve the Project and the MND will extend to areas in

28 which citizens represented by Petitioner own property and/or live. Unless this Court grants the
requested writ of mandate, the impacts resulting from Respondent's decision to approve

-3- the

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Project and MND will extend to areas in which numerous citizens represented by Petitioner live

2 and will directly and adversely affect their health and living environment. Consequently,
3 Petitioner is directly and beneficially interested in the issuance of the requested writ of mandate.

4 11. Respondent City of Redlands is a municipal corporation, organized and existing

5 under the laws of the State of California. The City was the "lead agency" under CEQA for the

6 Project and is responsible for carrying out its statutorily mandated duties, including preparation

7 of environmental documentation conforming to the requirements of CEQA and the Guidelines
8 prior to approving the MND and implementing and complying with all provisions of CEQA, the
9 Guidelines, the PZL, and other laws, ordinances and regulations applicable to the City.
10 12. Real Parties in Interest REDLANDS PALM INVESTMENT, LLC, and DiVersified

11 PACIFIC DEVELOPMENT GROUP, LLC, are California limited liability companies, with the latter

LEIBOLD McCLENDON & MANN g 12 serving as the manager of the former.
NOLIVAOdHOD IVNOISSHHOHd V 13 13. City staff reports, agendas, and other materials presented to the City's planning
14 commission and City Council identified REDLANDS PALM INVESTMENT, LLC, as the applicant
15 seeking the discretionary approvals needed to develop the Project. Therefore, By naming
16 REDLANDS PALM INVESTMENT, LLC, and its manager DIVERSIFIED PACIFIC DEVELOPMENT
17 GROUP, LLC, Petitioner has fully complied with subdivision (a) of Public Resources Code
18 section 21167.6.5.

19 14. Petitioner is ignorant of the true names and capacities of the respondents named
20 herein as DOES 1 through 10, and the real parties in interest named herein as DOES 11 through
21 25, inclusive, and therefore sues those respondents and real parties in interest by such fictitious

22 names. Petitioner will amend this petition to allege the true names and capacities of those Doe
23 parties when ascertained. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that each
24 of the parties designated herein as a Doe is responsible in some manner for the events and
25 actions referred to herein.

26 15. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that at all relevant
27 times the City, RPI, and the Doe respondents and real parties in interest were and are the agents
28 of each other, authorized to do the acts herein alleged, each of which was ratified by the others.

-4-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

16. The true names and capacities, whether individual, corporate, or otherwise of Does

2 through 25 are unknown to Petitioner who therefore sues Does 1 through 25 by such fictitious

3 names. Petitioner will amend this petition to allege the true names and capacities of the Doe

4 respondents when the same becomes known to it. Reference to "City" or "Respondent" herein

5 shall mean the named respondents and Does 1 through 25.
17. Petitioner is informed and believes and on that basis alleges that Respondent and

7 each of the Does proximately caused the acts, omissions to act, and/or injuries herein alleged.

8 18. Respondent is, and at all times relevant herein has been, charged by law with the
9 performance of all duties arising under CEQA and the Guidelines, including (but not limited to)
10 the preparation and certification of a legally adequate environmental impact report ("EIR") for
11 the Project, the PZL, and other laws, ordinances and regulations applicable to the City.
LEIBOLD McCLENDON MANN 12 19. Petitioner has exhausted all legally available administrative remedies against
NOILVHOdHOO IVNOISSIIONd V 13 Respondent's decision to approve the Project's MND as being in compliance with CEQA and
8 14 the Guidelines. The decision of Respondent to approve the MND is a final determination. If the
15 Court does not grant the relief prayed for herein, Petitioner will suffer irreparable injury for
16 which it has no adequate remedy at law, there will be a waste, and the failure to enjoin further
17 conduct may tend to render the judgment in this action ineffectual.
18 20. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section
19 21167.5 by sending, via United States Mail, written notice of this action to Respondent. A copy
20 of the written notice provided to Respondent is attached hereto as Exhibit A and incorporated
21 herein by this reference.

22 21. Petitioner will comply with the requirements of Public Resources Code section
23 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure section 388 by furnishing a copy of this Verified Petition
24 for Writ of Mandate to the Attorney General of California in accordance with Public Resources
25 Code section 21167.7.

public art and streetscaping elements. Despite the City's celebration of its citrus heritage, the
amount of land in citrus production has decreased substantially over the years.

23.

4 On November 4, 1997, the City's voters passed "Measure U" to amend the City's

5 General Plan. The voters took this extraordinary step So that the General Plan would (among

6 other things) ensure the preservation of agricultural and citrus production uses in the City. To
achieve this fundamental goal and impose a mandate a on City officials, Measure U begins with
7 the following statement of purpose:

8 A.

9 The purpose and intent of this initiative measure is to establish

10 comprehensive and inviolable principles of managed development for the City of

11 Redlands that will preserve, enhance and maintain the special quality of life

8 LEIBOLD McCLENDON É - MANN 12
A PROFESSIONAL CORPORATION valued by this community. The principles of managed development established by

13 this initiative measure assure that future development within the City of Redlands

14 occurs in a way that promotes the social and economic well-being of the entire
community.

15 B.

16 The unique character of the City of Redlands as a quiet university town

17 surrounded by agricultural and citrus producing lands is cherished by its residents.

18 Residents of Redlands perceive the City as a community a of homes where
children are eager to return to raise their families. grown

19 24.

20 In addition, Measure U's statement of purpose underscores the importance of

21 agriculture to the community as follows:
I.

22

23 Uncontrolled high density urban development will permanently alter the character

24 of the City of Redlands and threaten the public health, safety and welfare by causing
increased traffic congestion, associated air pollution, noise, and higher crime rates.

25 Costly expansion of public facilities and services, including police and fire services, will

26

27 be required to meet the needs of a rapidly urbanizing community. This will create
inevitable conflicts between urban and agricultural uses within the City of Redlands and

28 will permanently alter the quality of life experienced by its residents.

J.

2 This initiative measure is consonant with and furthers the purpose and intent of
Proposition R, approved by the voters in 1978, and Measure N, approved by the voters

au in 1987 with regard to the preservation of agricultural land. In addition, it furthers the
explicit policy of the State of California set forth in California Government Code Section
51220 which reads in relevant part as follows:

7

8 [T]he discouragement of premature and unnecessary conversion of

9 agricultural land to urban uses is a matter of public interest and will be of

10 benefit to urban dwellers themselves in that it will discourage

11 discontiguous urban development patterns which unnecessarily increase the

LEIBOLD McCLENDON É MANN 12 costs of community services to community residents.

13
8 A PROFESSIONAL CORPORATION [I]n a rapidly urbanizing society agricultural lands have a definite

14 public value as open space, and the preservation in agricultural production

15 of such lands, the use of which may be limited under the provisions of this

16 25. chapter, constitutes an important physical, social, esthetic and economic
asset to existing or pending urban or metropolitan developments."

18 Section 1A of Measure U establishes certain specific development principles that
17 the City is required to implement in making development decisions such as this. With regard

19

20 to principles affecting land in agricultural use, Measure U provides as follows:
1A.40 PRINCIPLE FOUR

21 Agricultural uses of land are important to the culture,

22 economy and stability of the City of Redlands and shall be preserved to the greatest extent

23 possible consistent with the will of the people as expressed in Proposition R and

24 Measure N, and consistent with the policies of the State of California set forth in
Government Code Section 51220.

26. Measure U also added specific language to the City's land use regulations,
25 including the following:

27

28 2. The non-italicized portion of Section 4.40s is hereby amended in its entirety as follows:

16 effect on other property.
17 5. The resulting use will be compatible with uses on adjacent land.
18 6. The proposed density increase will not require substantial expansion
19 of public infrastructure, facilities or services."

20 27. The Property is one of the City's most unique historical treasures. Known as the
21 England Estate, its original (1893) main house, Queen Anne cottage, carriage house and barn

22 make it one of the last examples of a fully intact grove estate in the City. Among the many
23 things making the Property and its cultural context so remarkably unique are its original hand-cut
24 stone walls and its nearly 700 heritage orange trees, planted between 1891 and 1893 on Prime
25 Farmland that are still productive and watered by the last remaining example of a 19th Century
26 gravity-fed irrigation system in the City.
27 28. In late 2019, RPI presented the proposed Project to the City by application for
28 approvals and entitlements needed to develop it despite the Property's historical values.

1 29. In 1986, the City adopted Ordinance No. 1954, known as the "Historic and Scenic
2 Preservation Ordinance of the City" for the purposes set forth in Section 2.62.020 of the

3

4

5 Redlands Municipal Code ("RMC"), and with the intent of "carry[ing] out the goals and policies
of the historic and scenic preservation element of the Redlands general plan."
30.

6 The Historic and Scenic Preservation Ordinance of the City created a seven-
member Historical and Scenic Preservation Commission ("HSPC") and authorized it "to make
7 recommendations, decisions, and determinations concerning the designation, preservation,
8 protection, enhancement and perpetuation of the[] historical, scenic and cultural resources which
9 contribute to the culture and aesthetic values of the city." "One member of the commission

LEIBOLD McCLENDON z MANN 10 [must] be the archivist curator of the Redlands A.K. Smiley public library" and the other must
11 be "city residents at large who have demonstrated that they have knowledge of and long standing

d A. PROFESSIONAL CORPORATION 12 interest in the preservation of historic resources."

13 31. The HSPC reviewed and discussed the Initial Study/Mitigated Negative
14 Declaration ("MND") as well as the Cultural Resource Assessment and Historic Resource
15 Evaluation prepared for the Project on October 1, October 15, and December 17 of 2020, as well
16 as on March 4, 2021. The HSPC adopted a resolution on March 4, 2021, documenting its
17

18 findings that the proposed MND and Cultural Resources Report do not adequately identify and
address the potential impacts to cultural and historic resources and found that an Environmental
19 Impact Report should be prepared for the Project to fully identify and analyze any potentially
20 significant impacts.

21 32.

22

23 The Project was presented to the City's Planning Commission at a public hearing
on May 11,2021, and that hearing was continued to June 8, 2021, after commissioners expressed

25 concerns with the Project. On June 22, 2021, after being continued on June 8th with no

26 Project.
27 33. On July 20, 2021, the City Council held a public hearing a on the MND and the
28 Project at which Petitioner's counsel explained (among other things) that the MND contained

-9-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

2 factual errors and that City staff's processing of the MND violated CEQA. Thereafter, the City
Council voted to continue the item to its next regular public meeting on September 7, 2021.
34.

4 On September 7, 2021, the City Council voted to recirculate the MND for 30 days
in order to comply with CEQA by allowing a full 30 days for the public and State agencies to
5 provide comments on the MND.

6 35.

7

8 Thereafter, the City Council notified the public that it would consider the Project

9 at its November 16, 2021, public meeting and listed the public hearing for the Project on its

10 agenda for that meeting; however, prior to that meeting Petitioner's counsel sent a courtesy

11 notice to City officials notifying them that City staff had failed to the Project's MND on the

LEIBOLD McCLENDON è : MANN 12 agenda as an item for discussion. In response, the City continued the hearing on the MND and
the Project to December 7. 2021.
36.

13
dè A PROFESSIONAL CORPORATION 14 Prior to the City Council's December 7, 2021 public hearing on the Project,

15 counsel for Petitioner again notified the City Council of procedural and substantive problems
in a letter that began with the following:

16 "Dear Mayor and City Councilmembers:

17 As you know, on two prior occasions I have cautioned you that the processing of

18 the 301 West Palm Avenue residential subdivision project (the "Project")

19 proposed by Redlands Palm Investments, LLC, by City planning staff and its

20 consultants violated State law and regulations:

21 At your July 20, 2021, public hearing on the Project, informed you that

22 the City's failure to submit the Mitigated Negative Declaration ("MND")

23 the City's consultants prepared for the Project for 30-day review violated
CEQA.

24

25

26 Before your November 16, 2021, public hearing on the Project, I informed
you that City staff had failed to include on your agenda the MND as
item for discussion. an

27

28 Both times you did the right thing and delayed the hearing to correct their errors.

2 By this letter I am-for the third calling to your attention three more

3 errors that City planning staff and their consultants have made; errors so

4 egregious that they preclude you holding a public hearing tonight on the Project

5 and approving it. However, I am realistic enough to expect that, by now the

6 pressure the applicant is applying on you to approve its Project is so great that you
will disregard my caution and approve it anyway."
7 The letter proceeded to explain that (1) the City had violated the due process rights of property

8 owners surrounding the Property; (2) the City's consultant had misused an procedure the
9 Guidelines allow as an optional procedure for determining whether the loss of farmland that is
10 not otherwise designated by the California Department of Conservation Farmland Mapping and

to assess the cumulative effect of the Project's conversion of Prime Farmland to non-agricultural
14 use in addition to another project that had been concurrently processed by City staff that
15 proposed the conversion of some 58 acres of Prime Farmland to non-agricultural use.
16 37.

17

18 The City Council initially agendized its hearing on the Project for September 21,
2021, but continued it after receiving letters objecting to the Project on the grounds that it

19 violated Measure U and CEQA.

38. Despite being presented with substantial evidence from the public and
20 experts-including the City's own historic and scenic preservation experts- that the Project would
21

22 result in significant environmental impacts, at the end of the December 7, 2021 public hearing

23 the City Council voted 5 to 0 to approve the Project.

26

27 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION (Against Respondent)

28 40. PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Petitioner realleges paragraphs 1 through 39 into this paragraph.

-11-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

41. The Project does not comply with all applicable laws. By way of example and
2 without limitation (including alternative theories of liability):

A. The Project Violates CEQA and the Guidelines.

4 42. CEQA applies to all "governmental agencies at all levels" and requires public
5 agencies to prepare an EIR whenever the approval of a project may cause significant adverse

6 effects or impacts on the environment. Respondent's decision to approve the Project was a
7 project approval causing significant adverse environmental impacts.

8 43. CEQA requires lead agencies to review the environmental impacts of all projects.

9 Under Public Resources Code Section 21065, a project is any discretionary public "activity
10 which may cause either a direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable

11 indirect physical change in the environment." Respondent's decision to approve the Project was
LEIBOLD McCLENDON & MANN 8 12 a discretionary decision by Respondent that will result in "reasonably foreseeable" adverse
NOLLVHOdJOO IVNOISSHJONI V 13 environmental impacts.

14 44. A "significant effect on the environment" means a substantial, or potentially
15 substantial, adverse change in any of the physical conditions within the area affected by the
16 project including land, air, water, minerals, flora, fauna, ambient noise, and objects of historic
17 or aesthetic significance. The Project's potential impact to both its future occupants and the
18 community required the preparation of an environmental impact report ("EIR"). By way of
19 example and not limitation, Respondent approved the Project despite being presented with fair
20 arguments supported by substantial evidence and expert opinion that the Project would lead to
21 environmental impacts that would not be mitigated to a level of insignificance, and subdivision
22 (g) of Guidelines section 15064, therefore, required the preparation of an EIR.

23 45. In order for an EIR to be legally adequate, it must comport with certain
24 requirements set forth in CEQA and the Guidelines. For example, CEQA and the Guidelines
25 require that an EIR include a description of the Project and a discussion of alternatives to the
26 Project, including (but not limited to) the "no project" alternative and alternative methods of
27 accomplishing some, but perhaps not all, of the proposed Project's objectives. However,
28 Respondent did not proceed in the manner required by law in that it failed to cause an EIR to be

-12-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

2 prepared that adequately discussed a reasonable range of alternatives to the proposed Project,
thereby eliminating meaningful basis for comparing the adverse environmental impacts of the
3 proposed Project to environmentally superior alternatives.

4 46.

5 Respondent further did not proceed in the manner required by law in that it caused
a MND to be produced that was biased in favor of the proposed Project's approval and,
6 therefore, failed to constitute the full disclosure document intended to objectively inform

7

8 decision-makers and the public of the Project's true impacts, mitigation measures, and
alternatives. By way of example and not limitation, the MND failed to honestly address basic
9 deficiencies in the Initial Study's Agriculture and Forestry Impacts section by acknowledging

LEIBOLD McCLENDON É • MANN 10 that the Property upon which the Project was to be developed is Prime Farmland but then
11 discounting this fact by misusing a Land Evaluation and Site Assessment ("LESA").

12
A PROFESSIONAL CORPORATION 47.

13 The City was presented with fair arguments supported by substantial evidence and
expert opinions that the Project will result in significant environmental impacts; in fact, the
14 administrative record for the Project is replete with evidence supporting a fair argument that the

15 Project will result in significant impacts in several of the twenty-one impact areas identified in
16 Appendix G of the Guidelines, especially adverse impacts on agricultural and cultural resources.
17 By way of example and not limitation, and as noted above, the City's own experts on historic and

18

19 environmental impact report was required by CEQA.
20 scenic resources determined that an MND was inadequate for the Project and that an

48.

21

22 The Project will also result in cumulative impacts unaccounted for in the MND.

23 CEQA and the Guidelines prohibit: lead agency from "piecemealing" a project; i.e., breaking
up a larger project into pieces and individually analyzing each piece's potential to result in
environmental impacts. At the same time the City was processing the Project, it was also
24 considering at least one other proposed private development project that would convert some 58
25 acres of Prime Farmland acreage to a residential tract development. However, instead of
26 reviewing the combined cumulative impact of multiple projects that would cause the loss of
27 Prime Farmland, the City analyzed each project discretely in order to avoid such a cumulative
28 impact analysis.

-13-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

49. The Project's significant direct, indirect, or cumulative adverse impacts on the
2 environment give rise to Respondent's legal obligation to prepare an EIR.
50. Respondent's failure to prepare an environmental impact report is a violation of

4 CEQA and the Guidelines. As a result of Respondent's violation of CEQA and the Guidelines,
Petitioner has been harmed insofar as Petitioner, its members, other members of the public, and

6 the responsible decision-makers were not fully informed about the potentially adverse

7 environmental impacts of the Project; and insofar as Petitioner, its members, and other members
of the public did not have an opportunity to participate meaningfully in the analysis of such

9 impacts prior to approval of the Project.
10 51. Respondent did not proceed in the manner required by law in that it failed to adopt

11 findings that adequately discussed all significant Project impacts, failed to make adequate

LEIBOLD McCLENDON ‹ C MANN 12 specific findings with regard to the feasibility of each mitigation measure and each alternative
13 identified in the MND, and failed to adopt all feasible mitigation measures.
•8 NOLLVHOdHOO TVNOISSHIONI V 14 52. In order to process a project with a mitigated negative declaration, CEQA and the

15 Guidelines require Respondent to adopt feasible mitigation measures that are "fully enforceable"

16 to avoid all of that project's potentially significant environmental impacts. Respondent did not
17 proceed in the manner required by law in that the MND failed to adequately examine and discuss
18 potential mitigation measures that would substantially lessen the Project's foreseeable adverse
19| impacts. By way of example and not limitation, while the MND conceded that the Property's
20 19th century "gravity irrigation system with a weir and concrete flumes" were historic resources
21 that "would be removed to accommodate the [Project]"--even referring to its as "the historic
22 irrigation system" and "a contributor to the potential historic district," the MND then ignored
23 that fact and failed to provide a fully enforceable mitigation measure to reduce the impact of its
24 loss to a level of insignificance.
25 B. The Project Violates the PZL. In particular:

26 53. The City's General Plan is its basic land use planning document and .
27 54. State law requires a city's general plan to include a comprehensive long-term plan
28 for the physical development of that city.

-14-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

55. Government Code section 65302 mandates that every general plan contain and
2 address seven mandatory elements: land use, circulation, housing, conservation, open space,

3 noise, and safety.

4 56. By its enactment of Government Code section 65300.5, the Legislature intends that

5 every general plan and elements and parts thereof comprise an integrated, internally consistent
6 and compatible statement of policies.

7 57. The PZL prohibits the approval of any project that is not consistent with the

8 General Plan and its components. The Project authorizes land uses and activities that are in

9 some way inconsistent with the General Plan and its components.

10 58. Additionally and/or alternatively, Respondent failed to make the proper findings

11 required for approval of the Project under the PZL.
LEIBOLD McCLENDON NNVW 2 12 59. Additionally and/or alternatively, Respondent's approval of the Project was based
NOUVHOdNOD TVNOISSHONd V 13 on findings that are not supported by sufficient evidence in the administrative record.
8 14 60. Despite being presented with expert opinion and substantial evidence showing that
15 the Project conflicts with the General Plan, Respondent nevertheless approved the Project.

16 61. As result of Respondent's violation of the PZL, Petitioner, its members, and the

17 general public have been harmed insofar as Respondent has approved a project that is
18 inconsistent with the land-use rules designed to protect the public from harmful development.
19 C. The Project Violates Measure U. In particular:

20 62. The City's failure to prepare an EIR for the Project led to the City failing to
21 identify and disclose the true impacts of the Project, especially on agriculture resources. Thus,
22 the following findings Measure U requires the City to make before converting any property in
23 active agricultural production on November 3, 1986 to non-agricultural use could not be made
24 by the City:

25 1. There are substantial and overriding economic or social benefits to

26 the City and its residents and taxpayers from the proposed density increase.

27 2. The proposed density increase will not cause adverse environmental

28 impacts, either individually or cumulatively, directly or indirectly.

-15-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 3.

2 The proposed density increase will not convert viable agricultural land to non-agricultural uses.

3 4.

4 5. The proposed density increase will not have a growth-inducing effect on other property.

5 6. The resulting use will be compatible with uses on adjacent land.

6 The proposed density increase will not require substantial expansion of public infrastructure, facilities or services.

7 Notably, City staff ignored the phrase "regardless of zoning" the following section of Measure U
8 in order to skirt its requirement that the above findings had to be made for the Project:
9

10 "No land undeveloped as of March 1, 1997 and designated in whole or in part as

11 "Urban Reserve" or "Urban Reserve (Agricultural)" in the Redlands general plan

12
A PROFESSIONAL CORPORATION LEIBOLD McCLENDON & MANN 8 in effect as of June 1, 1987, and/or any land parcel that was in active agricultural

13 production on November 3, 1986 regardless of zoning, shall be re-designated or

14 rezoned to permit residential density greater than the Estate Residential (R-E)

15 classification, as the same existed on June 1, 1987, in the Redlands City Zoning

16 Ordinance, unless the following mandatory findings are made and the re-

17 designation or rezoning is approved by four-fifths (4/5) vote of the total authorized
membership of the City Council.3
18 (Emphasis added.) The reason for the City to avoid having to make these finding is particularly
19 obvious with regard to finding #3: since the Property upon which RPI proposes to develop the
20

21 Property is officially mapped by the State as Prime Farmland, finding #3 cannot be made.
63. As result of Respondent's violation of Measure U, Petitioner, its members, and
22 the City's electorate have been harmed insofar as Respondent has approved a project that the
23 voters intended Measure U to prohibit.

24 D.

25 Propriety of Relief Under C.C.P. $§1085 et seq., and/or §§1094.5 et seq.
64. Respondent has the legal duty in making its determinations to comply with the
26 applicable law governing such legislative acts. In particular, Respondent has the legal and
27 nondiscretionary duty to act in accordance with the requirements of CEQA, the Guidelines, the
28 Government Code, and other applicable laws and regulations.
-16-

1 65.

2 Respondent acted arbitrarily, capriciously, irrationally, and unreasonably, and
without any or an adequate evidentiary basis in failing or refusing to comply with the
3 requirements of CEQA, the Guidelines, the Government Code, and other applicable laws and

4

5

6 regulations. At all times material hereto, Respondent had, and continues to have, the ability to
comply with its legal duties. Notwithstanding the efforts of Petitioner's members and others to
inform Respondent of its legal duties, and to induce Respondent to comply with its legal duties,
7 Respondent has failed and refused to perform these duties as described herein.

8 66.

10 The decision of Respondent to approve the Project constitutes a final decision as
contemplated in Section 1094.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

67.

11 Petitioner has exhausted all available administrative remedies. There is no

A PROFESSIONAL CORPORATION LEIBOLD McCLENDON & MANN 8 provision known to Petitioner for any further administrative remedial action from the decision
12 of Respondent to approve the Project.
13 68. Respondent has prejudicially abused its discretion by approving the Project
14| permitting the acts and omissions described herein to occur.

15 69.

16 in an arbitrary, capricious, and irrational manner lacking any reasonable basis, in violation of
17 In acting and failing to act in the manner described above, Respondent has acted

18 Code of Civil Procedure Sections 1085

70. et seq.

19

20 Petitioner is beneficially interested in issuance of the peremptory writ of mandate

21 as prayed for hereafter. Petitioner will be seriously harmed if Respondent proceeds with the
Project without first complying with applicable laws and regulations.
71.

23 At all times material hereto, Respondent has been able to perform its duties and
22 obligations as demanded by Petitioner. Respondent has, however, failed and refused to
undertake its obligations. Respondent has failed and refused to require or to perform any of the
24 above, notwithstanding the substantial evidence presented to Petitioner and others that such
25 failures and refusals are contrary to law and will have adverse consequences on Petitioner.

Re: Save Redlands Orange Groves v. City of Redlands, et al.
San Bernardino County Superior Court Case No. [***TBD***]

Dear Ms. Bonta:

Enclosed please find a copy of the Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate in the above- referenced action. This copy is provided to you in compliance with Public Resources Code section 21167.7. The litigation will challenge (among other things) the City of Redlands' failure to comply with the California Environmental Quality Act (Public Resources Code
§ 21000 et seq.), and the State Guidelines for Implementing CEQA (Title 14, California Code of Regulations, § 15000 et seq.) prior to approving a mitigated negative declaration and entitlements for a 28-home residential subdivision proposed to be developed by Redlands Palm Investments, LLC (the "Project") upon the historic 8.8 acre England Estate. The
Project will result in the unmitigated permanent loss of 6.6 acres of Prime Farmland
and comes on the heels of the City of Redlands approving, just two months prior, a project causing the unmitigated permanent loss of 58 acres of Prime Farmland.
Please acknowledge receipt of the enclosed Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate. Unless you request otherwise, we will not serve on your office any documents other than this initial pleading and any amended or supplemental initial pleadings.

Thank you for your attention to this matter, and please do not hesitate to contact me
if you would like to discuss this matter further.

Very truly yours,

LEIBOLD McCLENDON & MANN, P.C.
