VERIFIED PETTTION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 INTRODUCTION

2 1. This action challenges the actions by the City of Vallejo and its City Council

3 (collectively, "Respondents") between January 25, 2022, and July 5, 2022 approving multiple

4 resolutions in support of the development and construction by Firm Foundation Community

5 Housing ("Applicant") of a Home Key 2.0 Program Project known as the Broadway Project

6 ("Broadway Project" or "Project") located on Broadway Street at Assessor Parcel Number

7 0067-140-150. The Project proposes to provide a four story, 48-unit permanent supportive

8 modular housing project designed to house chronically homeless individuals immediately

9 adjacent to a single-family residential neighborhood and community park.
2.
10 In addition to approving resolutions authorizing the submittal of Homekey

11 Program applications, acceptance of Homekey funds, acquisition of the Project site and
recordation of a Declaration of Restrictive Covenants, the City Council also adopted a
12 resolution purporting to exempt the "Broadway Project, and all actions relating thereto," from
13 the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") pursuant to Public
14 Resources Code sections 21159.23, 21159.24, and 21080(b); Health and Safety Code section
15 50675.1.4; and CEQA Guidelines sections 15194, 15195, 15268, and 15332.
16 3. Notwithstanding the City's asserted exemptions, the Project will have significant
17 adverse impacts in and around the Project area including impacts related to aesthetics, air
18 quality, noise, and traffic. These impacts will significantly affect the existing single-family

19 residential neighborhood, the adjacent community park, and will result in serious health, safety,

20 and other issues including a drastic and adverse effect on surrounding residents' existing quality

21 of life.

22 4. In adopting its exemption resolution, the City ignores these significant adverse

23 environmental impacts without meaningful discussion or support, and instead provides a series

24 of self-serving, conclusionary statements purporting to support its exemption determinations.

25 These statements are inconsistent with the facts in the record and are not otherwise supported by

26 substantial evidence. Moreover, the Project presents unusual circumstances with respect to its

27 unique construction method, which includes the use of stacked modular units. This construction

28 method is relatively untested and, as such, results in additional geological and site stability

2
VERIFFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 concerns - particularly in light of the Project's location immediately adjacent to an existing

2 railroad line and its proximity to known earthquake faults.

3 5. Furthermore, the City purports to rely on multiple statutory and ministerial
4 project exemptions. In doing so, however, the City misstates the Project's access to necessary

5 utilities, which are not, as the City claims, available to serve the Project site, but must instead be

6 extended significant distances from off-site locations. Moreover, the City's reliance on density

7 bonus laws to support its actions is completely lacking as there is no evidence in the record that

8 the Project Applicant ever applied for density bonuses or that the City ever granted them

9 pursuant to Title 16 of the Vallejo Municipal Code (*Zoning Code').
PARTIES
10
6.
11 Individual Petitioner, Russell Charpentier, is a resident of the City a of American
Canyon, and, Individual Petitioner, William Baker, is a resident of the City of American
12 Canyon. Both live within the immediate vicinity of the Project site. As local residents,
13 Petitioners have a direct and beneficial interest in Respondents' compliance with CEQA and the
14 CEQA Guidelines, as well as Respondents' compliance with its own planning and zoning laws
15 embodied in its Zoning Code. These interests will be directly and adversely affected by the
16 Project, which violates the provisions of law as set forth in this Petition and which would cause
17 irreversible harm to the environment. Furthermore, the maintenance and prosecution of this
18 action will confer a substantial benefit on the public by protecting the public from the
19 environmental and other harms alleged herein.

20 7. Respondent City of Vallejo ("City") is a city organized and existing under and by

21 virtue of the laws of the State of California. Respondent Vallejo City Council ("City Council")

22 is the legislative body duly authorized under the laws of the State of California to act on behalf

23 of the City including compliance with the requirements of CEQA and the City's Zoning Code.

24 8. Petitioners do not know the true names and capacities, whether individual,

25 corporate, associate, or otherwise, of respondents DOE 1 through DOE 10, inclusive, and

26 therefore sues said Respondents under fictional names. Petitioners allege, upon information and

27 belief, that each fictionally named Respondent is responsible in some manner for committing

28

3
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 the acts upon which this action is based. Petitioners will amend this Petition to show their true

2 names and capacities if and when they have been ascertained.

3 9. Petitioners are informed and believe that Real Party in Interest Firm Foundation

4 Community Housing is California corporation and the applicant for approval of the Project.

5 10. Petitioners do not know the true names and capacities, whether individual,

6 corporate, associate, or otherwise, of Real Parties in Interest DOE 11 through DOE 20,

7 inclusive, and therefore sues said Real Parties in Interest under fictional names. Petitioners

8 allege, upon information and belief, that each fictionally named Real Party in Interest is

9 responsible in some manner for committing the acts upon which this action is based or has

10 material interests affected by the Project or by the City's actions with respect to the Project.
Petitioners will amend this Petition to show their true names and capacities if and when they 11 have been ascertained.
12 JURISDICTION AND VENUE
13 11. This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this Petition pursuant to
14 Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 (alternatively section 1085) and Public Resources Code
15 sections 21168 (alternatively section 21168.5) and section 21168.9.
16 12. Venue is proper in this Court because the causes of action alleged in this Petition
17 arose in Solano County, where the Project was approved and would be carried out.
18 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

19 AND INADEQUACY OF REMEDY

20 13. Petitioners have performed any and all conditions precedent to filing the instant

21 action and have exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent required

22 by law.

23 14. Petitioners have complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code

24 section 21167.5 by serving a written notice of Petitioners' intention to commence this action on

25 the City on August 9, 2022. Copies of the written notice and proof of service are attached

26 hereto as Exhibit A.

27

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

15. Petitioners will comply with the requirements of Public Resources Code section
2 21167.6 by concurrently filing a notice of Petitioner's election to prepare the record of
3 administrative proceedings relating to this action. A copy of the filing is attached as Exhibit B.

4 16. Petitioners are complying with the requirements of Public Resources Code

5 section 21167.7 by sending a copy of this Petition to the California Attorney General within ten

6 (10) days of filing this Petition. A copy of the letter transmitting this Petition is attached hereto

7 as Exhibit C.

8 17. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary
law unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to set aside

10 Respondents' approval of the Project. In the absence of such remedies, Respondents' approval
will remain in effect in violation of state law.
11
18.
12 This action has been brought within 35 days of Respondents filing a Notice of
Exemption as required by Public Resources Code section 21167(d).
13 19, Petitioners' representatives and others submitted comments on the Project raising
14 the issue of CEQA and Zoning Code compliance including, but not limited to, public testimony
15 ai the City's January 25, 2022, June 7, 2022, and July 5, 2022 City Council Hearings.
16 STATEMENT OF FACTS

17 20. The Project is located on Broadway Street north of Mini Drive in the City of
18 Vallejo. The Project site does a not have a street address and is instead identified as Assessor

19 Parcel Number 0067-140-150.

20 21. The Project site is 0.53 acres in size and has City General Plan land use

21 designation of District-North Gateway and a zoning designation of Central Corridor a

22 Commercial under the City's Zoning Code. The Project site is currently undeveloped and

23 supports several mature trees and open grasslands.

24 22. The Project site is bounded on the north by the American Canyon Dog Park and

25 American Canyon Veterans Memorial Park, on the east by an existing single family residential

26 neighborhood, the south by a two-story, conventional apartment building, and on the west by an

27 operating heavy freight railroad line and Highway 29.

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 23. The Project proposes the development of a 48-unit permanent supportive housing

2 project targeted for chronically homeless individuals. The Project utilizes unique modular unit

3 construction model with 40 modular units assembled into a four-story building configuration

4 and eight units oriented in a single story duet configuration. The project also includes 16 at

5 grade parking spaces and a communal common area on site.

6 24. Petitioners are informed and believe that existing wet and dry utility services are

7 not physically available at the Project site and, therefore, would need to be extended to the

8 Project site from an off-site location.

25.
9 Petitioners are further informed and believe that, although the Project will require

10 a density bonus and development standard concession, the Project Applicants have not applied
for a density bonus or development standard concession, nor has the City approved an 11 application for a density bonus or development standard concessions pursuant to its Zoning
12 Code.
13 26. a The Homekey Program is a state program to expand housing for people
14 experiencing homelessness or at risk of homelessness. The California Department of Housing
15 and Community Development ("Department") administers the Homekey Program. The
16 Department made approximately $1.4 billion in grant funding available to local public entities
17 for the second round of the Homekey Program. The Department released the Homekey
18 Round 2 Notice of Funding Availability on or around September 9, 2021, and the program
19 application in late September 2021.

20 27. On January 25, 2022, the City Council approved a resolution authorizing the City
21 Manager to apply for Project Homekey Round 2 Funding. The resolution further authorized the

22 City Manager to make the application in conjunction with Firm Foundation Community

23 Housing as its co-applicant for the purposes of developing of a 48-unit permanent supportive

24 housing project located on Broadway Street at Assessor Parcel Number 0067-140-150. The

25 resolution was approved on a 5-2 vote, with Mayor McConnell and Councilmember Arriola

26 voting "no". Petitioners are informed and believe that the City asserted that its actions were

27 exempt from CEQA, but it did not file a notice of exemption in support of the approved
resolution.
28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 28. On January 31, 2022 the City and its co-applicant, Firm Foundation Community

2 Housing and Shelter, submitted an application to the Department requesting Project Homekey

3 Round 2 Funding consistent with the approved January 25, 2022 City Council Resolution.

4 29. On May 10, 2022, the Department announced that the City and Firm Foundation

5 Community Housing had been awarded Project Homekey Round 2 Funding in the amount of

6 $12,091,866 for the proposed Broadway Project to construct the 48-unit permanent supportive

7 housing project identified in the City's application.

8 30. On June 7, 2022, the City Council approved a resolution accepting the Project

9 Homekey Round 2 Funding award. Furthermore, staff initiated a request to amend the City

10 budget to include the Project Homekey Round 2 award monies and to authorize expenditures of

11 those monies. The resolution was approved by the City Council on a 4-1-2 a vote, with
Councilmember Brown absent and Mayor McConnell and Councilmember Arriola voting "no".
12 Petitioners are informed and believe that the City asserted that its actions were exempt from
13 CEQA, but it did not file a notice of exemption in support of the approved resolution.
14 31. On June 14, 2022, the City Council approved a resolution amending the city
15 budget and authorizing expenditure of the Project Homekey Round Two award. The resolution
16 was again approved by the City Council on a 4-1-2 vote, with Councilmember Brown absent
17 and Mayor McConnell and Councilmember Arriola voting "no."
18 32. On July 5, 2022, the City Council approved three resolutions. The first resolution

19 exempted all actions related to approval of the Broadway Project from CEQA pursuant to Public

20 Resources Code sections 21159.23, 21159.24, and 21080(b); Health and Safety Code section

21 50675.1.4; and CEQA Guidelines sections 15194, 15195, 15268, and 15332. The second
22 resolution authorized the City Manager to execute and record a declaration of restrictive

23 covenants against a Project site located at Assessor Parcel Number 0067-140-150. The third and

24 final resolution authorized the City Manager to acquire the Broadway Project upon its

25 completion.

26 33. On July 6, 2022, the City filed its Notice of Exemption with the Clerk of the

27 Board of Supervisors of the County of Solano.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 34. Petitioners are informed and believed that they and other concerned residents

2 unrelated to Petitioners have submitted substantial evidence supporting a fair argument that the

3 Project will have a substantial adverse environmental effect on the environment, that unusual

4 circumstances exist creating an exception to the City's use of any categorical exemption, and

5 that the City's reliance on statutory and ministerial exemptions are unsupported by the facts in

6 the record.

7 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

8 (Violations of CEQA; Public Resources Code)

35.
9 Petitioner hereby realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1 through 34 above,
inclusive.
10
36.
11 CEQA is designed to ensure that the long term protection of the environment be
the guiding criteria in decisions. CEQA requires the preparation of an EIR for a project 12 whenever substantial evidence in the record supports a fair argument that the project may have a
13 significant effect on the environment.
14 37. CEQA also requires that an agency's findings for the approval of a project be
15 supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record and provide an explanation of
16 how the record evidence supports the conclusions the agency has reached.
17 38. Respondents violated CEQA by improperly relying on a series of statutory,
18 ministerial, and categorical exceptions without substantial evidence in the record to support
19 those exceptions and instead relied on conclusory statements unsupported by and inconsistent
20 with the facts in the record.

21 39. Respondents improperly applied Public Resource Code section 21159.23(a)(2)

22 related to exemptions for affordable low-income housing projects by failing to comply with the

23 requirements of Public Resources Code section 21159.21(c) which is incorporated by reference,

24 and in relevant part, requires that "the project. . . can be adequately served by existing

25 utilities[.l" Notwithstanding the City's conclusory statement in its Notice Of Exemption,

26 evidence in the record demonstrates that the Project site does not have access to wet and dry

27 utilities and, therefore, that the Project cannot be adequately served until extensive off-site

28 utility construction has been completed. The need for these off-site utility extensions has not

8
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 been addressed by the City or the Project Applicant. Indeed, the Project Applicant has not
2 budgeted for or even identified these off-site improvements in it's Project Homekey Round Two

3 Funding application.

4 40. Respondents' reliance on Public Resources Code section 21159.24 also fails in

5 that it also incorporates by reference the requirements of Public Resources Code section

6 21159.21(c) related to adequate existing utilities services. Again, the record demonstrates that

7 these utility services are not available absent extensive off-site improvements that have not been

8 addressed by the City or the Project Applicant. In addition to the above, Public Resources Code

9 section 21159.24(b) further provides that its exemption is not available if "[t]here is a

10 reasonable possibility that the project will have a project-specific, significant effect on the
I environment due to unusual circumstances." Here, the Project's unique construction 11 methodology, which utilizes stacked modular units presents an unusual circumstance. Given the
12 Project's location immediately adjacent to an existing railroad line and in the vicinity of a known
13 earthquake fault, there is a reasonable possibility that a project-specific, significant affect related
14 to geologic conditions and soil stability could occur as a result of the projects unique
15 construction method.

16 41. Further, Respondents reliance on public resources code section 21080(b) relevant
17 to ministerial projects is also unavailing. Absent the ministerial approval of a density bonus and
18 development concession, the Project, as proposed, would not be permitted pursuant to the City's
19 existing General Plan and Zoning designations. There is no evidence in the record
20 demonstrating that the Project Applicant has applied for a density bonus or development

21 concession, nor is there any evidence that the City has approved any density bonus or
22 development concession application. Absent an active application, there is no reasonable ability

23 to ascertain whether the Project would or could comply with the Zoning Code's density bonus

24 standards and thereby qualifying as a ministerial project.

25 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

26 (Violations of CEQA; Health and Safety Code)
42.
27 Petitioners hereby realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1 through 41 above,
inclusive.
28

g
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

43. Health And Safety Code section 50675.1.4 provides that, notwithstanding any

2 other law, CEQA shall not apply to any project funded pursuant to the provisions of 5075.1.3

3 [Project Homekey Round 2 Funding] if it can not meet certain applicable requirements.

4 Relevant here, Health and Safety Code section 50675.1.4(9) provides, in relevant part, that a

5 project does not qualify for an exemption if the project results in an increase in existing on-site

6 development footprint of structure, structures, or improvements by more than 10%.

7 44. The Project proposes to develop an existing vacant parcel with 40 studio units in

8 a four-story building, 8 single story duet units, and 16 on-site parking stalls with associated
circulation areas. On its face, these improvements, on little more than 0.53 acres of land,

10 unequivocally exceed the 10% improvement limit contained in Public Resources Code section
50675.1 and, therefore, precludes its use as a viable basis for exemption from the requirements 11 of CEQA.
12 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

13 (Violations of CEQA; CEQA Guidelines)
14 45. Petitioners hereby realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1 through 44 above,
15 inclusive.

16 46. Petitioners further attempts to rely on CEQA Guidelines sections 15194 and
17 15195 also fail. Both CEQA Guidelines incorporate by reference the threshold requirements of

18 CEQA Guidelines section 15192, which provides, in relevant part, that projects seeking an

19 exemption must have access to adequate existing utilities. As previously noted, the proposed

20 Project does not have access to adequate existing utilities and extensive off-site improvements

21 must be completed to adequately serve the Project. Moreover, CEQA Guidelines section 15195

22 further restricts the use of its exemption if a project has the reasonable possibility of resulting in

23 a project-specific, significant effect due to unusual circumstances. Again, as noted above, the

24 Project's unique construction methodology coupled with its proximity to an existing railroad

25 line as well as an existing earthquake fault creates the reasonable possibility of project-specific,
significant effects due to the Project's unusual construction technics.
26
47. Petitioners' reliance on the definition of ministerial project contained in CEQA 27 Guidelines section 15268 also fails. The proposed Project is not consistent with the City's
28

10
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 applicable General Plan and Zoning designations absent approval of a ministerial density bonus

2 application. There is, however, no evidence in the record that the Project Applicant has applied

3 for a density bonus or development concession, nor is there any evidence that the City has

4 approved any density bonus or development concession application. There is no reasonable

5 ability to ascertain whether the Project would or could comply with the City's ministerial

6 Zoning Code's density bonus standards. Therefore, the City cannot rely on a ministerial

7 approval if it has not processed an application demonstrating that the Project can met the Zoning

8 Code's ministerial approval standards.
48. Finally, Petitioners unsuccessfully rely on the infill development exemption

10 contained in CEQA Guidelines section 15332. As with the City's other asserted exemptions, its

11 efforts are unsupported by the facts and the record. First, section 15332(d) provides that the

12 proposed project must be "adequately served by all required utilities and public services". As
noted above, the facts in the record demonstrate that the Project cannot meet this requirement
13 given the extensive off-site improvements that are necessary. Second, as a Categorical
14 Exemption, section 15332 is subject to the exceptions outlined in CEQA Guidelines section
15 15300.2. In particular, section 15300.2(c) provides that a categorical exemption shall not be
16 used if there is a "reasonable possibility that the activity will have significant effect on the
17 environment due to unusual circumstances." As noted above, there is a reasonable possibility
18 that the Project's unusual construction methodologies will result in significant effects on the
19 environment - particularly as they relate to geology and soil stability. For these reasons, the

20 City's effort to rely on the exemption contained in Public Resources Code section 15332 must

21 fail.

22 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

23 WHEREFORE, Petitioners prays for judgment as follows:

24 1. For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing Respondents to vacate

25 and set aside approval of the Project;

26 2. For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing Respondents to

27 comply with CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines, and to take any other action as required by

28 Public Resources Code section 21168.9;

Re: Notice of Intent to File CEQA Petition: Russell Charpentier and William Baker v. City of Vallejo

Dear City Clerk:
This letter is to notify you pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.5 that individuals Russell Charpentier and William Baker, intend to file a Petition for Writ of Mandate in Solano County Superior Court against the City of Vallejo and City Council of the City of Vallejo for failure to comply with the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code section 21000 et seq., and the CEQA Guidelines, California Code of Regulations section 15000 et seq.
This action challenges the actions by the City of Vallejo and its City Council between January 25, 2022, and July 5, 2022, approving multiple resolutions in support of the development and construction by Firm Foundation Community Housing of a Home Key 2.0 Program Project known as the Broadway Project located on Broadway Street at Assessor Parcel Number 0067- 140-150 in Vallejo.
The Petition for Writ of Mandate requests that the court direct the City of Vallejo and the Vallejo City Council to vacate and rescind its adoption of the aforementioned resolutions and to comply with CEQA. Additionally, the Petition will seek Petitioner's costs and attorney's fees associated with this action.

Very truly yours,
HARRISON, TEMBLADOR, HUNGERFORD & GUERNSEY LLP T David P. Temblador, Esq.
