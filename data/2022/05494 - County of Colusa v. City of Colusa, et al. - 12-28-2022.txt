21 STATEMENT OF FACTS

22 18. In or around 2005, Respondent and Real Party in Interest CIP submitted an

23 application to the County to allow the development of 151 acres of property just south of the City

24 of Colusa in unincorporated Colusa County. CIP proposed the development of a mixed-use

25 community, including approximately 286 residential units, 140 of which were designated as single-

26 family residences, improvements to the existing golf course, various commercial and office space

27 of approximately 116,580 square feet along State Route 20, and wastewater treatment facilities to

28 serve the mixed-use community and other uses.

4

Second Amended Petition for Writ of Mandate

19. The proposed development of the mixed-use community necessitated amendments to

2 the Colusa County General Plan and Zoning Ordinance, including (1) changes in land use

3 designation for 138 acres from Industrial (I) to Urban Residential (UR), Parks and Recreation (P-
4 R), and Commercial (C); (2) change in land use designation for 13 acres from Parks and Recreation

5 (P-R) to Urban Residential (UR); (3) change in zoning for 138 acres from Industrial (M) and
vO Industrial Planned Development (M-PD) to Single Family Residential (R-1-8), High Density
7 Residential (R-4), General Recreation (G-R), Neighborhood Commercial (C-1), Community
8 Commercial (C-2), and Highway Commercial (CH); and (4) change in zoning for 13 acres from
9 General Recreation (G-R) to High Density Residential (R-4).
10 20. The County served as the lead agency for purposes of reviewing and approving the
11 proposed project, including environmental review and certification of a Final Environmental Impact
12 Report (EIR) pursuant to CEQA.
13
21. In or around November 2007, the Draft Environmental Impact Report (DEIR) for the 14 above-referenced project was prepared and circulated for public review and comment (SCH No. 15
2006052113).
16
22. The DEIR explained, inter alia, that the project was located adjacent to the Colusa 17

18 County Airport and fell within the influence area of the County's Airport Land Use Compatibility

19 Plan (ALUCP).

20 23. With regard to the CIP project's proposed single-family residences build-out, the

21 DEIR analyzed the environmental impacts associated with the construction of a maximum of 140

22 single-family residential units.

23 24. Pursuant to Public Utilities Code section 21675, subdivision (b), local agencies must

24 refer proposed projects that include land use changes requiring amendments to a general or specific

25 plan, or the adoption or approval of a zoning ordinance or building regulation that fall within the

26 influence area of the ALUCP, which included the CIP project, to the ALUC for review of the

27 proposed project's consistency with the ALUCP.

28 /11

5

Second Amended Petition for Writ of Mandate

25. The legislative purpose behind the formation of an ALUC is set forth in Public

2 Utilities Code section 21670, which identifies, in relevant part, the protection of public health,

3 safety, and welfare by ensuring the orderly expansion of airports and the adoption of land use

4 measures that minimize the public's exposure to excessive noise and safety hazards within areas

5 around public airports to the extent that these areas are not already devoted to incompatible uses.

6 26. Each ALUC is charged with formulating an ALUCP that provides for the orderly

7 growth of each public airport and the area surrounding the airport within the jurisdiction of the

8 commission, and safeguards the general welfare of the inhabitants within the vicinity of the airport
and the public in general.
10 27. In formulating an ALUCP, the ALUC may develop height restrictions on buildings,
11 specify use of land, and determine building standards, including soundproofing adjacent to airports,
12 within the airport influence area.
13 28. In 2007, pursuant the requirements of Public Utilities Code section 21676,
14 subdivision (b), the County referred the proposed CIP project to the ALUC for review of the
15

16 proposed project's consistency with the ALUCP.

29. On or about December 18, 2007, the ALUC, in accordance with Public Utilities
17

18 Code Section 21676(b), notified the County of its findings related the proposed project's

19 inconsistency with the ALUCP.

20 30. More specifically, the ALUC's findings of project inconsistency with the ALUCP

21 included: (I) the proposed concentration of residential units and people exceeding the limits of the

22 ALUCP, with the associated impacts and risks not being adequately mitigated; (2) a determination

23 that the proposed business inside the Safety Area may create a concentration of people that exceed a

24 the limits established in the ALUCP, with the associated impacts and risks not mitigated; and (3)

25 the impact of existing airport noise on the proposed residential units and businesses exceeded the

26 limits established by the ALUCP, with the impacts and risks not fully mitigated.
27 ///

Second Amended Petition for Writ of Mandate

31. Public Utilities Code Section 21676(b) authorizes a local agency to override ALUC

2 findings of a proposed project's inconsistency with an ALUCP following a public hearing on a
e AW proposal to overrule the ALUC by a two-thirds vote of its governing body upon specific findings
that the proposed action is consistent with the purposes stated in Public Utilities Code section
21670.

32. On or about May 27, 2008, the Colusa County Board of Supervisors held a public
A hearing on the ALUC's determination that the proposed project was inconsistent with the ALUCP.
8 Following the public hearing, the Board of Supervisors made findings in accordance with Public
9 Utilities Code section 21676.5(a) that the proposed project was consistent with the purposes set
10 forth in Public Utilities Code section 21670. In doing so, the Board of Supervisors overruled the
11 ALUC's determination that the proposed project was inconsistent with the ALUCP.
12 33. In overruling the ALUC's determination that the proposed CIP project was
13 inconsistent with the ALUCP, the Board of Supervisors identified additional mitigation measures
14 that had been drafted specifically to address the issues identified by the ALUC that were deemed 15

16 inconsistent with the ALUCP. These included, inter alia,: (1) modifying mitigation measure LU-4b

17 to require the applicant to enter into an avigation easement agreement with the County; (2)

18 requiring the applicant to notify all prospective purchasers and users of property in the project area

19 of the inconveniences or discomforts that may accompany the airport operations; and (3) adopting

20 new mitigation measure N4-h to reduce the number of low density residential units in the southwest

21 portion of the project area from the maximum 140 analyzed in the DEIR to 84 units, thereby

22 resulting in a wider aircraft corridor adjacent to the project area described in the DEIR.

23 34. On or about April 18, 2014, some seven years after the City's adoption of its 2007

24 Master Environmental Report (*MEIR") pertaining to its General Plan, and prior to the annexation

25 of the CIP project location into the City, the City prepared an Initial Study, which purported to

26 evaluate whether the annexation of the project site into the City would result in additional

27 environmental impacts not covered in the 2007 MEIR; the Initial Study states its purpose was to

28 "evaluate the project for any potential, adverse environmental impacts ABOVE AND BEYOND

7

Second Amended Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 those already identified and mitigated within the above-referenced MEIR, and for some of which

2 the City Council duly adopted a statement of overriding considerations. None of the project

3 components would cause any additional significant effect on the environment which was not

4 previously examined in the MEIR." The 2014 Initial Study referenced the CIP EIR certified by the
5 County of Colusa in 2008 and stated that mitigation measures in the CIP EIR apply to the project.

6 Petitioner has been unable to locate the purported statement of overriding considerations mentioned

7 in the Initial Study.

8 35. The Initial Study concluded that no new additional mitigation measures or

4 alternatives specific to the proposed project may be required, that the CIP project was within the
10 scope of the City's MEIR, and that no additional environmental review was required in accordance
11 with Section 15177(a) and (b) of the CEQA Guidelines.
12 36. In September 2014, the ALUC adopted a new ALUCP to govern uses within its
13 defined airport influence area, including the CIP project site. The new ALUCP included revised
14 standards and criteria to protect public health, safety and welfare, and the operations and orderly
15 development of the airport, including new "compatibility zones." 16
37. On or about September 30, 2015, the Executive Director of the Colusa County Local 17

18 Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) recorded a Certificate of Completion with regard to the

19 annexation of the CIP residential development property into the City.

38. 20 In or around April of 2016, the Colusa City Council adopted Ordinance No. 513,

• -.-. -m om. 21 approving a development agreement between the property owner of the CIP residential project and

22 the City, which reflected amendments to the project that included, inter alia, the expansion of

23 single-family residential units from the 84 units approved by the County in 2008 (a limit required

24 by mitigation measure N4-h) to 180 units. At the same time, however, the City required, as a

25 condition of approval, that the project comply with all of the mitigation measures in the CIP EIR,

26 including mitigation measures N4-h.

27 ///

28 /1/

Second Amended Petition for Writ of Mandate

F 39. In support of the approval, Ordinance No. 513 stated that the project "was addressed

2 within the General Plan Amendment and Zoning Amendment for Colusa Industrial Properties -

3 Draft and Final Environmental Impact Reports ("CIP EIR"), certified by the County of Colusa in
+ 10 0 2008.33

40. Ordinance No. 513 also noted that, in 2007, the City certified the MEIR for its
General Plan, and that in 2014, the City Council considered the Initial Study, which determined the
7 project would have no additional significant effect on the environment, that no new additional

scope of 8 mitigation measures or alternatives may be required, and that the project was within the
9 the General Plan MEIR, pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15177. Although Ordinance No. 513
10 mentioned documents the City had considered in the past for other proposals, it did not identify
11 how the City was complying with CEQA for the expanded proposal, and did not consider whether
12 additional environmental review was required.
13
41. On or about May 17, 2016, the Colusa City Council passed Resolution No. 16-14
14 approving Tentative Map 01-16, which approved the subdivision of approximately 57.42 acres of 15
land into approximately 180 residential low-density single-family lots, with the remainder parcels 16
for open space, landscaping and related uses. 17
42. The City's approval of the CIP project's Tentative Map by way of passage of 18

19 Resolution No. 16-14 referenced the same or similar CEQA findings set forth in Ordinance 513,

20 including a finding that the proposed CIP project was within the scope of the City's MEIR. The

21 City again cited the 2014 Initial Study, which analyzed a different version of the project.

22 43. As a condition of approval for the tentative map, the City required the developer to

23 comply with the mitigation measures in the County's project-specific 2008 EIR, as well as the

24 mitigation measures in the City's 2007 General Plan MEIR.

25 44. Subsequent to the City's adoption of Ordinance No. 513, and passage of Resolution

26 No. 16-14, on or about April 18, 2017, the City adopted Ordinance 516 to amend the development

27 agreement to include language omitted from Ordinance 513 pertaining to water and sewer

28 availability, which was followed by passage of Resolution No. 18-21 on April 3, 2018, thereby

9

Second Amended Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 approving Tentative Map 01-18, which amended and replaced Tentative Map 01-16. Ordinance 516

2 acknowledged that the County certified an EIR for the project in 2008. The amended development

3 agreement subjects development of the project to the City's "Existing Rules" which include both

4 the City's Master EIR and the mitigation measures in the project-specific EIR approved by the

5 County.

6 45. The City's approval of the Tentative Map by way of Resolutions 16-14 and 18-21

7 relied on several incorrect findings as to the project's environmental review process, including (1)

8 the project being part of the City's 2007 MEIR; (2) the City Council's consideration and reliance on

9 2014 Initial Study in determining that that no additional significant effects on the environment
10 existed with regard to the amended project; (3) that no new/additional mitigation measures or
11 alternatives related to environmental impacts resulting from the project may be required; (4) that
12 the project is within the scope of the MEIR; and (5) that the proposed subdivision and
13 improvements are not likely to cause public health problems.
14 The City's 2007 General Plan MEIR
15
46. The City's MEIR, adopted in or around July 2007, some eight months prior to the
16

17 County's approval of the EIR specific to the proposed CIP project, was created for the purpose of

18 addressing, at a programmatic level, potential environmental impacts of the City's General Plan.

47.
19 The City's 2007 MEIR was not the EIR document considered and certified by the

20 County in 2008 with regard to the CIP project. Rather, despite the existence of the City's MEIR, the

21 County determined that a separate EIR was required under CEQA to analyze the project's impacts.

22 Neither CIP nor the City objected to the County's determination that a project-specific EIR was

23 required under CEQA.

24 48. While the City's MEIR references the CIP project (page 3.0-13) as falling within

25 one of several identified "Special Planning Areas," and indicates "[t]he City's intent for this

26 planning area is that it be annexed to the City with a mix of land uses including low-density

27 residential on the western portion of the site; commercial professional along the SR 20/45 corridor;

28 and Parks, Recreation and Open Space within the airport overflight zone,* this MEIR was not relied

10

Second Amended Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 on by the County, as the lead agency, as the MEIR was for the City's General Plan, and did not

2 cover the CIP proposed project. Rather, as already explained, the County prepared and certified an

3 EIR specific for the project.
n 49. The City's MEIR did not analyze the CIP project. As stated on page 4.0-7 of the
MEIR, only three projects within the Special Planning Areas were analyzed through the MEIR.
6 The CIP project was not one of these three projects, which included (i) Colusa Riverbend; (ii)
7 Colusa Crossings; and (iii) Brookins Ranch.
8 50. As the CIP project was not one of the three projects analyzed in the MEIR, it was
9 subject to separate environmental review. Page 4.0-2 of the MEIR noted "environmental review in
10 process" for the CIP project relating to a "General Plan Amendment and rezone, resulting in
11 potential construction of approximately 200 residences and commercial properties, adjacent to
12 Colusa County Airport."
13 51. With regard to planning activities that involve project proposals within the ALUCP's 14

15 Airport Overflight Zone, the MEIR notes that some of the project site is situated within the "Airport

16 Overflight Zone, and that the City would review the CIP project, as with all projects falling within

17 the CLUP Airport Overflight Zone to determine consistency with the ALUCP. More specifically,

18 page 3.0-14 of the City's MEIR states:

19 Airport Overflight Zone Large areas of land within the City's Sphere of Influence lie within the boundaries of the
20 Colusa County Airport Comprehensive Land Use Plan (CLUP). A portion of this land, including some of the Colusa Industrial Park site, is situated within the
S Airport Overflight Zone, as designated in the CLUP. This zone generally coincides with the area overflown by aircraft during normal traffic patterns procedures.
23
24 Most of the proposed Planning Area within the airport overflight zone is designated on the proposed Land Use Diagram as
25 Parks/Recreation/Open Space, but some is designated Low-Density Residential. Whether proposed for annexation or not, the City would
26 review all project proposals within the CLUP Airport Overflight Zone to ensure compliance with the CLUP.
27

28 //1

Second Amended Petition for Writ of Mandate

52. The City's May 17, 2016, passage

2 of Resolutions Nos. 16-14 and 18-21, which

3 approved Tentative Maps 01-16 and 01-18, did not include any reference to the City's, or the
ALUC's, review of the amended CIP project for consistency with the ALUCP. The same is the

5 case with regard to the City's adoption of Ordinances 513 and 516, pertaining to the respective
adoption of, and amendment to, the development agreements for the CIP project.

53.

7 Nor did Resolution Nos. 16-14 or 18-21 expressly consider the project-specific EIR.

8 Rather, these Resolutions reference a 2014 "Colusa Industrial Park Initial Study," along with the
City's 2007 MEIR, as the environmental documents supporting the City's finding that the project

10 would have no additional impacts on the environment, that no new additional mitigation measures

11 or alternatives may be required, and that the project is "within the scope" of the MEIR. The Initial

12 Study, however, only considered annexation of the project site into the City's boundaries; the

13 project considered in that document was the one approved by the County, without any changes.
54.
14 Similarly, the City's findings and conclusions set forth in Ordinance Nos. 513 and

15 516, pertaining to the City's respective adoption of, and amendment to, the development

16 agreements for the CIP project, which included the increased number of single-family residences

17 from the 84 approved by the County in 2008 to the 180 approved by the City, erroncously state that

18 the revised project is "within the scope" of the MEIR

:! 19 55. By not first referring the CIP project to the ALUC for a determination as to the

20 amended project's consistency with the ALUCP, the City's passage of Ordinances 513 and 527,

21 pertaining to the approval of the development agreements for the CIP project, and Resolutions 16-

22 (4 and 18-21, pertaining to the approval of the Tentative Map for the CIP project, along with

23

24 findings that the proposed subdivision, as conditioned, was compatible with adjacent land uses,
were done so in error and without proper authority:

25 56.

26 Public Utilities Code section 21676(b) requires that prior to the amendment of a

27 general or specific plan, or the adoption or approval of zoning ordinances or building regulations

28 within the planning boundary established by the ALUC pursuant to section 21675, the local agency
shall first refer the proposed action to the ALUC for ALUCP consistency review.

12

Second Amended Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 57. Further, ALUC review of amendments to a project within its boundaries is also

2 mandated under the ALUCP itself, including Sections 1.4.3(c) pertaining to subsequent revisions to

3 a project; Section 2.2.2(e) pertaining to the ALUC's review of the consistency of development |
agreements with the ALUCP; Section 2.6.4(b) pertaining to additional review of projects where the
5 design subsequently changes in a manner that affects previously considered compatibility issues for
6 subsequent review and determination as to whether the amendments to the nature and scope of the
7 project that were not part of the ALUC's review in 2007 were consistent with the ALUCP.

8 58. As the ALUC determined in 2007 that the then-proposed concentration of residential
9 units and people exceeded the limits of the ALUCP, which the County then considered and
10 mitigated through a significant reduction in the number of approved single-family residential units,
11 the City's subsequent approval of approximately 180 single family residences-which represents an
12 additional 40 single-family residences beyond the maximum 140 considered in the 2007 EIR, and
13

14 approximately 96 more than the limit required by the mitigation adopted by the County in 2008 and

15 later imposed on the project by the City-was neither in conformity with the CIP project's EIR, the

16 2007 ALUC findings, nor the mandatory ALUC review requirements to determine consistency with

the ALUCP.
17
59.
18 Notably, moreover, the City's approvals for the project, including the development

19 agreement and tentative map, were all expressly conditioned on compliance with the mitigation

20 measures in the CIP project-specific EIR, including mitigation measure N4-h which capped the

21 number of low-density residential units in the western portion of the project area at 84 units.

22 60. Subsequent to the City's aforementioned approvals of the development agreement

23 and Tentative Map for the CIP project, construction of the first phase of the project, known as

24 "Sunrise Landing." commenced.

25 61. In 2020, following the submittal of building permits pertaining to the project, the

26 Colusa County Airport Manager became aware that the project under construction was different

27 from the project approved by the Colusa County Board of Supervisors in 2008.

62. In response to multiple formal and informal inquiries by the County to the City

N starting in 2020, regarding the City's amendments and approvals for the proposed project, including

3 the status of any noise mitigation measures pertaining to the planned increased number of
4 residences, the County was informed that an acoustical study had not been completed to address

5 noise impacts resulting from the proximity of the project to the County airport, and that the City

6 had determined the nature of the insulation and wall framing of the residences being constructed

7 would be adequate to mitigate aircraft noise.
8 63. In response to findings in the CIP EIR that the entire proposed CIP development
area would be exposed to aircraft noise levels of 55 dB CNEL or greater, resulting in a significant
10 impact under CEQA, the project applicant was required to obtain an acoustical professional to
11 conduct an acoustical investigation for purposes of evaluating with requisite certainty that the
12 impacts of aircraft activities on the noise levels within the residences under development will meet
13 acceptable interior noise level standards consistent with the ALUCP and County standards, which
14 cannot be higher than 45 dB CNEL. The City's MEIR, section 4.4, also includes the same noise
15

16 standards related to airport caused noise.

64. Based on information and belief, as of the date of this Second Amended Petition, the
17

18 acoustical investigation required by the mitigation measure has not been conducted.

65. On or about July 21, 2021, the City completed a "Residential Building Façade Noise 19
1i
20 Reduction Assessment" related to the CIP project for the purpose of ".quantif[ying] the aircraft

21 noise reduction provided by the residences being constructed within the development."
-•-
22 66. According to the July 21, 2021, Residential Building Façade Noise Reduction

23 Assessment, noise measurements were taken from the location of the CIP project's model homes,
E 24 as depicted in figure 2 of the Assessment, thereby not including the remaining areas of the

25 undeveloped planned residential areas as part of the site locations for noise measurements.

26 67. According to the Residential Building Façade Noise Reduction Assessment, Ldn

27 values ranged from 53-58 dB Ldn. The Assessment did not indicate that samples had been taken

28 from areas where noise exposure in excess of 70 dB would be present, but indicated, as precursor to

14

Second Amended Petition for Writ of Mandate

specific recommended construction upgrades required to meet noise standards, that such noise

2 exposure in excess of 70 dB would leave "little margin for error in construction or materials to

3 ensure satisfaction with the 45 Db Ldn interior requirement." Further, the Assessment indicated
4 that while the Ldn values were below those predicted for aircraft utilizing the Western departure

5 flight path, it was possible that the aircraft flight conditions were atypical during the survey, and, as

6 a result, the ambient noise measurement results were being provided for acoustical context and

7 were not purported to be representative of typical aircraft noise generation at the CIP project site.
8 City's Referral of the CIP Project to the ALUC
9 68. On or about February 21, 2021, the City acknowledged that it was required to refer
10 the amended project to the ALUC for a consistency review with the ALUCP.
11 69. On or
12 about March 1, 2021, and March 11, 2021, the ALUC reviewed the project for
consistency with the 2014 ALUCP.
13
70. ALUC Resolution 21-003, dated March 11, 2021, set forth the Commission's
14

15 findings as to the amended project's consistency with the 2014 ALUCP, preliminarily noting that

16 the City was required to refer the entitlement actions associated with the amendments to the CIP

17 project prior to taking any action on the entitlements.

71.
18 Further, ALUC Resolution 21-003 specifies that the ALUCP requires the ALUC to

19 review the various CIP residential City entitlement approvals for consistency with the ALUCP prior

20 to the City taking action on these entitlements, which the City failed to do prior to entering into the

21 2016 development agreement and Tentative Map on the CIP project via Ordinance No. 513 and

22 Resolution 16-14, respectively, and again in 2018 when it amended the development agreement and

23 issuing a new Tentative Map, which served to amend the Tentative Map approved in 2016, via

24 Ordinance No. 516 and Resolution 18-21, respectively.

25 72. According to the March 11, 2021, findings of the ALUC, the City's 2018, approval

26 of Tentative Map 01-18 for the project was a new version of the prior approval document, Tentative

27 Map 16-14, and represented the filing of an amended subdivision map that was significantly
28 different in terms of the number of residential units and types of residential units from the County's

15

Second Amended Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 2008 CIP project approval.

2 73. Further, the ALUC concluded that no prior development agreements had been

C submitted to the ALUC for consistency review with the ALUCP, as required pursuant to section
2.2.2(e) of the ALUCP.

74. Further, the ALUC made specific findings that the amended CIP project was
inconsistent with the 2014 ALUCP for numerous reasons, including:
7 With regard to the location of the project's residential development in Compatibility Zones
8 B-1, C-1, and C-2, the ALUC concluded that the average and maximum densities set forth
in Tentative Map 01-18 exceed the average and maximum densities detailed in Table 3A of
259 the ALUCP, thereby making Tentative Map 01-18 inconsistent with the ALUCP.
With regard to noise levels, the ALUC concluded that a number of the homes included in

13 Tentative Map 01-18 will have an interior noise level exceeding the ALUCP interim 45 dB

14 Ldn noise standards, thereby making Tentative Map 01-18 inconsistent with the ALUCP.
Additionally, the ALUC noted that the portions of the residential project are located above
15

16 the 70 dB Ldn noise contour projected in the project's adopted 2008 EIR, which specified

17 that an acoustical professional must conduct an acoustical investigation to identify the

18 construction measures necessary in order to meet the interior noise standards of the ALUCP

19 and the County, which are also set at the same maximum by the City at 45 dB Ldn. Such an

20 acoustical study in accordance with the final 2008 project EIR was not completed or

21 required by the City. Further, the ALUC noted that without the acoustical study required by

22 the 2008 final EIR, it is not possible to confirm with a reasonable high-degree of certainty

23 that the internal noise levels of all the homes will meet the 45 dB Ldn standard.

24 With regard to the development agreement with the City, the ALUC found that: "The

25 Development Agreement between the residential developer and the City of Colusa obligates

26 the City to allow the construction of the residential project as long as the developer meets

27 their contractual obligations. Based on the findings of inconsistency with the ALUCP given

28 the density and noise levels, said Development Agreement which allows for the construction

16

Second Amended Petition for Writ of Mandate

of the residential project would also be inconsistent with the ALUCP."

Nm 75. After the City released a staff report and proposed resolution to override the ALUC's
inconsistency determination, the ALUC, County, and others submitted comments objecting to the
proposed override on numerous grounds. The letters identified numerous mitigation measures that
5 were apparently not being implemented or enforced by the City, including Mitigation Measures

6 LU-la, Mitigation Measure LU-4a, Mitigation Measures LU-4b, Mitigation Measures LU-4j,
7 Mitigation Measure N-4a, Mitigation Measure N-4b, Mitigation Measure N-4i, Mitigation Measure
8 M-4h, Mitigation Measure HHM-3a, Mitigation Measure HHM-3g, and Mitigation Measure HHM-
9 3f. The letter from the ALUC explained that the City was required to identify the specific
10 mitigation measures that were adopted to protect the public health, safety, and welfare and explain
11 how the project will comply with those requirements. The letter from the County demanded that the
12 City explain how the City has, or has not, implemented the required EIR mitigation measures, and
13 where mitigation measures have not been implemented, document the formal process of how the
14 mitigation measures were eliminated. The County's letter attached the mitigation monitoring and 15 reporting program for the project, which listed the mitigation measures that were adopted by the 16

17 County and later imposed as conditions by the City.

76. On or about September 9, 2021, October 19, 2021, and November 2, 2021, the City 18

19 held hearings on the proposed override of the ALUC's findings of project inconsistency with the

20 2014 ALUCP. Representatives of the County, the ALUC, and members of the public appeared and

21 testified at all three hearings, objecting to the proposed override due in part to the City's failure to

22 comply with CEQA by not preparing a subsequent EIR, and the City's failure to enforce mitigation

23 adopted by the County and integrated into the CIP project by the City.

24 77. Attempting to justify its failure to refer the proposal to the ALUC, which as the City

25 later acknowledged is required by law, the ALUCP itself, and the City's own General Plan, the City

26 stated it "had no established pattern, history or clear awareness of formal project review

27 expectations or authority held by the Colusa County Airport Land Use Commission (ALUC)."
28 Notably, the City's own General Plan specifically requires that all development projects be referred

17

Second Amended Petition for Writ of Mandate

1

2 to the ALUC, and that the City take measures to ensure compatibility between airport operations

3 and proposed land uses. This requirement was identified in the City's MEIR as the basis for

4 finding impacts to public safety and airport operations would be less than significant.

78.

5 Prior to and during the November 2, 2021, hearing, the City received letters and

6 other correspondence from the County and other public agencies objecting to the City's proposed

7 override on numerous grounds. For example, the Caltrans Division of Aeronautics strenuously

8 objected to the City's proposed override, explaining that after reviewing the City's proposed

9 findings, it determined the findings were insufficient to support an override. Specifically, the

10 Caltrans Division of Aeronautics informed the City that its findings "are not consistent with the

11 purposes of the statutes set forth in the California Public Utilities Code (PUC) section 21670. These

12 findings do not provide substantial evidence that the proposed Project will meet the requirements of

13 PUC statutes set forth in PUC section 21670. These findings do not provide substantial evidence

14 that the proposed Project will meet the requirements of PUC, section 21670(a)(I) and (2)." Among

15 numerous substantial problems, the Caltrans Division of Aeronautics informed the City that the

16 project will create safety problems, will negatively impact the ability of the airport for future

17 orderly development, will create new incompatible land uses near the airport, and will adversely

18 impact the ability to protect public health, safety, and welfare. The Caltrans Division of Aeronautics

19 letter also noted that the City's analysis must be guided by the California Airport Land Use

20 Planning Handbook, a requirement reflected in Public Resources Code section 21096 and CEQA

21 Guidelines section 15154. The City did not respond to the Caltrans Division of Aeronautics or

22 otherwise address its concerns.

23 79.

4:1. During the City's hearings on the ALUC's inconsistency determination and the

24

25 City's proposed override, there was substantial discussion on whether the City needed to perform

26 additional environmental review and whether adopted mitigation measures were being enforced, in
addition to whether the proposed override was permissible under the Public Utilities Code.

27 /1/

28 111

18

Second Amended Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 80. During these hearings, the City disclosed for the first time that it is not, and would

2 not be, enforcing mitigation measures that were adopted for the project. The City indicated its belief

(n that some of the measures may not be desirable, and that it is making "judgment calls" as to which
measures to implement or not over time.
n 81. At the conclusion of the November 2, 2021, hearing, the City Council passed and
6 adopted Resolution 21-57, issuing findings to "overrule the ALUC's decision associated with

7 Colusa Industrial Properties Tentative Map 01-16 and related entitlements."
8 82. In overruling the ALUC's determination that the CIP project was inconsistent with
0 the ALUCP, the City's made findings, in relevant part, that:
10 A. The project will not adversely impact the ability to provide for the orderly development
11 of the public use airport because it is located 2,000 feet Northwest of the airport in a "sparsely
12 developed area that is not within property that could be acquired for purposes of extending the
13 airport."
14 B. The project will not adversely impact the ability to provide for the orderly development 15 of the area surrounding the airport so as to promote the overall goals and objectives of the City and 16

17 County noise standards, and will not cause the creation of new noise and safety problems for

18 individuals. The City further found that mitigation measures have been imposed to ensure that the

19 existing exposure to noise levels are consistent with noise standards for residential uses, including

20 review of building plans by an acoustical engineer specific to lots that are located in the noise

21 contour above 70 dBn Ldn shown in the EIR's noise study who shall detail what additional

22 mitigation measures shall be required in the construct of the home. The City also referenced a July

23 2021 acoustical study that found the "construction of the homes" to be consistent with the indoor

24 noise level of less than 45 dB Ldn.

25 C. The project will not adversely impact the ability to protect the public health, safety, and
26 welfare by continuing to ensure the orderly expansion of the airport and will not adversely affect

27 the utility or capacity of the airport. In furtherance of this finding, the City stated that the project
28 was not "immediately adjacent" to any land owned by the airport, and that mitigation measurcs are

19

Second Amended Petition for Writ of Mandate

in place to "require future improvement plans to be submitted to the Federal Aviation

2

3 Administration to ensure the proposed heights are not a hazard to air navigation, thus the project
will not pose any safety concerns," and inferring that because there are no hazards to air navigation,

5 any hazards to individuals on the ground would be "less than significant."
D. The project will not adversely impact the ability to protect the public health, safety, and

A welfare and incorporates land and safety hazards within the areas around the public airport to the

8 extent that these areas are not already devoted to incompatible uses. In support of this finding, the
City referenced "the project not proposing any significant land use changes but rather a modest

10 increase in single-family homes and elimination or (sic) high density residential, which will reduce

11 the overall population for the project." The City also referenced the removal of high-density

12 housing while constructing 180 single family houses, which the City contended was "well below

13 the minimum housing density originally contemplated," and resulting reduced density and intensity

14 (number of persons per acre), which the City cited as being compatible with ALUCP policies for

-.p• 15 land development. Further the City found that the project incorporates conditions of approval to

16 ensure the public will not be exposed to excessive noise or safety hazards, including noticing

...::1. 17 project residents of aircraft noise and avigation easements, in combination with Federal Aviation

18 Administration height restrictions so as not to create hazards to air navigation.

19 83. Recognizing that its November 2, 2021, approval of the ALUC override was a

20 subsequent discretionary approval triggering the need to comply with CEQA's subsequent review

21 requirements, Resolution 21-57 states, in single conclusory paragraph: "The Project was reviewed

22 in conformance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), Public Resources Code

23

24 Section 21000 et seq., the CEQA Guidelines, Cal. Code Regs, tit. 14, Section 1 5000 et seq., and

25 the City Council has, prior to or concurrent with the approval of this proposed resolution,

26 considered the Colusa Industrial Park Initial Study, and determined that the Project would have NO

27 ADDITIONAL SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS on the environment, that NO NEW ADDITIONAL

28 MITIGATION MEASURES OR ALTERNATIVES are required, and that the Project IS WITHIN
THE SCOPE of the City of Colusa General Plan MEIR. Such Initial Study and determination serve

20

Second Amended Petition for Writ f Mandate

1 as the environmental documentation for the proposed Project."
N m t10 0 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

Violation of California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA):
Error in not Requiring a Subsequent or Supplemental EIR

84. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference each and every allegation contained in
Paragraphs 1 through 83 as set forth above.
7 85. "The fundamental goals of environmental review under CEQA are information,
8 participation, mitigation, and accountability." (Lincoln Place Tenants Assn. V. City of Los Angeles
9 (2007) 155 Cal.App.4th 425, 443-444.) CEQA is designed to ensure that government agencies
10 incorporate the goal of long-term protection of the environment into their decisions that may affect
11 the environment. CEQA applies to any situation where a governmental agency can use its judgment
12 in deciding whether and how to carry out or approve a project (i.e., a "discretionary approval"). 13
86. The EIR serves not only to protect the environment but also to demonstrate to the 14
public that it is being protected. As the cornerstone of the CEQA process, the EIR must disclose and 15

16 analyze a project's potentially significant environmental impacts. In addition, the EIR also must

17 inform decision-makers and the public of feasible mitigation measures and alternate project designs

18 or elements that would lessen or avoid the project's significant adverse environmental impacts.
87. If an 19 agency approves a project requiring environmental review, CEQA mandates that

20 the agency adopt all feasible mitigation measures that would reduce or avoid any of the project's

21 significant environmental impacts. If any of the project's significant projects cannot be feasibly

22 mitigated to a less-than-significant level, the project can be approved only if there are no feasible,

23 environmentally superior alternatives available and the agency finds that the project's benefits would

24 outweigh its unavoidable impacts. Further, when an EIR identifies a significant effect, the

25 government agency approving the project must make findings on whether the adverse environmental

26 effects have been substantially reduced or if not, why not.

27 /1/

28 /1/

21

Second Amended Petition for Writ of Mandate

88. When an EIR shows that a project would cause substantial adverse changes in the

2 environment, the governmental agency must respond to the information by methods that include, but

3 are not limited to: (1) changing a proposed project; (2) imposing conditions on the approval of the
project; (3) adopting an alternative to the proposed project; (4) disapproving the project; (5) finding
that changing or altering the project is not feasible; (6) find that the unavoidable significant

6 environmental damage is acceptable as provided in section 15093 of the CEQA guidelines.

7 89. Under CEQA, all findings required for the public agency's approval of a project must

8 be legally adequate and supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record. CEQA
further requires that an agency provide an explanation of how the evidenced in the record supports
10 the conclusions that the agency has reached.
11 90. When a project involves multiple discretionary approvals by one or more agencies,
12 the agency issuing any later approval must consider whether supplemental review is required under
13 CEQA at the time it makes its decision. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21166; CEQA Guidelines, §§
14 15162-15164.) If, after an initial approval is granted, any of the conditions triggering supplemental
15

16 review have occurred, a subsequent EIR "shall" be prepared by the public agency which grants the

17 next discretionary approval. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15162, subd. (c).) If an agency determines, with

18 substantial evidence supporting the determination, that a subsequent EIR is not required, the agency

19 "shall" prepare an addendum to the previously certified EIR. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15164.) The

20 decision-making body "shall" consider the addendum with the final EIR prior to making a decision

21 on the project. (Id., at subd. (d).)

22 91. The City is responsible under CEQA for evaluating environmental impacts of its

23 decisions, including the preparation of a subsequent or supplemental EIR pursuant to Public

24 Resources Code section 21166 and CEQA Guidelines section 15162 when any of the following

25 events occur: (1) substantial changes are proposed in the project which will require major revisions to

26 the EIR due to new or more severe significant impacts compared to what was disclosed in the prior

27 EIR; (2) substantial changes occur with respect to the circumstances under which the project is being

28 undertaken which will require major revisions to the EIR due to new or more severe significant

22

Second Amended Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 impacts; or (3) where new information, which was not known and could not have been known at the

2 time the EIR was certified, becomes available, and demonstrates there would be new or more severe

3 significant impacts.
† 1n 92. CEQA does not allow an agency to conduct subsequent environmental review by
relying on an EIR for a different project. (See Martis Camp Community Association v. County of
6 Placer (2020) 53 Cal.App.5th 569, 607.)
A 93. CEQA imposes even greater obligations on agencies when an agency seeks to delete,
8 modify, or otherwise not enforce a mitigation measure that was previously adopted for a project,
9 which can only be done in very limited circumstances. "[W]hen an earlier-adopted mitigation
10 measure has been deleted, the deference provided to governing bodies with respect to land use
11 planning decisions must be tempered by the presumption that the governing body adopted the
12 mitigation measure in the first place only after due investigation and consideration. We therefore hold
13 that a governing body must state a legitimate reason for deleting an earlier-adopted mitigation 14 measure, and must support that statement of reason with substantial evidence. If no legitimate reason 15
for the deletion has been stated, or if the evidence does not support the governing body's finding, the 16

17 land use plan, as modified by the deletion or deletions, is invalid and cannot be enforced. [1 * * * In

18 other words, the measure cannot be deleted without a showing that it is infeasible." (Napa Citizens

19 for Honest Government v. Napa County Bd. of Supervisors (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 342; see also

20 Lincoln Place Tenants Association v. City of Los Angeles (2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 1491.) In addition

21 to performing supplemental environmental review, the agency must reconsider whether the project's
new statement of overriding 22 benefits outweigh its significant environmental impacts and issue a

23 considerations, which also must be supported by substantial evidence. (Ibid.)

24 94. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that the City violated CEQA,

25 and continues to violate CEQA, including:

26 a. The City's actions on November 2, 2021, to override the ALUC's March 2021

27 determination that the Project is inconsistent with the ALUCP was a discretionary approval within
28 the meaning of CEQA. The City had ample discretion to revise the project or impose mitigation

23

Second Amended Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 measures to address impacts caused by the project, including but not limited to impacts public safety,

2 noise, and airport operations identified in the ALUC's 2021 inconsistency findings and

3 correspondence from the public and other agencies, including the Caltrans Division of Aeronautics

4 and the County. The City itself recognized that its November 2, 2021, approval of the ALUC

5 override was a subsequent discretionary approval triggering CEQA's subsequent review

6 requirements.

7 b. In approving the ALUC override on November 2, 2021, the City improperly relied on
8 the 2007 MEIR and 2014 Initial Study. Neither document considered the project as approved by the
9 County. For example, the Initial Study did not address the substantial increase in the number of
10 single-family residences or the ALUC's findings of inconsistency with the original project proposal,
11 resulting in the County mitigating the identified impacts by substantially reducing the number of
12 single-family residences, or the findings of significance set forth in the final project EIR. The 2007
13 MEIR did not include the CIP project as one of the three projects subject to environmental review
14 under the MEIR, which specifically referenced the CIP project as pending annexation into the City
15

16 and being subject to separate environmental review (i.e., the project-specific EIR certified by the
reliance on Section 15177, subdivisions (a) and (b), was improper,
17 County). The City's

18 as the use of an Initial Study pursuant to Section 15177 is specific to "subsequent projects" that are

19 within the scope of a MEIR. As the CIP project was subject to project-specific EIR completed by

20 the County, and which the City's 2007 MEIR, approved the year before the County's approval of the

21 CIP project EIR, did not include the CIP project as one of three identified projects analyzed in that

22 document, the CIP project was merely a proposal referenced in the MEIR that would be subject to

23 separate environmental review, which did in fact occur (the County's 2008 EIR). Accordingly, the

24 City's reliance on its 2007 MEIR and 2014 Initial Study for purposes of approving ALUC override,

25 was inadequate and contrary to the law, thereby resulting in the improper and ongoing reliance on an

26 insufficient environmental document, instead of the project EIR, in violation of CEQA. The City's

27 reliance on the MEIR and Initial Study was also inappropriate because they did not contemplate the

28 City's project and did not analyze the significant impacts revealed during the ALUC review process,

24

Second Amended Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 thereby constituting a prejudicial abuse of discretion.

2 C. The City's failure to perform supplemental CEQA review prior to its subsequent
m + u vo discretionary action on November 2, 2021, of overriding the ALUC's determination that the project is
incompatible with the 2014 ALUCP is a violation of CEQA and constitutes a prejudicial abuse of
discretion. Specifically, the ALUC determined that the is revised project is incompatible with the
airport and would significantly impact the use and operations of the airport, in part, due to the
7 significant noise impacts that the project would create by exposing people to noise levels in excess of
9 the standards in the 2014 ALUCP and the City's General Plan, as well as safety impacts the project
9 would create by placing substantial numbers of single-family homes in close proximity to the airport.
10 This is the opposite of what was anticipated in the City's MEIR. The City's decision to override the
11 ALUC's determination, without analyzing or mitigating the significant noise and safety impacts and
12 impacts to the airport identified leading up the City's approval through a supplemental or subsequent
13 EIR was a prejudicial abuse of discretion.
14
d. The City's determination, made as part of its November 2, 2021, approval of the 15 ALUC override, that subsequent review was not required and that the project was within the scope of 16 the 2007 General Plan Master EIR was a was a prejudicial abuse of discretion. The City improperly 17

18 relied on its 2007 Master EIR and a 2014 Initial Study to comply with CEQA for its approval of the

19 ALUC override. The 2007 Master EIR and 2014 Initial Study could not have covered the City's

20 approval of the ALUC override for several reasons, including: (1) at the time the MEIR and Initial

21 Study was prepared, the ALUC had not reviewed the City's project, much less identified

22 inconsistencies with the 2014 ALUCP and related impacts; (2) neither the Master EIR nor the Initial

23 Study considered the project as approved by the City; and (3) prior to 2021, no version of the project

24 had been reviewed under the current ALUCP, which includes more stringent and specific standards

25 to protect the public from safety hazards and noise impacts, compared to when a different version of
26 the project was reviewed by the ALUC in 2008.
27 //1

28 //1

25

Second Amended Petition for Writ of Mandate

P e. The ALUC's determination, made in 2021, that the project is inconsistent with the

2 ALUCP, and the reasons for that determination, is a change in circumstances and new information

3 requiring subsequent EIR under CEQA. The ALUC's inconsistency determination was the first and
only time the City's project was reviewed by the ALUC. The ALUC's inconsistency determination

5 was the first and only time any version of the project was reviewed under the current ALUCP, which

6 has different standards and requirements compared to the prior ALUCP. The ALUC's inconsistency

7 determination, and information leading up to that determination, revealed new or more severe

8 significant impacts compared to what was disclosed in the City's Master EIR or the 2014 Initial

4 Study, upon which the City purported to rely on for compliance with CEQA. For example, the MEIR
10 concluded that impacts to public safety and airport operations (Impact 4.3.8 in the MEIR) would be
11 less than significant based primarily on the assumption that future development would be consistent
12 with the ALUCP. In reaching this conclusion, the MEIR applied the following standard (or
13 "threshold of significance"): For project located within an airport land use plan, would the project
14 "result in a safety hazard for people residing and working in the project area." In finding there would 15

16 be no significant safety impacts or impacts to airport operations, the MEIR relied on General Plan

17 Policy CIR-8.2, which requires the City to work with the County and ALUC to ensure that new

18 development is compatible with the airport, and Implementing Action CIR-8.2.a, which requires the

19 County to integrate the standards and operational thresholds of the airport into future design review

20 criteria to address concerns regarding noise, safety, and hazards. Regarding impacts to the airport,

21 the MEIR stated that airport-related impacts would be avoided by "by ensuring the compatibility of

22 adjacent land uses with airport operations, as sought by Implementing Actions CIR-8.1.a and CIR-

23 8.2.a." The MEIR noted that "compatibility, as defined by the Airport Land Use Plan, would consider

24 factors such as noise exposure and potential safety hazards associated with aircraft takeoffs and

25 landings." The MEIR concluded that "[bly only allowing compatible land uses near the airport, the

26 City can ensure that there would be relatively little pressure for restriction or closure of airport

27 operations." In other words, the MEIR determined that development projects would not result in

28 airport-related impacts because projects would be required to be compatible with the airport and

26

Second Amended Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 airport operations, and the ALUC process would ensure that projects are compatible with the

2 ALUCP. The 2014 Initial Study states there would be "no impact." The ALUC's inconsistency
m determination, however, revealed that the project is not compatible with the airport or airport
operations and would result in significant impacts related to safety and airport operations. This is the
1n opposite of what the MEIR concluded, and therefore, the City was required to perform subsequent
6 review under CEQA Guidelines section 15162. Its failure to do so was a prejudicial abuse of
7 discretion.

8 f. The 2021 letter from Caltrans Aeronauticsthe State agency charged with
9 overseeing ALUC procedures and protecting public safety near airports provided additional
10 evidence that the ALUC's inconsistency determination was a major event that was not contemplated
11 in the MEIR, and in fact, was the opposite of what the MEIR contemplated. Caltrans Aeronautics
12 notified the City that, based on the ALUC's inconsistency determination and having reviewed the
13 City's proposed override findings, the project, inter alia: "will adversely affect the public health, 14
safety, and welfare"; "will negatively impact the ability of the airport for future orderly 15 development"; "will create new safety issues for individuals"; "creates the potential to adversely 16
affect the utility or capacity of the Colusa County Airport"; will "adversely impact the ability to 17

18 protect the public health, safety, and welfare."

g. The City's decision to not enforce mitigation measures is also a change in 19

20 circumstances requiring subsequent environmental review. Notably, the 2014 Initial Study relied on

21 the mitigation measures in the CIP EIR, in addition to the mitigation measures in the MEIR, to

22 conclude no further environmental review was required. The Initial Study states in part: "It is through

23 the project's consistency within the scope of the City of Colusa General Plan MEIR .  and

24 mitigation in the CIP EIR" that the City found the project would have no additional significant effect

25 on the environment and that no additional mitigation or alternatives may be required. The Initial

26 Study also states there would be "no impact" related to the airport, based in part on the mitigation

27 measures in the CIP EIR. Because the City is not enforcing numerous mitigations measures it relied

28 on to reduce impacts, it was an abuse of discretion to rely in the Initial Study without performing

5 The City's failure to monitor and enforce the mitigation measures adopted by the

6 County in certifying the final project EIR, including measures adopted to address noise, safety, and

7 airport impacts, among others, despite the City's explicit incorporation of those mitigation measures

8 into project entitlements, including but not limited to the amended Development Agreement adopted

9 through Ordinance No. 516 and subsequent approvals violates CEQA and constitutes prejudicial

abuse of discretion.

10 96.
11 The City disclosed for the first time at its 2021 hearings on the proposed ALUC

12 override that it is not enforcing, and/or would not enforce, mitigation measures that it had adopted for

13 the project and relied on in its prior environmental documents. The City did not make findings that

14 any previously adopted mitigation measures are infeasible and has not performed subsequent review

15 to analyze and disclose the impacts of the project without the mitigation measures. Rather, despite

16 acknowledging that it adopted all of the mitigation measures as set forth in the County's mitigation

17 monitoring and reporting program (MMRP), the City is determining on an ad hoc basis, behind

18 closed doors and shielded from public scrutiny, which mitigation measures to enforce or not. This is

19 antithetical to CEQA. The County is informed and believes, and thereon alleges that, as of the date of

20 this Second Amended Petition, the City is not enforcing numerous mitigation measures, including the

21 following:

22 a. Mitigation Measures LU-1a, LU-4a, and N-4a. These measures require that

23 homes and businesses affected by aircraft noise must be designed to achieve acceptable interior noise

24

25 levels consistent with the ALUCP and County standards. These measures require the preparation of

26 an acoustical investigation that identifies measures to be implemented to achieve those standards.

27 Specific designs for buildings must be submitted to Colusa County for approval prior to issuance of

28 building permits to ensure compliance with noise standards. As explained above, the acoustical
analysis prepared in July 2021 did not fulfil the requirements of this mitigation.

28

Second Amended Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 b. Mitigation Measures LU-1g, LU-4i, N-4h, and HHM-3f. To reduce airport

2 land use, noise, and safely conflicts, these mitigation measures require that a revised conceptual land

3 use plan be implemented that reduces the number of low-density residential units (single-family
+ 40 homes) in the western portion of the project area to 84 units. Although the City approved a
development agreement and tentative map allowing 180 units, those approvals were expressly
6 conditioned on compliance with LU-1g, LU-4i, N-4h, and HHM-3f. As of the date of this Second

7 Amended Petition, the City has not found these measures infeasible, stated any legitimate reasons for
8 not enforcing them, or provided any documentation associated with their apparent "deletion."
-o C. Mitigation Measures LU-5a, TT-1. and TT-2: These mitigation measures

require that the applicant provide sufficient funding to cover the cost of installation traffic signal at
11 the Bridge Street (State Route 20) /Freemont Street intersection to operate at a LOS "D" and that the
12 payment for this cost be included in the project development agreement. The mitigation measures
13 require that the payment be held in escrow until Caltrans approves the signal. The County is informed
14

15 and believes, and thereon alleges, that as of the date of this Second Amended Petition the City has not

enforced these measures.
16
d.
17 Mitigation Measures LU-5b, AR-3a, and AR-4. These mitigation measures

18 require the construction of a minimum 6-foot-tall wall along the western project boundary. These

19 mitigation measures require the installation of the wall to minimize conflict between the residences

20 and adjacent agricultural lands. The County is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that as of
s the date of this Second Amended Petition the City has not enforced these measures.
22 C. Mitigation Measures LU-5c, A-4a, A-4b. These mitigation measures require
23 the implementation of lighting and landscaping plans for uses along state route 20. The landscaping
24 and lighting is required to be similar to that used in the adjacent office park to minimize adverse
25 views of the project from SR 20. The County is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that as of
26 5 the date of this Second Amended Petition the City has not enforced these measures.

29

Second Amended Petition for Writ of Mandatc

1 f. Mitigation Measure PHE-3. This mitigation measure requires the applicant to

2 designate at least 10 percent of the units as affordable housing. The mitigation measure specified that

3 providing 29 affordable units in the high-density residential zone would make the project consistent

4 with the policies and programs in the General Plan Housing Element. The City eliminated high-

5 density residential from the project and has not required affordable housing. The City has not

6 explained why it is not feasible to require affordable housing or disclosed the impacts of the project

7 without this required mitigation.

8 g. Mitigation Measure PS-1. This mitigation measure requires the applicant to

9 fund two new Sherriff's Department staff and that the funding be identified and included in the
10 project's development agreement. In addition, if determined necessary the applicant is also required
11 to provide rent-free office space in the project to accommodate the increase in staffing, and then fair
12 share funding to construct new space for these law enforcement staff. The City has not required any
13 funding for the Sherriff's Department. The County is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that
14 the City also has not required commensurate mitigation for City law enforcement, or documented a
15

16 change in the mitigation from County to City law enforcement.
h.
17 Mitigation Measure PS-3. This mitigation measure requires the applicant to

18 fund one new Sacramento River Fire District firefighter and that the funding be identified and

19 included in the project's development agreement. In addition, if determined necessary the applicant is

20 also required to provide rent-free office space in the project to accommodate the increase in staffing,

21 and then fair share funding for renovations to accommodate the additional staff. The City has not

22 required any funding for the Sacramento River Fire District. The County is informed and believes,

23 and thereon alleges, that the City also has not required commensurate mitigation for City fire

24 services, or documented a change in the mitigation from County to City services.

25 i. Mitigation Measure PS-5. This mitigation measure requires the applicant to

26 provide fair share funding to the City for park development, maintenance, operations, and

27 renovations to mitigate the impacts of the new residents. The County is informed and believes, and

28 thereon alleges, that as of the date of this Second Amended Petition the City has not enforced this

30

Second Amended Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 measure.

2 •- Mitigation Measure TT-6. AQ-2b. These mitigation measures require the

3 applicant to provide sidewalks and bike routes on all project roads and establish opportunities for
transit. These mitigation measures require that the tentative subdivision map identify a safe pedestrian
5 walkway and bicycle path between the project's land uses and Wescott Road (i.e., along Farinon
6 Road Extension), along Wescott Road to the limits of the existing sidewalks and that these facilities
7 provide non-vehicular connectivity consistent with the City's General Plan policies. The mitigation
8 also requires the applicant to coordinate with Colusa County Transit to identify opportunities for
9 residents to utilize transit and provide stop in the project areas, if necessary. The project's tentative
10 does not identify pedestrian or bicycle paths as required by these measures. The County is informed
11 and believes, and thereon alleges, that as of the date of this Second Amended Petition the City has not
12 enforced these measures.
13 k. Mitigation Measure TT-7a. This mitigation measure requires the applicant to 14 provide fair-share funding for widening SR 20/Bridge Street from Market Street to Farinon Road to a 15
four-lane road. The measure states that the development agreement would enforce payment of the fair 16
share fees prior to issuance of building permits. The measure also requires the applicant to identify 17

18 the Right of Way need to accommodate future traffic conditions along SR 20 and make an

19 irrevocable offer of dedication for that Right of Way adjacent to the project area. The County is

20 informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that as of the date of this Second Amended Petition the

21 City has not enforced this measure.

22 1. Mitigation Measure TT-7b. This mitigation measure requires the applicant to

23 provide fair-share funding for modifying Fremont Street. The is applicant is required to pay its fair

24 share cost of either widening Fremont Street to a four-lane road or converting Fremont Street and

25 Sioc Street to one-way roads. The measure states that the development agreement would enforce

26 payment of the fair share fees prior to issuance of building permits. The payment is required to be

27 held in escrow until the modifications are fully funded. The County is informed and believes, and
28 thereon alleges, that as of the date of this Second Amended Petition the City has not enforced this

1 measure.

2 m. Mitigation Measure TT-8a. This mitigation measure requires the applicant to
provide fair-share funding for road improvements on SR 20 between Fremont Street and Wescott
Road. The measure states that the development agreement would enforce payment of the fair share

5 fees prior to issuance of building permits. The payment is required to be held in escrow until the

6 improvements are fully funded. The County is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that as of

7 the date of this Second Amended Petition the City has not enforced this measure.

8 n. Mitigation Measure TT-8b. This mitigation measure requires the applicant to

9 provide fair-share funding for installing traffic signal on SR 20 at Sunrise Boulevard and Farinon
10 Road. The measure states that the development agreement would enforce payment of the fair share
11 fees prior to issuance of building permits. The payment is required to be held in escrow until the
12 improvements are fully funded. The County is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that as of
13 the date of this Second Amended Petition the City has not enforced this measure.

S. Mitigation Measure N-1b. This measure requires a minimum six-foot high 14 noise barrier along the northwest corner of the project during construction. The applicant is required 15
to identify the noise barrier on all grading plans and construction contracts to reduce noise exposure 16

17 from grading and construction activities at adjacent homes as is required to be installed prior to initial

18 grading. The County is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that as of the date of this Second

19 Amended Petition the City has not enforced this measure.

100. Relief is granted under CCP Section 1094.5 when a respondent has proceeded

2 without, or in excess of, jurisdiction, has not provided a fair trial, and/or has committed a

3 prejudicial abuse of diseretion. A prejudicial abuse of discretion is established if the respondent has
not proceeded in a manner required by law, the order or decision is not supported by the findings,
10 0 0 or the fidings are not supported by the evidence and/or not supported by substantial evidence in
light of the whole record. Morover, the City's findings must be fact specific and not merely declare
a general conclusion. They must link the proposal, the finding of consistency with section 21670
8 purposes, and the evidence in a manner that reveals "the analytic route" the City Council traveled
9 from evidence to action. (Topanga Assn. for a Scenic Community v. County of Los Angeles (1974)
10 11 Cal.3d 506.)
11 101. The City's November 2, 2021, hearing to override of the ALUC's findings of project
12 inconsistency with the ALUCP was held purusant to Public Utilities Code section 21676, which, in
13 order to override the ALUC's findings of the project's inconsistency with ALUCP, requiried the 14 City to make specific findings that the propsoed action is consistent with the purposes stated in 15 section 21670. Subdivision (a)(1) of section 21670 states in relevant part: "It is the purpose of this 16

17 article to protect public health, safety, and welfare by ensuring the orderly expansion of airports and

18 the adoption of land use measures that minimize the public's exposure to excessive noise and safety

19 hazards within areas around public airports to the extent that these areas are not already devoted to

20 incompatible uses."

102. The City committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion in making its findings that the
CIP project, as amended, was consistent with the purposes stated in Public Utilities Code section 22

23 21670, and in its findings that the CIP project, as amended, was consistent with the ALUCP, in that

24 its decision to override the ALUC decision was not supported by the findings, and further that the

25 findings were not supported by the evidence. Further, the City's findings were inadequate in that

26 they failed to link the proposal, the finding of consistency with section 21670 purposes, and the
27 evidence in a manner that revealed the analytic route the City Council traveled from evidence to
28 action.

1 103. Further specific inadequacies and legal errors include the following:

2 City Finding:

3 The project will not adversely impact the ability to provide for the orderly development of
the area surrounding the airport so as to promote the overall goals and objectives of the City and
County noise standards, and will not cause the creation of new noise and safety problems for

6 individuals. The City further found that mitigation measures have been imposed to ensure that the

7 existing exposure to noise levels are consistent with noise standards for residential uses, including

8 review of building plans by an acoustical engineer specific to lots that are located in the noise
contour above 70 dBn Ldn shown in the EIR's noise study who shall detail what additional
10 mitigation measures shall be required in the construct of the home. The City also referenced a July
11 2021 acoustical study that found the "construction of the homes" to be consistent with the indoor
12 noise level of less than 45 dB Ldn.
13 Discussion
14 The City's finding that the project will promote the overall goals and objectives of the City
15

16 and County noise standards, and will not cause the creation of new noise and safety problems for

17 individuals is entirely speculative, inconsistent with the findings of the project EIR, and the ALUC,

18 and appears to be based largely on an inadequate acoustical study in which the noise samples relied

19 upon were collected from a small section of the development where model homes were located.

20 The study itself brought into question the reliability of the results in which it noted that it was

21 possible the aircraft flight conditions were atypical during the survey, and, as a result, the ambient

22 noise measurement results were being provided for acoustical context and were not purported to be

23 representative of typical aircraft noise generation at the CIP project site.

24 The City's findings, and the evidence relied on in support thereof, were entirely inadequate

25 and unreliable for purposes of overruling the findings of the ALUC with regard to the identified

26 noise impacts that exceeded the standards set forth in the ALUCP, as well as the noise standards set

27 by both the City and County. More specifically, the evidence relied on by the City, and the

28 corresponding findings in support of its override, ignored the County's 2008 approval of the final

36

Second Amended Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 EIR and adopted mitigation measures, which the City is not implementing, as required by condition

2 3 of the Tentative Map, including those related to the noise impacts and concentration of residential

3 units following the ALUC's 2007 findings of inconsistency with the original version of the
+ 10 proposed project, which were contrary to the City's approval of the 2016 and 2018 amendments to
the Tentative Map and development agreement and believed to be ignored or disregarded by the
6 City on that basis. Rather, in addition to the aforementioned July 2021 noise study, the City
7 focused its findings on a 2007 a MEIR that did not include the CIP project as one of three projects
8 covered by the MEIR for full environmental review, and a 2014 Initial Study that failed to analyze
9 or mention the increase in number of single-family residences from the 84 approved by the County
10 in 2008 to the 180 subsequently approved by the City in 2016, and which constituted 40 more
11 residence than contemplated and studied in the final project EIR. Nor did the City mention or
12 analyze the placement of single-family residences in the ALUCP's B-1 high noise and increased
13 safety risk zone. Further, the City failed to address the fact that its own MEIR references the five-
14 year time limits of Public Resources Code Section 21157.6 for the use of a MEIR or the associated
15
exceptions that do not apply. 16
Such evidence was entirely inadequate for purposes of enabling the City to override the 17

18 specific finding by the ALUC that a number of the proposed homes to be constructed pursuant to

19 Tentative Map 01-18 will have an interior noise level exceeding the ALUCP interim 45 dB Ldn

20 noise standards, thereby making Tentative Map 01-18 inconsistent with the ALUCP. Further, the

21 ALUC noted that without the acoustical study required by the 2008 final EIR, it is not possible to

22 confirm with reasonable high-degree of certainty that the internal noise levels of all the homes

23 will meet the 45 dB Ldn standard. Without question, the City's July 2021, acoustical study was

24 entirely incomplete and unreliable for this purpose.

25 Accordingly, the City's decision in support of its override of the ALUC findings of project
26 inconsistency with the ALUCP was not supported by the findings, and further the findings were not
27 supported by the evidence. As such, the City's override of the ALUC's incompatibility
28 determination was inconsistent with the purposes set forth in Public Utilities Code section 21670.

37

Second Amended Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 City Finding:

2 The project will not adversely impact the ability to protect the public health, safety, and
w welfare by continuing to ensure the orderly expansion of the airport and will not adversely affect
the utility or capacity of the airport.
A Discussion

The City relies on an entirely speculative conclusion that unspecified "future improvement
plans" will be submitted to the Federal Aviation Administration" that will ensure unidentified

8 "heights" will not be hazard to air navigation. Such a vague and ambiguous finding in support of
9 the ALUC override fails to effectively address the purpose the ALUC and ALUCP to safeguard the

10 general welfare of the inhabitants within the vicinity of the airport and the public in general, which
11 is furthered by way of its density standards for residential units within the jurisdiction of the ALUC.
12 Further, the City's findings fail to address or consider the identified threats to public health,
13 safety, and welfare described in the final project EIR, including a significant and unavoidable 14 impact with regard to airport operations involving routine crop dusting, and whether the more than
15

16 doubling of the single-family residences from that approved by the County in 2008, including the

17 planned location of single-family residences in the B-1 high risk and high noise compatibility zone.

18 These changes were not contemplated in the final project EIR, and would certainly result in

19 increased impacts not studied or contemplated therein.

20 For these reasons, the City's decision supporting its override of this ALUC decision was not

21 supported by the findings, and further the findings were not supported by the evidence. As such,

22 the City's override of the ALUC's incompatibility determination was inconsistent with the purposes

23 set forth in Public Utilities Code section 21670.
0 --p-pgew 24 City Finding:

25 The project will not adversely impact the ability to protect the public health, safety, and

26 welfare and incorporates land and safety hazards within the areas around the public airport to the

27 extent that these areas are not already devoted to incompatible uses. In support of this finding, the

28 City contended that the project was not proposing any significant land use changes but rather a

38

Second Amended Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 "modest increase in single-family homes and elimination or (sic) high density residential, which

2 will reduce the overall population for the project."
M * Discussion

In support of this finding, the City makes several inaccurate, at best, misleading, at worst,
5 contentions regarding the project's housing density prior to the City's 2016 approval that more than
o doubled the number of single-family residences approved by the County in 2008, which the ALUC
7 concluded "….significantly affected the Board's previously considered compatibility findings and
8 raised significant questions as to the validity of the Board's earlier finding of consistency."
9 Whether a certain number of residential units were "contemplated" by the applicant, or even
10 considered by the County prior to final project approval is entirely irrelevant to the ALUC'S
11 determination that the City's approval of the increase in the number of residential units, as set forth
12 in Tentative Map 01-18, exceeded the average and maximum density standards set forth in the
13 ALUCP with regard to the proposed residential development in Zones B-1, C-1, and C-2.
14 Further, the City's contention in support of its override of this finding by the ALUC that the 15
project incorporates conditions of approval to ensure the public will not be exposed to excessive 16
noise or safety hazards, including noticing project residents of aircraft noise and avigation
easements, in combination with Federal Aviation Administration height restrictions so as not tO 17

18

19 create hazards to air navigation, is entirely inadequate in light of the clear airport operation noise

20 impacts that have not been subject to a reliable and adequate acoustical study, as discussed more

21 fully above, and which remains a requirement condition the final project EIR. The City has not

22 provided any reliable or compelling evidence that would overcome the ALUC'S finding of

23 residential density inconsistency with the ALUCP. Further, in the absence of subsequent

24 environmental review, including a reliable acoustical study, of the noise and other public health,

25 safety, and welfare impacts resulting from the increased residential density, the extent to which

26 such impacts are exacerbated by the City's project amendments, and the extent to which they can be

27 effectively mitigated remains unknown. The City's more than doubling of the single-family

28 residences originally approved by the County in 2008, including the placement of single-family

39

Second Amended Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 homes in the B-1 high risk compatibility zone, the sizeable increase of which exceeds the scope of

2 the final project EIR, remain unstudied within the requirements of CEQA, unmitigated, and

3 inconsistent with the ALUCP. Accordingly, the City's decision to override the ALUC'S findings of

4 project inconsistency with the ALUCP is not supported by the findings, nor are the findings

5 supported by the evidence. As such, the City's override of the ALUC's incompatibility
