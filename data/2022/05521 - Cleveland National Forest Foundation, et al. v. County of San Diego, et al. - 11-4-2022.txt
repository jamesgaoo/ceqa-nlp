VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

INTRODUCTION F

2 1. This action challenges the September 28, 2022 decision of the County of San

3 Diego ("County" or "Respondent") to approve a Transportation Study Guide and associated
4 thresholds of significance for evaluation of transportation impacts (the "Transportation Study
5 Guide" or "Project") under the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA").

6 2. The Legislature enacted Senate Bill 743 in 2013 in order to change the way the
7 transportation impacts of development are addressed under CEQA. After SB 743, rather than
8 focusing on measures of traffic congestion and delay, agencies must address vehicle miles
9 traveled ("VMT") or other measures that better elucidate and reduce the climate, air quality, and
10 other impacts of vehicle travel.

11 3. SB 743 supports California's broader climate goals by ensuring that analysis and
12 mitigation of environmental impacts under CEQA will aid in reducing greenhouse gas emissions
13 from the transportation sector, the state's largest source of climate pollution. Indeed, the
14 California Air Resources Board has found that without significant reductions in VMT, achieving
15 California's climate goals will be impossible.

16 4. The Project runs directly counter to the state legislation it purports to implement.
17 Rather than require analysis of future projects' contribution to VMT in accordance with SB 743,
18 the Project will create sweeping exemptions from VMT analysis requirements. And rather than
19 reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental impacts from vehicle travel as the
20 Legislature directed, the Project will facilitate increased greenhouse gas emissions and other
21 adverse transportation-related effects from future development projects without any disclosure,
22 analysis, or mitigation.
23 5. Under CEQA, "thresholds of significance" are intended to aid agencies in
24 determining whether particular environmental impacts of a project should be considered
25 "significant," and thus subject to heightened environmental analysis, mitigation, and avoidance
26 requirements. Aspects of the County's VMT thresholds, in contrast, are not designed to help
27 determine whether environmental impacts from transportation are significant under CEQA.
28 Rather, some of the County's thresholds appear to have been designed to exempt a desired
2
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

F amount of County development from any requirement to evaluate or mitigate transportation
2 impacts.

3 6. One aspect of the Transportation Study Guide represents an improvement from its
4 prior iteration, adopted in 2020 and later rescinded in 2021. With the Project, the County
5 corrected course and established a threshold of significance that complies with state guidance.
6 As recommended in state technical guidance, Projects with VMT 15 percent below the existing
7 regional average would be considered to have less-than-significant impacts. The regional
8 average VMT includes all of the highly connected, integrated San Diego region.

9 7. Thus, Projects in "VMT-efficient" areas (where the existing VMT is 15 percent
10 below the regional average) would be screened out of further VMT analysis.

11 8. However, other aspects of the Project created sweeping and unlawful exemptions
12 from CEQA's and SB 743's requirements.

13 9. The County adopted a second screening criteria for residential developments by
14 establishing so-called "Infill Village Areas." The County separated the unincorporated county
15 into 1,104 Traffic Analysis Zones ("TAZs"). Of these, 138 met the County's definition of
16| "infill." The County's "infill" criteria were created by the County's consultant based on
17 household density, intersection density, and job accessibility.

18 10. To "smooth out" the results of the infill areas, the County then expanded the
19 screening criteria to include County Village areas surrounding the infill areas.

20 11. The County also identified "Transit Opportunity Areas" ("TOAs") where the

21 regional transit network purportedly has the best opportunity to expand within the
22 unincorporated county and which are near or adjacent to Regional Transportation Plan Mobility
23 Hubs. TOAs would require transit planning and development above and beyond that identified
24 in the Regional Transportation Plan.

25 12. The Board of Supervisors directed staff to develop a VMT exemption for Infill
26 Village Areas within TOAs. However, due to inconsistency between the adopted Transportation
27 Study Guide and attached maps, it is unclear whether the Infill Village Area screening criteria is
28 truly applicable within TOAs only.

3
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

F 13. The County's Infill Village Area exemption is based on a memorandum prepared

2 by its consultant, Fehr & Peers. This "Infill Area Memo" acknowledges the County lacks
3 substantial evidence to support a determination that projects within Infill Village Areas would

4 have a less than significant transportation impact and meet the intent of SB 743. (Infill Area

5 Memo, pp. 10-11).

6 14. The County also adopted an unsupported "screening threshold" for purportedly
7 small projects. Under this threshold, the County concluded that all of the residential
8 development in unincorporated rural and semi-rural areas--areas where vehicle trips reasonably
9 could be expected to be the longest- -would be "small" and thus exempt from VMT analysis and
10 mitigation.

11 15. Together, the County's thresholds could exempt thousands of potential residential
12 units that could be developed under the County's General Plan from any transportation impacts
13 analysis whatsoever.

14 16. Adding insult to injury, the County refused to analyze the environmental
15 consequences of adopting these sweeping exemptions. Instead, the County found the Project
16 itself exempt from CEQA, based on a series of dubious rationalizations that lack legal and
17 evidentiary support.

18 17. The County's actions not only violate CEQA, but also directly undermine the clear
19 intent and direction of the Legislature in SB 743 to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other

20 impacts of vehicle travel. The Project is contrary to law and unsupported by substantial
21 evidence. Its adoption was a clear abuse of discretion and must be set aside.
22 PARTIES

23 18. Petitioner and Plaintiff Cleveland National Forest Foundation ("CNFF") is a
24 nonprofit corporation dedicated to preserving the plants, animals and other natural resources of
25 Southern California mountains by protecting the land and water they need to survive. CNFF is
26 committed to sustainable regional land use planning in San Diego County in order to stem the
27 tide of urban encroachment on wildlands. Members of CNFF are residents and taxpayers of San
28 Diego County who will be adversely affected by the Project's significant environmental

4

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 impacts. CNFF submitted written comments to the County objecting to and commenting on the

2 Project and related approvals.

3 19. Petitioner and Plaintiff Coastal Environmental Rights Foundation ("CERF") is a
4 non-profit public benefit corporation organized under the laws of the State of California with its
5 office located in Encinitas, California. CERF was founded by surfers in North San Diego
6 County and is active throughout California's coastal communities. CERF was established to
7 advocate for the protection and enhancement of coastal natural resources and the quality of life

8 for coastal residents. Members of CERF are residents and taxpayers of San Diego County who

9 will be adversely affected by the Project's significant environmental impacts. CERF submitted
10 written and oral comments to the County objecting to and commenting on the Project and
11 related approvals.

12 20. The interests that CNFF and CERF (together, "Petitioners") seek to further in this
13 action are within the goals and purposes of these organizations. Petitioners and their members
14 have a direct and beneficial interest in the County's compliance with laws bearing on the SB 743
15 Implementation Project. These interests will be directly and adversely affected by the Project,
16 which violates the law as set forth in this Petition, and which would cause substantial harm to
17 Petitioners' members, the natural environment, public health, and the quality of life in the
18 surrounding community. The maintenance and prosecution of this action will confer a
19 substantial benefit on the public by protecting the public from the environmental and other
20 harms alleged herein.

21 21. Respondent and Defendant County of San Diego is, and at all times herein
22 mentioned was, a political subdivision of the State of California responsible for regulating and
23 controlling land use within the County, including but not limited to implementing and
24 complying with the provisions of CEQA as well as other state and local laws. The County is the

25 "lead agency" for the purposes of Public Resources Code section 21067, with principal
26 responsibility for conducting environmental review of proposed actions. The County has a duty
27 to comply with CEQA and state law.
28 22. Petitioners are unaware of the true names and capacities of Respondents and

5
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

P Defendants Does through 10 and sue such respondents by fictitious names. Petitioners are
2 informed and believe, and on that basis allege, the fictitiously named respondents are also
3 responsible for the actions described in this Petition. When the true identities and capacities of
4 these respondents have been determined, Petitioners will amend this petition, with leave of the
5 Court if necessary, to insert such identities and capacities.

6 23. Petitioners are unaware of the true names and capacities, whether individual,
7 corporate, associate, or otherwise, of Real Parties in Interest Doe 11 through Doe 40, inclusive,

8 and therefore sue said Real Parties in Interest under fictional names. Petitioners allege, upon
9 information and belief, that each fictionally named Real Party in Interest is responsible in some
10 manner for committing the acts upon which this action is based or has material interests affected

11 by the Project or by the County's actions with respect to the Project. Petitioners will amend this
12 Petition to show their true names and capacities if and when the same have been ascertained.

13 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

14 24. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 526, 527, 1060, 1085, 1087, and

15 1094.5, and Public Resources Code sections 21168, 21168.5 and 21168.9, the San Diego County
16 Superior Court has initial jurisdiction to issue appropriate injunctive and declaratory relief and
17 to a issue a writ of mandate to set aside Respondents' decision to approve the Project and make
18 related CEQA findings.

19 25. Venue for this action properly lies in the Superior Court for the State of California

20 in and for the County of San Diego pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 394. The
21 activities authorized by Respondents will occur in San Diego County.

22 26. Venue for this action properly lies in the Central Division of the Superior Court

23 for the State of California for the County of San Diego pursuant to Local Rule 1.2.2(E) because
24 this petition pleads a California Environmental Quality Act claim, Respondent County of San

25 Diego is located in San Diego County.

26 27. Petitioners have performed any and all conditions precedent to filing this action

27 and have exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent possible and
28 required by law. Petitioners and their members submitted comments objecting to approval of the
6
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 Project based on the absence of evidentiary support for the Project, the County's improper
2 findings that the Project was exempt from CEQA, and the Project's conflicts with state law.
3 28. Respondents have taken final agency actions with respect to approving the Project
4 and making related CEQA findings. Respondents have a duty to comply with applicable state
5 laws, including but not limited to CEQA, prior to undertaking the discretionary approvals at
6 issue in this lawsuit.

7 29. On October 28, 2022, Petitioners complied with Public Resources Code section
8 21167.5 by emailing and mailing to Respondent a letter stating that Petitioners planned to file

9 Petition for Writ of Mandate seeking to invalidate Respondents' approval of the Project.
10 Attached hereto as Exhibit A is a true and correct copy of this letter.

11 30. Upon filing of the instant Petition, Petitioners will comply with Public Resources
12 Code section 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure section 388 by furnishing the Attorney

13 General of the State of California with a copy of the Petition.
14 31. Pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.6(b)(2), Petitioners elect to

15 prepare the record of proceedings in this action. Concurrently with this Petition, Petitioners will
a 16 file a notice of election to prepare the administrative record.

17 32. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary
18 law unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to set aside
19 their approval of the Project. In the absence of such remedies, Respondents' approvals will
20 remain in effect in violation of State law, and Petitioners and their members will be irreparably
21 harmed. No money damages or legal remedy could adequately compensate Petitioners and their
22 members for that harm.

23 33. This petition is timely filed pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167(d).

24 STATEMENT OF FACTS

25 SB 743 and Vehicle Miles Traveled

26 34. The County's action purports to implement--but fails to comply with-Senate
27 Bill 743 ("SB 743"), codified at Public Resources Code section 21099.
28 35. SB 743 directed the Office of Planning and Research to prepare and develop, and
7
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

F the California Natural Resources Agency to certify and adopt, guidelines establishing criteria for
2 determining the significance of transportation impacts under CEQA. The legislation provided

3 that transportation impacts should be evaluated in terms of vehicle miles traveled (*VMT") or
4 similar metrics, rather than "levels of service" or other measures of vehicular capacity or
5 roadway congestion. (See Pub. Resources Code § 21099(b)(1), (2).)

6 36. The Legislature specifically directed that transportation significance criteria "shall
7 promote the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, the development of multimodal
8 transportation networks, and a diversity of land uses." (Pub. Resources Code § 21099(b).)

9 37. The Office of Planning and Research developed guidelines and criteria in response
10 to SB 743 and transmitted the guidelines to the California Natural Resources Agency. In late

11 2018, the California Natural Resources Agency promulgated those guidelines and criteria by
12 adding a new section 15064.3 to the CEQA Guidelines.1

13 38. Under SB 743, local agencies like the County retain authority to establish their
14 own thresholds of significance for analyzing VMT, but only to the extent that those thresholds

15 are "more protective of the environment" than the state guidelines require. (Pub. Resources
16 Code § 21099(e).)

17 39. In December 2018, contemporaneously with the promulgation of CEQA
18 Guidelines section 15064.3, the Office of Planning and Research published a document entitled
19 "Technical Advisory on Evaluating Transportation Impacts in CEQA" ("Technical Advisory").

20 The Technical Advisory provided "technical recommendations regarding assessment of VMT,
21 thresholds of significance, and mitigation measures." (Technical Advisory at 1.)

22 40. The Technical Advisory explained that VMT analysis and mitigation are critical to
23 achievement of California's legislatively mandated targets for greenhouse gas emissions
24 reduction. Indeed, "it will not be possible to achieve the State's 2030 and post-2030 emissions
25 goals without reducing VMT growth." (Technical Advisory at 2.)

26 41. The Technical Advisory further explained that necessary reductions in VMT can

27

28 14 Cal. Code Regs. §§ 15000 et seq.

8
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 occur under CEQA through identification of significant VMT impacts and adoption of
2 mitigation measures to reduce VMT. (Technical Advisory at 2-3.)

3 42. The Technical Advisory recommended thresholds of significance for use in
4 determining whether specific projects may have significant transportation impacts, and thus

5 require VMT mitigation, under CEQA. Specifically, the Office of Planning and Research
6 "recommend[ed] using quantitative VMT thresholds linked to [greenhouse gas] reduction targets
7 when methods exist to do so." (Technical Advisory at 8.)

8 43. Informed by a quantitative assessment by the California Air Resources Board
9 evaluating the degree of VMT reduction necessary to meet the State's long-term climate goals,
10 the Technical Advisory concluded that a project with a per capita or per employee VMT that is

11 15 percent below that of existing development may reasonably be found not to have a significant
12 transportation impact. (Technical Advisory at 10-12, 15.)

13 44. The Technical Advisory concluded that "existing" VMT "may be measured as
14 regional VMT per capita or as city VMT per capita.' (Technical Advisory at 15.)
15 45. The Technical Advisory used the term "region" synonymously with the "areas"
16 subject to metropolitan planning organization jurisdiction. (Technical Advisory at 15.)
17 46. In San Diego County, the relevant metropolitan planning organization is the San
18 Diego Association of Governments ("SANDAG"), and the relevant "region" is the San Diego
19 region encompassed by SANDAG's regional transportation plan.

20 47. The Technical Advisory also discussed a possible "screening threshold" for
21  "smaller projects," under which projects generating fewer than 110 average daily trips ("ADT")
22 could be assumed to cause a less-than-significant transportation impact. (Technical Advisory at

23 12.) The Technical Advisory derived this screening threshold from a CEQA categorical
24 exemption for "existing facilities, including additions to existing structures of up to 10,000

25 square feet, so long as the project is in an area where public infrastructure is available to allow
26 for maximum planned development and the project is not in an environmentally sensitive area."
27 (Technical Advisory at 12 & fn. 19.)
28 48. The Technical Advisory identified a range of potentially feasible mitigation

9
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 measures and alternatives that could be adopted to reduce significant VMT impacts from
2 development projects. (Technical Advisory at 26-28.)

3 49. Although local agencies could "elect to be governed by" its provisions at any time

4 after promulgation, CEQA Guidelines section 15064.3 took effect statewide on July 1, 2020,

5 and applies to all environmental documents set out for public review after that date. (CEQA
6 Guidelines § § 15007(c), 15064.3(c).)
7 II. The County's Review and Approval of the SB 743 Implementation Project

8 50. On June 24, 2020, the County approved the first Transportation Study Guide.

9 51. Petitioners, and Sierra Club, filed suit against the County for its adoption of the
10 first Transportation Study Guide.

11 52. On September 15, 2021, the County rescinded the first Transportation Study
12 Guide. Shortly thereafter, Petitioners, and Sierra Club, dismissed their lawsuit.

13 53. On February 9, 2022, the County Board of Supervisors provided staff direction on
14 options to implement analysis of transportation impacts of proposed projects under CEQA using
15 VMT in two phases. Phase One was conducted without CEQA environmental analysis. Phase
16 Two will include the preparation of a Programmatic Environmental Impact Report ("EIR").

17 54. After receiving the Board's direction in February 2022, staff revised the
18 Transportation Study Guide using the transportation model developed by SANDAG to estimate
19 VMT within the region.

20 55. As part of Phase One, the final Transportation Study Guide includes a
21 presumption of less than significant transportation impact based on compliance with any of the
22 following criteria:
23 i. Projects within a VMT Efficient Area

24 ii. Projects within an Infill Area and any surrounding "Village"

25 iii. Small Project Screening Criteria (less than 110 average daily trips)
26 iv. Locally Serving Uses and Public Facilities

27 V. 100 Percent Affordable Housing

28 vi. Transit Priority Areas
10
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

F vii. Redevelopment that Lowers VMT

2 viii. Agriculture, Renewable Energy, Wineries, and similar projects
3 which may rely on qualitative analysis

4 56. According to the Board Letter supporting the Transportation Study Guide for the

5 September 28, 2022 hearing, Phase Two will include evaluation of the impacts from screening
6 out projects from VMT analysis within Transit Opportunity Areas. The programmatic EIR
7 would "provide programmatic environmental coverage for future projects within TOAs so no
8 additional VMT analysis would be required for future individual projects." (Board Letter, p. 11).

9 57. In a report to the Planning Commission, County staff conceded that most of the
10 defined "infill" areas are not located within VMT a efficient areas. As a result, projects within

11 VMT inefficient Infill Village Areas will increase regional VMT.
12 58. The County's draft SB 743 GIS maps confirm much of the Infill Village Areas
13 have VMT above the regional average.

14 59. On September 28, 2022, the County approved Resolution No. 22-144 adopting the
15 Transportation Study Guide Establishing Transportation Threshold of Significance for Vehicle
16 Miles Traveled.

17 60. In approving the Project, the County also determined the Project was exempt from
18 CEQA because: (1) it is not a "project" as defined in CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines, and
19 therefore is not subject to CEQA; (2) it is considered "ministerial" because the County is
20 mandated to comply with SB 743; (3) it is categorically exempt under CEQA Guidelines section

21 15308 as an action taken to enhance and protect the environment; and (4) it is subject to the
22 "common sense" exemption because it implements existing law and therefore has no possibility

23 of causing a significant impact on the environment.

24 61. The agenda for the Board of Supervisor's September 28, 2022 hearing included

25 the following as Item 6: "Noticed Public Hearing: Transportation Study Guide To Implement
26 Vehicle Miles Traveled Analysis During Environmental Review In The Unincorporated Areas,
27 Update On The Parcel-By-Parcel Analysis, And Updates To Fire Safety Guidelines And
28 Standards." The agenda did not include the consideration and adoption of the Notice of
11
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

M a Exemption as a separate, distinct item of business.

2 62. The County filed a Notice of Exemption regarding the project on September 28,
3 2022. The Notice of Exemption erroneously stated the Project was approved on September 15,
4 2021 and that the Transportation Study Guide was dated July 1, 2020.

5 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

6 Violations of CEQA - Against All Respondents
7 Lack of Substantial Evidence to Support Adopted Thresholds of Significance

8 (Public Resources Code § 21000 et seq; CEQA Guidelines;

9 CCP §§ 1085, 1094.5)

10 63. Petitioners hereby reallege and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs

11 in their entirety.

12 64. CEQA is designed to ensure that government agencies incorporate the goal of
13 long-term protection of the environment into their decisions. CEQA applies to any discretionary
14 action taken by an agency that may cause a reasonably foreseeable change in the environment.
15 65. Public agencies may not approve projects as proposed if there are feasible
16 mitigation measures or alternatives that would substantially lessen the significant environmental
17 effects of those projects. (Pub. Resources Code § 21002.) Public agencies are thus required to
18 mitigate or avoid the significant environmental effects of projects they approve whenever it is
19 feasible to do so. (Pub. Resources Code § 21002.1(b).)

20 66. "Determining whether a project may have a significant effect plays a critical role

21 in the CEQA process." (CEQA Guidelines § 15064(a).) If there is substantial evidence in light
22 of the whole record that a project may have a significant effect on the environment, the lead

23 agency must prepare an environmental impact report. (CEQA Guidelines § 15064(a)(1).) And if
24 the final environmental impact report identifies one or more significant effects, the agency must
25 make specific findings that feasible mitigation measures or alternatives that reduce or avoid
26 those effects have been incorporated into the project. (CEQA Guidelines § 15064(a)(2); see Pub.
27 Resources Code § 21081.)

28 67. The determination of whether an impact is significant "calls for careful judgment"
12
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

F on the part of the public agency, "based to the extent possible on scientific and factual data."
2 (CEQA Guidelines § 15064(b)(1).)

3 68. A "threshold of significance" is "an identifiable quantitative, qualitative, or
4 performance level of a particular environmental effect, non-compliance with which means the

5 effect will normally be determined to be significant by the agency and compliance with which
6 means the effect normally will be determined to be less than significant." (CEQA Guidelines §

7 15064.7(a).)

8 69. Thresholds of significance may assist public agencies in determining whether an
9 environmental impact is significant. (CEQA Guidelines § 15064(b)(2).) However, compliance
10 with a threshold of significance does not relieve an agency of responsibility for determining

11 whether substantial evidence indicates an impact may be significant notwithstanding compliance
12 with the threshold. (Id.; Protect the Historic Amador Waterways v. Amador Water Agency

13 (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 1099, 1106-1107.)
14 70. An agency's determination as to whether an environmental impact is significant
15 must be based on substantial evidence in the record. (CEQA Guidelines § 15064(f).)

16 71. Thresholds of significance serve the same purpose: to aid the agency in
17 determining whether environmental impacts are significant. Accordingly, a threshold of
18 significance adopted by a public agency for general use in that agency's environmental review
19 process also must be supported by substantial evidence. (CEQA Guidelines § 15064.7(b).)

20 72. The thresholds of significance contained within the Transportation Study Guide
21 are not supported by substantial evidence.

22 73. Respondent's decision to adopt the Infill Village Area "screening" threshold
23 exempting projects within so-called "infill" areas and corresponding villages, is not supported
24 by substantial evidence.

25 74. The County did not consider VMT in developing the Infill Village Area exemption
26 or defining "infill."

27 75. The County's infill areas do not meet the CEQA definition of "infill" pursuant to
28 Public Resources Code Sections 21099, 21094.5, 21180, or 21061.3.
13
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

F 76. The County's "infill" designation is not a land use category in the General Plan

2 and was created solely to further the Transportation Study Guide's screening of thousands of
3 housing units from VMT transportation impact analysis and mitigation.

4 77. The County's definition and development of "urban areas" does not comply with

5 the CEQA definition of "urbanized area" at Public Resources Code Section 21071.

6 78. In approving the Project, the County did not consider whether development in
7 Infill Village Areas would increase VMT.

8 79. By definition, the Infill Village Areas have VMT that is above the quantitative
9 threshold of significance of 15 percent below regional baseline VMT.
10 80. Without analysis and mitigation, projects within Infill Village Areas with VMT
11 above the regional average will result in transportation impacts.

12 81. Respondent's decision to adopt a "screening" threshold exempting projects
13 generating less than 110 ADT was unsupported by substantial evidence for several reasons:
14 a. The "screening" threshold takes into account only the number of daily trips,
15 not their length. Vehicle trips originating in rural and semi-rural areas of the County are longer
16 than vehicle trips originating elsewhere. Accordingly, there is no substantial evidence ADT
17 serves as an adequate proxy for VMT in the unincorporated County.
18 b. Available trip-generation data do not support the "screening" threshold.

19 C. The Technical Advisory does not provide substantial evidence to support

20 the County's application of the "screening" threshold to rural and semi-rural residential
21 development.

22 d. The County's attempt to exempt a substantial number of residential
23 development in rural and semi-rural areas-where vehicle trips are likely to be the longest-
24 from VMT analysis is unsupported by substantial evidence.

25 82. The County prejudicially abused its discretion in adopting thresholds of
26 significance that are unsupported by substantial evidence.

3 Violations of CEQA - Against All Respondents

4 Improper Determination that Project is Exempt from CEQA

5 83. (Pub. Resources Code § 21000 et seq.; § CCP §§ 1085, 1094.5)
Petitioners hereby reallege and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs
6 in their entirety.

7 84. Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by finding and determining that
8 their adoption of the Transportation Study Guide and thresholds of significance was exempt
9 from CEQA. As a result, a Respondents failed to disclose or evaluate the potentially significant
10 environmental effects of their actions, and further failed to consider mitigation measures and
11 alternatives that could lessen or avoid those impacts.

12 85. Each of Respondents' rationales for finding the Project exempt from CEQA is
13 both legally erroneous and unsupported by substantial evidence.
14 86. Adoption of the Transportation Study Guide and thresholds of significance is a
15| "project" under CEQA because it has the potential to cause direct or reasonably foreseeable
16 indirect changes in the environment. (Pub. Resources Code § 21065; CEQA Guidelines .0.
17 15378.) The Project is not subject to any of the exceptions to the definition of a "project"
18 provided in CEQA Guidelines section 15378(b), including the exception for proposed state
19 legislation.

20 87.

21 88. The Project is not exempt from CEQA as a ministerial action.
The Project is not subject to the categorical exemption in CEQA Guidelines
22 section 15308 for agency actions taken to protect or enhance the environment.

23 89. The Project is not subject to CEQA's "common sense" exception (CEQA
24 Guidelines section 15061(b)(3)) because it cannot be seen a with a certainty that there is no
25 possibility the Project may have a significant environmental impact.

2 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

3 Violation of State Law - Declaratory Relief - Against All Respondents

Conflict with SB 743

4 (CCP § 1060)

5 90. Petitioners hereby reallege and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs
6 in their entirety.

7 91. An actual and immediate controversy has arisen and now exists regarding the
8 legality of the County's action in adopting Transportation Study Guidelines and thresholds of
9 significance that could exempt thousands of dwelling units from the VMT analysis and
10 mitigation required by SB 743.

11 92. SB 743 mandates that "criteria" for determining the significance of transportation
12 impacts "promote the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, the development of multimodal
13 transportation networks, and a diversity of land uses." (Pub. Resources Code § 21099(b)(1).)

14 93. The Technical Advisory states that local agencies should select thresholds of
15 significance for transportation impacts that align with all three of these goals.
16 94. The County's Transportation Study Guidelines and thresholds of significance not
17 only fail to align with the goals of SB 743, but also directly conflict with and undermine the
18 Legislature's purpose and intent in enacting SB 743.

19 95.

20 The primary purpose and effect of the Transportation Study Guide and thresholds
of significance is to exempt development in large areas of the County from any requirement to
21 analyze transportation impacts under CEQA. Under the County's thresholds, thousands of
22 potential General Plan dwelling units (units in Infill Village Areas and residential developments

23

24 in rural and semi-rural land use categories) would not be required to analyze or mitigate VMT.

96. Achieving California's legislatively mandated climate goals will require
25 reductions in VMT. Yet there is no evidence that the Transportation Study Guide and associated
26 thresholds of significance will actually reduce VMT in the County.

27 97. As noted in the Office of Planning and Research Technical Advisory, in the
28 absence of VMT analysis and mitigation in CEQA, lead agencies might ignore the longer-term
16
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

F climate change impacts resulting from land use development and infrastructure decisions.
2 (Technical Advisory at 2). The County has done just that here.

3 98. Directing development toward "infill" areas may be a sound policy decision;
4 however, the County's decision to exempt all Infill Village Areas from any VMT analysis or
5 mitigation is contrary to SB 743. The County exempted thousands of development units without

6 regard for their impact on California's climate goals, development of multimodal transportation
7 networks, or regional VMT.

8 99. The Transportation Study Guidelines impermissibly create a presumption that
9 future projects will not result in significant impacts related to air quality, noise, safety, or other
10 impacts associated with transportation, and thus violate the plain requirements of SB 743. (Pub.
11 Resources Code § 21099(b)(3).)

12 100. A judicial declaration is necessary and appropriate at this time in order that the
13 parties ascertain the correct interpretation of SB 743 in light of its contemporaneous
14 construction by the Office of Planning and Research, and further ascertain their rights and
15 obligations with respect to the selection of thresholds of significance necessary to comply with
16 and implement SB 743.
17 101. Therefore, Petitioners seek a declaration that the County's action in approving the
18 Transportation Study Guide and thresholds of significance that will interfere with disclosure and
19 mitigation of other transportation impacts, while at the same time exempting thousands of
20 potential General Plan dwelling units from VMT analysis and mitigation, conflicts with the
21 intent and purpose of SB 743, is an abuse of discretion, or otherwise fails to comply with the

22 law.

23 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

24 WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for judgment as follows:

25 1. Alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing the County to vacate and
26 set aside all approvals related to the Project, including adoption of Resolution No. 22-144, the
27 Transportation Study Guide, associated thresholds of significance, and accompanying findings
28 and determinations;
17
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

M 2. Alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing the County to comply with
2 the requirements of CEQA and to take any other action as required by Public Resources Code
3 section 21168.9;

4 3. For a temporary stay, temporary restraining order, and preliminary and permanent

5 injunctions restraining Respondents and their agents, servants, and employees, and all others
6 acting in concert with Respondents on their behalf, from taking any action to implement the

7 Project, pending full compliance with the requirements of CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines, and
8 other applicable authority;

9 4. For a declaration that the Project as adopted conflicts with and impedes the
10 purposes and intent of SB 743;

11 5. For costs of the suit;

12 6. For an order awarding Petitioners their attorneys' fees under Code of Civil
13 Procedure section 1021.5 and other applicable authority; and
14 7. For such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

Re: Notice of Intent to Sue
SB 743 Transportation Study Guide

Dear Ms. Silva:

This letter is to notify you that Cleveland National Forest Foundation (CNFF") and Coastal Environmental Rights Foundation ("CERF") intend to file suit against the County of San Diego for failure to comply with the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code section 21000 et seq., the CEQA Guidelines, California Code of Regulations section 15000 et seq., and other state laws in connection with the County's September 28, 2022 approval of the Transportation Study Guide establishing the Transportation Threshold of Significance for Vehicles Miles Traveled. This notice is given pursuant to Public
Resources Code section 21167.5.

Petitioners will also seek an award of attorneys' fees under Code of Civil Procedure
section 1021.5. This letter is to provide notice of the same pursuant to Graham v.
DaimlerChrysler Corp. (2004) 34 Cal.4th 553, 577. Petitioners recognize the public interest
would be best served if the County were to voluntarily comply with its statutory duties in order
to avoid the unnecessary expenses of litigation. If the County is interested in resolving this
matter please contact me immediately.

Sincerely,
