VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

-

2 Petitioner SUNFLOWER ALLIANCE (*Petitioner") brings this action for writ of mandate
under the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") (**Petition") on behalf of Petitioner's
3 interested members and residents, and in the public interest.

4 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

5 1.

6 On November 24, 2021, the State of California Natural Resources Agency,
Department of Conservation, Geologic Energy Management Division (*Management Division" or
7 "Respondent") issued a Notice of Exemption ("NOE") for the PAL Reabold 072-00-0001 Project
8 (the "Project"), with "Reabold California" as the Project Applicant, determining that the Project is

9 exempt from further environmental review requirements of the California Environmental Quality
10 Act.

11 2.

12 The NOE determines that the Project is subject to a Class 1 Categorical Exemption

13 for "Existing Facilities" pursuant to 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15301.

3. The NOE further determines that the Project is exempt from CEQA as an ongoing
14 project Pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21169 and 14 Cal. Code Regs. Section
15 15261(b).

16 4. The Project seeks to allow disposal of wastewater into a Class II Water Disposal
17 well proposed to be installed in an existing well boring in the Brentwood oil field (the "Well").

18 5.

19 The Well is currently listed as plugged and abandoned.

6.

20 The Well was previously used as a Dry Gas well.
7.

21 The Well has never been used for wastewater injection.

8. Class Categorical Exemptions apply only to "the operation, repair, maintenance,
22 permitting, leasing, licensing, or minor alteration of existing public or private structures, facilities,
23 mechanical equipment, or topographical features, involving negligible or no expansion of existing
24 or former use." 14 Cal. Code Regs § 15301. New uses, requiring new permits, do not fall under
25 the category of a negligible or no expansion of existing use or former.

26 9. The ongoing project exemption does not exempt new entitlements approved for
27 existing projects after April 5, 1973.

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 10. The Project permits a greater scope of activities and environmental effects than
2 originally permitted.

3 11. The Court should therefore issue a peremptory writ of mandate, vacating
4 Respondent's NOE, unless and until the Project can be brought into compliance with the law.

5 THE PARTIES

6 12. Petitioner SUNFLOWER ALLIANCE is an unincorporated association committed
7 to environmental justice and the health and safety of San Francisco Bay Area communities
8 threatened by toxic pollution and climate disruption. The mailing address for Sunflower Alliance
9 is P.O. Box 1934, El Cerrito, CA, 94530-1934.

10 13. Respondent CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION, GEOLOGIC

11 ENERGY MANAGEMENT DIVISION is the public agency and the CEQA "Lead Agency" that
12 approved the CEQA Categorical Exemption for the Project, and approved the Project.

13 14. Real Party in Interest REABOLD CALIFORNIA, LLC is the Project applicant,
14 well owner, and leaseholder for two producing wells with production approaching 300 barrels of
15 oil per day and 300 barrels of water per day. According to the Secretary of State's business portal,
16 the entity mailing address for REABOLD CALIFORNIA, LLC is P.O. Box 520 Lincoln, CA
17 95648. According to the Secretary of State's business portal, the entity address and address for
18 service of process for REABOLD CALIFORNIA, LLC is 5701 Lonetree Blvd., Suite 226,
19 Rocklin, CA 95765. Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that Reabold
20 California, named as the Project applicant in the NOE is, in fact, Reabold California, LLC.
21 15. The true names and capacities of the Respondents named here as DOES 1 through
22 100, inclusive, are presently unknown to Petitioner. As such, Petitioner has sued these
23 Respondents by fictitious names, and Petitioner will seek to amend this Petition to show their true
24 names and capacities when ascertained.

25 16. The true names and capacities of the Respondents named here as DOES 101
26 through 200, inclusive, are presently unknown to Petitioner. As such. Petitioner has sued these

27

28

2
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Respondents by fictitious names, and Petitioner will seek to amend this Petition to show their true

2 names and capacities when ascertained.

3 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4 17. This Court has jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandate to set aside Respondent's
5 actions and decisions relating to the NOE and the Project, and to compel Respondent to comply
6 with CEQA under California Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 and California Public
7 Resources Code sections 21168 and/or 21168.5.

8 18. This Court has jurisdiction to issue an order for injunctive relief pursuant to
9 California Code of Civil Procedure section 525 et seq.

10 19. Venue is proper in the County of Alameda under California Code of Civil
11 Procedure section 393 and 401 and California Government Code section 955.3. Respondent is a
12 state agency with its principal offices in Sacramento, and the Attorney General has offices in
13 Alameda County.

14 NOTICE REQUIREMENTS AND TIMING
15 20. Respondent filed a Notice of Exemption exempting the Project from CEQA review
16 on November 24, 2021.

17 21. Petitioner filed this action within the applicable statute of limitation as required by
18 14 California Code of Regulations section 15062(d).

19 22. On December 28, 2021, prior to commencing this action, Petitioner served
20 Respondent with written notice of Petitioner's intent to commence this action under CEQA, and
21 thus Petitioner has complied with the requirements of California Public Resources Code section
22 21167.5. Copies of that written notice and proof of service are attached as Exhibit A.
23 23. Petitioner is filing and serving, concurrently with the filing of this Petition,
24 Petitioner's election to prepare the administrative record.
25 24. Petitioner is filing and serving, concurrently with the filing of this Petition, a
26 Request for Hearing concurrently with the filing of this Petition, and thus complied with Public
27 Resources Code section 21167.4.

28

3
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 ADDITIONAL STANDING ALLEGATIONS

2 25. Petitioner and its respective members and residents live in the areas included in,
3 and that will otherwise be affected by the Project, and use the areas affected by the Project for
4 recreational and educational purposes.

5 26. Petitioner and its respective members and residents are directly and beneficially
6| interested in Respondents' mandatory duty to fully comply with CEQA, and Petitioner and its
7 respective members and residents are directly and beneficially interested in, and aggrieved by, the
8 acts, decisions, and omissions of Respondents as alleged in this Petition.

9 27. The requirement that Petitioners exhaust all administrative remedies prior to filing

10 a petition for writ of mandate pursuant Cal. Pub. Resources Code § 21167 "applies where (1)
11 CEQA provides a public comment period, or (2) there is public hearing before a notice of
12 determination is issued." (Azusa Land Reclamation Co. V. Main Gabriel Basin Watermaster
13 (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 1165, 1210). Where NOE is issued, there is "no "public comment period
14 provided by CEQA' and there [is] no *public hearing before the issuance of the notice of
15 determination.' Consequently, Public Resources Code section 21177 has no application" in such
16 instances. (ld.; see also Cal. Pub. Resources Code § 21177(e) (*This section does not apply to any
17 alleged grounds for noncompliance with this division for which there was no public hearing or
18 other opportunity for members of the public to raise those objections orally or in writing before
19 approval of the project . . . .").) Accordingly, "the only prerequisite to challenging an exemption
20 I determination is that it be brought within 180 days of the date of the final decision of the agency"

21 or within 35 days of the filing of the NOE and the posting on the list of notices. (Azusa Land
22| Reclamation Co., supra, 52 Cal.App.4th at 1210, citing 14 CCR 15062(d).)
23 28. Petitioner does not have a plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course
24 of law. Without the requested mandatory and injunctive relief, Petitioner and its respective
25 members and residents will be irreparably harmed by implementation of the Project and by
26 Respondent's violations of CEQA. Such harm cannot be adequately compensated by money or
27 other legal remedies.

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL DOCTRINE

2 29. Petitioner brings this action as a private attorney general pursuant to California
3 Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5, and any other applicable legal theory, to enforce
4 important rights affecting the public interest.

5 30. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will confer significant benefits on

6 the general public by, among other benefits: 1) requiring Respondent to properly disclose, analyze
7 and mitigate the direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts of the Project that were not properly
8 disclosed, analyzed or mitigated, 2) ensuring that Respondent properly consider alternatives and/or
9 mitigation measures to reduce or avoid the Project's potentially significant, adverse environmental
10 effects, 3) requiring Respondent to implement all feasible alternatives and mitigation measures to
11 avoid such adverse effects or reduce them to less-than-significant levels, and 4) ensuring that
12 Respondent affords the public and affected agencies with the opportunity to review and comment
13 on potentially significant project impacts, and receiving : meaningful and complete response to
14 any such comments on such issues, prior to the approval of such Project.
15 31. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will result in the enforcement of
16 important rights affecting the public interest. By compelling Respondent to complete a legally
17 adequate analysis of the Project, to protect public health and natural resources, Respondent will be
18 required to properly and publicly disclose and analyze all of the Project's potentially significant,
19 adverse environmental effects, and to ensure that all feasible mitigation measures or alternatives
20 that would reduce or avoid the Project's potentially significant, adverse environmental impacts are
21 implemented.

22 32. The necessity and financial burden of enforcement are such as to make an award of
23 attorneys' fees appropriate in this proceeding. Absent enforcement by Petitioner, the Project might
24  otherwise be deemed valid despite its legally and factually inadequate NOE, disclosures, analysis,
25 conclusions, mitigation measures, and alternatives, among other things, and, as a result, potentially
26 significant, adverse environmental effects might otherwise have evaded legally adequate
27 environmental review and mitigation in accordance with the California Legislature's policy, in
28

5
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

of the P adopting CEQA, of affording the greatest protections to the environment within the scope

2 statute.

3 33. Petitioner will serve a copy of this Petition, once filed, on the Attorney General's
4 office to give notice of Petitioner's intent to bring this proceeding as private attorneys general
5 under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5.

6 LEGAL FRAMEWORK

7 34. CEQA has two purposes: environmental protection and informed self-government.
Woodward Park Homeowners Assn., Inc. V. City of Fresno, 150 Cal.App.4th 683, 690-691 (2007).

9 CEQA is "to be interpreted to afford the fullest possible protection to the environment within the
10 reasonable scope of the statutory language." Mountain Lion Foundation v. Fish & Game Com., 16
11 Cal.4th 105, 134 (1997). CEQA requires agencies to "take all action necessary to protect,
12 rehabilitate, and enhance the environmental quality of the state." Pub. Resources Code, §

13 |21001(a).

14 35. Pursuant to CEQA, a "project" is an activity which may cause either direct physical
15 change in the environment, or reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment
16 (Pub. Resources Code § 21065(a)); and a "discretionary" project is one that is subject to
17 judgmental controls, where the agency can use its judgment to decide whether and how to carry

a 18 out a project. Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, ch. 3 ("CEQA Guidelines"), § 15002(i). Prior to approving §

19 any discretionary project, an agency must fully disclose and analyze all of the project's potentially
20 significant direct, indirect, and cumulative environmental effects. See, e.g., CEQA Guidelines §
21 15002(f)), and that public agencies avoid or minimize such environmental damage where feasible.
22 CEQA Guidelines § 15021(a). Pursuant to this duty, no public agency may approve or carry out a
23 project where one or more significant effects on the environment may occur if the project is
24 approved, unless certain narrow findings are made. CEQA Guidelines §§ 15091, 15093.

25 36. Respondent's approval of the Project was a discretionary decision.

26 37. Class Categorical Exemptions apply only to "the operation, repair, maintenance,
27 permitting, leasing, licensing, or minor alteration of existing public or private structures, facilities,

28

6
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 mechanical equipment, or topographical features, involving negligible or no expansion of existing
2 or former use." (14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15301 (emphasis added).)

3 38. Modification of the Well to allow for installation of a new Class II Water Disposal
4 well and new well uses, requiring new permits, does not fall into the category of an "existing
5 facility" or a "negligible or no expansion of an existing or former use," particularly where the
6 supposed existing facility has never undergone environmental review. (See Communities for a
7 Better Environment v. South Coast Air Quality Management Dist., 48 Cal.4th 310, 317-319, 326
8 [refinery expansion "*cannot be characterized as merely the modification of a previously analyzed
9 project"].)

10 39. A "minor' alteration cannot be an activity that creates a reasonable possibility of a
11 significant environmental effect." (Azusa Land Reclamation Co, supra,. 52 Cal.App.4th at 1194).
12 40. The "key consideration" in determining whether a Class Categorical Exemption
13 applies is whether the Project involves "negligible" or "no expansion" of an existing or former
14 use. (14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15301).

15 41. Exemption categories are "*"not to be expanded or broadened beyond the
16 reasonable scope of their statutory language."* (World Business Academy v. State Lands Com.
17 (2018) 24 Cal.App.5th 476, 495; see also Save Our Carmel River v. Monterey Peninsula Water
18 Management Dist. (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 677, 697 [categorical exemptions usually narrowly
19 construed "to afford the fullest possible environmental protection"].)
20 42. CEQA Guidelines section 15261, subdivision (b), provides, "A private project shall
21 be exempt from CEQA if the project received approval of a lease, license, certificate, permit, or
22 other entitlement for use from a public agency prior to April 5, 1973 ..."
23 43. The CEQA Guidelines recognize this statutory exemption for projects that are
24 | **still' being carried out . . . ." (North Coast Rivers Alliance v. Wetlands Water Dist. (2014) 174
25 Cal. App. 4th 832, 855). "[T]he exemption is evidently founded, at least in part, on the fact that
26 CEQA, as a statutory enactment, was intended by the Legislature to have a prospective, not
27 retroactive, application." (Id). "The key issue in analyzing the exemption is whether the
28

7
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

challenged action is 'a normal, intrinsic part of the ongoing operation' of a project approved prior
2 to CEQA, rather than an expansion or modification thereof." (Id. at 857).

3 44. Whether an activity requires environmental review depends on whether it expands
4 or enlarges project facilities or whether it "merely monitors and adjusts the operation of existing
5 facilities to meet fluctuating conditions." (Nacimiento Regional Water Management Advisory

6 Com. v. Monterey County Water Resources Agency (1993) 15 Cal. App. 4th 200, 205, citing
7 County of Inyo V. Yorty (1973) 32 Cal. App. 3d 795, 806-807). Where there is a "change in

8 proposed operation" or a "chang[e] [in] the focus" of a Project, the "Ongoing Project" exemption
9 is inapplicable. (County of Amador, County of Amador v. El Dorado County Water Agency (1999)
10 76 Cal.App.4th 931, 968-69). "[O]ngoing projects that contemplate expansion or revisions are
11 subject to environmental review." (Id. at 968, citing Nacimiento, supra, 15 Cal. App. 4th at 206-
12 207). Where a project "entail[s] revisions in procedures" rather than "*continued operations within
13 existing parameters," the "ongoing project" exemption does not apply. (Id. at 969, citing
14 Nacimiento, supra, 15 Cal. App. 4th at 207-208).

15 45. There have been at least twelve (12) amendments to oil and gas laws since CEQA's
16 passage on November 23, 1970, highlighting the Legislature's intent not to insulate from review
17 Projects that do not clearly fall within the "Ongoing Project" exception. (See, e.g., 14 Cal. Code
18 Regs., §§ 1723, 1722.8 (1974); 1721.7 (1975); 1722(d), 1722.5, 1722(b) (1978); Pub. Resources
19 Code §§ 3222 (1976); 3202 (1988); 3203(c) (1991, 2000); 3106(c) (1994); 3205.3, 3011(a)
20 (2020).)
21 CAUSE OF ACTION

22 (Violations of CEQA)

23 46. Petitioner incorporates by reference the allegations of set forth above, as if fully set
24| forth in this paragraph.

25 47. Respondent prejudicially abused its discretion in approving an "*Ongoing Project"
26 exemption for the Project.

27

28

8
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 48. Respondent did not proceed in the manner required by law in approving the
2 Project, and its decision in issuing the Ongoing Project exemption is not supported by substantial
3 evidence. (See, e.g., County of Amador, supra, 76 Cal.App.4th at 968 (*change in proposed
4 operation renders exemption inapplicable); see also Nacimiento, supra, 15 Cal. App. 4th at 206-
5 08 (ongoing projects that contemplate expansion or revisions, rather than continued operations
6 within existing parameters, are subject to environmental review).)

7 49. Respondent prejudicially abused its discretion in issuing a Class Categorical
8 Exemption.

9 50. Respondent did not proceed in the manner required by law in approving the
10 Project, and its decision in issuing the Categorical Exemption is not supported by substantial
11 evidence. (Berkeley Hillside Preservation v. City of Berkeley (2015) 60 Cal.4th 1086, 1110
12 (setting forth standard of review); see also County of Amador, supra, 76 Cal.App.4th at 966-67
13 (change in focus of project operation does not constitute "negligible expansion of current use").)
14 These legal deficiencies include, without limitation, the following:
15 51. The NOE impermissibly utilizes the "Ongoing Project" exemption to approve a
16 Project that is not ongoing. As stated in the NOE, the existing well boring that the Project seeks to

17 turn into a Class II Water Disposal well "is currently listed as plugged and abandoned." This
18 defies any reasonable interpretation of a Project that is "still being carried out," and is contrary to
19 the CEQA Guidelines as well as established precedent.
20 52. The conversion of a currently plugged and abandoned well boring into a Class II
21 Water Disposal Well is not "a normal, intrinsic part of the ongoing operation' of a project
22 approved prior to CEQA, rather than an expansion or modification thereof."
23 53. The conversion of a currently plugged and abandoned well boring into Class II
24 Water Disposal well constitutes a "*change in proposed operation" or a "chang[e] [in] the focus" of
25 a Project.

26 54. The NOE impermissibly designates the plugged, abandoned boring well as an
27| "existing facility." While a facility used to provide natural gas is listed as an example of a Class
28

9
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

"Existing Facility" to which the Categorical Exemption may apply, facilities used to provide either
2 oil or wastewater disposal are not listed. 14 Cal. Code Regs § 15301.

3 55. The Well is not an "existing facility" pursuant to CEQA.

4 56. The alteration of the Well from one that has been plugged, abandoned, and
5 nonoperational for some undisclosed amount of time to one into which approximately 300 barrels

6 of oil production wastewater per day will be disposed does not constitute a "minor alteration."
(See 14 Cal. Code Regs § 15301 (The alteration of an existing facility must be minor); see also

8 Azusa Land Reclamation Co., supra, 52 Cal. App. 4th at 1194 (a "minor alteration" "has to be one

9 that is so small that it does not cross the threshold level set by the [CEQA] Guidelines for an
10 exception to the categorical exemptions. Thus, a 'minor' alteration cannot be an activity that
11 creates a reasonable possibility of a significant environmental effect").)

12 57. The expansion of use of the Well from one that has been plugged, abandoned, and
13 nonoperational as a "Dry Gas" well for some undisclosed period of time to one into which
14 approximately 300 barrels of oil production wastewater per day will be disposed does not
15 constitute "negligible or no expansion of former use." (14 Cal. Code. Regs § 15301; see also
16 Communities for a Better Environment, supra, 48 Cal.4th at 326 (adding a new process to the

17 facility requiring the installation of new equipment as well as the modification and increased

18 operation of other equipment constitutes a significant expansion of use).)

19 58. The Project proposes a new well use - wastewater disposal instead of dry gas
20 production - requires new permits in order to operate, constitutes a change in the focus of Project
21 operation, and is therefore not a "negligible or no expansion of former use."
22 59. For each of these reasons, Respondent prejudicially abused its discretion and failed
23 to proceed in the manner required by law in issuing the NOE and approving the Project.
24 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for relief as follows:
25 l. That this Court issue a peremptory writ of mandate:
