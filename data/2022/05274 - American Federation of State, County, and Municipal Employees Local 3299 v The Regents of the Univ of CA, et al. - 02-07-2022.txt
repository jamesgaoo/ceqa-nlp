FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 INTRODUCTION

2 1. Petitioner American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees Local

3 3299 ("Local 3299" or "Petitioner") brings this action to challenge the unlawful actions of

4 Respondent The Regents of the University of California ("University") in certifying the

5 Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") for the University of California Berkeley's ("UC Berkeley")

6 2021 Long Range Development Plan ("2021 LRDP") and Housing Projects #1 and #2, approving the

7 2021 LRDP and Housing Projects #1, and making related findings (collectively, "the Project")

8 because the EIR fails to satisfy the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act

9 ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code § 21000 et seq., and the CEQA Guidelines, title 14, California

10 Code of Regulations, § 15000 et seq.

11 2. The Project has three components: (1) the 2021 Long Range Development Plan

12 Update for the University of California, Berkeley campus, (2) Housing Project #1, also referred to as

13 Anchor House, and (3) Housing Project #2, also referred to as People's Park.

14 3. The University of California ("University") prepared and certified an Environmental
15 Impact Report that included a programmatic-level environmental analysis of the 2021 LRDP and
16 project-level analyses of Housing Projects #1 and #2. On or about July 22, 2021, the University
17 certified the EIR and approved the 2021 LRDP and Housing Project #1.
18
4. In certifying the EIR, the University failed to comply with CEQA. More specifically,
19

20 the University prejudicially abused its discretion and failed to proceed in the manner required by law

21 by certifying an EIR that does not adequately analyze or mitigate the Project's significant

22 environmental impacts. The EIR also fails to provide a CEQA-compliant alternatives analysis,

23 response to comments, or statement of overriding considerations. As a result of these and other

24 deficiencies, the EIR fails as an informational document.

25 5. Because the EIR violates CEQA, the approvals that are reliant upon it must be

26 overturned. Therefore, Petitioner respectfully requests that the Court direct Respondents to set aside

27 the certification of the EIR and associated approvals of the 2021 LRDP, Housing Project #1, and

28 Housing Project #2.

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 PARTIES

2 Petitioner and Plaintiff

3 6. Petitioner and Plaintiff American Federation of State, County, and Municipal

4 Employees Local 3299 is a public services employee union representing thousands of members

5 throughout the University of California system. Some of those members live, work, and recreate near
6 the UC Berkeley Campus and in Alameda County, including more than 950 who work at UC
7 Berkeley and the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. Local 3299's members are predominantly people
8
of color and are among the University of California's lowest-paid workers. Local 3299's purposes
9
include advocating for vital services that keep Local 3299 members and their families safe, make 10

11 their communities strong, and protect the environment.

12 7. Local 3299 and its members have a direct and beneficial interest in compliance with

13 laws bearing upon approval of the Project. These interests will be directly and adversely affected by

14 the Project, which violate provisions of law as set forth in this Petition and would cause substantial

15 harm to public safety, the natural environment, and the quality of life in the surrounding community.

16 Local 3299 and its members will suffer injury from adverse environmental impacts caused by the

17 construction and operation of the Project if the legal violations alleged in this Petition and Complaint

18 are not remedied. Local 3299 brings this action to represent and advocate for the beneficial interests

19 of its members in obtaining relief from these legal violations and to protect its members' safety,

20 advocate for affordable housing, improve quality of life, protect the environment, and ensure that the

21 University adheres to the requirements of CEQA in evaluating the Project. In addition, increased

22 demand for housing in the area surrounding the proposed Project is likely to harm Local 3299's
23 members who live in the area by raising rents, thereby causing economic injury or displacement or
24 both. Local 3299 actively participated in the Project's administrative approval process. Local 3299
25 expressed its concerns regarding the Project in writing to the University and urged the University to
26 remedy the EIR's deficiencies and to comply with CEQA.
27
8. Local 3299 brings this action on behalf of itself, its members, and in the public
28
interest. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will confer a significant benefit on the general

3
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

public by requiring Respondents to carry out its duties under CEQA and other applicable laws before
approving the Project. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will also result in the

3 enforcement of important rights affecting the public interest by compelling Respondents to engage in
a legally adequate analysis of the Project, and to ensure that the public has a meaningful opportunity
to review and comment on the impacts and mitigation measures for the Project.
6
9. Local 3299 has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law
7 unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondent to set aside its
certificate of the EIR and the Approvals. In the absence of such remedies, the Regents' decisions
will remain in effect in violation of state law and Local 3299 and its members will be irreparably
10
harmed.
11

12 10. Unless enjoined, Respondent will implement the Project despite its lack of

13 compliance with CEQA. Local 3299 will suffer irreparable harm by Respondent's failure to take the

14 required steps to comply with CEQA's procedures and protect the environment.

15 Respondent and Defendant

16 11. Respondent The Regents of the University of California ("University") is a public

17 trust corporation and state agency established pursuant to the California Constitution vested with
18 administering the University of California including the management and disposition of facilities at

19 the UC Berkeley Campus. The Regents is the lead agency under CEQA for consideration of
20 certification of the EIR and has principal responsibility for approving the 2021 LRDP, Anchor House

21 (also referred to herein as "Housing Project #1"), and People's Park (also referred to herein as

22 "Housing Project #2").

23 Real Parties in Interest and Defendants

24 12. Real Party in Interest University of California, Berkeley, is listed as the applicant on
25 the Notices of Determination for the 2021 LRDP and Housing Projects #1 and #2.
26 13. Real Party in Interest Helen Diller Foundation is a non-profit public benefit
27 corporation and is providing funding for Housing Project #1.
28

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 14. Petitioner and Plaintiff does not know the true names and capacities of Real Parties in

2 Interest and Defendants fictitiously named herein as DOES 1 through 10, inclusive. Petitioner is

3 informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that such fictitiously named Real Parties in Interest and

4 Defendants are responsible in some manner for the acts or omissions complained of or pending

5 herein. Petitioner and Plaintiff will amend this Petition to allege the fictitiously named Real Party in

6 Interest's and Defendants' true names and capacities when ascertained.

7 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

8 15. This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this Petition pursuant to Code

9 of Civil Procedure §§1085 and 1094.5 and Public Resources Code §821168 and 21168.5. The Court

10 has jurisdiction to issue declaratory relief pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 1060 and injunctive

11 relief pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 525 et seq.

12 16. Venue is proper pursuant to CCP §§ 393(b) (actions against public officers) and 395
13 (actions generally) because Respondent is an agency of the State of California. Venue is proper in

14 this Court because the causes of action alleged in this Petition and Complaint arose in the County of

15 Alameda, the Project will occur within the County of Alameda, and the environmental impacts of the

16 Project will be acutely felt within the County of Alameda.

17 17. This action was timely filed. Petitioner filed this Petition and Complaint prior to the

18 expiration of any applicable statute of limitations.

19 18. Petitioner performed all conditions precedent to filing this action by complying with
20 the requirements of PRC § 21167.5. Petitioner served the University with written notice of

21 commencement of this action on August 18, 2021. A copy of the written notice of commencement
22 of this action and proof of service is attached hereto as Exhibit A.

23 19. Pursuant to PRC § 21167.6(b), Petitioner has elected to prepare the record of
24 proceedings in this matter, and is simultaneously filing their notice of intent to prepare said record of
25 proceedings with this Petition and Complaint. A true and correct copy of Petitioner's Notice of
26 Intent to Prepare Record is attached to this complaint as Exhibit B.
27 20. Petitioner provided notice of this action to the Attorney General of the State of
28 California on August 24, 2021, by serving a copy of the Petition in this action along with a notice of

5
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 its filing, as required by PRC 21167.7 and CCP § 388.

2 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

3 21. Local 3299 has actively participated in the administrative and environmental review

4 process prior to close of the public hearings on the Project and before the issuance of the Notices of
5 Determination. Local 3299 has fully exhausted administrative remedies to the extent required by law.

6 Pub. Res. Code §21177(a).
7 22. CEQA allows a petitioner who objected to a project to allege in a petition all
8 deficiencies asserted by others. California Clean Energy Committee v. City of Woodland (2014) 225
9
Cal.App.4th 173, 191. Local 3299, agencies, interested groups, and individuals commented on
10
the Project and raised each of the legal deficiencies asserted in this Petition and Complaint. 11
23.
12 The University has taken final agency actions certifying the EIR and adopting related

13 Project approvals and findings. The Regents had a mandatory duty to comply with all applicable

14 laws, including CEQA, prior to undertaking the discretionary approvals at issue in this First Amended

15 Petition and Complaint. Local 3299 possesses no effective remedy to challenge the Project approvals

16 at issue in this action other than by means of this lawsuit.

17 PROCEDURAL ALLEGATIONS

18 24. The University released a Draft EIR for public review in March 2021. The Draft EIR

19 addressed the 2021 LRDP, Housing Project #1, and Housing Project #2.

20 25. Many parties provided written comments on the Draft EIR, including Local 3299,

21 other organizations, public agencies, and individual members of the public.

22 26. In July 2021, the University released the Final EIR for the Project. The Final EIR

23 included responses to comments on the Draft EIR and revisions to the Draft EIR, among other

24 things.

25 27. On or about July 22, 2021, the University held a hearing on and certified the Final
26 EIR for the 2021 LRDP, Housing Project #1, and Housing Project #2. The same day, the University
27 also approved the 2021 LRDP and Housing Project #1, and made related findings.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

2 The Project and Project Site

3 28. The 2021 LRDP is an overall land use plan intended to guide future growth and

4 development on the UC Berkley Campus over the next 15 years. It has a buildout horizon of the It a
5 2036-37 school year and is an update to the University's existing Long Range Development Plan
6 adopted in 2005, which had a buildout horizon year of 2020. The 2021 LRDP contemplates an on-
7
campus population of 67,200 persons (an increase of 12,071 from 2020 levels), an additional
8
8,096,249 square feet of development, and an additional 1,240 parking spaces covering 1,081,080
9

10 square feet of space for parking lots and parking structures. EIR at 3-25.

29.
11 The UC Berkely Campus is predominately located within the cities of Berkley and

12 Oakland. EIR at 3-6. The "study area" used by the University for the EIR is contiguous with the 2021

13 LRDP planning area and includes the majority of UC Berkeley-owned properties. EIR at 3-8.

14 However, it does not include UC Berkeley-owned properties outside of EIR study area, including the

15 University Village in Albany, the Richmond Field Station in Richmond, or various properties outside

16 of the city of Berkeley. Id.

17 30. The EIR analyzed Housing Project #1, also known as the Helen Diller Anchor House

18 or Anchor House, at the project level. The Housing Project #1 site is located immediately west of the

19 Campus Park in Downtown Berkeley, on a site bounded by Berkeley Way on the north, Oxford Street

20 on the east, University Avenue on the south, and Walnut Street on the west. EIR at 3-35.

21 31. Housing Project #1 involves the demolition of all existing on-site structures, including
22 an eight-unit apartment building (equivalent to 16 beds), surface parking, UC Berkeley office space,
23 and the University Garage.
24 32. In its place, Housing Project #1 includes the construction and operation of a new 16-
25 story, 526,000 square foot mixed-use building with a combination of residential, campus life,
26
academic life, and other commercial suites. EIR at 3-34. Housing Project #1 would provide housing
27
for 770 students and 46 employees. EIR at 3-34.
28

7
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 33. The Anchor House site is currently occupied by eight apartment units (equivalent to 16

2 beds), surface parking, UC Berkeley office space, the University Garage, and vacant commercial

3 buildings. EIR at 3-35. Built in 1930, the University Garage was designed by renowned architect

4 Walter Ratcliff. The Garage is listed in the California State Historic Resources Inventory and was

5 designated a City of Berkeley historical landmark in 1981. Id.

6 34. The EIR also analyzed Housing Project #2, known as People's Park, at the project
7 level. Housing Project #2 is slated to be built at the current site of People's Park, located three blocks
8
south of the UC Berkeley Campus at 2556 Haste Street in Berkeley. People's Park is a 2.8-acre park
9

10 with current on-site uses including gardens and lawn space, a paved basketball court, picnic tables, a

11 wooden stage, and a public restroom building. EIR at 3-53. Currently, People's Park is primarily

12 occupied by people without housing in multiple encampments. Id. Historically, People's Park has

13 been known for being the site of protests and community action and is listed in the California State

14 Historic Resources Inventory and is a City of Berkeley historic landmark. Id.

15 35. Housing Project #2 involves the demolition of all existing on-site structures and park

16 amenities. In its place, Housing Project #2 would include three components: (1) student housing, (2)

17 affordable and supportive housing, and (3) open space.

18 36. The student housing component of Housing Project #2 would include approximately

19 326,500 gross square feet of housing space, providing 148 apartment units and 1,113 beds and related

20 common space. The student housing building would be divided into two wings, a North Wing and a

21 South Wing. The north wing would be 12 stories tall, and the South wing would be six stories. The

22 ground floor of the student housing building would include 2,600 gross square feet of "grab and go"
23 food service retail operated by UC Berkeley, open to students and the public.
24 37. The supportive housing component of Housing Project #2 would be six stories in
25 height and would include up to 125 beds of affordable and supportive housing totaling 87,500 gross
26 square feet. It would be run by an outside community organization.
27
38. The Anna Head School complex located across the street from People's Park, is listed
28
on the National Register of Historic Places. Architect Bernard Maybeck's First Church of Christ

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 Scientist is also located directly across the street from Housing Project #2, and is one of only 2,500

2 Federally designated National Historic Landmarks in the United Sates.

3 Wildfire, Public Safety, and Evacuation Impacts

4 39. More than half of the UC Berkeley campus is designated a Very High Fire Severity
5 Zone, including all of Hill Campus West, Hill Campus East, Clark Kerr Campus, and many of the
6 City Environs properties. EIR at 5.18-1, 3-8. New development in Very High Fire Severity Zones
7 increases the risk of fire ignition, which in turn increases the risk of exposing students, residents,
8
employees, and visitors to wildfire. "[A]s population increases and development further encroaches
9
into wildland vegetation, there is an increased risk that a human-caused ignition will coincide in place
10

11 and time with hot, dry weather; flammable vegetation; and severe wind conditions," Syphard, A. K,

12 Keely, J. E. (2020). Why Are So Many Structures Burning In California? Fremontia, 47(2), 28. The

13 EIR fails to analyze and mitigate the increased risk of wildfire stemming from the siting of additional

14 development within Wildland Urban Interface Zones and Very High Fire Severity Zones on campus.

15 40. In evaluating the hazards created by a project, CEQA Guidelines Appendix G requires

16 EIRs to analyze whether a Project will "[e]xpose people or structures, either directly or indirectly, to a

17 significant risk of loss, injury or death involving wildland fires." CEQA Guidelines Appendix G

18 §IX(g). The EIR does not adequately address this impact. The EIR does not include an analysis of

19 how the Project and its associated traffic and population increase will impact the ability of UC

20 students, staff, and faculty, as well as nearby neighborhoods, to evacuate in the event of a wildfire.

21 Nothing in the EIR analyzes whether the existing roadways are sufficient to accommodate the

22 evacuation of the increased UC campus population and surrounding neighborhoods, including the

23 additional cars and traffic resulting from the Project's increased parking and population. Moreover,
24 the EIR is silent on how the existing campus population plus an additional 12,000 people will be
25 safely evacuated in the event of a fire, including the tens of thousands who will access campus
26

27 without cars. Without this information, there is no evidence to support the EIR's conclusion that the
Project will not impair implementation or physically interfere with an adopted emergency response 28
plan or emergency evacuation plan.

9
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

41. With its July 17, 2021 comments, Petitioner submitted to Respondent the expert

2 comment of Professor Thomas Cova of the University of Utah who teaches and studies

3 environmental hazards, environmental management, and evacuation hazards. After reviewing the

4 EIR, Professor Cova explained that it "fails to account for the increased cars accommodated by the

5 1,240 additional parking spaces added by the LRDP, and the impact those cars will have on
evacuation capacity and timing. In addition, the EIR does not analyze how the thousands of additional
7 students and staff who access campus without cars will safely evacuate in the event of a wildfire or
8 other emergency." Cova at 1. "Without this information, it is impossible to determine if the Project 9

10 would substantially impair an adopted emergency response plan or emergency evacuation plan." Id.

42.
11 The EIR's analysis of wildfire and public safety impacts was also deficient because it

12 failed to study the Project's impacts on surrounding areas, outside of the Project site.

13 43. The Final EIR's response to comments made by Petitioner and others raising concerns

14 about the Project's impacts on wildfire and safety were inadequate and conclusory.

15 44. Since the EIR concludes the Project's impact on wildfires is significant and
16 unavoidable, the University was required to adopt all feasible mitigation measures, and it could only

17 reject proposed mitigation measures if substantial evidence supported a finding of infeasibility. In

18 violation of CEQA, the EIR does not adopt numerous additional mitigation measures suggested by

19 the public, experts, and the City of Berkeley to reduce wildfire and safety risks, and provides no

20 explanation or evidence that such measures are infeasible.

21 45. In addition, the mitigation measures adopted by the University violate CEQA.
22 Mitigation Measure WF-3, meant to address some wildfire concerns, is uncertain, unenforceable, and

23 constitutes deferred mitigation. MM WF-3 provides: "[e]lectrical lines associated with future electric
24 infrastructure shall be undergrounded, where feasible. UC Berkeley shall verify compliance with this
25 measure as part of plan review prior to construction." EIR at 5.18-26. The EIR provides no definition
26 for what is meant by "feasible" in the context of this measure. As a result, the MM WF-3 does not
27
require the University to underground any wires, as long as at some point after the CEQA process is
28

10
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 complete, it finds any reason at all that doing SO would be infeasible. Moreover, there is no evidence

2 that it is infeasible to underground all electrical lines associated with future electric infrastructure.

3 Transportation

4 46. The EIR's discussion of transportation and traffic impacts is deficient. The EIR
5 concludes that the Project will have a less than significant transportation impact because the Project is
6 "generally consistent with the transportation-related goals and policies in the UC Sustainable
7
Practices Policy and the UC Berkeley Sustainability Plan." EIR at 5.15-47. In reaching this
8
conclusion, the EIR fails to analyze the impacts of the more than 12,000 additional people expected
9
to be on campus by the year 2036, together with the Project's increased reliance on public
10

11 transportation. Moreover, the EIR not address how the 2021 LRDP's increased reliance on public

12 transportation will impact public safety evacuation plans.

13 Public Services

14 47. The EIR fails to disclose or mitigate impacts to fire and emergency medical services.

15 The City of Berkeley noted in comments on the Draft EIR that "the Berkeley Fire Department

16 ("BFD") provides the vast majority of fire and emergency medical protection for the campus." Final

17 EIR at 5-115. The City of Berkeley explains that responding to calls for higher density and taller

18 apartment buildings- like the proposed Housing Project #1 and #2 - takes twice the staff and

19 additional fire engines because of the need to evacuate hundreds of people. Final EIR at 5-116. The

20 EIR acknowledges that "the BFD indicated that projected population growth and development

21 proposed by UC Berkeley over the buildout horizon of the proposed 2021 LRDP would require
22 significant additional resources and facilities in order for the BFD to adequately respond to calls for
23 service." EIR at 5.13-17. Additional needed equipment includes an aerial ladder truck, type fire

24 engine, ambulance, mobile air supply truck, and battalion chief to accommodate the increased density
25 and height of projects under the proposed 2021 LRDP. Id. The EIR also acknowledges that "[t]he
26 BFD indicated that a new facility would need to be close to the Campus Park to house these
27 additional resources, and the BFD's Division of Training building would need to be expanded to meet 28
additional training demands of a larger department." Id.

11
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 48. CEQA requires an EIR to evaluate and mitigate any significant environmental impacts

2 caused by the need for new or expanded facilities to provide public services required by proposed

3 projects. CEQA Guidelines, Appendix G § XV. However, the environmental impacts of the new and

4 expanded facilities required by the Project are never analyzed or mitigated in the EIR.

5 49. In response to the City of Berkeley's comments, the Final EIR quotes the Draft EIR's
6 statement that "if and when the City of Berkeley would decide to construct a new facility in order to
7 accommodate additional resources, UC Berkeley would negotiate its proportional share of funding for
8
the mitigation of any environmental impacts resulting from the construction of the facility." Final EIR
9

10 at 5-115. This is not an adequate response to the City of Berkeley's comments (see Cleary v. County

11 of Stanislaus (1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 348, 357), and fails to analyze the Project as a whole, including

12 it reasonably foreseeable indirect physical changes to the environment.

13 Historic, Cultural, and Tribal Resources

14 50. The EIR Study Area includes dozens of historic buildings by renowned architects. The

15 Project will result in the demolition of more than 40 buildings that have been or could be designated

16 as landmarks by the City of Berkeley and/or listed in the National Register of Historic Places.

17 51. Yet the EIR does not discuss the conflict between the Project and UC Berkeley's New

18 Century Plan, Master Landscape Plan, and the Historic Landscape Plan.

19 52. The Berkeley Architectural Heritage Association ("BAHA") commented that the EIR

20 does not contain : comprehensive survey detailing existing baseline condition for historic, tribal, or

21 cultural resources. BAHA also points out that the EIR's historic resource technical reports are based

22 on incomplete and incorrect information, impacted resources were omitted or misdescribed.

23 53. The EIR's discussion of impacts on these and other historic and cultural resources is
24 deficient. For instance, the EIR fails to evaluate the impacts of shadows on the First Church of Christ
25 Scientist, a historic landmark located directly across the street from the 12-story housing building
26 proposed for Housing Project #2. The Final EIR responds to comments on shadow impacts by
27
improperly claiming that they do not need to be analyzed under CEQA. See Bowman v. City of 28
Berkeley (2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 572, 586; South of Market Community Action Network v. San

12
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 Francisco (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 321, 349-350 (EIR was adequate in addressing shadow impacts

2 because it described the impacts in detail before concluding that there would be no significant

3 impact.). The EIR's failure to include information about the Project's shading impacts renders the
4 EIR inadequate as an informational document.

5 54. The EIR fails to adequately mitigate the Project's impacts to historic resources. The
6 EIR concludes that the Project's impacts on historical resources will be significant and unavoidable
7 despite the availability of additional feasible mitigation measures and alternatives. Numerous experts,
8

9 organizations, and members of the public, including the City of Berkeley, the Berkeley Landmark

10 Preservation Committee, and the Berkeley Architectural Heritage Association suggested additional

11 feasible mitigation measures that would reduce the Project's impacts on historical resources. These

12 suggested mitigation measures and alternatives were rejected without an adequate explanation and

13 without evidence of infeasibility.

14 55. The mitigation measures there were adopted to reduce impacts on historic resources

15 violate CEQA. For example, Mitigation Measures CUL-1.4 requires that, prior to approval of final

16 design plans for Housing Project #2, UC Berkeley shall retain an architect meeting the National Park

17 Service Professional Qualifications Standards for historic architecture to review plans for the

18 proposed student housing and affordable and supportive housing buildings. The historic architect is to

19 provide input and refinements to the design team regarding fenestration patterns, entry design, and

20 the palette of exterior materials to improve compatibility with neighboring historical resources and to

21 enhance compliance with the Secretary of the Interior's Standards and the City of Berkeley Southside
22 Design Guidelines. Final EIR at 6-29. Mitigation Measure CUL-1.4 constitutes improperly deferred
23 mitigation because the EIR provides no reason why MM CUL-1.4 could not be conducted now, sO
24 that the design recommendations could be reviewed and commented on by the public during the
25 CEQA review process. In addition, MM CUL-1.4 includes no performance standards and does not
26
provide the types of actions that could feasibly achieve those standards. Moreover, while the measure
27

28 requires UC to retain a historic architect to provide input on how to reduce the impact of Housing

13
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 Project #2 on surrounding historical resources, it does not actually require UC to adopt any of the

2 architect's recommendations.

3 56. The EIR's conclusion that the Project's impacts on tribal cultural resources ("TCR") is

4 less-than-significant after mitigation is not supported by the evidence or the law. The EIR claims that
5 Mitigation Measure CUL-2 and CBP CUL-1 would reduce Project impacts on TCRs below
6 significance. EIR, 5.16-8. Mitigation Measure CUL-2 provides a process for consultation between the
7 consulting archeologist and the appropriate tribe to "recommend appropriate and feasible avoidance,
8
testing, preservation, or mitigation measures." It does not require avoidance if feasible. EIR at 5-4-43
9

10 and 5-4-44. This approach cannot be relied on as the basis for concluding that the Project's impact on

11 TCR would be less-than-significant. See, Save the Agoura Cornell Knoll v. City of Agoura Hills

12 (2020) 46 Cal.App.5th 665, 731-33 [mitigation measure requiring completion of data recovery

13 program if preservation becomes impossible does not mitigate impact to a less-than-significant level].

14 Greenhouse Gas

15 57. The EIR's discussion of greenhouse gas impacts is inadequate. For instance, there is

16 no evidence that it is feasible to reduce the Project's significant greenhouse gas emissions to a less-

17 than-significant level, including through the purchase of offset credits. In addition, the UC Berkeley

18 2020 Sustainability Goals require that the UC Berkely Campus be climate neutral for scope 1 and 2

19 sources and at least 40 percent of the natural gas combusted onsite must be biogas by 2025. EIR at

20 5.7-19 to 20, 5.7-26. But the EIR contains no discussion specific to how the Project would advance

21 or hinder meeting those requirements or the many other climate-goals discussed in the EIR. Further,

22 the EIR claims the University will start purchasing offsets to comply with the UC Sustainability

23 Policy in 2025 to meet net-zero requirements for Scope 1 and 2 emissions, but the EIR does not
24 explain how it will reduce its GHG impacts to a less than significant level prior to 2025.
25 Biological Resources
26
58. The EIR's discussion of the Project's impacts on biological resources is inadequate.
27 Petitioner's April 21, 2021 comment on the Draft EIR includes the comments of expert wildlife
28
ecologist Dr. Shawn Smallwood, Ph.D who reviewed the EIR and found that the it: (1) failed to

14
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

establish a proper baseline for wildlife; (2) failed to adequately analyze impacts due to habitat loss;

2 (3) improperly analyzed the Project's impact on wildlife movement; (4) failed to disclose, analyze,

3 and mitigate the Project's impacts to wildlife due to window/vehicle collisions and energy use; (5)

4 inadequately analyzed the Project's cumulative impacts; and (6) failed to incorporate all feasible

5 mitigation measures.

6 59. The Final EIR does not adequately respond to Dr. Smallwood's comments. For
7
instance, in response to Dr. Smallwood's comments that the Project will have a significant impact on
8
biological resources as a result of habitat loss, the Final EIR states that "preconstruction surveys
9
would be necessary during nesting season to confirm whether proposed development or vegetation 10

11 management activities would adversely affect nesting birds where suitable habitat is present." Final

12 EIR at 5-423. This response ignores the ongoing impact on species resulting from habitat loss.

13 Housing and Population

14 60. No EIR has been prepared that analyzes UC Berkeley's past campus population

15 increase above what was analyzed in the LRDP adopted in 2005. The University improperly
16 attempts to boot-strap these past population increases into the Final EIR, while also claiming that the

17 EIR does not need to analyze the impacts of anticipated future campus population growth. Both are

18 inconsistent with recent Court rulings in Save Berkeley Neighborhoods v. The Regents et al (Case

19 No. RG19022887) and The City of Berkeley v. The Regents et al. (Case No. RG19023058) (the

20 "Enrollment Cases Decision"), which made it clear that UCB must treat its planned population

21 growth as a "project" for CEQA purposes.

22 61. From the previously approved LRDP in 2005 through the build-out of the 2021
23 LRDP, UC Berkley's campus population will increase from 33,450 students to 48,200 - a nearly
24 50% increase. The overall campus population over that time period is expected to grow from 48,870
25 to 67,200. The EIR violates CEQA by failing to include this large population growth in the Project
26 description and failing to analyze the environmental impacts of the population increase - both
27 individually and cumulatively with past population growth.
28

15
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 62. Public Resources Code section 20180.09(b) provides that: "Environmental effects

2 relating to changes in enrollment levels shall be considered for each campus or medical center of

3 public higher education in the environmental impact report prepared for the long range development

4 plan for the campus or medical center." Subdivision (d) of Public Resources Code section 20180.09
5 provides that the University must consider the environmental impact of academic and enrolment
6 plans" under CEQA, and such plans "shall become effective for a campus ... only after the
7 environmental effects of those plans have been analyzed" under CEQA.
8
63. One of the impacts of the LRDP's increased population that the EIR fails to
9

10 adequately assess is housing availability and affordability. The UC Berkeley campus has the lowest

11 percentage of beds for the student body of any campus in the UC system, requiring many to seek

12 housing in the cities surrounding campus, and cities further away. EIR at 3-2.

13 64. The LRDP includes an additional 8,492 students and 3,579 faculty and staff compared

14 to the baseline population evaluated in the EIR. Approximately 71% of those new students (6,032

15 students) and 29% of new faculty and staff (1,037) are expected to live off-campus in the City of

16 Berkley. EIR at 5.12-9. This amounts to an additional 7,069 people who will need to find housing in

17 the City of Berkley, which as of 2020 had a total housing stock of only 51,523 units. EIR at 5.12-11.

18 To house an additional 7,069 people will require additional housing to be built in Berkeley or

19 elsewhere, and the EIR failed to analyze the impact of this necessity. As the Alameda County

20 Superior Court recently held, "[i]ncreases in campus population foreseeably lead to direct and indirect

21 impacts on housing, population, and displacement, and the failure to consider those impacts

22 constitutes prejudicial abuse of discretion." Save Berkeley's Neighborhoods v. Regents of Univ. of
23 Cal., Alameda Sup. Ct. at p. 16 (Case No. 19022887) ("SBN v. Regents") (attached hereto as Exhibit
24 C).
25 65. The EIR defends the LRDP's population growth as minimal in relation to regional
26 growth. EIR at 5.12-15. But a regional comparison does not account for, mitigate, and analyze
27

28 alternatives to the specific growth-inducing effects of the Project in the particular area in which it is
located, including relating to housing. See SBN v. Regents at 14 (Exhibit C).

16
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

66. In addition to requiring construction of new housing, increased demand for housing in
the neighborhoods surrounding campus will also cause displacement of longtime low- and middle-
income families because the more than 7,000 new employees and students will flood the surrounding
rental market, driving up prices and forcing current renters out. Given the exorbitant cost of housing
5 in Berkeley currently, more students and staff will be required to commute longer distances to find
6 more affordable housing, resulting in greater VMTs and in turn greater GHG emissions.

67. Making matters worse, while the EIR assumes full buildout of the 2021 LRDP's
8
development by 2036, along a with a significantly increased campus population, the EIR and 2021

10 LRDP do not link the amount of campus population growth with the development of new campus

11 housing, and no mitigation measure requires the same. As a result, the full campus-population

12 increase could occur without construction of any additional housing. If this does occur, the impacts

13 on housing in Berkeley, Oakland, and other nearby cities would be even greater. The EIR fails to

14 analyze the environmental impact of additional housing that will be needed in the City of Berkeley

15 and elsewhere to make up for such a shortcoming.

16 68. The EIR improperly concludes, without supporting evidence, that these population

17 and housing impacts will be fully mitigated. However, the mitigation measures relied on are

18 unlawful under CEQA because they do not actually reduce the impact, are not feasible, are not

19 effective, and constitute deferred mitigation. The EIR fails to adopt additional measures to

20 adequately address the Project's significant impacts on housing and population.

21 Impacts to Human Health from Toxic Air Contaminants in Indoor Air.

22 69. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, evaluate, and mitigate the Project's significant

23 adverse impact with respect to impacts on human health as a result of formaldehyde emissions in
24 indoor air, and its conclusions are not supported by substantial evidence.
25 70. The EIR fails to disclose, evaluate, and mitigate the Project's significant health risks to
26 future residents and workers at future buildings that are planned as part of the 2021 LRDP, including
27 Housing Projects #1 and #2, resulting from the emissions of formaldehyde into the indoor air. 28
Formaldehyde is a toxic air contaminant ("TAC"). TACs are pollutants with the potential to cause

17
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 significant adverse health effects. Many composite wood products typically used in building

2 construction contain formaldehyde-based glues which off-gas formaldehyde over a very long time

3 period. The primary source of formaldehyde indoors is composite wood products manufactured with

4 urea-formaldehyde resins, such as plywood, medium density fiberboard, and particle board. These
5 materials are commonly used in building construction for flooring, cabinetry, baseboards, window
6 shades, interior doors, and window and door trims. The Bay Area Air Quality Management District
7 ("BAAQMD") has established a significance threshold of health risks for carcinogenic TACs of 10 in
8
a million.
9
71. Certified Industrial Hygienist, Francis "Bud" Offermann, PE, CIH, conducted a review
10

11 of the Project, the EIR, and relevant documents regarding the Project's indoor air emissions. Mr.

12 Offermann concluded that future residents of the Project will be exposed to a cancer risk from

13 formaldehyde of approximately 120 per million, assuming all materials are compliant with the

14 California Air Resources Board's formaldehyde airborne toxics control measure. This is more than 12

15 times the BAAQMD's CEQA significance thresholds for airborne cancer risk of 10 per million.

16 72. The Final EIR also fails to adequately respond to comments on the Draft EIR raising

17 this issue. For instance, in response to comments, the EIR dismisses Mr. Offerman's comments as
18 speculative, but never provides additional detail on the types of building materials that would be used,

I9 or investigates and discloses what the Project's formaldehyde emissions would actually be, and what

20 health impact that would have. The Final EIR also claims there is no need to analyze this impact

21 because the Project will follow Campus Design Standards, which build off of other applicable
22 regulations such requiring the use of materials meeting the CARB Phase 2 standard. Final EIR at 5-
23 443-44. This does not adequately respond to Mr. Offermann's comment because Mr. Offermann's
24 analysis is clear that the increased cancer risk of 120 per million is based on materials that already
25 meet CARB Phase 2 standards.
26
Alternatives
27
73. Project Alternative D proposes "Increased Faculty and Staff Housing." EIR at 6-59.
28
"Under Alternative D, the Increased Faculty and Staff Housing Alternative, the proposed LRDP

18
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 would include an additional 1,000 beds for faculty and staff within the Hill Campus East and the

2 Clark Kerr Campus." Id. The only other detail provided about this alternative is as follows: "The Hill

3 Campus East would absorb an additional 600 beds and 400 additional beds would be included under

4 redevelopment within the Clark Kerr Campus. While no specific sites have been selected for
5 development on the Hill Campus East for this alternative, it is assumed that any new development
6 would be located in close proximity to existing development and infrastructure." Id. Without
7 explanation the EIR arbitrarily sited additional staff and faculty housing at an undisclosed location
8
within the area of campus with the most undeveloped natural habitat, the most risk of fire, and the
9

10 most difficult soil issues. Hill Campus East includes 760-acres of land, much of which is undeveloped|

11 and hilly, and which is considered a Very High Fire Severity Zone. Noting only that an additional 600

12 beds would be located somewhere in the 760-acre Hill Campus East, the EIR's description of

13 Alternative D is not sufficient to allow the public and decision makers to meaningfully evaluate,

14 analyze, and compare Alternative D with the Project.

15 74. The EIR's conclusion that the impacts of Alternative D would be greater than the

16 Project's impacts on aesthetics, biological resources, geology and soils, utilities and service systems,

17 and wildfire are not supported by substantial evidence because the analysis is based on unstated and
18 unsupported assumptions about where the additional staff and faculty housing will be located in Hill

19 Campus East.

20 75. The EIR failed to evaluate a reasonable range of alternatives that would feasibly attain

21 most of the basic objectives of the Project but would avoid or substantially lessen any of the
22 significant effects of the Project. A reasonable range of alternatives should have included an analysis
23 of additional student, staff, and faculty housing that did not include development in open space found
24 in Hill Campus East, which is the most undeveloped, hilly, and fire-prone area of the entire campus.
25 Among other options, UC should have looked at locating the additional housing on the dozens of
26
parcels already deemed appropriate for redevelopment, increased the density of Anchor House by
27

28 building additional floors, or providing housing on UC Berkley-owned City Environs properties or on
other UC Berkeley-owned sites outside of the EIR study area. The EIR also improperly failed to

19
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

evaluate an alternative that limited campus population to a lower level. Compared to the Project and

2 Alternative D, any of these alternatives would have reduced environmental impacts and should have
3 been considered. Siting additional staff and faculty housing in Hill Campus East acted as a poison
4 pill, meant to defeat the environmental superiority of this alternative.
5 76. In addition, the alternatives analysis did not contain a reasonable range of alternatives
that would reduce the impacts of the Project, including Housing Projects #1 and #2, on historical
resources. The EIR notes that there are 39 sites identified as candidate sites for new buildout within
8
the LRDP area that are not designate as historical resources. Final EIR at 6-63. The EIR provides no
9

10 evidence that housing and other development could not be sited on these parcels, eliminating or

11 substantially reducing the Project's irreversible destruction of historic resources currently at the sites

12 of Housing Project #1 and 2. Moreover, the EIR did not analyze alternative locations, including off-

13 campus locations such as UC Berkeley City Environs properties, Richmond Bay Campus/Richmond

14 Field Station, the Mills College Campus, Albany Village, satellite UC Berkeley campuses, or other

15 off-campus sites, that would reduce or eliminate the impacts of Housing Project #1 and 2 on historic

16 resources.

17 77. Petitioner and other members of the public raised these issues in written and oral

18 comments on the Draft EIR, but the Final EIR did not adequately respond to such comments and

19 dismissed proposed alternatives as infeasible without supporting evidence or legal justification.

20 Noise and Vibration

21 78. The EIR's discussion of noise impacts is deficient. No acoustical report was prepared
22 by an expert in support of the EIR's analysis of potential noise impacts. To fill this informational gap,
23 Petitioner submitted comments of noise expert Deborah A. Jue, INCE-USA, of the firm Wilson Ihrig,
24 who reviewed the EIR and found that it lacked substantial evidence to support baseline noise levels.
25 Ms. Jue also suggested additional feasible mitigation measures to further reduce the Project's
26 significant and unavoidable impacts. The Final EIR did not adopt these mitigation measures, despite
27
no evidence of infeasibility.
28

20
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 79. The EIR's discussion of construction-related vibration impacts is also deficient. The

2 EIR is not supported by a geotechnical report, and no information is provided about the subsurface

3 conditions of the sits of Housing Projects #1 and #2, thereby failing to establish an adequate

4 environmental baseline.

5 80. In addition, numerous parties and experts commented on the Project's impact on

6 historic resources near the Project as a result of pile driving and similar construction methods. The
7 Final EIR responds by noting an intention to use alternative construction methods that do not include
8
piledriving for Housing Projects #1 and #2, and for future LRDP projects "if feasible." This
9
constitutes improperly deferred and uncertain mitigation in violation of CEQA. Moreover, the Final
10

11 EIR does not disclose or analyze the vibratory impact of alternative construction methods on nearby

12 historic structures.

13

14 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

15 Violation of CEQA-Inadequate EIR

16 (Pub. Resources Code $21000, et seq. and CEQA Guidelines § 15000 et seq.)
81. Petitioner hereby realleges and incorporates all of the above paragraphs as if fully set
17
forth herein.
18
82. CEQA was enacted by the legislature to ensure that the long-term protection of the
19
environment is guiding criterion in public decisions. Pub. Res. Code, § 21001(d). CEQA requires
20
the lead agency for a project with the potential to cause significant environmental impacts to prepare
21
an EIR for the project that complies with the requirements of the statute, including, but not limited 22
to, the requirement to disclose and analyze the project's potentially significant environmental
23
impacts. Pub. Res. Code, §§21002.1(a), 21100(a), 21151(a); 14 CCR §§15064(a)(1), (f)(1), 15367. 24
The EIR must provide sufficient environmental analysis such that the decisionmakers can
25
intelligently and fully consider environmental consequences when acting on the proposed project.
26
Such analysis must include and rely upon thresholds of significance that are based on substantial
27
evidence in the record.
28

21
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

83. CEQA also mandates that the lead agency analyze and adopt feasible and enforceable
mitigation measures that would reduce or avoid each of a project's significant environmental impacts.

3 PRC § 21061; see also §21002.1. If any of the project's significant impacts cannot be mitigated to a

4 less than significant level, then CEQA bars the lead agency from approving a project if a feasible
alternative is available that would meet the project's objectives while avoiding or reducing its
6 significant environmental impacts.
7
84. Each of the lead agency's findings and conclusions, including those in the EIR, must
be supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record, and the agency must explain how

10 the evidence in the record supports the conclusions the agency has reached. Topanga Assn. for a

11 Scenic Community v. County of Los Angeles (1974) 11 Cal.3d 506, 515.

85. 12 Respondent committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion and failed to proceed in a

13 manner required by law because the Project relies on an EIR that fails to meet the CEQA's

14 requirements for the disclosure, analysis, mitigation, reduction, and/or avoidance of significant

15 environmental impacts from the Project, including direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts relating to

16 wildfire, public safety, public services, historic, cultural, and tribal resources, transportation,

17 greenhouse gas emissions, biological resources, housing and population, human health, and noise and

18 vibrations. These deficiencies rendered the EIR inadequate as an environmental document and

19 precluded informed decision making and informed public participation.

20 86. Wildfire, Public Safety, and Evacuation. The EIR fails to adequately disclose,

21 analyze, and/or mitigate the Project's significant direct, indirect, and cumulative wildfire-related

22 impacts. The EIR's analysis of wildfire-related impacts is inadequate because, inter alia, the EIR:

23 a. fails to analyze and mitigate all the increased potential for wildfire ignitions resulting

24 from siting additional housing and development in Wildland Urban Interface Zones

25 and Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zones;

26 b. fails to analyze and mitigate whether the Project will expose people and/or structures

27 to a significant risk of loss, injury or death involving wildland fires;

28 C. fails to provide sufficient information to determine how the Project's traffic and

22
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

population increases will impact evacuation times and procedures and whether it will
interfere with existing emergency and evacuation plans;
d. fails to support its findings that the Project will not physically interfere with an
adopted emergency response plan or emergency evacuation plan with substantial
evidence;

e. fails to adopt all feasible mitigation measures to reduce the Project's significant and
unavoidable wildfire and safety impacts; and

f adopts mitigation measures that do not comply with CEQA.
87. Transportation. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze, and/or mitigate the
10 Project's significant direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts on public transportation.
11 88. Public Services. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze, and/or mitigate the
12 Project's significant direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts on the environment from the need for
13 new or expanded public services. The EIR's analysis of public services impacts is inadequate
14 because, inter alia, the EIR:
15
a. fails to disclose, analyze, and mitigate impacts stemming from additional facilities and
16
equipment needed by fire and police services as a result of the Project;
17

18 b. fails to analyze the impacts of the project as a whole, including in direct impacts; and

C. fails to adequately respond to comments raising concerns about the impacts on the

20 environment caused by the need for new or expanded facilities to provide public

21 services.

22 89. Cultural and Tribal Resources. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze, and/or

23 mitigate the Project's significant direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts on cultural and tribal

24 resources. The EIR's analysis of cultural and tribal resources impacts is inadequate because, inter

25 alia, the EIR:

26 a. fails to require all feasible mitigation measures and alternatives;

27 b. fails to adequately respond to comments;

28 C. adopts deferred mitigation that violates CEQA;

23
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

a. fails to support its finding that the Project's impacts on tribal cultural resources will be

2 less-than-significant with mitigation.

3 90. Greenhouse Gases. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze, and/or mitigate the
4 Project's direct, indirect, and cumulative greenhouse gas effects. The EIR's analysis of greenhouse

5 gas impacts is inadequate because, inter alia, the EIR:

a. fails to support its selection of thresholds of significance with substantial evidence in
the record;
8
b. relies on greenhouse gas mitigation measures that are vague, ineffective, deferred,
9
and/or unenforceable;
10
11 C. fails to incorporate all feasible mitigation and avoidance measures;

12 d. impermissibly relies on off-site offsets to mitigate Project's greenhouse gas emissions

13 because the EIR fails to provide substantial evidence that such offsets are available,

14 real, permanent, quantifiable, verifiable, and enforceable reductions; and

15 e. fails to discuss how the Project would affect the ability to meet the University's

16 requirements for the UC Berkeley Campus.

17 91. Biological Resources. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze, and/or mitigate

18 the Project's significant direct and cumulative impacts to biological resources. The EIR's analysis of

19 impacts on biological resources is inadequate because, inter alia, the EIR:

20 a. fails to establish a proper baseline for wildlife;

21 b. fails to adequately analyze impacts due to habitat loss;

C. analyzes the Project's impact on wildlife movement using an improper standard;
23 24 d. failing to disclose, analyze, and mitigate the Project's impacts to wildlife due to
window/vehicle collisions and energy use;
25
e. inadequately analyzes the Project's cumulative impacts; and
26
f. fails to incorporate all feasible mitigation measures.
27
92. Population, Housing, and Growth Inducement. The EIR fails to adequately
28
disclose, analyze, and/or mitigate the Project's significant direct and cumulative impacts on

24
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 population, housing, and grown inducement. The EIR's analysis of impacts on impacts on population,

2 housing, and grown inducement is inadequate because, inter alia, the EIR:
3 a. fails to consider the direct and indirect impacts of the Projects' increased campus
4 population on housing, population, and displacement;
5 b. fails to adequately discuss the need for construction of additional housing;
6
C. fails to adequately analyze the Project's cumulative impacts on housing and
7
population growth;
8

9 d. fails to analyze the impacts of an increased student and staff population without

10 additional housing beyond Housing Projects #1 and 2; and

c.
11 fails to analyze impacts of past and projected campus population growth.

12 93. Health Hazards from TAC Emissions. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze,

13 and/or mitigate the Project's significant direct and cumulative impacts on human health from the

14 emissions of TACs in indoor air. The EIR's analysis of impacts on human health from TAC

15 emissions is inadequate because, inter alia, the EIR:

16 a. fails to disclose and mitigate the impact despite substantial evidence that it will be

17 significant;

18 b. fails to adopt feasible mitigation measure to reduce the significant impact; and

19 C. fails to adequately respond to comments on the Draft EIR providing substantial

20 evidence of a significant impact not analyzed and mitigated by the EIR.

21 94. Baseline. The EIR fails to adequately describe the existing physical environmental

22 conditions in the vicinity of the Project, including but not limited to environmental conditions relating

23 to the Project's impacts to biological resources, wildfire, noise, vibrations, historic resources, and

24 population.

25 95. Alternatives. The EIR fails to provide an adequate selection and discussion of
26 alternatives for consideration that foster informed decision-making and informed public
27 participation. The alternatives analysis in the EIR does not meet CEQA's requirement that an EIR
28 consider a reasonable range of alternatives that lessen the Project's significant environmental

25
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

impacts, does not focus on alternatives that either eliminate adverse impacts or reduce them to
insignificance even if they would to some degree impede the Project's objectives, failed to consider

3 a feasible alternative that would lessen significant impacts, unlawfully rejects alternatives without
adequately analyzing whether their impacts would be less significant than the Project's, and fails to
support with substantial evidence its conclusions regarding alternatives.

6 96. Response to Comments. The responses to comments in the Final EIR fail to meet
CEQA's requirements in that they neither adequately dispose of all the issues raised, nor provide

8 specific rationale for rejecting suggested Project changes, including the consideration or adoption of
feasible mitigation measures or alternatives. CEQA requires that a lead agency evaluate and respond

10 to all environmental comments on the Draft EIR that it receives during the public review period. The

11 responses must describe the disposition of the issues raised and must specifically explain reasons for

12 rejecting suggestions and for proceeding without incorporating the suggestions. The Final EIR's

13 responses to comments fail to satisfy the requirements of law. Failing to adequately respond to

14 comments rendered the Final EIR inadequate as an informational document.

15 97. Based upon each of the foregoing reasons, the EIR is legally defective under CEQA.

16 Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion in violation of CEQA in approving the Project. As

17 such, the Court should issue a writ of mandate directing Respondents to set aside the certification of
18 the EIR and approval of the Project.

SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
22 Violation of CEQA - Inadequate Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations

23 (Pub. Res. Code § 21000, et seq. and CEQA Guidelines 15000 et seq.)
98.
24 Petitioner hereby reallege and incorporates all of the above paragraphs as if fully set
forth herein.
25
99.
26 Respondents' Findings of Fact and Statement of Overriding Considerations violate the

27 requirements of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines. Respondents' findings fail to identify the changes

28 or alterations that are required to avoid or substantially lessen the project's significant environmental
effects, and do not provide adequate reasoning or disclose the analytic route from facts to

26
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 conclusions, as required by law. The purported benefits of the Project cited in the Statement of

2 Overriding Considerations do not outweigh the Project's substantial costs to public health and the

3 environment. Respondents' Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations are not supported

4 by substantial evidence in the record.

5 100. When an EIR concludes that project would result in significant environmental
6 effects, but where mitigation measures and alternatives identified in the EIR are deemed infeasible,
7
the CEQA findings must identify the specific economic, legal, social and technological and other
8
considerations that make infeasible the adoption of mitigation measures or alternatives. All CEQA
9
findings must be supported by substantial evidence in the record and must disclose the analytical 10

11 route by which approval of a project is justified. Here, the findings regarding the impacts, mitigation

12 measures, and alternatives relied upon by Respondent's approval of the Project are not supported by

13 substantial evidence in the record, and do not disclose the links between evidence and conclusions.

14 101. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondent failed to proceed in a manner required

15 by law, and its decision to approve the Project and adopt Findings of Fact and a Statement of

16 Overriding Considerations was not supported by substantial evidence.
PRAYER FOR RELIEF 17

18 WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests the following relief and entry of judgment as

19 follows:

20 1. For a stay of Respondent's decisions approving the Project pending trial;

21 ~i For a peremptory writ of mandate directing:

26 Respondents.

1 Petitioners City of Berkeley and Save Berkeley's Neighborhoods commenced two actions

2 seeking a writ of mandate from the Court directing respondent The Regents of the University of

3 California (*UC") to set aside a determination of May 16, 2019. (AR1.) UC approved a new

4 development project to create additional academic and residential space for UC Berkeley's

5 Goldman School of Public Policy ("GSPP") on Hearst Avenue (the "Upper Hearst

6 Development"). (AR1.) To document its considerations of the environmental impact of its

7 project under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA"), UC certified a Supplemental

8 Environmental Impact Report, which tiered from its 2020 Long Range Development Plan
9 Environmental Impact Report (*2020 LRDP EIR.") and made minor amendments to it. (AR1.)

10 For the following reasons, the court grants the writs of mandate. The parties vigorously

I1 debate whether the project description was consistent or appropriately defined. UC Berkeley's

12 concession that both the project and its "baseline" are subject to judicial review makes much of

13 this debate besides the point. The court concludes that the environmental analysis was legally

14 insufficient in several respects, and that it cannot accordingly endorse the failure to consider a

15 reduced enrollment alternative.

16 LEGAL STANDARDS

17 The Legislature intended CEQA "to be interpreted in such a manner as to afford the

18 fullest possible protection to the environment within the reasonable scope of the statutory

19 language.'" (Sierra Club v. County of Fresno (2018) 6 Cal.5th 502, 511, quoting Laurel Heights

20 Improvement Assn. v. The Regents of the Univ. of Cal. (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 390.) "With

21 narrow exceptions, CEQA requires an EIR whenever a public agency proposes to approve or to

22 carry out a project that may have significant effect on the environment.™ (Ibid., citing same at

23 pp.390-391.) "Because the EIR must be certified or rejected by public officials, it is a document

24 of accountability." (Id. at p.512, citing same at p.392.) The general public, "being duly

25 informed, can respond accordingly to action with which it disagrees." (Ibid., citing same.)

26 When the Court finds a violation of CEQA, a writ must issue. (Pub. Res. Code § 21168.9(b).)

When the Court is asked to review the decision of a public agency for compliance with

2 CEQA, its review "extend[s] only to whether there was a prejudicial abuse of discretion." (Pub.

3 Res. Code § 21168.5.) A public agency has abused its discretion if either (1) the agency "has not

4 procceded in a manner required by law" or (2) the agency's decision is "not supported by

5 substantial evidence." (Ibid.) "" Judicial review of these two types of error differs significantly:

6 While we determine de novo whether the agency has employed the correct procedures,

7 "scrupulously enforc[ing] all legislatively mandated CEQA requirements" [citation], we accord

8 greater deference to the agency's substantive factual conclusions.3 (Sierra Club, supra,

9 6 Cal.5th at p.512, quoting Vineyard Area Citizens for Responsible Growth, Inc. V. City of

10 Rancho Cordova (2007) 40 Cal.4th 412, 435.) Reviewing factual findings, the Court "will

11 resolve reasonable doubts in favor of the administrative decision[] and will not set aside an

12 agency's determination on the ground that the opposite conclusion would have been equally or

13 more reasonable.3 (Id. at p.515.)

14 Il. INCREASES IN STUDENT ENROLLMENT AND CAMPUS POPULATION

15 A. ENROLLMENT - "UPDATED BASELINE"

16 In the SEIR, UC Berkeley undertook to study the environmental impacts of the existing

17 higher-than-projected campus population as part of the description of an "updated baseline.»

18 The SEIR states that its study of past population increase is not as part of the "project" as that

19 term is used in CEQA. (See AR60, 101-103; AR847; see Guidelines § 15378 [defining 'Project"

20 as "the whole of an action, which has a potential for resulting in either a direct physical change

21 in the environment, or a reasonably foresecable indirect physical change in the environment" and

22 subject to direction, funding, or discretionary permission by a public agency].) According to the

23 SEIR, UC Berkeley studied the impacts of the increase in its population leading to its "updated

24 baseline"---even though that increase was not part of the project-because "in its response to

25 comments to the 2020 LRDP EIR, UC Berkeley made commitment to the City of Berkeley

26

that, if enrollment increased beyond the projections set forth in the 2020 LRDP, it would

2 undertake additional review under CEQA." (AR60.)
It is important to distinguish the SEIR's "updated baseline" analysis from the normal use

4 of the term "baseline" under CEQA. Ordinarily, an environmental impact report studies the

5 impacts of a project on the environment. To determine and measure those impacts, the lead

6 agency must determine the environmental conditions as they exist at the time it files its notice of
1 preparation for the project. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, div. 6, ch.3, ["Guidelines"] § 15125(a).)

8 Under Guidelines section 15125, "[a]n EIR must include a description of the physical

9 environmental conditions in the vicinity of the project." (Guidelines § 15125(a).) "This

10 environmental setting will normally constitute the baseline physical conditions by which a lead

11 agency determines whether an impact is significant." (Ibid.) "The purpose of this requirement is

12 to give the public and decision makers the most accurate and understandable picture practically

13 possible of the project's likely near-term and long-term impacts." (Ibid.)

14 The "updated baseline" discussion in the SEIR serves to serve two purposes. First, the

15 SEIR describes the current campus population as the baseline for its environmental impact

16 analyses of the Upper Hearst Development, including the impact of further population increases.

17 Second, the SEIR includes an analysis for purely informational purposes to "update" the 2020

18 LRDP EIR's projected population-related impacts analyses to analyze the impacts of the increase

19 in campus population above the level studied in the 2020 LRDP EIR (the "Excess Population").

20 The SEIR discusses the potential impacts of the Excess Population and finds that it has had no

21 significant environmental impacts. (See AR101-103.) The SEIR does not consider alternatives

22 to the enrollment levels that led to Excess Population and does not adopt mitigation measures

23 beyond those already adopted in the 2020 LRDP EIR.

24 The unusual structure of the SEIR's "update" analysis stems at least partly from an issue

25 of legal interpretation. When it was certified in 2005, the 2020 LRDP EIR had projected that

26 student enrollment at UC Berkeley would stabilize at around 33,450 students. (AR2134

[*[O]nce our current target is reached, at an estimated two-semester average of 33,450 students,
enrollment at UC Berkeley should stabilize."]; see also AR101.) But UC Berkeley's headcount

3 did not stabilize. It continued to increase and quickly exceeded those projections, with student
enrollment in the 2017-2018 school year reaching 40,955, "exceed[ing] the 2020 LRDP
projection by approximately 7,500 students." (AR101.) The record in this action does not

6 include any evidence that UC Berkeley studied the potential effects of the Excess Population

7 before its decision to enroll the additional students who make up the bulk of the increase to its

8 campus population since the 2020 LRDP EIR.

9 Several community members and organizations, including SBN and the City of Berkeley,

10 responded to UC Berkeley's Draft Supplemental Environmental Impact Report ("DSEIR") for

11 the Upper Hearst Development by requesting that UC Berkeley separate its "updated baseline"

12 analysis from the analysis of the Upper Hearst Development into a separate EIR. (AR847-848.)

13 Many commenters found the DSEIR confusing and unusual because it combined a future land
14 development project with a seemingly unrelated increase in student population that has already

15 happened. UC Berkeley responded to these comments in its Final Supplemental Environmental

16 Impact Report ("FSEIR"), arguing that an increase in enrollment or population categorically

17 cannot constitute a "project" under CEQA. (AR847, citing Pub. Res. Code § 21080.09.) The

18 FSEIR reasons, it is not possible to produce meaningful EIR for the population increase

19 because it would not be tethered to an "approval" of a "project." (AR847-848.) The FSEIR also

20 notes that the GSPP project requires a minor amendment to the 2020 LRDP, and that the EIR

21 analysis for that land-use plan would therefore need to be brought up to date. (Ibid.) The FSEIR

22 concluded based on those premises that the Excess Population portion of its updated baseline

23 analysis must be included in the SEIR for the Upper Hearst Development because it could go

24 nowhere else.

25 a That conclusion stood on a false premise. UC Berkeley was under the misapprehension

26 that increases in student enrollment only needed to be considered in the context of the long-range

1 development plan process, and then only to the extent such projections would "assist in

2 determining the amount of physical development required." (See AR847-878.) In 2018, before

3 the DSEIR for the Upper Hearst Development was published, Petitioner Save Berkeley's

4 Neighborhoods sued UC for failing to study the impacts of these increases in enrollment,

5 alleging that the enrollment increases constituted an unstudied project in violation of CEQA.

6 (See Save Berkeley's Neighborhoods v. The Regents of the Univ. of Cal. (2020) 51 Cal.App.5th

7 226, 233.) In June 2020, after the DSEIR and FSEIR were published, the Court of Appeal held

8 that UC Berkeley's interpretation of CEQA was incorrect. "CEQA requires public universities

9 to mitigate the environmental impacts of their growth and development." (Id. at p.231.) "In this

10 context, growth includes student enrollment increases, which the Legislature has acknowledged

11 *may negatively affect the surrounding environment.™" (Ibid.) "[WJhen a public university

12 prepares an EIR. for a development plan, [Public Resources Code] section 21080.09 requires

13 universities to expand the analysis to include a related feature of campus growth, future

14 enrollment projections, which is entirely consistent with the traditional, broad definition of a

15 CEQA project." (Id. at p.239.) "It does not say that subsequent changes to enrollment plans

16 with new or increased environmental effects that have not been analyzed and addressed-are

17 exempt from CEQA." (Ibid.)

18 B. ENROLLMENT - HOW TO REVIEW THE "UPDATED BASELINE"

19 The "updated baseline" is a novel concept under CEQA, and it was included because UC

20 Berkeley misunderstood its legal obligations to study the impacts of student enrollment. Yet the

21 inclusion of an erroneous legal analysis in the SEIR does not necessarily require the EIR

22 certification be set aside. An EIR serves to structure the public consideration of environmental

23 impacts. Courts review an EIR for prejudicial abuse of agency discretion. (Sierra Club, supra, 6

24 Cal.5th at pp.511-512.) But a false legal analysis, like noncompliance with CEQA, is grounds to

25 grant a writ setting aside the agency approval only if the noncompliance resulted in "a

26 subversion of the purposes of CEQA by omitting information from the environmental review

process." (See Schenck v. County of Sonoma (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 949, 959.) In other words,

2 so long as the EIR still correctly identifies, analyzes, discusses alternatives, and proposes

3 mitigation for substantial environmental impacts, it fulfills its public purpose as an informational

4 document, notwithstanding the inclusion of a mistaken legal analysis, and its certification is not
an abuse of discretion for that reason. (See Pub. Res. Code § 21168.5 [standard of review is

6 prejudicial abuse of discretion]; Guidelines 15151 ["The courts have looked not for perfection

7 but for adequacy, completeness, and a good faith effort at full disclosure."].)

8 The next step would normally be to determine whether UC Berkeley's updated baseline

9 analysis is part of the project being studied. An EIR must study and mitigate the impacts of a

10 "project" and consider reasonable alternatives to that "project." (See Pub. Res. Code § 21002.1

11 ['The purpose of an environmental impact report is to identify the significant effects on the

12 environment of a project, to identify alternatives to the project, and to indicate the manner in

13 which those significant effects can be mitigated or avoided."]; Guidelines § 15126.2(a) ["An EIR

14 shall identify and focus on the significant effects of the proposed project on the environment."];

15 see also Guidelines § 15358 [defining "effects" and "impacts" as including only those direct and

16 indirect environmental impacts "caused by the project"].) In their briefs, the parties argued about

17 whether UC Berkeley was estopped from denying that the population increase was part of the
18 "project." At the hearing on the petition, however, the parties stipulated that the SEIR's analysis

19 of the impacts of the increase in enrollment was subject to judicial review in this proceeding

20 without resolving the issue of whether the increases to student enrollment that led to the Excess

21 Population were a part of the project studied in the SEIR. Given this stipulation, the Court does

22 not need to determine whether that past increase was part of the project under study here.

23 But what standard does the Court review the SEIR's analysis of the past increases in

24 student enrollment? CEQA provides only one standard for review for an EIR-the Court will

25 grant the writ if it finds that an agency "has not proceeded in a manner required by law" or its

26 conclusions are "not supported by substantial evidence." (See Pub. Res. Code § 21168.5.) The

Court does not decide whether the "updated baseline" analysis or the decision to increase

2 enrollment are a part of the project. But because CEQA provides only one standard of review,

3 this Order reviews the factual determinations and procedural conformity under the same

4 standards as if they were a part of project. The parties' arguments in the briefs regarding
estoppel, waiver, and admission are moot given the parties' stipulation at hearing.

6 C. ENROLLMENT - DESCRIPTION OF THE UPDATED BASELINE

7 Both SBN and the City object to the SEIR on the grounds that it offers an inadequate,

8 shifting description of the project under study as sometimes including the population increase,

9 sometime not. "An accurate, stable, and finite project description is the [s]ine qua non of an

10 informative and legally sufficient EIR." (See County of Inyo v. City of Los Angeles (1977)

11 71 Cal.App.3d 185, 193, 199.) An EIR is "fundamentally inadequate and misleading" if it offers

12 "conflicting signals to decision-makers and the public about the nature and scope of the activity
13 being proposed." (San Joaquin Raptor Rescue Ctr. v. County of Merced (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th

14 645, 655-656.)

15 The public environmental review process begins with the issuance of a Notice of

16 Preparation ("NOP"). (Pub. Res. Code § 21092.) A NOP must provide "sufficient information
17 describing the project and the potential environmental effects to enable the responsible agencies

18 to make a meaningful response." (Guidelines § 15082(a)(1).) In this case, UC Berkeley's NOP
19 describes the "project" as "a public-private partnership that would provide additional academic

20 space for GSPP's undergraduate, graduate, and Global Executive Education programs, and

21 housing geared toward campus affiliates, principally faculty, graduate and post-doctoral

22 students" including "two separate buildings - an academic building and a residential building

23 (AR51, 53.) It also notes that the project "would involve minor text amendments to the

24 2020 LRDP" to "address the fact that.. the proposed project conflicts with the existing

25 applicable land use plan[] and is not consistent with the 2020 LRDP housing element." (AR52.)

26 The NOP announces that a supplemental EIR, rather than some other kind of informational

* document, would be prepared because of "changes to the [2020 LRDP] land use plan" and "an

2 increase in current and foreseeable campus population levels above those analyzed in the 2020

3 LRDP EIR, based on a general increase in student enrollment and employee levels and growing

4 the GSPP program(s)." (AR52.) The NOP also notes that growing enrollment is part of a

5 continuing trend, as least in the foreseeable future: "UC Berkeley may continue to expand

6 enrollment" which "depends on various factors including . . . legislative mandates, University

7 and State of California policies, available resources, and demographic trends" with an estimated

8 growth of "about 1.5 percent annually, on an average, in the near-term." (AR51.) UC Berkeley

9 eventually circulated a Draft SEIR, which described the project as both (1) "the Upper Hearst

10 Development for GSPP" that "would have residential and academic components," and (2) a

11 "Minor LRDP Amendment to accommodate the proposed land uses on the Project site."

12 (AR76.) The evaluation of existing population levels above the levels previously studied were

13 described in the DSEIR not as part of the project but as part of an updated baseline for campus

14 population. (See, e.g., AR60, 64, 848.)

15 The "updated baseline" analysis does not fit well within a traditional CEQA framework.

16 As discussed above, the SEIR itself consistently describes the project under study: the "Upper

17 Hearst Development" involving residential and academic buildings a and a minor amendment to

18 the 2020 LRDP's land use plan to allow for that construction. (See, e.g., AR59-60, 69-98, etc.)

19 In its discussion of student enrollment levels, the SEIR distinguishes the impacts of new student

20 enrollment at the Upper Hearst Development from the impacts of the prior and projected

21 enrollment growth not attributable to the GSPP project. Its apparent goal in doing so is to

22 provide an environmental analysis for that previously unstudied population increase sufficient to

23 inform the public without having to study the increase as an actual project.

24 Petitioners argue that the SEIR's use of an "updated baseline" to sometimes discuss and
25 sometimes ignore the Excess Population is analogous to the misleading project descriptions in

26 County of Inyo and City of Santee. (See County of Inyo, supra, 71 Cal.App.3d 185; City of

1 Santee v. County of San Diego (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 1438.) But it does not present the same

2 problems as an informational document as the EIRs in those cases. In County of Inyo, the City of

3 Los Angeles abused its discretion by certifying an EIR that discussed an increase in ground

4 water pumping from city-owned land in the Owens Valley for in-valley use while failing to

5 discuss and analyze its vaguely defined "recommended project," a plan to divert surface and

6 groundwater for export to the City of Los Angeles. Los Angeles defined its "project" narrowly

7 while still purporting to disclose and discuss environmental impacts of increased water exports to

8 the City as "not part of the project" because those flows were to be directed through an aqueduct

9 that had been approved before CEQA was enacted--

2 At one point of the Final EIR the contradiction becomes explicit: 'In the process of preparing this environmental impact report, other aspects of
I1 Aqueduct System operation have been reevaluated. This includes a reappraisal of the rate of export through the Los Angeles Aqueducts. Thus,
12 the project description presented below includes references to the rate of export, even though the rate of export was not part of the project . , , '
13 (County of Inyo v. City of Los Angeles (1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 185, 196.)

14 Here, UC Berkeley narrowly described its project as the Upper Hearst Development, but also

15 purports to discuss the environmental impacts of the Excess Population as "not part of the

16 project" because all previous unstudied increases in student enrollment were supposedly exempt
17 from CEQA under UC's misreading of Section 21080.09. Upper Hearst Development includes a

18 small increase in projected student enrollment at the GSPP, but that increase is one part of a

19 continuing trend of increasing student enrollment with potential cumulative effects. But that is

20 not the end of the analysis. Unlike the EIR in County if Inyo, UC Berkeley's SEIR discusses,

21 describes, and considers the impacts of the larger trend in student enrollment in the SEIR.

22 In City of Santee, the Court analyzed a project by the County of San Diego to build a

23 "temporary" jail facility to ease overcrowding in its jail system and analyzed the impacts over

24 seven years. (City of Santee v. County of San Diego (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 1438.) The Court

25 emphasized that the County had inappropriately "chopp[ed] a large project into many little ones"

26 because "[n]ot only does a reading of the record support a conclusion that some future action on

the temporary project was contemplated, it also reflects the EIR here could be considered one

2 small part of the larger project to ease jail crowding in the entire county," (Id. at p.1454.) "Thus

3 it is reasonably foresecable that the project will continue for a longer term than seven years, and

4 it is likewise reasonably foreseeable that the temporary male detention facility will be moved to

5 East Mesa either before the end of seven years or at that time." (Ibid.) "These future uses

6 should have been included in the EIR and their cumulative effects discussed." (Ibid.) The SEIR

7 in this case does consider increase in student enrollment on its own, but it does divorce that

8 analysis from its context in its discussion of the "updated baseline."

9 In short, the SEIR attempts to analyze an increase in student enrollment without

10 admitting that increasing student enrollment is a project subject to review. The SEIR describes

11 the Upper Hearst Development as the relevant project. That project description does not shift

12 from one part of the SEIR to another. The SEIR situates that project within its larger context of

13 increasing student enrollment and it discusses cumulative effects. The SEIR's definition is clear

14 enough that reasonable members of the public would not be misled about the scope of the project

15 under review, and it is not so "curtailed, enigmatic or unstable" that it a "draws a red herring

16 across the path of public input." (County of Inyo, supra, 71 Cal.App.3d at p.198.)

17 D. ENROLLMENT -IMPACTS FROM GROWING CAMPUS POPULATION

18 l. Induced Housing Demand and Population Growth

19 The CEQA Guidelines mandate that a lead agency should consider impacts to population

20 and housing when analyzing a project. (Guidelines § 15126.2(a), (e) [EIR must discuss "changes

21 induced in population distribution" "population concentration" and must "[d]iscuss the ways in

22 which the proposed project could foster economic of population growth, or the construction of

23 additional housing, either directly or indirectly, in the surrounding environment."].) The

24 Guidelines' Environmental Checklist Form asks the lead agency to determine whether the project

25 (a) would "[i]nduce substantial unplanned growth in an area, either directly (for example, by

26 proposing new homes and businesses) or indirectly (for example, through extensions of roads or

1 other infrastructure)" or (b) would "[d]isplace substantial numbers of existing people or housing,

2 necessitating the construction of replacement housing elsewhere." (Guidelines, appx. G, § XIV,

3 subds. (a), (b).)

4 UC Berkeley's DSEIR identified population and housing as an area in which further

5 analysis was required. (AR206.) It projected that student enrollment at UC Berkeley in the
6 2022-2023 academic year would exceed the projections in the 2020 LRDP EIR by more than a

7 third, but employees (and members of their households) were under projections. (AR207.) The

8 DSEIR attributes this increase to an increase in California's college-age population and the

9 state's Master Plan for Higher Education. (AR207.) The DSEIR "assume[s] that most of the

10 additional campus population would live in Berkeley or nearby parts of the Bay Area. (AR207.)

11 It compares the net population increase projected increase to population for the entire
12 metropolitan Bay Area and concludes that its increased campus population would not

13 a substantially affect the region as whole. (AR207.) The DSEIR also noted that UC Berkeley

14 had created only 1,119 of the 2,600 new student beds authorized or anticipated in the 2020

15 LRDP EIR, and that UC Berkeley therefore had excess capacity to accommodate additional

16 student housing to offset any impacts. (AR208.) The DSEIR did not analyze effects on the

17 housing market, reasoning that such impacts were "not in themselves environmental impacts."

18 (AR208.) It concluded that the increase in population "would generally be accommodated

19 without significant adverse impacts" and would not result in new impacts beyond those studied

20 by the 2020 LRDP EIR. (AR208.)

21 The City of Berkeley submitted comments disputing this analysis. The City argued that

22 the DSEIR's comparison to the entire Bay Arca was inappropriate because "new students,

23 faculty, and staff would be drawn to living in Berkeley due to the city's proximity to campus and

24 the campus' location in the heart of the City" but that the net increase of roughly 11,000 students

25 is approximately nine percent of the City's population. (AR1186.) The City also referenced a

26 2017 survey conducted by UC Berkeley's chancellor's office showing that demand for campus

1 housing at UC Berkeley outpaces supply and that UC Berkeley has the lowest percentage of beds

2 to its student body of any UC campus in the state. (ARI185.) The same report found that ten

3 percent of students had experienced homelessness while attending UC Berkeley, including 20

4 percent of doctoral students. (AR1185.) The City asserted that this increase in population

5 without an increase in on-campus housing had led to "increased pressure for development in the

6 City" as evidenced by a "marked increase in development applications over prior years

7 particularly for the development of multi-unit housing developments typically marketed to

8 students." (AR1186.) These new buildings, the City argued-when combined with UC

9 Berkeley's practice of master-leasing off-campus apartments for student housing--reduce the
10 housing available for non-student residents and displace existing residents, particularly in
11 historically lower-income neighborhoods in South Berkeley and West Berkeley. (AR1186.) The

12 City also argues the imbalance between rapidly increased student enrollment with little

13 additional student housing development exacerbated student and nonstudent homelessness and

14 caused additional significant environmental impacts, including physical impacts to parks, streets,

15 and public places and increased demand for public safety and public health services due to the

16 unsafe living conditions in homeless encampments. (AR1187.) The City faulted the DSEIR for

17 not considering these indirect impacts from development, displacement, and homelessness.

18 As part of the Southside Neighborhood Consortium ("SNC*), SBN also submitted

19 comments on the topic of housing and population. (See AR1656 [Southside Neighborhood
20 Consortium letter signed by Philip Bokovoy on behalf of SBN].) Like the City, SNC objected

21 that population impacts were compared to population growth in entire Bay Area, not just

22 Berkeley. (AR1654.) It argued that the increased student population causes "pressure on the

23 local housing market with higher rents and more displacement" and increased "gentrification."

24 (AR1655.) SNC also argued that the increased student population will increase demands for

25 City services-including police protection, fire and emergency medical services, parks and open

26 space-more late-night noise and traffic and more incidences of improper refuse disposal and

1 "moving day trash." (AR1655.) Finally, SNC also argued that the DSEIR's conclusion that the

2 fact that the City "already accommodates" a large number of student residents "is the equivalent

3 of saying: 'students over the baseline are already here so there is no impact.'"* (AR1656.)

4 UC Berkeley responded to these comments in the FSEIR, which reports that

5 approximately 65% of UC Berkeley students live on campus or within a mile of campus.

6 (AR845.) This statistic does not support the university's comparison of the increase in campus
7 population to population growth in the greater Bay Area rather than the local area in which the

8 majority of its students reside. The FSEIR also finds that the total increase of 11,285 students by

9 the end of the 2022-2023 academic year (that is, both the Excess Population and the projected

10 increase from the Upper Hearst Development) would exceed the projected growth in UC

I1 Berkeley-provided housing. (AR846.) It concludes that the University's 2020 LRDP planned

12 for a substantial increase in student housing that has not yet been built: "After construction of up

13 to 150 housing units in the proposed Upper Hearst Development, substantial capacity for

14 additional student housing would remain under the 2020 LRDP," and Development of additional,

15 affordable student housing "is consistent with the 2020 LRDP's development plans." (AR855.)

16 The FSEIR does not analyze whether exceeding the 2020 LRDP student enrollment projections

17 had indirect environmental impacts that were exacerbated leaving significant amounts of planned

18 student housing undeveloped.

19 The FSEIR's responded in part to the City's comments by noting that concerns about

20 increased campus population are about the "updated baseline," not the proposed Upper Hearst

21 Development. (See AR1185 [City's concern regarding impacts of "substantial increase in

22 campus population"]; AR882 [FSEIR's response].) The FSEIR concluded that no response was

23 required because the "updated baseline" was not the project under consideration: "[T]he student

24 population has now increased beyond 2020 LRDP projections with little or no analysis of the

25 potential environmental impacts of this increase in students over the number analyzed in the

26 2020 LRDP EIR." (AR882.) "CEQA [only] requires that UC Berkeley compare the potential

[ impacts of the housing project, such as the Upper Hearst Development, with existing

2 environmental conditions at the time CEQA review occurs, including current campus
population." (AR882.) "Review of population increases are typically done as part of an overall

4 LRDP and its EIR." (AR882.) Here, the SEIR dismisses the displacement and indirect

5 population impacts of the "update" portion of the updated baseline as outside the scope of its

6 study. The Court cannot meaningfully review the SEIR's analysis of population impacts when
the SEIR declines to reach those conclusions itself in the first place. If the "update" were a
project, UC Berkeley's refusal to consider potentially significant environmental impacts would
be a prejudicial abuse of discretion, and the Court finds it to be so here. This abuse of discretion

10 is exacerbated because the analysis does not clearly address the impact of the future student

11 enrollment increase attributed to the "project."

12 The FSEIR responds to the City and SNC's concerns about student and induced

13 nonstudent homelessness by asserting that "CEQA was enacted to protect the environment and

14 speculation about increased housing insecurity is beyond its scope." (AR883.) "The potential

15 displacement of existing tenants in Berkeley also could result in an incremental increase in the

16 population of homeless people living in Berkeley, although the social impacts of displacement

17 are beyond the scope of environmental review under CEQA." (AR856.) In the FSEIR, UC

18 Berkeley also argues that it need not consider the impacts of induced demand for non-University

19 housing because another agency will consider the environmental impacts of individual
20 development projects induced by economic forces. "Greater housing demand would increase the

21 incentive to construct additional private housing that caters to UC Berkeley students." (AR856.)

22 "If future projects are proposed that would require the displacement of substantial numbers of

23 people or existing housing, necessitating the construction of replacement housing elsewhere,

24 their environmental impacts would be evaluated as required by CEQA on a project-specific

25 basis." (AR856, citing AR2535 [2020 LRDP Vol. 1 at p.4.10-10].) This analysis fails to

26 consider whether its past increase in student enrollment caused population displacement.

1 Increases in campus population foreseeably lead to direct and indirect impacts on housing,

2 population, and displacement, and the failure to consider those impacts constitutes a prejudicial

3 abuse of discretion.

4 The FSEIR concludes that no new displacement impacts would result from the

5 construction of new University housing. "The proposed increase in headcount also may

6 necessitate the construction of new UC Berkeley-provided housing; however, such construction

7 would not require substantial displacements because the 2020 LRDP's land use strategy

8 prioritizes the siting of new housing on UC Berkeley's current property and, where necessary,

9 acquiring other sites where the displacement of existing tenants can be minimized." (AR856.)

10 This portion of the analysis also fails to consider indirect displacement impacts.

11 2, Demand for Public Services by Excess Population

12 The City argues that UC Berkeley erred in considering the population impacts by

13 concluding, without substantial evidence, that the increased population would not substantially

14 increase the demand for public services. The Guidelines require a lead agency to consider "other

15 aspects of the resource base such as . . . public services." (Guidelines § 15126.2(a).) The

16 Environmental Checklist Form asks the lead agency to determine whether the project would

17 "result in substantial adverse physical impacts associated with the provision of new or physically

18 altered government facilities, the construction of which would cause significant environmental

19 impacts, in order to maintain acceptable service ratios, response times or other performance

20 objectives" for various public services. (Guidelines, appx. G, § XV.) In response to the Draft

21 SEIR, the City of Berkeley submitted comments and evidence arguing that the increase in

22 student enrollment had created a significant increase in police services, fire and emergency

23 medical services, and public health services. (AR1187-1193.)

24 The City offered UC Berkeley a report by Economic and Planning Systems, Inc. (the
25  "EPS Report") as part of its public comments on the project. (AR1221-1309.) The EPS Report

26 broadly analyzes the fiscal impact on the City of being home to UC Berkeley. The Report states

J that calls for police service from UC Berkeley and its immediate surroundings increased from 14

2 percent to 19 percent of the citywide total from 2003 to 2018. (AR1223.) The EPS Report also
states that, although UC Berkeley has its own code enforcement and fire inspection personnel, it

4 does not maintain its own fire and emergency medical response teams a and, as a result, the City's

5 fire department provides the vast majority of fire and emergency medical response protection for

6 UC Berkeley's campus. (AR1223.) It also states that the City's fire department must undertake

7 special training because of high-density buildings (e.g., student dormitories) and specialized

8 buildings with dangerous contents (e.g., laboratories). (AR1189; see also AR6128 *UC

9 Berkeley relies on local public safety agencies to provide medical, fire, and emergency response" but

10 provides information about "hazardous materials [responders] may encounter and how to deal with

11 them ... ."].) The EPS Report also notes that increased enrollment has increased demand for the

12 City's public health services. (AR1191.)

13 In the FSEIR, UC Berkeley reasoned that staffing and equipment purchases are "fiscal

14 matters," whereas "CEQA analysis. focuses on environmental impacts that could result from

15 construction of new facilities that are required to provide fire department services." (AR846; see

16 also AR877 at Response A 8.4 "As to comments related to how increased student population
17  places additional burdens on already overtaxed city services, while this is a matter of concern,

18 under CEQA, staffing and support needs for public services are relevant only to the extent that

19 they result in physical changes that have environmental impacts."].) Regarding fire department

20 response times, UC stated that it would continue to abide by "Continuing Best Practice PUB-2.3"

21 from the 2020 LRDP EIR: to "continue [its] partnership with [Lawrence Berkeley National

22 Laboratory], [Alameda County Fire Department], and the City of Berkeley to ensure adequate

23 fire and emergency service levels to the campus and UC facilities," including "consultation on

24 the adequacy of emergency access routes to all new University Buildings." (AR847.) The

25 FSEIR did not expressly mention public health services in its response. (See AR884.)

26 Importantly, the FSEIR based its conclusion on an absence of evidence produced by the City. It

found that its analysis in the DSEIR was adequate because "[the City] did not provide

2 information or analysis to suggest that new or physically altered fire protection facilities, the

3 construction of which could cause significant environmental impacts, would be required as a

4 result of the proposed project or increased headcount.» (AR884, at Response 8.22.)
The City did, in fact, provide information indicating that increased service calls "will

6 result in a need for additional personnel and new facilities to accommodate them." (AR1190.)

7 After UC Berkeley released the Final SEIR, the City submitted additional evidence of physical

8 impacts. (See SAR239 [letter from City to UC Board of Regents dated May 13, 2019].) The

9 City identified its current plans for a new fire station in South Berkeley, a new ambulance it

10 already purchased, and its pressing need for larger space for its 911 emergency response call

I1 center. (SAR249, SAR340.) The same letter argues that, because Berkeley police spend an

12 increasing proportion of their time responding to an increasing number of student calls, their

13 activities necessarily result in increased air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and traffic.

14 (SAR248.) The Court found no substantial contradictory evidence that might show that the

15 increased demand on City of Berkeley services caused by from the Excess Population has not

16 contributed to the City's plans or purchase of new facilities with an impact on the environment,

17 and the SEIR does not cite or discuss any. The Court finds that it was a prejudicial abuse of

18 discretion to certify the SEIR on the basis of this inadequate analysis.

19 3. Noise and Aesthetic Impacts from Excess Population

20 The DSEIR noted that "additional student enrollment could indirectly result in an

21 increase in student rentals of private off-campus housing in Berkeley's residential

22 neighborhoods," which might result in "incrementally greater noise generated from existing

23 sources such as human conversations on sidewalks and residential yards, especially during social

24 gatherings." (AR208.) It dismissed this concern because the "increased headcount would not

25 introduce new sources of noise that may disturb residents, since neighborhoods near UC

26 Berkeley already accommodate a high proportion of off-campus student rentals." (AR208.)

1 "Continued implementation of the Berkeley Noise Ordinance would also minimize exposure to

2 high noise levels generated on properties in the city." (AR208.) "Therefore, the Project,
3| accounting for the updated campus headcount projections, would not result in significant indirect

4 environmental impacts in off-campus neighborhoods." (AR208.)

5 Residents living near campus expressed concern with this analysis. SNC commented that

6 the DSEIR did not consider evidence of the noise impacts of increasing student enrollment by

7 11,285 students who live primarily in off-campus private housing. (AR1653-1654.) Groups of

8 students living off campus are associated with "increases in noise, late-night traffic, and

9 improper refuse disposal." (AR1654.) Individual commenters also expressed this concern: "The

10 increase in traffic (and in aggressive driving), difficulties in parking, increase in noise from

II groups of students, and increase in improperly discarded trash and street dumping are only a few

12 of the changes I have seen." (AR1837.) "[M]ini-dorms frequently generate extreme party noise,

13 often into the wee hours of morning," but "calling the police when one is kept awake by party

14 noise is often useless, as they are too busy to go to each screaming party." (AR1861.)
15 Commenters attached pictures of improperly disposed refuse on "move-out day." (AR1865.)

16 The FSEIR repeated assertions from the DSEIR. "[A]dditional student enrollment could
17 result in an increase in student rentals of private off-campus housing in Berkeley's residential

18 neighborhoods." (AR845.) "However, increased headcount would not introduce new sources of

19 noise that may disturb residents, since neighborhoods near UC Berkeley already accommodate a

20 high proportion of off-campus student rentals," (AR845, emphasis added.) The FSEIR reasons

21 that neighborhoods near campus currently accommodate large numbers of students. This
22 analysis is an abuse of discretion. The FSEIR compares the its current student enrollment

23 numbers to the present, post-increase status quo and concludes that the increased in student

24 enrollment will not have any effects. That is, the SEIR fails to compare its increased enrollment

25 to a baseline before the increase. In this, the SEIR fails in its own stated goal of studying the

26 impacts of its earlier increases in student enrollment. The Court also cannot find substantial

1 evidence in the record supporting FSEIR's conclusion that a further marginal increase in student

2 enrollment would not exacerbate noise issues or have cumulative impacts.

3 The FSEIR also concludes that other factors will offset or mitigate any noise impacts
from increased student enrollment. "Continued implementation of the Berkeley Noise Ordinance
would also minimize exposure to high noise levels generated on properties in the city."
(AR845.) "Good neighbor relations programs and activities established by the [sic] UC

7 Berkeley, like Happy Neighbors, which educates students and their neighbors about community
expectations and relevant policies and laws, will also help to minimize exposure to high noise

9 levels." (AR846.) The SEIR refers to no evidence on which it based a conclusion that these

10 programs reduce the impact of the increase in students residing off-campus in private housing on

11 community noise levels, much less a finding that, if there were a noise impact, these programs

12 effectively reduce the impact to insignificance. The SEIR does not propose that UC adopt these

13 programs as mitigation measures to minimize the ongoing impact of its increased student

14 enrollment levels.

15 In response to community comments regarding moving-day trash, the FSEIR also asserts

16 that "[s]poradic littering does not rise to the level of a significant aesthetic impact under CEQA."
17 (AR846, 911, 1055.) It also similarly references university programs meant to mitigate the

18 impact: "Other issues, such as the visual effect of littering caused by students living off-campus,

19 are also addressed through programs such as Cal Move [I]n and Move Out, which is a program

20 established to decrease the environmental and social impacts of illegal dumping in near-campus

21 neighborhoods at the start and end of the academic year, and to educate students about

22 responsible disposal and reuse strategies." (AR846.) A "significant effect on the environment"

23 is "a substantial, or potentially substantial, adverse change in any of the physical conditions

24 within the area affected by the project. (Guidelines § 15382.) Under the substantial

25 evidence standard, UC Berkeley could reasonably conclude, based on the reported once-a-year

26 nature of this problem, that it was not a "substantial" effect on the environment.

1 4. Reasonable Alternatives

2 The City of Berkeley and SBN both fault UC Berkeley for not considering a "reduced

3 enrollment" alternative in the SEIR. Normally, a lead agency must "describe feasible measures

4 which could minimize significant adverse impacts" and "describe a range of reasonable

5 alternatives to the project, or to the location of the project, which would feasibly attain most of

6 the basic objectives of the project but would avoid or substantially lessen any of the significant

7 effects of the project, and evaluate the comparative merits of the alternatives." (Guidelines

8 15126.4(a)(1), 15126.6(a).) UC Berkeley argues that increased student enrollment was

9 already part of the baseline, but even if it was considered, the SEIR found the increase had no

10 significant impacts from the this excess population. Thus discussion of a reduced enrollment

11 alternative would have been superfluous. Because the court concludes that the environmental

12 analysis was flawed, however, this court cannot endorse UC Berkeley's conclusion that the lack

13 of analysis of a reduced enrollment alternative is legally permissible. Moreover, UC Berkeley's

14 argument does not address the future impact of increased enrollment due to the "project."

15 III. UPPER HEARST DEVELOPMENT - IMPACTS ON HISTORIC RESOURCES

16 SBN and the City both argue that UC Berkeley failed to properly define the historical

17 context of the new buildings on Hearst and performs an incomplete analysis of the impact of the

18 project on the historical buildings in the surrounding neighborhood. SBN also argues that the

19 University's mitigation measure improperly defers mitigation for significant historical impacts.

20 The DSEIR identified four buildings as historical resources near the Upper Hearst

21 Development site, relying on the 2020 LRDP EIR and the California Office of Historic

22 Resources Inventory. (AR134 [identifying the Beta Theta Pi House, Cloyne Court, Founder's

23 Rock, and Phi K Psi].) The 2020 LRDP EIR in turn drew its list of historic resources from "the

24 National Register of Historic Places, the State Historic Resources Inventory (State Inventory)

25 compiled by the Northwest Information Center at Sonoma State University, the Physical and

26 Environmental Planning unit in Facilities Services at UC Berkeley, and registers of the cities of

1 Berkeley and Oakland." (AR2312; AR2316 [describing Berkeley landmark ordinance]; see also

2 AR2324-2325 [listing designated buildings in the adjacent blocks north of campus]. The DSEIR

3 discussed the historical context of the First Bay Tradition, a style of architecture represented by

4 numerous buildings in Daley's Scenic Park (also called Daley's Scenic Tract), near the Upper

5 Hearst Development site. (AR131-140.) The DSEIR found that the Upper Hearst Development

6 project would require the demolition of a parking structure, which UC Berkeley had determined

7 not to be a historical resource. (AR147.) The Upper Hearst Development would also require the

8 demolition and replacement of "most of the primary site design of the Beta Theta Pi house"

9 including removal of 32 feet of a stream-rock training wall and numerous landscaping features.

10 (AR147-148.) The Upper Hearst Development would also "envelop [the Beta Theta Pi house]

11 within the site plan of the adjacent academic building, which bears little resemblance to the

12 historic property in terms of materials, design, scale/mass, and setting." (AR148.) Additionally,

13 the "scale, mass, and architectural design/materials of the new buildings" would not be

14 "compatible with the massing, size, scale, and architectural features" of the Beta Theta Pi house,

15 Cloyne Court, or Phi Kappa Psi because "the new buildings would be significantly higher and of

16 greater mass and scale than all buildings in the immediate vicinity." (AR149.)

17 The DSEIR concluded that the Upper Hearst Development would "impair the integrity of

18 two historical resources identified in the 2020 LRDP" and "would impair the integrity of a third

19 immediately north of the Project site." (AR150.) It proposed a mitigation measure

20 (designated "MM-CUL-1") requiring that, "Ip]rior to approval of final design plans for the

21 Upper Hearst Development, UC Berkeley shall retain a historic architect meeting the National

22 Park Service Professional Qualification Standards for historic architecture to review plans for the

23 proposed academic and residential buildings" who would "provide input and refinements to the

24 design team regarding modifications to the palette of exterior materials to improve compatibility

25 with neighboring historical resources and compliance with" national standards. (AR150.) The

26 DSEIR found that the Upper Hearst Development would "degrade the integrity of feeling and

- setting of historical resources adjacent to the Project site" as a "significant and unavoidable

2 cumulative impact on historical resources" and that MM-CUL-1 would "reduce this impact to

3 the extent feasible." (AR150.)

4 Several public commenters expressed concern about the DSEIR's description of the

5 Upper Hearst Development's historical context. (E.g., AR1206 [City of Berkeley]; AR1150-

6 1151 [Berkeley Landmark Preservation Commission]; AR1634-1639 [Berkeley Architectural

7 Heritage Association].) One particularly thorough letter from the Berkeley Architectural

8 Heritage Association ("BAHA") identified an additional 25 buildings in the neighboring

9 blocks-eleven of them designated landmarks by the City of Berkeley Landmark Preservation

10 Commission. (AR1638-1639.) It also argued that the DSEIR analysis did not recognize Daley's

II Scenic Park as an independently significant historical resource. (AR1634, 1639.) The eleven

12 listed buildings are "presumptive" 1 istoric resources because they are listed on a local historic

13 registry. (AR1638-1639; see Pub. Res. Code § 21084.1; Guidelines § 15064.5(a)(2).) One

14 building, the Phi Delta Theta chapter house, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

15 (AR1638.) The other buildings (and Daley's Scenic Park as an area) may constitute historical

16 resources, subject to the discretion of UC Berkeley, based on the evidence. (See Guidelines

17 § 15064.5(a)(3) ["Any building, structure, site, area, [or] place .. . which a lead agency
determines to be historically significant ... may be considered to be an historical resource, 18

19 provided the lead agency's determination is supported by substantial evidence in light of the

20 whole record."].)

21 The FSEIR responded to comments by noting that the Upper Hearst Development is not

22 situated in a designated historic district (AR897) and that the DSEIR "is not intended as a

23 comprehensive survey or original scholarship on the history of the project site and its

24 surroundings." (AR862.) The FSEIR noted that many of the buildings that BAHA identified are

25 located several blocks from the project site and that, "[i]n keeping with standard CEQA and
26 professional practice," the DSEIR analyzed the potential impacts on historical resources located

l within or directly adjacent to the project site. (AR898.) The FSEIR notes that, although the
2 remaining buildings were not discussed in the DSEIR by name, they are part of the historical

3 context and of the nearby neighborhood, which was discussed in some detail. (AR898; see

4 AR131-140.)

5 In its follow-up letter to the FSEIR, the City of Berkeley communicated a concern that

6 MM-CUL-1 was an inadequate mitigation measure because it did not reduce the severity of the

7 impact to a "less than significant" level. (SAR257.) The City also objected that it "relegates the

8 input of a historical architect to the status of unenforceable best practices, and delays this input

9 until a later unspecified date" because it "would merely result in recommendations for exterior

10 building materials that would be forwarded to University decision-makers to 'consider,' without

11 any demonstrable enforceability to avoid or reduce the severity of the impact." (SAR257-258.)

12 The City argued that "[t]he deferred input of an historical architect on future proposed redesigns

13 following CEQA review fails to avoid or substantially reduce this impact," which, "contrary to

14 the University's assertions, ... is not unavoidable." (SAR259.)

15 In its findings adopting the SEIR and approving the project, the University found that the

16 Upper Hearst Development would "degrade the integrity of feeling and setting of historical

17 resources adjacent to the Project site, which will contribute to a significant and unavoidable

18 cumulative impact on historical resources" and that adopting MM-CUL-1 was feasible and

19 would "reduce this impact to the extent feasible." (AR24-25.) It also found that, "even with

20 implementation of this measure, significant unavoidable impacts [would] occur" and that

21 "specific economic, legal, social, technological, or other considerations make it infeasible to

22 reduce this impact to a less than significant level." (AR25.)

23 The DSEIR's inventory of four potentially affected buildings as historical resources is

24 supported by substantial evidence, the inventories consulted for the DSEIR and the 2020 LRDP

25 EIR. (See AR862 [describing "due diligence" steps taken, including site visits, records research,

26 and experts consulted]; see also AR130, 141-145.) The DSEIR also discusses the major

l historical events and aesthetic and architectural features that give the area north of campus its

2 historical context and value and feeling. In so doing it describes the historical environmental

3 setting of the surrounding area, including the First Bay Tradition and the structures that survived

4 1923 Berkeley Fire.

5 UC Berkeley's decision to exclude the buildings on BAHA's list from consideration is

6 also not an abuse of discretion. The resources in the list may qualify as "historical resources."

7 (See Guidelines § 15064.5(a)(1)-(4).) But CEQA only requires a lead agency a to consider as an

8 impact a "substantial adverse change in the significance of an historical resource." (Guidelines

9 § 15064.5(b).) A "substantial adverse change in [ significance" means "physical demolition,

10 destruction, relocation, or alteration of the resource or its immediate surroundings such that the

11 significance of an historical resource would be materially impaired." (Guidelines

12 cop 15064.5(b)(1).) The City and SBN argue that the Upper Hearst Development might "alter[]"

13 the "immediate surroundings" of the additional historical resources identified by BAHA and that

14 UC Berkeley abused its discretion by failing to consider the project's potential impacts on those

15 buildings. The unconsidered buildings are as close as a block away to several blocks away.

16 UC Berkeley did not abuse its discretion in determining that buildings in the "immediate
17 vicinity" of the project site means buildings within the project side or immediately adjacent to

18 it--that is, buildings across the street were included; those a block away were not. The type of

19 impact being discussed here (a mismatch of scale and architectural style) may affect the

20 historical feel of a building, but proposed plans and the description of the environmental setting

21 are substantial evidence from which a reasonable person could conclude that the impact of the

22 project would be insignificant for all but the closest buildings. There is no evidence that the

23 addition of a new building would have a material impact on the historical significance of the

24 nearby historical structures. (Cf. Taxpayers for Accountable School Bond Spending v. San Diego

25 Unified School Dist. (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 1013, 1045 [finding no abuse of discretion when

26

1 school district failed to consider impact of increased field lighting from new football stadium on

2 historical significance of nearby neighborhood].)

3 UC Berkeley's decision not to consider Daley's Scenic Tract as a historical district is also

4 not an abuse of discretion. The FSEIR found by substantial evidence that Daley's Scenic Tract

5 is not listed in national, state, or local historic register. It is therefore not a "mandatory" or

6 "presumptive" historical resource. (See Pub. Res. Code § 21084.1; Guidelines & 15064.5(a)(1),

7 (2); see also Valley Advocates v. City of Fresno (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 1039, 1051 [discussing
8  "mandatory," "presumptive," and "discretionary" as common labels for three categories of

9 treatment for historical resources under CEQA].) SBN argues that UC Berkeley abused its

10 discretion by failing to consider whether Daley's Scenic Tract constitutes a discretionary

11 historical resource. SBN analogizes this to the Valley Advocates case, arguing that the Court

12 should grant the writ because UC Berkeley "did not, in fact, exercise its discretion" to determine

13 whether Daley's Scenic Tract is a historical resource. (Valley Advocates v. City of Fresno (2008)

14 160 Cal.App.4th 1039, 1061.) In that case, however, "the City Council [of Fresno] was

15 misinformed about its discretion" because it had previously denied an application for historical

16 recognition for the same building. (Id. at p.1061.) And although the SEIR does not expressly
17 consider the regulatory factors for weighing whether a resource could, in UC's discretion, be

18 considered a historical resource, there is no indication that UC Berkeley was under a

19 misapprehension of its ability to do so here. it Instead, it appears to have been aware of the history

20 and significance of the scattering of First Bay Tradition homes surviving in Daley's Scenic

21 Tract. (See, e.g., AR134-135, 862, 897.) The SEIR discussed the importance of the
22 neighborhood as context but did not find the area itself to be a historical resource independent of

23 the collection of historical buildings within it.

24 SBN argues that mitigation measure MM-CUL-1 improperly defers mitigation because it

25 only requires that the architect "provide input and refinements" but no actual requirements. The

26 DSEIR proposed, and UC Berkeley adopted, MM-CUL-1, which provides as follows:

Prior to approval of final design plans for the Upper Hearst Development, UC Berkeley shall retain a historic architect meeting the National Park
2 Service Professional Qualifications Standards for historic architecture to
review plans for the proposed academic and residential buildings. The historic architect shall provide input and refinements to the design team regarding modifications to the palette of exterior materials to improve compatibility with neighboring historical resources and compliance with the Secretary of Interior's Standards. This review shall include, but not be limited to, suggestions for incorporating exterior materials, such as wood or brick, in the design. (AR150.)

7 UC Berkeley argues that its adoption of MM-CUL-1 should not be judged against the usual

8 standards for mitigation measures because it does not purport to reduce the impact to a "less than

9 significant" level. (Resps.' Opp. to Petr. SBN's Opening Merits Brief, at p.35 [citing AR150];

10 see also AR25 [findings of significant and unavoidable impact]; AR2367 [2020 LRDP EIR ] .)

11 This argument is contrary to the text and policy underlying CEQA: "Each public agency shall

12 mitigate or avoid the significant effects on the environment of projects that it carries out or

13 approves whenever it is feasible to do so." (Pub. Res. Code § 21002.1; see also Pub. Res. Code

14 § 21002 ["[T]t is the policy of the state that public agencies should not approve projects as

15 proposed if there are feasible alternatives or feasible mitigation measures available which would

16 substantially lessen the significant environmental effects of such projects."].) Even if a lead

17 agency finds that environmental impacts would remain significant, it still must adopt feasible

18 measures to mitigate or avoid those impacts.

19 That said, UC Berkeley did not abuse its discretion by adopting MM-CUL-1. UC

20 Berkeley argues that it is not deferring mitigation because MM-CUL-1 requires it to take specific

21 steps, because those steps are to be guided by the Secretary of the Interior's standards, and

22 because mitigation to historical impacts is inherently subjective and does not lend itself to

23 objective criteria. As the term is used in CEQA, "[m]itigation' includes: [1] (a) Avoiding the

24 impact altogether by not taking a certain action or parts of an action[; and] [1] (b) [m]inimizing

25 impacts by limiting the degree or magnitude of the action and its implementation . . . ."

26 (Guidelines § 15370.) To ensure that mitigation measures are adequate, an "EIR shall describe

feasible measures which could minimize significant adverse impacts." (Guidelines

2 15126.4.(a)(1).) "Formulation of mitigation measures shall not be deferred until some future

3 time." (Guidelines § 15126.4(a)(1)(B).) "The specific details of a mitigation measure, however,

4 may be developed after project approval when it is impractical or infeasible to include those

5 details during the project's environmental review provided that the agency (1) commits itself to

6 the mitigation, (2) adopts specific performance standards the mitigation will achieve, and (3)

7 identifies the type(s) of potential action(s) that can feasibly achieve that performance standard

8 and that will considered, analyzed, and potentially incorporated in the mitigation measure."

9 (Ibid.) UC Berkeley's adopted mitigation measure MM-CUL-1 meets these standards because it

10 commits the University to hiring a qualified historical architect, because it requires the

11 University to adopt the Secretary of Interior's Standards as a performance standard (see

12 Guidelines §15064.5(b)(3)), and because it identifies changes to exterior materials as the kinds of

13 changes that will be considered and potentially incorporated in the mitigation measure.

14 UC Berkeley also did not abuse its discretion by concluding that the Upper Hearst
15 Development's impact on the historical resources would be significant and unavoidable and that

16 the benefits of the project outweigh the historical impacts. (See AR25, 40.) SBN argues that UC

17 Berkeley abused its discretion by rejecting a reduced scale alternative. (AR38.) UC's factual

18 findings included a finding that:

19 The Reduced Scale Alternative would meet most of the Project objectives, but to a lesser extent than would the Project. The Alternative would better
20 meet objectives to maintain the character and setting of surrounding historic

21 buildings and to build facilities that are compatible with the surrounding
neighborhood. However, by reducing the scale of the new GSPP, the

22 Alternative would not fully meet objectives related to fulfilling the academic needs of the School's program. Similarly, because the residential
23 building includes fewer residential units than proposed, the alternative would not fully meet objectives to provide housing on-site to serve current
24 market demand and to address the shortage of campus housing. By
reducing the scale of development, the Alternative would meet the objective
25 of accommodating increased School enrollment to a lesser extent than

26 would the Project. The potential removal of additional parking spaces also would not meet the objective of maintaining as much parking as possible

1 on-site. Because the Reduced Scale Alternative would meet Project objectives to a lesser extent than would the Project, the University rejects
2 this alternative. (AR38.)

* SBN argues that UC Berkeley did not actually find that the reduced scale alternative was

4 infeasible. UC Berkeley's findings noted that a reduced scale alternative would lessen some

5 impacts but exacerbate others. (See also AR251-254 [discussion in DSEIR reaching same

6 conclusion].) Substantial evidence supports the university's decision that the environmental

7 benefits of the reduced scale alternative were outweighed by its downsides and that it is
infeasible to reduce that impact to a less-than-significant level. (AR24-25,)

9 IV. UPPER HEARST DEVELOPMENT -TRAFFIC AND NOISE IMPACTS

10 The City also argues that the SEIR's analysis of the Upper Hearst Development failed to

11 adequately analyze potential traffic and noise impacts. The City objected to the DSEIR's traffic

12 analysis, arguing that the DSEIR assumed without evidence that reducing existing parking at the

13 Upper Hearst Development site would reduce trip generation rather than shift parking demand

14 elsewhere. (See AR1194.) Responding to the City's comment, the FSEIR justified its reliance

15 on indirect measures of trip generation because alternatives to university parking, such as street

16 parking and off-campus parking lots, are open to the public and University-affiliated parking

17 cannot be isolated from general public parking at those locations, so direct observation of trip

18 generation is infeasible. (AR884-885.) Instead the FSEIR, like the 2020 LRDP EIR from which

19 it tiers, relies on indirect data, such as survey data, intersection traffic data, on-campus parking

20 permits and parking lot occupancy rates. (AR885.) "[T]he UC Berkeley-operated parking

21 supply decreased by about 1,130 spaces (about 15 percent) from 2001-2002 to 2016-2017, and

22 during the same period, the drive-alone mode share for all population groups, as well as Campus

23 Park trip generation, decreased." (AR885.) The data behind these statements are substantial

24 evidence from which a reasonable agency could conclude that a marginal decrease in parking
25 availability will marginally decrease car commutes by inducing more students, faculty, and staff

26

1 to commute by public transportation, bicycle, or foot. This conclusion was not an abuse of

2 discretion.

The City also argues that the SEIR failed to consider traffic impacts related to
construction of the Upper Hearst Development. (See AR1195.) It did, however, consider those
impacts, and it concluded that they "would be less than significant and no mitigation is therefore

6 required." (AR879.) The City argues that the SEIR's continuing best practices, which were
adopted from the 2020 LRDP EIR, "do not include, as they should, City review and approval of

8 the Construction Traffic Management Plans." (AR1195.) The SEIR expressly adopted

9 continuing best practices from the 2020 LRDP EIR, which mandate that the university require

10 contractors to prepare of a construction traffic management plan early in the planning process-

11 including proposed truck routes, construction hours, employee parking, and equipment staging---

12 and schedule projects to minimize overlap between excavation and other truck-heavy portions of

13 construction projects. (AR879, 886 [responding to City's comment at AR1195]; see AR221

14 [describing continuing best practices TRA-3-a, TRA-3-b, and TRA-3-c].) These best practices

15 do not mandate that the University get City approval for its traffic and construction parking

16 plans, but the City provides no evidence of a legal requirement to do so or evidence that a failure

17 a to do so would result in a significant impact to the environment. UC Berkeley's decision to

18 certify the traffic analysis of the Upper Hearst Development in the SEIR was not an abuse of

19 discretion.

20 The City also objected to the SEIR's analysis of noise impacts of the Upper Hearst

21 Development's potential noise impacts on nearby noise-sensitive land uses like nearby

22 multifamily housing developments, student housing, and academic buildings. The City argues

23 that the SEIR's analysis was flawed because it measured the baseline noise level during the

24 evening commute, resulting in an artificially high baseline for noise impacts. The City also

25 argues that the SEIR failed to describe the sources of noise that might result from the Upper

26 Hearst Development, including both ongoing sources of noise like HVAC operations and

sporadic sources of noise such as outdoor activities or special events. The City objects that the
SEIR. reached its conclusion that no significant noise impacts would result without considering

3 the number, size, time, and frequency of events to be held at the event center at the Upper Hearst

4 Development. The City presented these arguments in its comments to the DSEIR. (See
AR1202.) In response, the FSEIR noted that peak-hour ambient noise measurements are used to
6 characterize "the worst daily noise exposure near a Project site" and is a "more conservative
approach to assume that new residents on the Project site would be exposed too this noise level."

8 (AR890.) The FSEIR also concluded that "the noise associated with outdoor events would not

9 cause City of Berkeley Noise Ordinance limits to be violated at nearby sensitive receptors and

10 therefore[] would be less than significant." (AR908; see also AR201-202 [discussing noise from

11 HVAC and outdoor events, concluding less than significant impact on nearby sensitive

12 receptors].) Certification of the SEIR on this issue was therefore not an abuse of discretion.
