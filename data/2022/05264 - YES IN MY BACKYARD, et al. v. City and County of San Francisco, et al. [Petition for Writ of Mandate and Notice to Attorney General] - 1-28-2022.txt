INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO COMPLETE THE COVER SHEET CM-010
To Plaintiffs and Others Filing First Papers. If you are filing a first paper (for example, a complaint) in a civil case, you must complete and file, along with your first paper, the Civil Case Cover Sheet contained on page 1. This information will be used to compile statistics about the types and numbers of cases filed. You must complete items through 6 on the sheet. In item 1, you must check one box for the case type that best describes the case. If the case fits both a general and a more specific type of case listed in item 1, check the more specific one. If the case has multiple causes of action, check the box that best indicates the primary cause of action.
To assist you in completing the sheet, examples of the cases that belong under each case type in item 1 are provided below. A cover sheet must be filed only with your initial paper. Failure to file a cover sheet with the first paper filed in a civil case may subject a party, its counsel, or both to sanctions under rules 2.30 and 3.220 of the California Rules of Court.
To Parties in Rule 3.740 Collections Cases. A "collections case" under rule 3.740 is defined as an action for recovery of money owed
in a sum stated to be certain that is not more than $25,000, exclusive of interest and attorney's fees, arising from a transaction in which
property, services, or money was acquired on credit. A collections case does not include an action seeking the following: (1) tort damages, (2) punitive damages, (3) recovery of real property, (4) recovery of personal property, or (5) a prejudgment writ of attachment. The identification of a case as rule 3.740 collections case on this form means that it will be exempt from the general time-for-service requirements and case management rules, unless a defendant files a responsive pleading. A rule 3.740 collections case will be subject to the requirements for service and obtaining a judgment in rule 3.740. To Parties in Complex Cases. In complex cases only, parties must also use the Civil Case Cover Sheet to designate whether the case is complex. If a plaintiff believes the case is complex under rule 3.400 of the California Rules of Court, this must be indicated by completing the appropriate boxes in items 1 and 2. If a plaintiff designates a case as complex, the cover sheet must be served with the
complaint on all parties to the action. A defendant may file and serve no later than the time of its first appearance a joinder in the in
plaintiff's designation, a counter-designation that the case is not complex, or, if the plaintiff has made no designation, a designation that
the case is complex. CASE TYPES AND EXAMPLES

4 10. San Francisco County Superior Court has initial jurisdiction of the matters
alleged herein pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1094.5 and 1085, which authorizes the 5

6 Court to issue a writ of mandate.

7 11. Venue is proper in this Court because the entire controversy occurred in San

8 Francisco County, and Respondents are situated in San Francisco County. (Code Civ. Proc. §§

9 394 & 395.)

10 12. This action is timely because it has been filed within 90 days from the effective Id 'NOSMALIVA  NVWAHTHH 'SXOVZ 11 date of a decision of a local agency's disapproval of housing development project. (Gov. ALIFORNIA 94104 00+ ALINS'LHIAIS ANHNODINOW 109 12 Code § 65589.5(m).)
13 13. Petitioners performed any and all conditions precedent to filing this action to the
14 extent required by law.
STATEMENT OF FACTS *ODSIONVAI NVS 15

16 14. This case concerns Respondents' illegal patterns and practices it institutes to
17 avoid compliance with state housing laws adopted by the California legislature to address the
18 ongoing housing crisis. As illustrated in this case, Respondent's conduct includes, but is not
19 limited to, (i) failing to act on housing development project applications within statutory
20 deadlines, (ii) abusing the California Environmental Quality Act review process to effectively

21 deny housing development projects based on unsubstantiated opinions of individual Board
22 members about speculative project impacts, and (iii) ignoring state housing laws that require

23 approval of code-compliant housing development projects unless a finding can be made that a

24 project would have a specific, adverse impact upon public health or safety. The City has

25 applied these illegal policies and practices to avoid their obligations under state law, and have

26 led to San Francisco being amongst the top two most expensive housing markets in the United

27 States

28 15. In enacting the Housing Accountability Act (HAA), the Legislature found and

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

F declared:
California has a housing supply and affordability crisis of historic
effectively and 2 proportions. The consequences of failing to
00 + u aggressively confront this crisis are hurting millions of Californians, robbing future generations of the chance to call California home,
stifling economic opportunities for workers and businesses,
worsening poverty and homelessness, and undermining the state's environmental and climate objectives .. despite the fact that, for
6 decades, the Legislature has enacted numerous statutes intended to
significantly increase the approval, development, and affordability 7 of housing for all income levels.
8 (Gov. Code § 65589.5(a)(2)(A)(J).)

9 16. To address this housing crisis, the HAA requires approval of proposed housing
Dd 'NOSHALIVA Y NVWOTTHJ 'SXOVZ 10 development projects that comply with "applicable, objective general plan and zoning

ILIFORNIA 94104 601 MONTGOMERY STREET, SUITE 400 11 standards and criteria, including design review standards." If a local agency proposes to
12 disapprove a project, the local agency must make written findings, supported by a
13 preponderance of evidence, that the housing development project would have a "specific,
14 adverse impact upon the public health and safety," which is defined as a "significant,
ODSIONVA NVS 15 quantifiable, direct, and unavoidable impact, based on objective, identified written public
16 health or safety standards, policies, or conditions," and there is no feasible method to avoid
17 satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the identified impact. (Gov. Code § 65589.5(j).)
18 17. The housing development project at issue here proposes to construct 495 new
19 dwelling units, including 73 units that would be restricted as affordable housing, at 469
20 Stevenson Street in San Francisco, which is currently used as a surface parking lot for the
21 department store Nordstrom (the Project).
22 18. An application for the Project was first submitted on November 17, 2017, and
23 was accepted by the City as complete on May 31, 2018.
24 19. The City failed to provide the applicant with written documentation identifying
25 and explaining any reasons the City considered the Project inconsistent, not in compliance, or
26 not in conformity with an applicable plan, program, policy, ordinance, standard, requirement,
27 or other similar provision within 60 days after the application was deemed complete as
28 required by Gov. Code § 65589.5(J)(2)(A)(ii). Therefore, the housing development Project was

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF
-5-

r deemed code-compliant pursuant to the HAA on July 30, 2018. (Id.)

2 20. On October 2, 2019, one year and one month after the application was deemed

3 complete, the City prepared an Initial Study that assessed the list of potential impacts on all
4 environmental factors required under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).

5 21. The Initial Study determined that the Project could potentially result in impacts

6 related to air quality, wind, and shadow. The Initial Study also found the Project would have a

7 less than significant impact with respect to all other environmental factors, including

8 population and housing, cultural resources, and geology and hazards. As a result, the City

9 required an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) but limited the scope of the EIR to an
Id 'NOSMALIVA  NVWAHTHH 'SXOVZ 10 evaluation of the three potential impacts identified in the Initial Study. The City accepted
601 MONTGOMERY STREET, SUITE 400 +0I+6 VINNOIIVO "ODSIONVE I NVS 11 written comments on the proposed scope of the EIR for 30 days.
12 22. On March 11, 2020, five months after the Initial Study was completed, a Draft

13 EIR was published. The San Francisco Planning Commission held a public hearing to receive
14 comments on the Draft EIR on April 16, 2020. The public comment period closed on May 11,
15 2021.

16 23. The Planning Commission held a second, "informational" public hearing to

17 discuss the Project on November 12, 2020.
18 24. In May 2021, one year after the public comment period closed, the City

19 published its responses to comments on the Draft EIR.

20 25. The Commission held a third, fourth, and fifth public hearing to take action on

21 the Project entitlements and certification of the EIR on June 10, 2021, June 24, 2021, and July
22 22, 2021, but continued the item each time without a vote.

23 26. The Commission conducted a sixth public hearing on July 29, 2021, wherein the

24 Commission voted to approve the entitlements for the Project and certify the EIR, finding that

25 the Project was consistent with the City's General Plan and Planning Code, and that the EIR

26 for the Project was "adequate, accurate, and objective."
27 27. An appeal of the EIR certification to the Board of Supervisors was filed by the
28 Yerba Buena Neighborhood Consortium, LLC on August 30, 2021. On October 5, 2021, the

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF
-6-

F Board of Supervisors held a hearing - the seventh public hearing for the Project - and voted to

2 continue the item without taking any action on the appeal.

3 28. On October 26, 2021, the Board of Supervisors held an eighth public hearing to

4 discuss the appeal. Based on speculative and nongermane public opinion that the Project would

5 result in gentrification, as well as unsubstantiated claims that the Project may have impacts on

6 historical resources and geology, the Board voted to conditionally reverse the EIR certification,

7 subject to the adoption of written findings in support of its action.

8 29. Several weeks after the Board's vote to conditionally reverse the EIR

9 certification, the California Department of Housing and Community Development ("HCD")
Dd 'NOSHALIVA Y NVWOTTHJ 'SYJVZ 10 sent a "Letter of Inquiry and Technical Assistance" to the City (attached hereto as Exhibit A).
00+ ILINS 'IHHMIS ANHWOSINOW I09 11 30. HCD wrote that it had become aware of the City's "effective denial" of the ALIFORNIA 94104 12 Project, as well as another 316-unit housing project located at 450 O'Farrell Street on October

13 5. 2021, and that "HCD is concerned that the City/County's actions are indicative of review
14 processes that may be constraining the provision of housing in San Francisco."
*ODSIONVEI NVS 15 31. HCD noted that the two projects shared the same fate of "having prior Planning
16 Commission approvals of significant housing projects being overturned by the BOS" and

17 "HCD is concerned that this represents a larger trend in a the City/County."
18 32. HCD noted the City had "cited various vague concerns about FEIR
19 deficiencies" during the hearing but failed to publish written findings or provide substantial

20 evidence in support of the findings. HCD requested the City adopt written findings within 30

21 days and advised that "HCD's investigation remains open, and HCD is continuing its review of
22 these particular actions and of the City/County's practices with respect to housing review and
23 approval generally."

24 33. On December 12, 2021, three years and six months after the application for the

25 Project was deemed complete, the Board of Supervisor adopted written findings to reverse the

26 EIR certification (attached hereto as Exhibit B).

27 34. According to the adopted findings, individual Board members "[e]xpressed the
28 opinion that the analysis of housing impacts based on displacement was inadequate," and

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF
-7-

r "[s]tated there is no question that the Project will cause significant displacement on the 6th

2 Street corridor, Filipino community, and the broader low-income community," without

3 providing any evidence in support of the Board members' opinions and statements.

4 35. The findings also noted that Board members "[s]tated that surrounding taller

5 buildings do impact historic districts," without identifying those impacts or providing evidence

6 in support of the Board members' statements.

7 36. The findings stated that the EIR was inadequate because it "relied on future

8 compliance with the California and San Francisco Building Codes as a basis to reach its

9 I conclusion," despite the fact that the City routinely and properly relies on future compliance
Dd 'NOSHALIVA Y NVWOTTHI 'SYJVZ 10 with building codes to reach the same conclusion in other similarly sized projects.
601 MONTGOMERY STREET, SUITE 400 11 37. As a result of the unsubstantiated statements and opinions of individual Board +OL+6 VINNOAIIVO *ODSIONVI I NVS 12 members, the Board erroneously determined that the EIR did not comply with CEQA, moved

13 to reverse the Commission's EIR certification, and directed the Planning Department to
14 conduct further review.

15 38. As a result of the Board's reversal of the EIR certification, the Planning
16 Commission's approval of the entitlements for the Project were deemed void pursuant to the

17 City's Administrative Code § 31.16(b)(10), effectively disapproving the Project.
18 39. The state Permit Streamlining Act (PSA), codified at Gov. Code § 65920 et

19 seq., is intended to expedite decisions on development projects. The PSA sets strict timelines

20 for local agencies to act on proposed development projects, including a requirement for a lead

21 agency to approve or disapprove a project within 120 days from the date of certification of an
22 EIR. (Gov. Code § 65950(a)(2).)
23 40. CEQA requires a local agency to prepare and certify an Environmental Impact

24 Report within one year from the date a development application is accepted as complete, which

25 may be extended for 90 days by ordinance or resolution if justified by compelling
26 circumstances and if the applicant consents. (Public Resources Code § 21151.5; CEQA

27 Guidelines § 15108.)

28 41. In total, the one-year CEQA deadline to certify an EIR, plus a 90-day extension,

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF
-8-

r and the 120-day PSA deadline from EIR certification to approve a project, provides local

2 governments with an absolute upper limit of one year and seven months after an application is

3 deemed complete to take a final action on a project. a

4 42. More than three years and seven months have passed since the Project

5 application was deemed complete. The City has failed to comply with its legal duty to certify

6 year and failed to the EIR within one pass resolution to extend the time to certify the EIR.

7 The Board's reversal of the EIR certification voids the Planning Commission's approval of the

8 Project entitlements, and Petitioners are informed and believe that the City does not consider

9 its action to be "final." The Board's action puts the Project back at square one of the
10 environmental review process, voids the Planning Commission's approval of the Project
601 MONTGOMERY STREET, SUITE 400 Id 'NOSMALIVJ  NVWIHTHA 'SXOVZ ALIFORNIA 94104 11 entitlements, and disregards the City's legal duty to expeditiously act on development projects.

12 43. The Housing Crisis Act of 2019, commonly referred to as SB 330, recognizes

13 that permitting delays exacerbate the cost of residential construction and significantly
14 contribute to the housing crisis. (Housing Crisis Act of 2019, Sec. 2(a)(10).) To expedite the
ODSIONVII NVS 15 approval of housing, SB 330 imposes a strict five-hearing rule for housing projects. (Gov.
16 Code, § 65905.5.) SB 330 defines a "hearing" to include any public hearing and specifically
17 a states that a "continued hearing shall count as one of the five hearings." (Gov. Code, §
18 65905.5(a), (b)(2).) SB 330 requires a local government to approve or disapprove a housing
19 development application at one of the five hearings. (Id.)
20 44. The City has already held eight public hearings on the Project after January 1,

21 2020, in violation of SB 330's five-hearing rule. The Board's reversal of the EIR certification

22 at the seventh public hearing also voided the Commission's approval of the Project
23 entitlements, which ensures that the City will violate the five-hearing rule again and will likely
24 result in multiple future violations.

25 45. The Board's action to reverse the EIR certification and void the Project

26 approval constitutes an "effective denial" of a code-compliant housing development Project, as
27 stated by HCD in their letter to the Board, and is a thinly veiled abuse of the CEQA process.
28 46. The Board's action clearly violates the HAA. The Board's findings did not

-9.

r identify any applicable, objective general plan and zoning standards and criteria that the
Project failed to meet. Rather, the Board's action disapproved the Project and voided the
3 Commission's approval based on vague, unsubstantiated concerns regarding the adequacy of 2

4 the EIR. The action is not supported by substantial evidence in the record.

5 47. The Board did not identify any applicable objective, identified written public

6 health or safety standards, policies, or conditions at all, nor did the Board find that the Project

7 failed to meet any such health and safety standards.

8 48. Petitioners wrote letters to the City and the Board to explain that the City had an

9 obligation under the HAA to approved the code-compliant housing development Project, had a

DJ 'NOSHALIVA Y NVWATTHI 'SXOVZ 10 legal duty to certify the EIR, and was already in violation of SB 330. The City ignored those

6 56. As detailed above, CEQA requires that a lead

7 within one year after an application is deemed complete, which may be extended for 90 days

8 by ordinance or resolution if justified by compelling circumstances and if the applicant

9 consents. Respondents failed to pass an ordinance or resolution extending the deadline to
10 certify an EIR. More than three years and seven months have passed since the Project
00+ ILINS 'LHHMIS ANENOSINOW I09 Dd 'NOSHALIVA Y NVWOTTHJ 'SXOVZ application was deemed complete. Respondents' action reversed the Planning Commission's +0I+6 VINNOIIVO "ODSIONVE I NVS 12 certification of the EIR, disregarding the City's legal duty to prepare and certify an EIR within 11

13 the timeframe allowed by law. Petitioners further contend that Respondents' actions are
14 intended to evade their legal duties and deny Petitioners, YIMBY Members, and others

15 similarly situated their rights under CEQA.
16 57. Pursuant to CEQA, an EIR need not be exhaustive or perfect, but merely

17 sufficient to allow for an intelligent decision. The Planning Commission determined that the
18 EIR for the Project was "adequate, accurate, and objective." Petitioners assert that
19 Respondents' reversal of the EIR certification is invalid because Respondents abused their

20 discretion by not proceeding in the manner required by law, issuing a decision unsupported by

21 the findings, and issuing findings that are unsupported by the evidence.
22 58. Contrary to Respondents' actions, the criteria to certify the EIR pursuant to

23 CEQA are met, and the Board abused its discretion in finding otherwise. The Board's findings
24 reversing the EIR certification are based on argument, speculation, unsubstantiated opinion and

25 narrative; evidence which is clearly erroneous and inaccurate; and evidence of social or

26 economic impacts which do not contribute to or are not caused by physical impacts on the

13 61. Petitioners assert that the disapproval of the Project is invalid because

14 Respondents abused their discretion by not proceeding in the manner required by law, issuing a

15 decision unsupported by the findings, and issuing findings that are unsupported by the
SIONVYINVS 16 evidence.

17 62. Petitioners, YIMBY Members, and the public each have beneficial interests that

18 have been, and will further be, severely injured and adversely affected if the disapproval of the

20 Petitioners' interests include ensuring that Respondents comply with state laws that require the

21 approval of code-compliant housing development projects in order to address the housing

22 needs of San Francisco and California residents, and ensuring that Respondents' actions are in

23 conformity with the requirements of the HAA.

24 63. The HAA must be construed broadly and "consistent with, and in promotion of,

The HAA requires, inter alia: 27 64.

(A) The housing development project would have a specific, adverse impact upon the public health or safety unless the project is disapproved or approved upon the condition that the project be developed at a lower density. As used in this paragraph, a "specific,

(Gov. Code § 65589.5(j)(1).) 13
65. The HAA provides that a housing development project shall be: 14
deemed consistent, compliant, and in conformity with an applicable 15 plan, program, policy, ordinance, standard, requirement, or other
similar provision if there is substantial evidence that would allow a 16 reasonable person to conclude that the housing development project 17 is consistent, compliant, or in conformity.
18 (Gov. Code § 65889.5(f)(4))
19 66. The Project "complies with applicable, objective general plan, zoning, and
20 subdivision standards and criteria, including design review standards," required to qualify for
21 the requested land-use entitlements.
22 67. Even if there were any ambiguity regarding the applicability of the HAA to the
23 Project, the HAA directs that it must be construed broadly and "consistent with, and in

24 promotion of, the statewide goal of a sufficient supply of decent housing to meet the needs of
25 all Californians." (Gov. Code § 65589(d).) A broad interpretation of the HAA inexorably leads
26 to the conclusion that it applies to the Project.
27 68. Pursuant to the HAA, to "Disapprove the housing development project"
28 includes any instance in which a local agency votes on a a proposed housing development

r project application and the application is disapproved, including any required land use
2 approvals or entitlements necessary for the issuance of a building permit. (Gov. Code §

3 65589.5(h)(5).) Respondents have not proceeded in a manner required by law by effectively

4 denying a code-compliant housing development Project by voting to void the Planning
5 Commission's approval of the entitlements for the Project without making findings that the

6 Project would have a specific, adverse impact upon the public health or safety as required by

7 section 65589.5(j). In the context of the HAA, "specific, adverse impact" means "a significant,

8 quantifiable, direct, and unavoidable impact, based on objective, identified written public

9 health or safety standards, policies, or conditions as they existed on the date the application
10 was deemed complete."
601 MONTGOMERY STREET, SUITE 400 Dd 'NOSHALIVA Y NVWOTTHJ 'SXOVZ ILIFORNIA 94104 11 69. The Board failed to make any such finding, much less one based on "objective,
12 identified written public health or safety standards" or supported by a preponderance of the
13 evidence. Even if such a finding could be made, it would only justify denial of the Project if
14 the Board were to find there is "no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the
*ODSIONVI NVS 15 adverse impact ... other than the disapproval of the housing development." (Gov. Code §
16 65589.5(j)(1)(B).) The Board made no such finding, and nor could it.

17 70. Respondents' disapproval is not based on the required findings and, to the
18 degree Respondents attempted to make such findings, the findings are unsupported by evidence
in the record. Respondents disapproved the Project based solely on vague, unsubstantiated 19

20 concerns regarding the adequacy of the EIR that are not supported by any evidence in the
21 record. Respondents' actions are an abuse of the CEQA process and an attempt to avoid their
22 legal duty to approve a code-compliant housing development project. This is a prohibited basis
23 for the denial of a housing development project.

24 71. Pursuant to the HAA, to "Disapprove the housing development project" also
25 includes any instance in which a local agency fails to comply with the time periods specified in
26 subdivision (a) of Section 65950 of the PSA, which requires a local agency to take a final
27 action on a project within 120 days after certification of an EIR. (Gov. Code § 65589.5(h)(5).)
28 72. As explained above, the one-year CEQA deadline to certify an EIR, plus a 90-

5 markets in the United States. Petitioners further contend that Respondents' actions are intended

6 to evade their legal duties and deny Petitioners, YIMBY Members, and others similarly

7 situated their rights under SB 330, CEQA, the PSA, and the HAA.

8 80. Petitioners are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that Respondents

San Francisco, CA 94103

RE: San Francisco - Letter of Inquiry and Technical Support

Dear Kate Conner:

The purpose of this letter is to seek information on two projects - 469 Stevenson Street and 450-474 O'Farrell Street - and to provide technical assistance to the City and
County of San Francisco (City/County). The California Department of Housing and
Community Development (HCD) has become aware of the effective denial of these
housing projects, and HCD is concerned that the City/County's actions are indicative of
review processes that may be constraining the provision of housing in San Francisco. It is well known that California is experiencing a housing crisis, and the provision of housing remains of the utmost priority.

Project Descriptions

HCD understands the project proposed at 469 Stevenson Street is a mixed-use, 27-story 469 Stevenson Street

high rise with 495 housing units, including 19 percent (89) affordable units - 11 percent of the units at 50 percent area median income (AMI), 4 percent of the units at 80 percent AMI, and 4 percent of the units at 110 percent AMI. The Planning Commission certified the final environmental impact report (FEIR) for the project on July 29, 2021, finding expressly that the "FEIR was prepared, publicized, and reviewed" in a manner that was consistent with "CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines, and Chapter 31 of the San Francisco
Administrative Code" and that the FEIR is "adequate, accurate, and objective." In approving the project, the Planning Commission noted that the project would replace an underutilized site with high quality housing to a serve a range of housing needs in the
City/County in a manner that is consistent with the City/County's housing element and
housing need. Despite prior approval and findings made by the Planning Commission, the
Board of Supervisors (BOS) voted (8-3) on October 26, 2021, to overturn the Planning Commission's FEIR certification, and by extension approval of this critically needed

Kate Conner, Manager, Priority Projects and Process
Page 2

housing project in the City/County. The BOS cited various vague concerns about FEIR deficiencies, including seismic concerns, effects (e.g., shadowing) on historic resources,
and gentrification. It appears that the BOS has tasked city planners to prepare a new environmental study and recirculate the EIR or portions of the EIR. To date, no written findings have been published or provided to the project applicant nor has any substantial evidence in support of these findings been identified.

450-474 O'Farrell Street and 532 Jones Street
HCD understands the project proposed at 450-474 O'Farrell Street and 532 Jones Street (O'Farrell Project) is an amendment to a project approval obtained for this site in 2018. The envelope of the proposed building remains the same size and shape as the original
approved project; the amendment to the Conditional Use Authorization (CUA) is for a
reallocation of interior space. The original project included 176 housing units, and the proposed amendment includes 316 smaller housing units. The developer reports this model will yield more units that are "affordable by design" - in other words, not deed restricted, without need for any public financing, and available at naturally lower rents.
HCD understands that 13.5 percent of the units (43 units) will be offered "below market
rent" as required by the City/County. Despite prior approval by the Planning Commission,
the BOS voted (11-0) on October 5, 2021, to overturn the Planning Commission's
approval. To date, no written findings have been published nor provided to the
project applicant.
While these projects have sought different types of approval, they share the circumstance of having prior Planning Commission approvals of significant housing
projects being overturned by the BOS - without any documented findings. HCD is
concerned that this represents a larger trend in the City/County. As you know,
California's housing production does not meet housing need. In the past ten years,
housing production has averaged fewer than 80,000 new homes each year, far fewer
than the 180,000 new homes needed. (Housing Crisis Act, Stats. 2019, ch. 654, § 2.)
The Legislature has declared that housing availability is a priority a of the highest order and that local and state governments have a responsibility to facilitate the development of housing for all economic segments of the community. (Gov. Code, § 65580.) As a
result, the cost of housing has skyrocketed, and San Francisco stands amongst the top
two most expensive housing markets in the United States.

For this reason, HCD requests that the City/County provide the written findings to HCD
and each project applicant within 30 days, explaining the reasoning for and the evidence behind these decisions. While reasons for denial were discussed in public
hearings, it is unclear what actions these project applicants are required to take to advance these projects. In the meantime, 811 potential housing units are in limbo.

Kate Conner, Manager, Priority Projects and Process

Housing Crisis Act of 2019 - "5 Hearing Rule"

HCD is concerned about the significant delays in the approval of housing generally and
in the City/County in particular. As you know, the Housing Crisis Act of 2019 recognized
this as a concern and imposed a strict five-hearing rule for housing projects. (Gov. Code, § 65905.5.) Under that law, hearings include formal hearings, workshops, meetings, and continuances. (ld.at (a), (b)(2).)

Regarding the O'Farrell Project, the Planning Commission's report documents six hearings of the Planning Commission alone that meet this definition. The BOS appeal
would be the seventh such meeting. Because the City's record notes that, "like the previous project, the revised project would not be obviously or substantially inconsistent with other local plans and policies or regional plans and policies" (Second Addendum to Environmental Impact Report, p. 11), HCD is concerned that the City/County may have violated the "5 Hearing Rule" in the Housing Crisis Act of 2019. (Gov. Code, § 65905.5.)

Housing Accountability Act

For the same reasons, HCD has significant concerns about the City's compliance with the Housing Accountability Act (HAA). Under Government Code section 65589.5, subdivision (j), a local government cannot disapprove or reduce the density of a housing development project that complies with applicable, objective general plan, zoning, and subdivision standards and criteria, including design review standards, in effect at the time that the application was
deemed complete unless it makes written findings supported by a preponderance of the
evidence on the record that the project world have a specific, adverse impact upon the public health or safety and there is no feasible way to mitigate that impact. Disapproval means either the City/County votes on a proposed housing development project and the application is
disapproved or the City/County fails to comply with the decision-making time period outlined in
the Permit Streamlining Act. (Gov. Code, § 65950.) This includes denial of other required land use approvals or entitlements necessary for the issuance of a building permit. Regarding the O'Farrell Project, as noted above, while the BOS voted to disapprove the application, no written findings have yet to be made supporting that disapproval.
5th Cycle Housing Element
In the City/County's 5th Cycle Housing Element, the City/County committed to two key objectives with associated policies and programs. The Stevenson Project and O'Farrell
Project each represent an opportunity for the City/County to take consistent action with
its housing element commitments.

Below is an excerpt from the City/County's 5th Cycle Housing Element: Objective 4: Foster a Housing Stock that meets the needs of all residents across
lifecycles.
Policy 4.4: Encourage sufficient and suitable rental housing opportunities,
emphasizing permanently affordable rental units wherever possible.

Kate Conner, Manager, Priority Projects and Process
Page 4

The Stevenson Project includes 89 affordable units. Likewise, the O'Farrell Project commits 43 affordable units. The approval of these projects would demonstrate action consistent with Policy 4.4.
Below are additional excerpts from the City/County's 5th Cycle Housing Element: Objective 10: Ensure a streamlined, yet thorough, and transparent decision-making
process.
Policy 10.1: Create certainty in the development entitlement process, by
providing clear community parameters for development and consistent application of these regulations. Policy 10.2: Implement planning process improvements to both reduce undue project delays and provide clear information to support community review.
Policy 10.3: Use best practices to reduce excessive time or redundancy in
local application of CEQA. O Implementing Program 84: Planning shall continue to implement tools and processes that streamline CEQA compliance, thereby reducing the time required for production of environmental documents and CEQA
processes. In addition to contracting with previously established pools of qualified consultants to produce necessary technical studies (e.g., transportation) and environmental documents (e.g., EIRs), Planning will continue to implement streamlined processes, including but not limited to: Community Plan Exemptions that tier from previously certified Community Plan EIR's; participate in the preparation of Preliminary Project Assessments that outline the anticipated
requirements for CEQA compliance, including necessary technical studies; and implement recent and pending updates to the CEQA
Guidelines that provide mechanisms for streamlining the environmental
assessment of infill development projects.
Strategies for Further Review: Planning should continue to examine how zoning regulations can be clarified, and design guidelines developed through community planning processes. Planning staff should adhere to such controls in reviewing and recommending approval of projects.
Objective 10 and its associated policies and programs are critical for the development of housing. Developers and members of the public rely on transparent processing of projects. HCD will continue to monitor the Stevenson Project and its CEQA path forward, particularly for timeliness and redundancy of areas of study.
6th Cycle Housing Element
HCD understands that San Francisco is starting the process to update the 6th cycle housing element. Academic research continues to show that San Francisco's processing and entitlement timeframes and procedures exceed the norms for other jurisdictions of similar size and complexity and act as a constraint on the development

Kate Conner, Manager, Priority Projects and Process
Page 5

of housing'. As part of the housing element's analysis of potential and actual
governmental constraints on housing pursuant to Government Code section 65583, subdivision (a)(5), it must describe and analyze the permit process from application to approvals, including a discussion on timeframe for each step in the process,
impediments, and how it addresses state law application processing requirements such
as those found in the Permit Streamlining Act and the HAA. The element must also demonstrate local efforts to remove governmental constraints that hinder the locality
from meeting its share of the regional housing need and include program actions with metrics and milestones to remove or mitigate identified constraints.
HCD Inquiry

As stated above, HCD is concerned specifically that the Stevenson Project and
O'Farrell Project that have been effectively denied without written findings as well as
larger trends in the City/County's review of housing. HCD requests the City/County
provide written findings for these BOS actions.

HCD has both the authority and duty to review any action or failure to act by a city,
county, or city and county that it determines is inconsistent with an adopted housing element or Government Code section 65583 (Gov. Code, § 65585, subd. (i)) or in violation of the HAA. (Gov. Code, § 65585, subd. (j).) At this time, HCD's investigation remains open, and HCD is continuing its review of these particular actions and of the City/County's practices with respect to housing review and approval generally.

1 WHEREAS, The Project would require 55,850 cubic yards of excavation and Project

2 construction would span approximately 36 months; and

3 WHEREAS, The Project would use the State Density Bonus Program and provide 73

4 affordable housing units onsite; and

5 WHEREAS, Under the State Density Bonus Law, a housing development that includes

6 on-site affordable housing is entitled to additional density, concessions and incentives, and

7 waivers from development standards that might otherwise preclude the construction of the

8 project. Specifically, the Project sought a density bonus of 42.5% and invoked an

9 incentive/concession from Height (Section 250 of the Planning Code), and waivers of the

10 following development standards of the Code: 1) Maximum Floor Area Ratio (Section 123); 2)

11 Rear Yard (Section 134); 3) Common Useable Open Space (Section 135); 4) Dwelling Unit

12 Exposure (Section 140); 5) Ground-Level Wind Current (Section 148); and 6) Bulk (Section

13 270); and

14 WHEREAS, The Planning Department prepared an Initial Study, released on October

15 2, 2019, that concluded that the Project could result in potentially significant environmental

16 impacts related to air quality, wind, and shadow and that only those three topics would be

17 discussed further in an Environmental Impact Report (hereinafter "EIR") as required by the

18 California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code, Section 21000 et

19 seq., the CEQA Guidelines, 14 California Code of Regulations, Section 15000 et seq., and

20 San Francisco Administrative Code, Chapter 31; with respect to other topics, such as land use

21 and planning, population and housing, cultural resources, tribal cultural resources,

22 transportation and circulation, noise, greenhouse gas emissions, recreation, utilities and

23 service systems, public services, biological resources, geology and soils, hydrology and water

24 quality, hazards and hazardous materials, mineral resources, energy resources, agriculture

25 and forestry resources, and wildfire, the Initial Study determined the potential individual and

Clerk of the Board
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS Page 2

1 cumulative environmental effects would be less than significant, or reduced to less than

2 significant with mitigation measures, and therefore the EIR did not study these issues beyond

3 the initial review undertaken in the Initial Study; and

4 WHEREAS, The Draft EIR was published on March 11, 2020, and circulated to

5 governmental agencies and to interested organizations and individuals for a 60-day public

6 review period that began March 12, 2020, and concluded on May 11, 2020; and

7 WHEREAS, The Planning Commission held a virtual public hearing on the Draft EIR on

8 April 16, 2020; during their deliberations, Commissioners expressed concern about the size of

9 the Project and its potential impacts on historic resources and gentrification and displacement;

10 and

11 WHEREAS, The Planning Department prepared a Responses to Comments document

12 ("RTC") to respond to environmental issues raised in written comments received during the

13 public comment period and in writing or presented orally at the public hearing for the Draft

14 EIR, and published the RTC on May 26, 2021; and

15 WHEREAS, On July 29, 2021, the Planning Commission held a virtual public hearing to

16 consider the adequacy of the Final Environmental Impact Report ("Final EIR"); among other

17 issues, commenters noted the project's displacement impacts and significant adverse impacts

18 on adjacent historic resources such as the Mint Conservation District and the Filipino

19 Conservation District, not sufficiently acknowledged by the Final EIR; commissioners noted

20 that the RTC did not adequately address some of their previous questions, particularly about

21 the potentially incompatible scale of the proposed tower in a setting that is comprised of not

22 just simply one, but a number of historic districts; another issue discussed at the Commission

23 hearing was the failure of the Final EIR project description to describe the proposed Project

24 foundation; the Project sponsor testified that he did not know whether piers would be required,

25 that that decision would be made with the design of the foundation, which had not been

o1 Clerk of the Board
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS Page

1 completed to date. He added that the Project would either use piers or a mat, depending on

2 what is appropriate for the building; and

3 WHEREAS, By Motion No. 20963, on July 29, 2021, the Planning Commission certified

4 a Final Environmental Impact Report ("Final EIR") for the proposed Project, by a vote of 4-2;

5 and

6 WHEREAS, By letter to the Clerk of the Board, dated August 27, 2021, the Brandt-

7 Hawley Law Group, on behalf of the Yerba Buena Neighborhood Consortium ("Appellant"),

8 appealed the Final EIR certification; and

9 WHEREAS, The Planning Department's Environmental Review Officer, by

10 memorandum to the Clerk of the Board dated September 2, 2021, determined that the appeal

11 had been timely filed; and

12 WHEREAS, On October 26, 2021, this Board held a duly noticed public hearing to

13 consider the appeal of the Final EIR certification filed by Appellant; and,

14 WHEREAS, At the hearing, Appellant and members of the public presented evidence

15 and testimony that the Project may have significant impacts that were not adequately studied

16 in the Initial Study, the Draft EIR, or the Final EIR; these included the Project's potential

17 impacts on adjacent historical resources; geotechnical impacts of the Project foundation; and

18 physical impacts resulting from likely gentrification of the Project area and resulting

19 displacement of current residents; and

20 WHEREAS, At the hearing, during the public comment and this Board's questions to

21 the Appellant, the Project sponsor, and Planning Department staff, a majority of members of

22 this Board found that the EIR had treated these impact areas in a conclusory manner;

23 specifically, the Final EIR had concluded that there will be no significant impacts (therefore

24 failing to analyze the impacts or identify feasible mitigation measures and alternatives to those

25

Clerk of the Board
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS Page 4

1

2 impacts) but failed to provide substantial evidence or a reasoned explanation as to why that
conclusion was reached; and

3

4 WHEREAS, At the hearing, individual members of the Board of Supervisors:

5 Explained that despite evidence of potentially significant impacts identified by

6 qualified experts, some areas of potentially significant environmental impact were

7 addressed only in the Initial Study, and were not further analyzed in the EIR, and

8 were not mitigated as required by CEQA, including: (1) impacts relating to adjacent

co historical resources and districts, despite the recognition of the Planning

10 Department that the Project may have an impact on the setting for those districts;

11 (2) geotechnical impacts that should have received further EIR analysis for the

12 benefit of decisionmakers; and (3) physical impacts resulting from potential

13 gentrification of the Project area and displacement of current residents, and an

14 inadequate range of reasonably feasible mitigation measures and alternatives to
avoid or reduce those impacts; and

15

16 Provided detailed comments objecting to the lack of objective analysis in the EIR of

17 gentrification and displacement that would result from the large number of market-

18 rate units proposed in the Project, noting concerns with the credibility of the

19 research provided in a report relied upon by the Planning Department in the

20 absence of further analysis in the EIR, and explained that the EIR's lack of analysis

21 to determine whether the Project would result in gentrification and displacement

22 prevented adequate analysis of the significance of foreseeable physical impacts
resulting from those socio-economic impacts; and

23

24 Expressed the opinion that the analysis of housing impacts based on displacement
was inadequate; and

25

Clerk of the Board
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS Page

Expressed the opinion that the Planning Department's approach to cumulative

2 impacts of gentrification was fundamentally flawed, and that gentrification and

3 displacement impacts should be considered in a holistic, thorough manner; and

4 Stated there is no question that the Project will cause significant displacement on

5 the 6th Street corridor, Filipino community, and the broader low-income community;

6 and

7 Stated that surrounding taller buildings do impact historic districts; and

8 WHEREAS, With regards to historic resources, the Initial Study acknowledged that the

9 Project would include the construction of a building that is a directly adjacent to the National

10 Register-eligible Market Street Theatre and Loft Historic District, National and California-

11 Register eligible Sixth Street Lodging House Historic District, and the Mint-Mission article 11

12 Conservation District, and a property within the Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) City Beautiful

13 Substations Discontinuous Thematic Historic District; however, the EIR included no further

14 analysis of the impacts of the 27-story Project on adjacent historic districts as required by

15 CEQA, in light of substantial record evidence of potentially significant impacts; absent that

16 analysis, the Final EIR's conclusions that the Project's setbacks would avoid significant

17 impacts on adjacent districts were premature and were inadequately supported by evidence;

18 and

19 WHEREAS, In the area of geotechnical impacts, the EIR did not conduct adequate

20 analysis, as the Initial Study concluded that the Project would not result in any impacts to

21 geology and soils and relied on future compliance with the California and San Francisco

22 Building Codes as a basis to reach its conclusion; CEQA requires that the EIR analyze and

23 determine whether the Project would have significant geotechnical impacts, beyond those

24 conclusory statements; and

25

Clerk of the Board
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS Page 6

WHEREAS, The Project's physical effects relating to gentrification of the surrounding

2 area and displacement of current residents were not studied in the EIR; the Final EIR (in the

3 RTC) acknowledged that these socio-economic effects, in themselves, are not considered

4 environmental impacts under CEQA, absent a related physical change in the environment.

5 The Final EIR noted that "some displacement may occur," but without benefit of study or

6 explanation, concluded that "the proposed project is not likely to result in residential

7 displacement and gentrification" and therefore improperly dismissed any potential physical

8 environmental impacts that may result from gentrification or displacement; and

9 WHEREAS, In reviewing the appeal of the Final EIR certification, this Board reviewed

10 and considered the Final EIR, including the Draft EIR and the RTC, the appeal letter, the

11 responses to the appeal documents that the Planning Department prepared, the other written

12 records before the Board of Supervisors and the Planning Commission and all of the public

13 testimony made in support of and opposed to the Project and the appeal; and

14 WHEREAS, The purpose of CEQA is to inform the public and decision-makers of the

15 environmental consequences of projects, before those projects are approved; and

16 WHEREAS, Following the public hearing, in Motion No. M21-146 (File No. 210921), the

17 Board of Supervisors conditionally reversed the Final EIR certification, subject to the adoption

18 of written findings in support of such determination based on the written record before the

19 Board of Supervisors as well as all of the testimony at the public hearing in support of and

20 opposed to the appeal; and

21 WHEREAS, The written record and oral testimony in support of and opposed to the

22 appeal and deliberation of the oral and written testimony at the public hearing before the

23 Board of Supervisors by all parties and the public in support of and opposed to the appeal is

24 in the Clerk of the Board of Supervisors File No. 210919 and is incorporated in this motion as

MOVED, That this Board of Supervisors finds that the Final EIR contains inadequate

2 analysis and information regarding potential impacts to historic resources; potential

3 geotechnical impacts resulting from construction of the Project; potential physical impacts

4 resulting from gentrification and displacement of local residents; and potentially feasible

5 mitigation measures and alternatives to address significant impacts in those impact areas, all

6 of which were either improperly and prematurely scoped out of the EIR and studied only in the

7 Initial Study, or studied in the EIR with insufficient analysis and evidence; and, be it

8 FURTHER MOVED, That based on the above findings this Board finds that the Final

9 EIR does not comply with CEQA, because it is not sufficient as an informational document;

10 and be it

11 FURTHER MOVED, That this Board reverses the EIR Certification by the Planning

12 Commission; and, be it

13 FURTHER MOVED, That this Board finds that as to all other topics studied in the final

14 EIR, that document complies with CEQA; is adequate, accurate and objective; is sufficient as

15 an informational document; its conclusions are correct; and it reflects the independent

16 judgment of the City; and, be it

17 FURTHER MOVED, That this Board remands the Final EIR to the Planning

18 Department to undertake further environmental review of the Project consistent with this

19 Motion, before further consideration of EIR Certification and any Project approvals.
