Architectural Preservation Foundation of CCC et al. Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 Petitioners Architectural Preservation Foundation of Contra Costa County

2 (APFCCC), Cheryll Grover, and Harlan Strickland, (hereinafter, Petitioners) allege:
3
1. The Contra Costa County Board of Supervisors through the Department of 4
Conservation and Development (County) filed a Notice of Exemption under the

6 California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) on September 9, 2021, for a project to
7 construct a new County office building, and demolish the old County administration 8
Granite Jail in downtown 9 building, and remove all elements of the historic 1903

10 Martinez. The stated purpose of the project is "to construct a new County Office

11 building" however the project approved involves demolition of two buildings (651 Pine
12 Street and the 1903 Granite Jailhouse) the construction of a New County Office 13
14 building, street closures, and construction of a "plaza" to integrate the redeveloped

15 Civic Center to include the new County Administration Building at 1039 Escobar Street,
16 Martinez, California.
17
2.
18 The County employed a shell game of multiple "Notices of Exemption" and

19 relied on an outdated narrowly focused EIR to avoid public notice and comment, and
20 circumvent CEQA requirements to review impacts of the whole Civic Center project,
21 including cumulative impacts. This is a classic case of piecemealing to avoid the 22

23 requirements of CEQA. The whole project is a new County Civic Center that the

24 County as undertaken in stages over the past four years, without compliance with

25 CEQA. The County identified the most recent phase of the Civic Center project in the
26

27 Notice of Exemption as "Redevelopment of 651 Pine Street WO#0969, CP#21-10."

28 3. The County Civic Center project involves demolishing the 1903 Granite

Architectural Preservation Foundation of CCC et al. Petition for Writ of Mandate 1

1 Jail, demolishing the "old County Administration building" constructing a "new County

2 administration building," constructing a new County Office building, creating
3

4 additional parking, and constructing a Civic Center plaza. The Civic Center project has

5 been on the county drawing boards, and in County budgets for at least 5 years and was

6 first identified as a County priority in 1999.

7
4. The 1903 Granite Jailhouse is an integral element of the historic Contra
8

9 Costa County Courthouse Block, and an historic resource of national, state and local

10 significance. In 1989, the Contra Costa County Courthouse Block was accepted for

11 listing on the National Register of Historic Places. The Courthouse Block is the entire
12 block bounded by Court, Main, Pine and Escobar Streets, and includes three elements: 13

14 (1) the Contra Costa County "Granite Jailhouse" built in 1903; (2) the Contra Costa

15 County Courthouse built in 1901 (now known as the "County Finance Building"); and

16 (3) a low granite retaining wall and curbing that encircles much of the property,
17

18 characterized by long rectangular spans of rough textured granite, punctuated by

19 square block posts with pyramidal tops.

20 5โข These historic resources, in their entirety, were listed on the National
21 Register of Historic Places because they represent the early center of government for 22

23 Contra Costa County, and are examples of classically-inspired early 20th century public

24 buildings. The 1903 Granite Jailhouse and Courthouse Block are also listed on the

25 California Register of Historical Resources, Contra Costa County Historic Resource
26 Inventory, the City of Martinez Historic Resource Inventory and are prominent features 27

28 of the Downtown Martinez Historic District.

Architectural Preservation Foundation of CCC et al. Petition for Writ of Mandate 2

1 6. The County's action will result in the destruction of historic resources, and

2 the emplacement of a modern Civic Center antithetical to the "Historic Downtown
3 Martinez" motif that is central to the City of Martinez' character, history, citizens and 4

businesses. The Petitioners bring this action in the public interest because, in

6 evaluating and approving the Redevelopment of 651 Pine Street Redevelopment and the
7 Civic Center project, the County violated the mandates of state law, local ordinances,
8

9 and due process. This mandamus action is necessary because CEQA is citizen-

10 enforced. The Petitioners seek this Court's judgment and peremptory writ to enforce

11 CEQA, enforce County ordinances and City of Martinez ordinances to protect and
12 preserve the 1903 Granite Jailhouse and the Courthouse Block, to conduct an and 13

14 adequate CEQA review of the county administration building construction and

15 concurrent demolition, the demolition of the 1903 Granite Jailhouse and Annex, the

16 construction of parking structures, and the creation of a Civic Center plaza, and to
17

18 require due process of law upon remand to the County.

19 Jurisdiction and Venue

20 7. This Court has jurisdiction under Public Resources Code section 21168,
21

22 and Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5. Venue is proper in Contra Costa County

23 because all parties, the county facilities at issue, and the historic resources at issue are

24 located there. This action was timely filed within 35 days of the County's Notice of
25 Exemption filed pursuant to CEQA and the Amended Petition is being filed at the 26

27 request of the County.

28 8. Petitioners provided written notice of their intention to file this petition to

Architectural Preservation Foundation of CCC et al. Petition for Writ of Mandate 3

1 the Contra Costa County Board of Supervisors pursuant to Public Resources Code

2 section 21167.5 on October 6, 2021.
3
9. Petitioners will serve the Attorney General with a copy of their Verified 4

Amended Petition along with a notice of its filing in compliance with Public Resources
Code section 21167.7, within ten days and will submit proof of service within 10 days.
7
10. Petitioners do not have a plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law because
8

9 Petitioners and their members will be irreparably harmed by the County's failure to

10 conduct environmental review as required by CEQA before approving the

11 "Redevelopment of 651 Pine Street", constructing a new Administration building, and
12 by the destruction of historic resources caused by the demolition. Issuance of a 13

14 peremptory writ is needed to avoid severe and irreparable harm to Petitioners without

15 compliance with the mandates of local and state environmental laws and due process.
16 The County has the capacity to correct its violations of law but refuses to do so.
17
11. Petitioners have exhausted their administrative remedies and have 18

19 continued to bring their concerns about the entire Civic Center project, the

20 Redevelopment of 651 Pine Street, and demolition of the 1903 Granite Jailhouse to the
21 County staff and County Board of Supervisors since 2015.
22

23 12. Petitioners have an interest in having CEQA executed and Respondents'

24 public duties enforced, so as to ensure that Respondents do not impair or defeat the

25 purpose of the legislation establishing their public rights
26
13. As set forth in this Petition, Respondents have present legal duties, and the 27

28 present ability to perform those duties, pursuant to CEQA. Respondents have failed

Architectural Preservation Foundation of CCC et al. Petition for Writ of Mandate 4

1 and/or refused to perform those duties. In addition, or in the alternative, Respondents

2 have abused their discretion in performing those duties. Petitioners have a clear,
3
present, and legal right to Respondents' performance of these duties. 4

14. Petitioners complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code

6 section 21167.6 by concurrently filing a notice of election to prepare the record of

7 administrative proceedings relating to this action on October 8, 2021.
8

9 Parties

10 15. The Architectural Preservation Foundation of Contra Costa County
11 (APFCCC) is a California non-profit organization formed in 2016, with an office in 12

13 Martinez, California. The APFCCC organization is committed to the preservation and

14 enhancement of Contra Costa County's unique character and quality of life and the

15 promotion of awareness and appreciation of Contra Costa County's historic, and
16 aesthetic resources. The APFCCC works for the preservation and sensitive adaptive 17

18 reuse of Contra Costa County's significant structures, landmark buildings, and notable
19 landscapes. The APFCCC acts as a liaison between historical societies and Contra Costa

20 County and its city governments, with a focus on buildings of true historic, social and
21

22 community value.

23 The APFCCC is composed of community residents and concerned citizens who

24 personally enjoy and appreciate the historic and cultural importance of buildings and
25 property in Contra Costa County, including the historic 1903 Granite Jailhouse, 26

27 Courthouse Block, and Historic Downtown Martinez. APFCCC is also concerned with

28 impacts to air quality, biological resources, circulation and traffic, downtown Martinez

Architectural Preservation Foundation of CCC et al. Petition for Writ of Mandate 5

1 businesses and neighborhoods. The APFCCC brings this petition on behalf of all others

2 similarly situated that are too numerous to be named and brought before this Court as
3
petitioners. APFCCC representatives exhausted administrative remedies and sought 4

settlement of the disputes here raised.
Currently, APFCCC is representing itself in this matter as it has a First

7 Amendment right to petition the government in a court of law as recognized in the case
8

9 of City of Long Beach v. Bozek' (holding that the right to petition includes an absolute

10 privilege to file a lawsuit against a government entity) and the case of Citizens United v.

11 Federal Election Commission 2 (recognizing the First Amendment right of corporations
12 to free speech and holding the government may not suppress speech based on the 13

14 speaker's corporate identity.) APFCCC had a specific time limit within which to file this

15 CEQA lawsuit (35 days) and was unable to secure counsel in that limited time frame.

16 Had APFCCC not filed, it would have lost its right to petition the government.
17
16.
18 Petitioner Harlan Strickland is a resident of Martinez, and is a member of

19 the APFCCC Board of Directors, with a concrete a and particularized interest in the
20 preservation of historic structures, the health and safety of residents and businesses in
21 downtown Martinez, and in preservation of the 1903 Granite Jailhouse and Courthouse
22

23 Block. He has exhausted his administrative remedies.

24 17. Petitioner Cheryll Grover is a resident of Martinez and is a member of the

25 APFCCC Board of Directors, with a concrete and particularized interest in the

10 project sponsor is the County Department of Public Works.

11 20. Respondent Contra Costa County Board of Supervisors acted as the agency
12 that approved the Redevelopment of 651 Pine Street (WO#0969, CP#21-10), the 13

14 approval of the demolition of the 1903 Granite Jailhouse (WO 5885 CP#13-28; SCH

23 General Allegations

24 22. The paragraphs below refer to and rely on information in documents
25 relating to this action that will be filed with this Court as part of the record of
26

27 proceedings and that are here incorporated by reference.

Architectural Preservation Foundation of CCC et al. Petition for Writ of Mandate 7

STATEMENT OF FACTS

2 Statutory and Regulatory Framework

23. CEQA is designed to ensure that the long-term protection of the

4 environment be the guiding criterion in public decisions. CEQA's purpose is to 5

6 "[e]nsure that the long-term protection of the environment, consistent with the

7 provision of a decent home and suitable living environment for every Californian, shall

8 be the guiding criterion in public decisions." (Pub. Resources Code ยงยง 21001(d),
9 21000(g).) Historical resources are considered part of the environment and a project 10

11 that may cause a substantial adverse effect on the significance of a historical resource is

12 a project that may have a significant effect on the environment. (Id. ยง 21084.1.)

13 24. CEQA requires that the government "[d]evelop and maintain a high-quality
14

15 environment now and in the future," and "[t]ake all action necessary to protect,

16 rehabilitate, and enhance the environmental quality of the state," (Id. ยง 21001 (a).)

17 25. To meaningfully achieve that end, CEQA compels public agencies to
18 consider and disclose to the public the environmental impacts of their actions in 19

20 approving projects. It requires informed and public participation in environmental

21 decision-making and planning processes. (Cal. Code Regs, tit. 14, ยงยง 15000, et seq.

22 ("CEQA Guidelines"), ยง 15151.)
23
26.
24 Environmental review should be conducted "as early as feasible. . . to

25 enable environmental considerations to influence project program and design and yet

26 late enough to provide meaningful information for environmental assessment." (CEQA

27 Guidelines ยง 15004(b).) Agencies are prohibited from taking actions "concerning the 28

Architectural Preservation Foundation of CCC et al. Petition for Writ of Mandate 8

1 proposed public project that would have significant adverse effect or limit the choice of

2 alternatives or mitigation measures, before completion of CEQA compliance." (Id. ยง

15004(b)(2).)
4

5 27. Public agencies are prohibited from approving projects that would result in

6 one or more significant effects on the environment unless changes or alterations to the
7 project will altogether avoid their significant effects, or reduce them to a level of
8

9 insignificance. (Pub. Resources Code ยงยง 21081, 21002.)

10 28. A Notice of Exemption under CEQA Guidelines ยง15332 (the urban infill

11 exemption) must meet five conditions: (a) consistency with the applicable general plan
12 designation and applicable general plan policies and zoning; (b) have a project site of no 13

14 5 more than 5 aces within the city; (c) has no value as habitat for endangered, rare or

15 threatened species; (d) approval of which would not result in any significant impacts

16 relating to traffic, noise, air quality or water quality; and (e) the site can be adequately
17

18 served by public services. (CEQA Guidelines, ยง 15332.)

19 29. The categorical exemption cannot be used for an activity where there is a

20 reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the environment
21 due to unusual circumstances. (CEQA Guidelines 15300.2(c).) Nor can it be used when 22

23 the cumulative impact of successive projects of the same type in the same place over

24 time is significant, (CEQA Guidelines 15300.2(b), or for a project that may cause a

25 substantial adverse change in the significance of a historical resource. (CEQA
26
Guidelines 15300.2(f).)
27

28 30. If the County is presented with a fair argument that a project may have a

Architectural Preservation Foundation of CCC et al. Petition for Writ of Mandate 9

1 significant effect on the environment, the County is required to prepare and EIR, even

2 though it may also be presented with other substantial evidence that the project will not
3
have a significant effect. The County is supposed to inquire, as a matter of law, whether 4

5 the record reveals a fair argument. If there is any reasonable possibility that a project

6 or activity may have a significant effect on the environment, then the urban infill

7 exemption is improper.
8

9 31. Thus, CEQA establishes both procedural obligations to make an initial
10 determination of whether the Project is exempt from CEQA, to determine whether any

11 exception applies, and if so, to analyze and make public adverse environmental effects,
12
as well as a substantive obligation to mitigate significant impacts or deny a project. 13

14 Environmental Setting and Historic Designations

15 32. Through its long history, the 1901 Contra Cost County Courthouse and
16 1903 Granite Jailhouse complex has served first as the major county government 17

18 headquarters and, in later years, as offices for the important financial functions of the

19 county. These were the first buildings in a governmental complex that has given the

20 community of Martinez a handsome, historic and economically advantageous civic
21
center. The courthouse and jail were very early examples of the Classical Revival in 22

23 Contra Costa County, and they illustrate the important associative qualities of stylistic

24 revivals. In the late 19th and early 20th century, classical styles were chosen because
25 they were easily recognizable and understandable. Roman architecture stood for justice 26

27 and Greek architecture for government. Classical buildings told a story and upheld a

28 moral and were, therefore, ideal for representing the growing confidence in the county

Architectural Preservation Foundation of CCC et al. Petition for Writ of Mandate 10

seat. The 1903 Granite Jailhouse is also historically significant based on its association
with Sheriff Robert Raines Veale, who was an influential public figure and who served

4 as Contra Costa County Sheriff for 40 years (1894-1935) and whose life's work is closely

5 associated with the 1903 Granite Jailhouse. It is significant because of its association

6 with one of the most prominent architects in the history of California, William Mooser
7 II.

8

9 33. In 1944, an annex was added to the 1903 Jailhouse to expand the Jailhouse

10 capacity to accommodate the County's population growth. The 1903 Jailhouse and the

11 1944 Annex held prisoners until the Contra Costa County Detention Facility was
12 completed in 1981. For the past 40 years, the 1903 Jailhouse and 1944 Annex have 13

14 been allowed to fall into disrepair, and have been used only intermittently for file

15 storage.

16 34. The Contra Costa County Historical Landmarks Advisory Committee, as
17

18 advisor to the Board of Supervisors on matters of historic significance, identified the

19 1903 Granite Jailhouse on the County's Historic Lands Inventory. The County General

20 Plan Historic and Cultural Resources goal is to identify and preserve important historic
21 resources within the County, and the County General Plan's mandatory language 22

23 requires that areas which have historical significance shall be preserved for such

24 historic uses. (Contra Costa County General Plan Open Space Element, Historic and

25 Cultural Resource Policies 9-32) (emphasis added.)
26
35. In addition, the Contra Costa County General Plan element includes a 27

28 policy to "coordinate effectively the land use policies of the County within the County

Architectural Preservation Foundation of CCC et al. Petition for Writ of Mandate 11

1 General Plan with those plans adopted by the cities." (County General Plan Land Use
Element, Chapter 3, ยง3-I.). The applicable city plans and policies are contained in the
3

4 City of Martinez Downtown Specific Plan and Historic Overlay District. The Martinez

5 Downtown Specific Plan identifies the 1903 Granite Jailhouse in its designation of

6 historic resources, and establishes mandatory preservation of buildings listed on the

7 National Register of Historic Places, such as the 1903 Jailhouse. Under those
8

9 provisions, no building more than 50 years old may be demolished before first

10 investigating all feasible methods of re-using the structure. (Martinez Downtown

11 Specific Plan, Chapter 6, ยง6.1.4.)
12 Planning, Environmental Review, and Approval Process 13

14 36. The County's plan to construct a new County Administration building and

15 demolish the 1903 Jail surfaced as early as 2000. The County's 1999-2000 Capital
16 Facilities Master Plan identified the demolition of the "old jail" and replacement of the 17

18 County Administration Building as unfunded capital projects. In 2013, the County

19 began exploring whether it was necessary to remove asbestos from the jail. In 2014, the

20 County considered options for the jail demolition and the replacement of the County
21

22 Administration building. The two building sites-the 1903 Jail and County

23 Administration building-are located in close proximity, across the street from one

24 another at 650 and 651 Pine Street, respectively.

25
37. In early 2015, the County began to develop a project description for the 26

27 1903 Granite Jailhouse demolition. The County considered a project description that

28 included consideration of the jail site for future construction on the site of an

Architectural Preservation Foundation of CCC et al. Petition for Writ of Mandate 12

1 administration building that would house Board of Supervisors' chambers, and offices

2 for Board members, staff, and the Clerk of the Board. This concept was captured in
3

4 the Draft EIR as one of the Downtown Martinez Jail Demolition Project objectives:

5 "Promote future development of required space for County government administrative

6 uses.

7 38. The County proceeded simultaneously on parallel tracks from 2015-2017 to
8
(1) demolish the 9 1903 Granite Jailhouse and (2) replace the nearby County
10 Administration building that housed the Board of Supervisors chambers, staff and

11 offices. The existing County Administration building was determined to be functionally
12 obsolete and not economically feasible to renovate. The County's vision was for a 13

14 revitalized Civic Center and a new county administration building in downtown

15 Martinez.

16 39. The County's Notice of Preparation an EIR for the Downtown Martinez Jail
17

18 Demolition Project was issued on November 2, 2015 and a scoping meeting was held

19 November 16, 2015. The Draft EIR for the 1903 Granite Jailhouse demolition was

20 released on March 29, 2016 and the Final EIR was published on April 13, 2017.
21
40. Simultaneously, the County Administration project to construct a new 22

23 County Administration building to replace the existing "old" County Administration

24 building at 651 Pine Street, then abate, dismantle and demolish the old County

25 Administration Building was undertaken. A new parking structure northeast of the old
26

27 County Administration building was also proposed. On February 7, 2017, the County

28 authorized contracts for construction of a new County Administration Building and

Architectural Preservation Foundation of CCC et al. Petition for Writ of Mandate 13

1 parking structure and subsequently prepared a Notice of Exemption (NOE) approved

2 on September 15, 2017 under CEQA Guideline 15332: (a) consistency with the
3

4 applicable general plan designation and applicable general plan policies and zoning; (b)
a project site of no more than 5 aces in with city; (c) a project with no value as habitat

6 for endangered, rare or threatened species; (d) a project, the approval of which would
7 not result in any significant impacts relating to traffic, noise, air quality or water
8

9 quality. On information and belief, the NOE for the new County Administration

10 Building was not publicly noticed or filed with the State Clearinghouse (SCH).

11 41. The 1903 Granite Jailhouse draft EIR identified the goal of the project as
12 "to help form a well-planned functional civic center in Downtown Martinez" with five 13

14 objectives: (1) to reduce hazards posed by the existence of an unoccupied contaminated

15 building; (2) meet near-term parking needs; (3) implement policies of the Martinez
16 General Plan, the Martinez Downtown Specific Plan, and the Contra Costa County
17

18 General Plan for the civic portion of downtown Martinez; (4) facilitate future
19 development of required space for County government administrative uses, and (5)

20 allow for compatible and functional structures in and land uses in the civic center area.
21
42. The 1903 Granite Jailhouse EIR determined that demolition of the 1903 22

23 Jailhouse would undermine the justification for inclusion of the jailhouse in the

24 National Register of Historic Places, disrupt the Courthouse Block and would cause a

25 substantial adverse change in the significance of this historical resource. The EIR
26

27 proposed mitigation measures including: Mitigation Measure CUL-1: to survey and

28 memorialize the 1903 Jailhouse building with photographs, written descriptions prior

Architectural Preservation Foundation of CCC et al. Petition for Writ of Mandate 14

1 to demolition, and Mitigation measure CUL-2: to the extent feasible, reuse materials

2 from the building in parks and public facilities. Mitigation Measure CUL-1 was
3 inconsistent with the EIR's Historic Resources Report finding that "[g]enerally the use 4

5 of drawings, photographs, and displays does not mitigate the physical impact on the

6 environment caused by demolition or destruction of an architectural resource."

7
43. Identification of historic properties is essential for a proper analysis of a
project. [CEQA Guidelines ยง 15064.5]. The 1903 Jailhouse demolition EIR indicated

10 that it analyzed all historic properties at the Project site and "within .25-mile radius

11 around the project site." The EIR identified six historic resources within this area, and
12

13 indicated that none of these was on the National Register of Historic Places, except the

14 1903 Granite Jailhouse. However, the EIR analysis omitted any mention of four other

15 properties located within .25 miles of the demolition site and that are on the National

16 Register of Historic Places including:
17

18 725 Court Street - Wakefield Taylor Courthouse/former Contra Costa County

19 Hall of Records built in 1932) NPS-91001385-0000;

20 โข 1005 Escobar Street Borland Home built in 1890 and listed April 2, 2015 in
21 the National Register of Historic Places as the first property of the Multiple 22

23 Property Submission "Historic Resources of Martinez, California." NPS-

24 15000120-0000;.

25 740 Court Street - Contra Costa County Library, Martinez Branch built in 1941.
26

27 NPS-07001467-0000;

Architectural Preservation Foundation of CCC et al. Petition for Writ of Mandate 15

1 0000.

2 The EIR also failed to mention other State and locally-recognized historic
3 properties in the area, and the existence of the Multiple Property Submission (MPS), 4

accepted by the National Register of Historic Places. The MPS identified the "Historic
Resources of Martinez" with significance for their association with events and persons

7 locally significant in the areas of community development, economic development,
8

9 commerce, agriculture, and associations with historically significant ethnic groups that

10 settled in and around Martinez and contributed significantly to the development of

11 Downtown Martinez.

12
44. The EIR indicated that no economic studies had been prepared regarding 13

14 the economic feasibility of selected alternatives. Yet, the County Findings listed

15 overriding considerations based upon "conceptual level [economic] estimates" that

16 were provided to the County after the close of the public comment period. The County
17

18 used those economic estimates to support a conclusion that, in economic terms, the cost

19 of the demolition would be the least expensive, and would override the significant

20 adverse impact of Jail demolition on historic resources. The economic information was

21 not circulated to the public, and was only released a few days before the Board of 22

23 Supervisors' action to certify the EIR.

24 45. The Jailhouse Demolition EIR identified a "near-term parking need" as a

25 Project objective, indicating that demolition for the proposed parking lot "would serve
26 some of the parking demand from the adjacent County buildings and would be 27

28 restricted to County employees only." No analysis of the near-term needs or demand

Architectural Preservation Foundation of CCC et al. Petition for Writ of Mandate 16

1 was provided in the Jailhouse Demolition EIR. In response to comments questioning

2 the need or demand for 13-18 parking spaces, the EIR stated "Meeting near-term

4 parking needs is only one of the project objectives" and provided no further information

5 on parking need or demand. The Jailhouse Demolition EIR did not address the

6 parking studies or needs that the County was simultaneously evaluating for the new
7 County Administration building and Civic Center projects.
8

9 46. The Jailhouse Demolition EIR identified "reduction of hazards posed by

10 the existence of an unoccupied contaminated building" as a Project objective. The EIR

11 stated that asbestos was detected in some samples within "the building" but did not
12 identify whether those samples were taken from the 1903 Jailhouse or the 1944 Annex. 13

14 The EIR did not indicate whether the amount of asbestos was at a hazardous level or

15 whether demolition would potentially release hazardous levels affecting air quality. The
16 EIR stated that it was assumed that the building contained lead-based paint and
17

18 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) because of the age of the building, but again, there

19 was no information on whether the materials were actually present, in what quantities,

20 or in which of the buildings (the 1903 Jail or the 1944 Annex). There was no analysis of
21 the specific costs of reducing the hazards of the 1903 Jailhouse or the 1944 Annex by 22

23 removal or abatement. There was no analysis of the abatement, dismantling or

24 demolition of the old Administration building which is located across the street from

25 the 1903 Granite Jailhouse, which contains lead-based paint, asbestos and PCBs in far
26
greater concentrations than the 1903 Granite Jailhouse, nor of the cumulative impacts 27

28 from simultaneously abatement of toxics in both buildings.

Architectural Preservation Foundation of CCC et al. Petition for Writ of Mandate 17

1 47. The Jailhouse Demolition EIR identified "implementation of policies of the

2 Martinez General Plan, the Martinez Downtown Specific Plan, and the Contra Costa
3
County General Plan for the civic portion of downtown Martinez" as another of the 4

5 Project objectives. The Jailhouse Demolition EIR inconsistently asserted that, with

6 respect to City of Martinez policies this objective would not be met "because the Project
7 site is on County-owned property, the Project would not be required to comply with the
8

9 City's policies and regulations." There was no explanation for this inconsistency

10 between the objective, and the County's decision not to comply with City plans. Nor did

11 the EIR address the County General Plan Land Use Element, Chapter 3, ยง3-I which
12 requires that the County "coordinate effectively the land use policies of the County 13

14 within the County General Plan with those plans adopted by the cities". The EIR also

15 did not address the County General Plan's mandatory language requiring that areas

16 which have historical significance shall be preserved for such historic uses. (Contra
17

18 Costa County General Plan Open Space Element, Historic and Cultural Resource

19 Policies 9-32.)

20 48. The Jailhouse Demolition EIR identified the Project objective to "allow for
21 compatible and functional structures and land uses in the civic center area." There was
22

23 no mention that the County was concurrently planning to construct a new

24 Administration building immediately northeast of the 1903 Granite Jailhouse. The EIR

25 Findings concluded that Alternative (No Project) would not allow for compatible and
26 functional structures. The EIR Findings also concluded that under both Alternatives 2 27

28 and 3 (adaptive reuse alternatives) the building of compatible and functional structures

Architectural Preservation Foundation of CCC et al. Petition for Writ of Mandate 18

1 in the civic center area would be "substantially limited." Therefore, the Findings

2 concluded that this objective would not likely be met under any of the alternatives.
3
49.
4 Before certifying the EIR in April 2017, the County received new
information on proposed designs and locations of a new Administration building. The

6 County also took official action to approve new Administration building and 5-year
7 Capital Facilities Plan policies, including conceptual designs that identified the 1903
8

9 Jailhouse and surrounding area.

10 50. The final EIR deleted the objective "Facilitate future development of

11 required space for County government administrative uses." The final EIR explained
12 that conceptual plans had been developed for County government buildings, including a 13

14 new Administration building, and the conceptual plans would either allow the 1903

15 Granite Jailhouse to remain as part of the civic center area "should an interested party
16 present a viable reuse of the structure" or, if the jail is demolished, the County would
17

18 use the former jail site for County administrative functions. There is no analysis in the

19 draft or final EIR of the Civic Center revitalization project, or of the new Administration

20 building project's potential impacts, nor any analysis of the cumulative impacts of both
21 projects. The EIR analysis focused exclusively on the demolition of the 1903 Jailhouse, 22

23 and provided no information on what a "viable reuse of the structure" would be, or how

24 the County would make a determination of viability.

25 51. On April 25, 2017, the County Board of Supervisors (1) approved the
26 Downtown Martinez Jail Demolition project; (2) authorized the County staff to proceed 27

28 with demolition of the 1944 Annex (including the granite curbing/walls); (3) committed

Architectural Preservation Foundation of CCC et al. Petition for Writ of Mandate 19

1 to the temporary preservation of the original 1903 Jailhouse for a minimum of two
years; (4) certified the EIR; (5) adopted Findings including a Statement of Overriding
3
Considerations.
4

5 52. The County issued a Notice of Determination on April 27, 2017. On

6 December 4, 2018, the Board of Supervisors committed to preserve the 1903 Granite

7 Jailhouse through April 30, 2021 because "County staff has been evaluating options for 8

9 possible reuse of the 1903 portion of the jail. Staff has been negotiating with the City of

10 Martinez regarding possible transfer of the 1903 portion of the jail to the City."

11 53. In March 2018 the County modified the plans for new County
12 Administration building and decided to change the location of the proposed parking 13

14 structure and instead to improve the surface parking structure to the northeast of the

15 old County administration building and add a deck to the existing parking lot near the
16 County Detention Center approximately ยผ mile away from the new Administration
17

18 Building. Due to its larger size, the project was estimated to generate additional daily

19 trips, and disrupt traffic flows on area roadways, disrupt the existing parking supply,

20 generate noise, and fugitive dust and disrupt nearby neighborhoods. In April 2018 the
21 County prepared a second NOE for the for a "two level parking structure and public 22

23 plaza on the site of the existing (old) County Administration Building and associated

24 surface parking lot." On information and belief, as with the first NOE for the new

25 Administration Building dated September 15, 2017, the reposted NOE (on or about
26

27 April 16, 2018) was not publicly noticed or filed with the State Clearinghouse (SCH).

28 54. The construction of the new County Administration building, and parking

Architectural Preservation Foundation of CCC et al. Petition for Writ of Mandate 20

1 structures, and the abatement, dismantling and demolishing of the old County
Administration building were not addressed in the 1903 Granite Jailhouse Demolition
EIR. There was an "Initial study of Environmental Significance" four months after the 4

5 September 15, 2007 NOE for the new County Administration building, issued on April

6 16, 2018 because the county modified the parking plan stating "Therefore CEQA is
7 being reposted to address the minor parking change."
8

9 55. Four years after the 1903 Jailhouse Demolition EIR (with the 1903 granite

10 Jailhouse and Annex still standing empty), and three years after the construction of the

11 new County Administration building and the new parking structure behind the County
12 Detention facility, the County Board of Supervisors voted to complete its Civic Center 13

14 revitalization project to demolish the old County Administration Building, demolish the

15 1903 Granite Jailhouse and Annex, and construct a new county office building and

16 parking on the site of the old Administration Building. The County posted a NOE on
17

18 September 9, 2021.

19 56. The September 9, 2021 NOE stated "The Demolition of the old County
20 Administration Building was previously analyzed under a Class 32 CEQA exemption for
21 the project that included construction of the new County Administration Building 22

23 posted to the County Clerk on September 15, 2017." However, there was no CEQA

24 analysis of the demolition of the old County Administration building analyzing: (a)

25 abatement of toxics (b) impacts to Species of Special Concern at the project site or other
26

27 biological resources;(c) air quality impacts from demolition and construction; (d)

28 climate change impacts; (e) pedestrian/circulation impacts; (f) impacts to traffic and,

Architectural Preservation Foundation of CCC et al. Petition for Writ of Mandate 21

1 transportation; (g) impacts to neighborhoods; (h) impacts to downtown Martinez

2 businesses; (i) unmitigable impacts to historic resources.
3

4 Violations of the California Environmental Quality Act

57. Petitioners incorporate all previous paragraphs as if fully set forth.

58. The County abused its discretion and failed to act in the manner required
7

8 by law by failing to conduct any environmental review of the project, approving the

9 project without adequate environmental review and compliance with CEQA's

10 procedural mandates.

11
59. The CEQA project (i.e. the whole of the action) included the entire Civic 12

13 Center project: the construction of a new County Administration building, the

14 demolition of the old Administration building, the demolition of the 1903 Granite

15 Jailhouse and Annex, the construction of parking near the County Detention Facility,
16

17 the construction of a new County office building (and parking), and a civic center plaza,

18 all within the downtown Martinez civic center area. The County violated CEQA by

19 failing to conduct an environmental review of the whole project.
20 60. The September 9, 2021 NOE and the County Board of Supervisors' action 21

22 to approve the project on September 7, 2021 violated CEQA by (a) failing to adequately

23 analyze and mitigate significant environmental impacts; (b) failing to sufficiently

24 analyze alternatives; (b) improperly segmenting the Civic Center, 650 and 651 Pine
25 Street demolition, new County Office Building project and previously constructed new
26

27 Administration Building project, (4) failing to analyze and apply County and City of

28 Martinez general and specific plan provisions; (5) failing to provide any cost analysis

Architectural Preservation Foundation of CCC et al. Petition for Writ of Mandate 22

1 to support the finding that rehabilitation of the Old Jail is "uneconomical"; (6) basing

2 the decision on County staff's erroneous assertion that the City of Martinez does not
support the preservation of the Old Jail, and instead supports its demolition and 4

5 construction of a plaza; (7) failing to provide sufficient analysis of: project cost; of

6 potential impacts to transportation/traffic; impacts of hazardous materials and toxic

7 abatement; air quality impacts; climate impacts utilities/service systems impacts;
8

9 impacts to geology/soils; aesthetic impacts; impacts to historic resources; and impacts

10 to biological resources; (8) failing to inform or consult with California Native American

11 Tribes; (9) improperly deferring analysis and mitigation to a non-public "design-build" a
12 process; (10) failing to consider or analyze any direct, indirect or cumulative impacts of 13

14 these projects, (11) failing to inform the public; (12) failing to consider or address the

15 fair argument that the project may have a significant effect on the environment; and

16 (13) making Notice of Exemption findings that are not supported by substantial
17
evidence in the record.
18

19 61. The County conceded that demolition of 1903 Jailhouse would have a

20 significant environmental impact to an historic resource but failed to adequately
21 analyze or adopt feasible alternatives that would avoid demolition, or make findings 22

23 supported by substantial evidence that a project alternative that did not include

24 demolition of the 1903 Granite Jailhouse would be infeasible to accomplish the

25 fundamental project objectives.
26
62. The County findings regarding the infeasibility of alternatives for adaptive 27

28 reuse of the 1903 Granite Jailhouse, and findings to support the statement of overriding

Architectural Preservation Foundation of CCC et al. Petition for Writ of Mandate 23

1 considerations, are not supported by substantial evidence in the whole of the

2 administrative record and, in fact, are contrary to analysis in the project EIR.
3
63. The County failed to adequately respond to comments regarding the 4

5 feasibility of project alternatives and the inadequacy of information.

6 64. The County's CEQA analysis for the four interrelated Civic Center projects

7 was inadequate and incomplete and failed to provide a good-faith full disclosure
8

9 regarding formulation and discussion of the Civic Center project being considered

10 simultaneously and combined impacts of these projects.

11 65. The County failed to formulate and discuss an adequate range of
12 reasonable and potentially-feasible project alternatives, including an alternative 13 14 identifying criteria and standards for the adaptive reuse of 1903 Granite Jailhouse to

15 maintain its integrity and mitigate project impacts on historic resources to a level of

16 insignificance.
17
66.
18 The County failed to provide an adequate analysis or resolve

19 inconsistencies with applicable General and Specific plans of the County and City,

20 respectively.

21 67. The County improperly segmented the 1903 Granite Jailhouse demolition
22

23 project from the new Administration building construction; old Administration

24 building demolition; new County building construction and parking lot construction

25 comprising the whole Civic Center project, depriving the public of the entire scope of
26

27 potential environmental impacts and potential benefits of the proposed Civic Center

28 project, and kept the County from exploring the full range of reasonable alternatives

Architectural Preservation Foundation of CCC et al. Petition for Writ of Mandate 24

1 that come through the public comment process. The County failed to consider future

2 planned development that was reasonably likely to occur when it certified the 1903

Granite Jailhouse demolition EIR.
4

5 68. The County failed to analyze potentially significant cumulative impacts of

6 the Administration building/Civic Center complex.

7 69. The project descriptions defining each project as including only one phase
8

9 of the Civic Center project prevented the public from commenting on project impacts

10 because the full scope of the project was not disclosed.

11 70. The County received significant new information about the costs of the

12 1903 Granite Jail demolition project and the alternatives, about the new Administration 13

14 building and 5-year Capital Facilities Plan policies, and about the two-year delay, but

15 failed to recirculate the revised EIR, or portions thereof, for additional commentary or

16 consultation or prepare a supplemental EIR in accordance with Cal. Code Regs. Tit. 14
17

18 ยง15163. This deprived the Petitioners and the public of a meaningful opportunity to

19 comment upon (1) a feasible way to mitigate or avoid the significant adverse impact of
20 demolition; (2) the significant new impacts of the proposed Administration building;

21 and (3) significant new impacts of demolition of the old Administration Building; (4)
22

23 significant adverse impacts of the whole project.

24 71. The County improperly determined that the project was exempt from

25 CEQA analysis despite the fact that: there is a reasonable possibility that the activity
26 will have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances (CEQA 27

28 Guidelines 15300.2(c); that the cumulative impact of successive projects of the same

Architectural Preservation Foundation of CCC et al. Petition for Writ of Mandate 25

1 type in the same place over time is significant; (CEQA Guidelines 15300.2(b); and the

2 project that may cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of a historical
resource (CEQA Guidelines 15300.2(f).
4

5 72. The County failed to update or supplement the 1903 Granite Jailhouse

6 demolition EIR despite the passage of time and changes in circumstances that

7 warranted supplemental CEQA analysis prior to demolition of the 1903 Granite
8
| Jailhouse.
9

10 73. The approved mitigation measures, and deferral of important aspects of

11 the Civic Center project "pending discussion between the City and the County" as stated
12 in the September 7, 2021 NOE do not alleviate the impacts of demolition to air quality,
13

14 toxic exposure, traffic, historic resources, biological resources, on neighborhoods or

15 downtown businesses nor are the effects of demolition and construction of new

16 buildings reduced to a level of insignificance.
17

18 Violations of the County General Plan and
Martinez Specific Plans
19

20 74. The Petitioners incorporate all previous paragraphs as if fully set forth.

21 75. The County failed to discuss the inconsistencies Civic Center project (and

22 each of its elements) with the County's General Plan, and the City of Martinez Specific
23
Plans.
24

25 76. The County violated provisions of the Contra Costa County General Plan

26 and the City of Martinez Downtown Specific Plan and Downtown Historic Overlay
27 District that mandated the protection and preservation of historic resources. 28

Architectural Preservation Foundation of CCC et al. Petition for Writ of Mandate 26

1 77. The County erroneously interpreted its obligation to comply with the

2 Contra Costa County General Plan and the Martinez Downtown Specific Plan.
3
Wherefore, the Petitioners respectfully request that the Court: 4

5 1. Issue a peremptory writ of mandate ordering the County to set aside its

6 approvals of the 651 Pine Street Redevelopment, the Downtown Martinez Jail

7 Demolition Project and not to consider approval until it circulates an adequate EIR and
8

9 fully complies with CEQA, the County General Plan and Martinez Specific Plan in a

10 public process that provides due process;

11 2. Direct the County to vacate and set aside its Notices of Exemption for the
1.2 651 Pine Street Redevelopment Project; the County Administration Building Project,
13

14 and certification of the EIR for the Downtown Martinez Jail (1903 Granite Jail)

15 Demolition Project;

16 3. Direct the County to suspend all activity that could result in any change or
17

18 alteration to the historic resources until the County has taken actions necessary to bring

19 the certification and approvals into compliance with CEQA;

20 4. Direct the County to prepare, circulate and consider a new and legally
21 adequate EIR and otherwise to comply with CEQA for all elements of the Civic Center
22

23 project;

24 5. Award Petitioners' costs and fees, including reasonable attorney's fees as

25 authorized by California Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5, and any other
26
applicable provisions of law; and
27

28 6. Grant such other and further relief as the Court finds proper.
