26 and Eddie Armando Torres ("Petitioners") petition this Court for writ of mandate and declaratory

27 and injunctive relief directed to Respondents and Defendants City of Visalia, the Site Plan Review

28 Committee for the City of Visalia, and Paul Bernal (collectively "Respondents" or "City") and Real

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

1 Party in Interest G4 Enterprises Ltd., A Limited Partnership. ("Real Party" or "Applicant"), and by

2 this verified petition and complaint, allege as follows:

3 1. This action alleges violations of the California Environmental Quality Act, Public

4 Resources Code sections 21000 et seq. ("CEQA"), by the City regarding a project proposed and

5 being carried out by Real Party in Interest to construct the Duarte Industrial Project, an approximately
6 320,000 square foot warehouse/office building and associated parking lot on a 15 acre parcel (APN
7 081-030-077) located east of N. Kelsey Street and south of W. Goshen Avenue in Visalia, California

8 ("Project").

9 2. On May 4, 2022, the City's Site Plan Review Committee approved the Project,

10 allowing it to proceed to apply for building permits without conducting any environmental review of

11 the Project pursuant to CEQA, despite the likely environmental impacts associated with the

12 construction and operation of a 320,000 square foot warehouse, and without preparing a Local

13 Transportation Analysis or CEQA Transportation Impact Analysis as required by the City's

14 "Procedures For Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) (Updated March 2021)" ("TIA Procedures").

15 3. When Petitioners attempted to appeal the Site Plan Review Committee's decision to

16 the City's Planning Commission, the City rejected their appeal, claiming that the Site Plan Review
17 Committee's review of the Project was ministerial and, therefore, not subject to CEQA. The City's

18 rejection of Petitioners' appeal also claimed that the Project's environmental impacts would be

19 mitigated by the 2014 environmental impact report prepared for the City's General Plan Update.

20 4. This action alleges that Respondents have violated CEQA by exempting the Project
21 from CEQA review as ministerial despite the Site Plan Review Committee's discretionary authority

22 over the Project granted by the City's municipal code, including the authority to "[a]pply

23 requirements to a site to protect the public health, safety and general welfare." (Visalia Muni. Code

24 (*VMC**), § 17.28.020(B)(2).)

25 5. This action alleges that Respondents have violated CEQA by determining that the
26 Project's environmental impacts are adequately addressed by the 2014 environmental impact report

27 prepared for the City's General Plan Update despite the requirements that the 2014 General Plan EIR

28

2

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

be supplemented pursuant to 14 Cal. Code. Regs. § 15162(a)(3) and Public Resources Code §21166
based on evidence of new mitigation measures that have become available and/or feasible since 2014.

6. This action alleges that Respondents abused their discretion by failing to comply with

4 the City's duty to implement General Plan Policy AQ-P-9 requiring the preparation of a site-specific

5 assessment of air quality impacts for the Project and which was a mitigation measure included in the

6 2014 General Plan EIR. Alternatively, the City's failure to perform the site-specific air quality

7 assessment for the Project is inconsistent with the City's General Plan.

8 7. This action alleges that Respondents abused their discretion by failing to prepare a

9 Local Transportation Analysis or CEQA Transportation Impact Analysis even though the City's TIA

10 Procedures require the preparation of such analyses.

11 8. This action alleges that Respondents abused their discretion by rejecting Petitioners'
12 appeal of the Site Plan Review Committee's approval of the Project, thereby denying Petitioners the

13 opportunity to prepare and provide meaningful written and oral comments to the Planning

14 Commission on the Project regarding the Project's potential significant impacts on Petitioners and the

15 environment and its consistency with the City's traffic analysis requirements.

16 PARTIES

17 9. Petitioner and Plaintiff EDDIE ARMANDO TORRES is a resident of Visalia,

18 California. Mr. Torres frequently visits or passes through the area of the Project site. Mr. Torres is

19 interested in ensuring that the City and Real Party fully comply with CEQA to ensure that all

20 environmental impacts are mitigated to the maximum extent feasible. Mr. Torres is a member of
21 Laborers International Union of North America, Local Union 294.

22 10. Petitioner and Plaintiff LABORERS INTERNATIONAL UNION OF NORTH

23 AMERICA, LOCAL UNION 294 (*Local 294") is a labor organization that has more than 1,500

24 members residing in Tulare, Fresno, Madera and Kings County. Local 294 has more than 220

25 members who live in the City of Visalia. Local 294's purposes include advocating on behalf of its

26 members to ensure safe workplace environments; working to protect recreational opportunities for its

27 members to improve its members' quality of life when off the job; advocating to assure its members'

28 access to safe, healthful, productive, and aesthetically and culturally pleasing surroundings on and off

3

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

the job; promoting environmentally sustainable businesses and development projects on behalf of its

2 members, including providing comments raising environmental concerns and benefits on proposed
development projects; advocating for changes to proposed development projects that will help to

4 achieve a balance between employment, the human population, and resource use to permit high
standards of living and a wide sharing of life's amenities by its members as well as the general

6 public; advocating for steps to preserve important historic, cultural, and natural aspects of our

7 national heritage, and maintain, wherever possible, an environment that supports diversity and variety

8 of individual choice; advocating on behalf of its members for programs, policies, and development
projects that promote not only good jobs but also a healthy natural environment and working
10 environment, including advocating for changes to proposed projects and policies that, if adopted,

11 would reduce air, soil, and water pollution, minimize harm to wildlife, conserve wild places, reduce

12 traffic congestion, reduce global warming impacts, and assure compliance with applicable land use

13 ordinances; and working to attain the widest range of beneficial uses of the environment without
14 degradation, risk to health or safety, or other undesirable or unintended consequences.

15 11. Local 294, its members, and Mr. Torres have direct and beneficial interests in

16 Respondents' compliance with laws bearing upon approval of the Project. These interests will be

17 directly and adversely affected by the Project, which violates the law as set forth in this Petition. The

18 I maintenance and prosecution of this action will confer a substantial benefit on Petitioners and the

19 public by protecting Petitioners and the public from the environmental and other harms alleged below

20 and others that may exist but are unknown due to the lack of a full environmental analysis of the
21 Project.

22 12. Respondent and Defendant CITY OF VISALIA is the "lead agency" for the Project
23 for purposes of Public Resources Code section 21067, and has principal responsibility for conducting
24 environmental review for the Project and taking other actions necessary to comply CEQA.

25 13. Respondent and Defendant SITE PLAN REVIEW COMMITTEE FOR THE CITY
26 OF VISALIA is a committee a established by the City of Visalia's Municipal Code §§ 17.28.010 -
27 17.28.120 and is ultimately responsible for reviewing and approving or denying Site Plan Review
28 permits for development projects within the City. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon

4

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

1 allege, that on or about May 4, 2022, the Site Plan Review Committee approved a site plan review

2 permit or otherwise authorized the Project to proceed.

3 14. Respondent and Defendant CITY OF VISALIA PLANNING COMMISSION is a

4 commission established by the City of Visalia Municipal Code Chapter 2.16 which is vested with all
of the powers and duties imposed upon planning commissions by general law of the State of

6 California. The Planning Commission is vested with a duty to hear appeals by any interested person

7 of decisions of the Site Plan Review Committee. (VMC § 17.28.050.) The Planning Commission

8 failed to place on its agenda and hear Petitioners' appeal of the Site Plan Review Committee's
decision for the Project.

10 15. Respondent and Defendant PAUL BERNAL is the Interim Director/City Planner of

11 the City's Community Development Department. Mr. Bernal is responsible for facilitating the Site
12 Plan Review Committee. Mr. Bernal also manages the City's environmental review of Project's

13 under CEQA. On May 16, 2022, Mr. Bernal issued a decision to reject Petitioners' appeal of the

14 Committee's May 4, 2022 approval of the Project.
15 16. Real Party in Interest G4 ENTERPRISES LTD., A LIMITED PARTNERSHIP ("G4
16 Enterprises Ltd.") is a California limited partnership. G4 Enterprises Ltd. is the applicant for the

17 Project.

18 17. Petitioners and Plaintiffs do not know the true names or capacities of the persons or

19 entities sued as Respondents DOES I through X, inclusive, nor of Real Parties in Interest ROES I

20 through X, inclusive, and therefore sue these respondents and real parties by their fictitious names.
21 Petitioners and plaintiffs will amend the Petition and Complaint to set forth the names and capacities

22 of the Doe defendants along with appropriate charging allegations when such information has been

23 ascertained.

24 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

25 18. Pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 (alternatively section

26 1094.5) and Public Resources Code sections 21168.5 (alternatively section 21168) and 21168.9, this

27 Court has jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandate to set aside Respondents' decision to approve the

28 Project without proper CEQA review. The Court has jurisdiction to issue declaratory relief pursuant

5

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

1 to Code of Civil Procedure § 1060 and injunctive relief pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 525 et
2 seq.

3 19. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1085, this Court has jurisdiction to issue a

4 writ of mandate to set aside Respondents' decision to approve the Project for failing to apply the

5 mitigation measures established by the 2014 General Plan EIR, to set aside Respondents' decision to

6 approve the Project for failing to comply with the General Plan's site specific air impact assessment

7 policy, and to set aside Respondents' decision to approve the Project for failing to comply with the

8 City's TIA Procedures.

9 20. Venue is proper in this Court because this action challenges acts done by a public
10 agency, and the causes of action alleged in this Petition and Complaint arose in Tulare County.
11 Venue also is proper in this Court because the City is located in Tulare County.

12 21. Petitioners have complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section

13 21167.5 by serving on May 25, 2022 a written notice of Petitioners' intention to commence this
14 action against Respondents pursuant to CEQA. A copy of the written notice is attached hereto as

15 Exhibit A.

16 22. This action is timely filed within all applicable statutes of limitations, including those
17 set forth in Public Resources Code section 21167(b).

18 23. Petitioners have complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section

19 21167.6 by filing a notice of their election to prepare the record of administrative proceedings

20 relating to this action. A copy of the notice is attached hereto as Exhibit B.
21 24. Petitioners will comply with the requirements of Public Resources Code section
22 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure section 388 by sending a copy of this Petition and Complaint to
23 the California Attorney General within the required time period.
24 25. Petitioners have performed any and all conditions precedent to filing this instant action
25 and have exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent required by law.
26 26. Petitioners have no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law
27 unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents set aside the City's

28 actions taken in violation of CEQA, to require Respondents to prepare an EIR or other legally

6

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

adequate CEQA document for the Project and to enjoin the City from approving the Project pending

2 completion of legally adequate CEQA review. In the absence of such remedies, Respondents'

3 decision will remain in violation of state law.

4 LEGAL BACKGROUND
The California Environmental Quality Act

6 27. CEQA mandates that "the long-term protection of the environment..shall be the

7 guiding criterion in public decisions" throughout California. (Pub. Res. Code § 21001(d).) The

8 foremost principle under CEQA is that it is to be "interpreted in such a manner as to afford the fullest

9 possible protection to the environment within the reasonable scope of the statutory language."

10 (Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Bd. of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal. 3d 553, 563-64.) An agency's action

11 violates CEQA if it "thwarts the statutory goals" of "informed decisionmaking" and "informed public
12 participation." (Kings Co. Farm Bur. v. City of Hanford (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 692, 712.)

13 28. To achieve its objectives of environmental protection, CEQA has three-tiered

14 structure. (14 CCR § 15002(k; Comm. to Save Hollywoodland v. City of Los Angeles (2008) 161

15 Cal.App.4th 1168, 1185-86) First, if a project falls into an exempt category, no further agency

16 evaluation is required. (Id.) Second, if there is a possibility the project will have a significant effect
17 on the a environment, the agency must perform a threshold initial study. (Id.; 14 CCR § 15063(a).) If

18 the study indicates that there is no substantial evidence that the project may cause a significant effect

19 on the a environment the agency may issue a negative declaration. (Id., 14 CCR §§ 15063(b)(2),

20 15070) Finally, if the project will have a significant effect on the environment, an environmental
21 impact report ("EIR") is required. (Id.)

22 29. Exemptions to CEQA are narrowly construed and "[e]xemption categories are not to

23 be expanded beyond the reasonable scope of their statutory language." (Mountain Lion Found. V.

24 Fish & Game Com. (1997) 16 Cal.4th 105, 125)

25 30. CEQA applies only to "discretionary projects proposed to be carried out or approved
26 by public agencies." § (Pub. Res. Code § 21080(a).) Section 15357 of the CEQA Guidelines defines
27 "discretionary projects" as:

28 [A] project which requires the exercise of judgment or deliberation when the public agency or body decides to approve or disapprove a particular activity, as distinguished
7

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

1 from situations where the public agency or body merely has to determine whether there

2 has been conformity with applicable statutes, ordinances, or regulations.

3 (14 CCR §15357.) Section 15369 of the CEQA Guidelines defines "ministerial" as:

4 [DJescrib[ing] a governmental decision involving little or no personal judgment by the

5 public official as to the wisdom or manner of carrying out the project. The public official merely applies the law to the facts as presented but uses no special discretion
6 or judgment in reaching a decision. A ministerial decision involves only the use of fixed standards or objective measurements, and the public official cannot use personal, 7 subjective judgment in deciding whether or how the project should be carried out.

8 (14 CCR § 15369.) Common examples of ministerial permits include automobile registration, dog
9 licenses, and marriage licenses. (Id.) A building permit is ministerial if it "limits the public official to
10 determining whether the zoning allows the structure ... the structure would meet the strength
11 requirements ... and applicant has paid his fee." (Id.)
12 31. If project's approval involves both discretionary and ministerial acts, the project is
13 subject to CEQA review. (14 CCR § 15258(d).)
14 32. The CEQA Guidelines further explain that "[w]hether an agency has discretionary or
15 ministerial controls over a project depends on the authority granted by the law providing the controls
16 over the activity. Similar projects may be subject to discretionary controls in one city or county and
17 only ministerial controls in another." (14 CCR § 15002(i)(2).) "The statutory distinction between
18 discretionary and purely ministerial projects implicitly recognizes that unless a public agency can
19 shape the project in a way that would respond to concerns raised in an EIR, or its functional
20 equivalent, environmental review would be a meaningless exercise." (Mountain Lion Found., supra,
21 16 Cal.4th at 117.)
22 33. The Courts apply a "functional" test for distinguishing ministerial from discretionary
23 decisions. (Friends of Westwood, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles (1987) 191 Cal.App.3d 259, 272.) That
24 test examines whether the agency has the power to shape the project in ways that are responsive to
25 environmental concerns. (Id. at 267; Mountain Lion Found., supra, 16 Cal.4th at 117.) Under this
26 functional test, a project qualifies as ministerial "when a private party can legally compel approval
27 without any changes in the design of its project which might alleviate adverse environmental
28 consequences." (Friends of Westwood, supra, 191 Cal.App.3d at 267; accord, Miller v. City of

8

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

1 Hermosa Beach (1993) 13 Cal. App. 4th 1118, 1141-42.) Discretion exists where the approving

2 agency can impose "reasonable conditions" based on "professional judgment." (Natural Res. Def.

3 Council v. Arcata (1976) 59 Cal.App.3d 959, 971);

4 34. It is sufficient that an agency possess discretionary authority, even if it chooses not to

5 exercise that authority. "[W]here the agency possesses enough authority (that is, discretion) to deny

6 or modify the proposed project on the basis of environment consequences the EIR might conceivably

7 uncover, the permit process is discretionary' within the meaning of CEQA." (Friends of Westwood,

8 supra, 191 Cal.App.3d at 272.)

9 35. To determine whether the City has discretionary authority, the Court must look to the
10 plain language of the City's municipal code. "Whether an agency has discretionary or ministerial

11 controls over a project depends on the authority granted by the law providing the controls over the

12 activity. Similar projects may be subject to discretionary controls in one city or county and only

13 ministerial controls in another." (CEQA Guidelines § 15002(i)(2).) In construing a statute or an

14 ordinance, the courts look first to the language of the provision itself. (Friends of Juana Briones

15 House V. City of Palo Alto (2010) 190 Cal.App.4th 286, 304.) If the language "is clear and

16 unambiguous our inquiry ends. There is no need for judicial construction and a court may not indulge a

17 in it." (Id.)

18 36. Where, as here, no public hearing was held for the CEQA determination, legal

19 challenges are made pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure 1085 (traditional mandamus) and Public

20 Resources Code section 21168.5. (San Lorenzo Valley Com. Advocates v. San Lorenzo Valley Unif.
21 Sch. Dist. (2006) 139 Cal.App.4th 1356, 1381.) The court must determine if there was a "prejudicial

22 abuse of discretion" by the agency including a failure to proceed "in a manner required by law."

23 (Western States Petroleum Assn. v. Super. Ct. (1995) 9 Cal.4th 559, 568.) Courts owe no deference to

24 agencies where the law has been misapplied and "an agency's use of an erroneous legal standard

25 constitutes a failure to proceed in a manner required by law. The interpretation and applicability of a
26 statute is a question of law requiring an independent determination by the reviewing court." (East

27 Pen. Educ. Coun. v. Palos Verde Unif. Sch. Dist. (1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 155, 165.) "The legal

28

9

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

1  determination of whether an approval is exempt from CEQA review as a ministerial action is subject

2 to our de novo review." (Friends of Juana Briones, supra, 190 Cal.App.4th at 303.)

3 2104 Environmental Impact Report for Visalia's General Plan Update

4 37. In 2014, the City completed the preparation of a programmatic EIR reviewing

5 potential impacts of its 2014 General Plan Update (*2014 General Plan EIR"). The 2014 General

6 Plan EIR stated that it did not provide environmental review for subsequently approved projects

7 consistent with the General Plan:

8 This EIR is a program EIR that examines the potential effects resulting from

9 implementing designated land uses and policies in the proposed General Plan. The impact assessment evaluates the General Plan as a whole and identifies the broad,
10 regional effects that may occur with its implementation. As a programmatic document, this EIR does not assess site-specific impacts. Any future development project made 11 possible by the General Plan will be subject to individual, site-specific environmental

12 review, as required by State law.

13 (2014 General Plan EIR, p. ES-1 [emphasis added].) The EIR reiterates: "The EIR is intended to be

14 solely used for the approval of the proposed Plan and should not be used for the approval of

15 individual projects undertaken subsequent to the Plan's adoption.' (Id. at p. 1-2.)

16 38. The 2014 General Plan EIR concluded that the growth planned for under the General

17 Plan would result in significant and unavoidable air quality impacts, including from the emission of

18 PM2.5. (2014 General Plan EIR, p. ES-7.) Vehicles, including trucks, are a significant source of

19 PM2.5. (Id. at p. 5-3.) Likewise, the 2014 General Plan EIR anticipated significant air quality impacts

20 from emissions of ozone precursors such as nitrogen oxides ("NOx") and reactive organic gases

21 ("ROG") from heavy construction equipment. (Id. at p. ES-27 [*Implementation of the proposed

22 Visalia General Plan could result in cumulatively considerable net increase of any criteria pollutant

23 for which the project region is non-attainment under an applicable federal or state ambient air quality

24 standard [including releasing emissions that exceed quantitative thresholds for ozone precursors]'].)

25 The 2014 General Plan EIR emphasized that construction emissions of ROG and NOx from future

26 individual construction projects were not yet known and could emit significant levels of air pollution:

27 "[G]iven the lack of specifics regarding construction projects at this time, it is uncertain whether

28 construction activities would result in ROG and NOX emissions that exceed SJVAPCD thresholds.
Accordingly, this impact is considered significant and unavoidable." (Id. at p. 3.3-23; see also id. at p. 10

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

1 3.3-27 ["Construction-related ROG and NOX emissions could potentially exceed SJVAPCD's

2 quantitative thresholds of significance. Because the SJVAB is in nonattainment for ozone, for which

3 ROG and NOX are precursors, construction activities associated with the proposed General Plan

4 could result in cumulatively considerable and significant impact."].)

5 39. The 2014 General Plan EIR also determined that the operation of future projects also

6 would exceed the significance thresholds for emissions of PM10 and PM2.5, which impacts were
7 significant, "cumulatively considerable," and unavoidable. (2014 General Plan EIR, p. 3.3-27

8 ["implementation of the proposed General Plan would exceed SJVAPCD's operational thresholds for
PM10 and PM2.5"].) Given that future projects were not yet known and the lack of "a quantitative

10 analysis of reductions anticipated under the General Plan policies," the General Plan EIR concluded

11 that "there is insufficient data to determine whether operational emissions would be below SJVAPCD
12 thresholds." (Id. at p. 3.3-24.)

13 40. The 2014 General Plan EIR mandates that "[fJuture development proposed under the

14 proposed General Plan would undergo subsequent review, including in many cases CEQA review,

15 and would evaluate project-specific impacts." (2014 General Plan EIR, p. 3.3-27.) The General Plan

16 EIR adopted a City-wide general policy requiring those future projects be subject to environmental

17 review under CEQA: "General Policy AQ-P-9: Continue to mitigate short-term construction impacts

18 and long-term stationary source impacts on air quality on a case-by-case basis and continue to assess a

19 air quality impacts through environmental review." (Id. at pp. 3.3-26 to 27, ES26 to27.) The 2014

20 General Plan EIR identified General Policy AQ-P-9 as a mitigation measure upon which the City
21 based its determination that the General Plan's air quality impacts were significant and unavoidable.

22 (Id. at pp. 3.3-26, ES-26 to27.)

23 41. The 2014 General Plan EIR identified significant and unavoidable impacts from future
24 projects due to their increasing of noise levels from vehicles. (2014 General Plan EIR, p. ES-8.)
25 Likewise, the 2014 General Plan EIR indicated the need for future project's potential impacts on

26 habitat of special-status species would need to be assessed "prior to approval of any discretionary
27 development projects." (Id. at p. 3.8-34.)

City of Visalia Municipal Code

2 42. The Project's parcel is zoned Industrial ("I"). Warehousing is permitted use in the

3 Industrial zone. (VMC § 17.25.030, Table 17.25.030.) Combined office/warehouse-type buildings

4 (M45) is one of the uses "permitted by right" in the Industrial zone. (Id.; see VMC § 17.25.030(B)
l'A "P" means that the use is permitted by right in that zone"].) However, all of the permitted

6 industrial uses are qualified by the City's Site Plan Review permit process. "A site plan review permit

7 must be obtained for all development in an I-L or I zone, subject to the requirements and procedures

8 in Chapter 17.28." (VMC § 17.22.040(C).)

43. Chapter 17.28 of the City's Municipal Code establishes the Site Plan Review

10 Committee and the requirements for the issuance of Site Plan Review Permits. "The purpose of the
11 site plan review permit is to assure that developments, new and remodeled buildings and structures,

12 and improvements to land are reviewed to ensure substantial compliance with the general plan,

13 municipal code, policies, and improvement standards of the city." (VMC § 17.28.010.)

14 44. The Site Plan Review Permit provisions apply to, inter alia, "[n]ew commercial,
15 industrial and other non-residential structures or additions to existing commercial, industrial or other
16 non-residential structures." (VMC § 17.28.015(A)(2).)

17 45. The Site Plan Review Committee consists of "staff representatives of the engineering,

18 building, and planning divisions of the community development as well as the fire department...."

19 (VMC § 17.28.020.) The Site Plan Review Committee meets regularly each Wednesday at 9:00 a.m.

20 (VMC § 17.28.030(C).)

21 46. The VMC grants the following powers to the Site Plan Review Committee: "(1)

22 Review site plan review permit applications for consistency with the general plan, municipal code,

23 policies, regulations, and improvement standards of the city; (2) Apply requirements to a site to a

24 protect the public health, safety and general welfare; (3) Require revisions to the site plan to bring it

25 into consistency with the General Plan and local ordinances; (4) Identify the city permits necessary to

26 construct the proposed project; (5) Require that the site plan be revised, and/or provide direction to
27 the project applicant be permitted to proceed to submit for the necessary city permits; or (6) Require

28 that the site plan be resubmitted with required revisions." (VMC § 17.28.020(B).)

12

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

47. The VMC also grants the Site Plan Review Committee the authority to determine

2 whether or not to request various right-of-way dedications, street improvements and grading based on

3 a Project's addition of traffic to the local street. Section 17.28.080 provides that "[b]ecause of

4 changes that may occur in local neighborhood due to increased vehicular traffic generated by
facilities requiring a site plan review permit, and upon the principle that such development should be

6 required to provide street dedications and improvements proportionate to such increased vehicular

7 traffic, the following dedications and improvements may be deemed necessary by the site plan review

8 committee and may be required as a revision to any site plan." (VMC § 17.28.080.)

48. The VMC requires any applicant to submit a site plan and a site plan review

10 application form. (VMC § 17.28.030.) When a site plan review application and twenty copies of the

11 proposed site plan are submitted to the Committee by Thursday at 4:00 p.m., the application is heard

12 by the Committee at the following Wednesday morning meeting, unless otherwise extended by the

13 Committee. (VMC § 17.28.030(C).)

14 49. The VMC provides that "[w]ithin thirty (30) working days after submission, the site
15 plan review committee shall provide, in writing to the applicant, either to proceed with applying for

16 necessary city permits, either with or without required revisions, or require resubmittal of the site

17 plan review and identify required revisions." (VMC § 17.28.040(B).) "The site plan review

18 committee shall consider each project's consistency with current city ordinances and whether it will

19 affect the public health, safety and general welfare." (Id.)

20 50. The VMC provides a broad right to appeal any action or determinations of the Site
21 Plan Review Committee to the City's Planning Commission. "The applicant or any interested person
22 may appeal a decision of the site plan review committee to the planning commission, setting forth the

23 reason for such appeal to the commission." (VMC § 17.28.050.) "Such appeal shall be filed with the

24 city planner in writing with applicable fees, within ten (10) days after notification of such decision."

25 (Id.) The current fee for filing an appeal of a Site Plan Review decision is $552.00. Once filed, "[t]he

26 appeal shall be placed on the agenda of the commission's next regular meeting[,]" unless the appeal
27 was filed within five days of the next Planning Commission, in which case "the appeal shall be
28 placed on the agenda of the commission's second regular meeting following the filing of the appeal."

13

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

1 (Id.) In furtherance of the appeal, the Planning Commission " shall review the site plan and shall

2 uphold or revise the decision of the site plan review, based on the findings set forth in

3 Section 17.28.040[,]" including whether the project "will affect the public health, safety, and general

4 welfare." (Id.; VMC § 17.28.040(B).) An appellant may then appeal the Planning Commission's

5 decision to the City Council. (VMC § 17.28.050.)

6 51. The VMC does not provide any definition of the term "interested party." The VMC

7 contains no prerequisite that an interested person must make comments to the Site Plan Review

8 Committee or otherwise appear before the Committee before filing an appeal pursuant to VMC §
17.28.050. The VMC does not provide any administrative appeal procedure of any action by the

10 Planning Director to unilaterally reject a timely filed appeal by a person claiming to be interested in a

11 decision of the Site Plan Review Committee.

12 52. The VMC does not provide any administrative appeal process for a determination by

13 the City's environmental planner that a proposed project is ministerial and not subject to CEQA

14 either to the Planning Commission, the City Council or any other city official or department.
15 Visalia's Traffic Impact Analysis Procedures

16 53. The City has published "Procedures For Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA)" "TIA

17 Procedures"), which was last updated in March 2021. The City requires the preparation of a traffic

18 impact analyses ("TIA") in order to ensure the development of "an integrated transportation system

19 for the safe and efficient movement of people and goods in the Visalia planning area." (TIA
20 Procedures, p. 1.) "The review and management of development-generated traffic is an integral part

21 of operating and maintaining a safe and efficient roadway system and meeting this goal." (Id.) "The
22 procedures establish a range of traffic impact study categories based on the characteristics of the

23 development and the estimated peak hour traffic volumes, while also outlining the analysis approach

24 and methods." (Id.) "A Local Transportation Analysis (LTA) identifies existing traffic volumes and

25 conditions, development traffic volumes and conditions and their combined impacts on the existing

26 and future roadway system." (Id.) "When insufficient attention is given to traffic operational

27 deficiencies, the following problems may result: • On-site congestion and/or congestion on adjacent

28

14

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

roadways Inadequate site access High accident experience; and/or • Limited flexibility to modify

2 the development to eliminate problems or adjust to changed conditions." (Id.)

54. "The need for a LTA should be assessed as early as possible in the development

4 process when there is maximum flexibility for eliminating traffic-related problems adjacent to and
near the proposed development." (TIA Procedures, p. 2.) As part of the Site Plan Review Committee

6 process, an applicant must "complete the LTA section of the Site Plan Review application, or a TIQ

7 ['Traffic Impact Questionnaire"]." (Id., pp. 5-6.)

8 55. The LTA Procedures define 5 levels of TIA that must be performed based on peak
hour Project trip generation as determined in a Traffic Impact Questionnaire. The higher the trip

10 generation level, the more extended the area and level of analysis required. The correspondence of

11 TIA Category to trip generation is as follows:

12 Category 1: Less than 100 peak hour trips.

13 Category 2: Greater than 100 but less than 500 peak hour trips.

14 Category 3: Greater than 500 but less than 1000 peak hour trips.

15 Category 4: Greater than 1000 but less than 1500 peak hour trips.

16 Category 5: Greater than 1500 peak hour trips.

17 56. Where a project is a discretionary project under CEQA, the TIA Procedures also

18 require the preparation of a vehicle miles traveled ("VMT") analysis. (TIA Procedures, p. 24.)

19 STATEMENT OF FACTS

20 57. On or about December 31, 2021, the City posted the Site Plan Review Agenda for the
21 January 5, 2022 meeting of the Site Plan Review Committee ("SPR Committee") at which the SPR

22 Committee would consider the Project.

23 58. On January 4, 2022, Petitioners submitted a written comment to the SPR Committee.

24 ("January 4 Comment").

25 59. The January 4 Comment noted that the Project should be subject to CEQA because the

26 City's Municipal Code grants the SPR Committee discretion over the Project, including the authority

27 to "[a]pply requirements to a site to protect the public health, safety and general welfare." (VMC
28 17.28.020(B)(2).)

15

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

1 60. The January 4 Comment noted that any reliance on the City's 2014 EIR for its General

2 Plan Update (*2014 General Plan EIR") was misplaced because the 2014 General Plan EIR explicitly

3 stated that it should not be used for the approval of individual projects undertaken subsequent to the

4 Plan's adoption and required site-specific environmental review of the Project's air quality, noise and

5 wildlife impacts.

6 61. The January 4 Comment noted that the City failed to prepare a Local Transportation

7 Analysis ("LTA") or CEQA Transportation Impact Analysis (*VMT Analysis") for the Project as

8 required by the City's "Procedures For Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) (Updated March 2021)."

9 62. On January 5, 2022, the SPR Committee directed the Project's applicant to resubmit
10 its application.

11 63. On or about February 18, 2022, the City posted the Site Plan Review Agenda for the

12 February 23, 2022 meeting of the SPR Committee at which the SPR Committee would again consider

13 the Project.

14 64. On February 22, 2022, Petitioners submitted a written comment to the SPR Committee

15 (*February 22 Comment").

16 65. The February 22 Comment noted that new mitigation measures have become available

17 and/or feasible since certification of the 2014 General Plan EIR to address air quality impacts from

18 warehouse projects, including but not limited to mitigation measures identified by the California

19 Attorney General in California Department of Justice's "Warehouse Projects: Best Practices and

20 Mitigation Measures to Comply with the California Environmental Quality Act." The February 22

21 Comment noted that the availability of these new mitigation measures requires that the City update

22 the 2014 General Plan EIR as required under CEQA Guidelines section 15162.

23 66. On February 23, 2022, the SPR Committee again directed the Project's applicant to

24 resubmit the application.

25 67. On or about April 29, 2022, the City posted the Site Plan Review Agenda for the May
26 4, 2022 meeting of the SPR Committee at which the SPR Committee would again consider the

27 Project.

28

16

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

1 68. On May 3, 2022, Petitioners submitted a written comment to the SPR Committee

2 (*May 3 Comment").

3 69. The May 3 Comment included an analysis of the Project by expert wildlife biologist

4 Dr. Shawn Smallwood, Ph.D. Based on a site visit and available wildlife databases, Dr. Smallwood

5 concluded that at least 76 special-status species either were present or likely to be present on the

6 Project site. Dr. Smallwood concluded that the Project posed potential significant impacts to these

7 species due to the direct destruction of existing habitat, impacts on wildlife movement, and collisions

8 between wildlife and vehicles.

9 70. The May 3 Comment included an analysis of the Project by air quality experts Paul
10 Rosenfeld, Ph.D., and Matt Hagemann, P.G., C.Hg., of the Soil/Water/Air Protection Enterprise

11 (*SWAPE"). SWAPE concluded that the Project exceeds the screening criteria for the industrial land

12 use category established by the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District ("SJVAPCD"),
13 indicating a potentially significant air quality impact. SWAPE also conducted a screening level health
14 risk assessment and concluded that emissions of diesel particulate matter associated with construction

15 and operation of the Project would result in an increased cancer risk for infants of 34.4 in one million,

16 in excess of SJVAPCD's CEQA significance threshold. SWAPE also concluded that the Project's

17 amortized construction-related greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions in combination with the Project's
18 operational GHG emissions exceeded applicable CEQA significance thresholds.

19 71. On May 4, 2022, the SPR Committee directed the Project's applicant to Revise and

20 Proceed.

21 72. On May 12, 2022, Petitioners submitted an appeal to the City to appeal the SPR

22 Committee's May 4, 2022 decision approving the Project to the City's Planning Commission for the
23 reasons stated in Petitioner's written comments on January 4, 2022, February 22, 2022, and May 3,

24 2022. Petitioners submitted the required appeal fee with their appeal.

25 73. On May 16, 2022, Respondent Paul Bernal issued a letter to Petitioners rejecting
26 Petitioners' appeal ("City's Appeal Rejection"). The City's Appeal Rejection stated that Petitioners'
27 appeal it was rejected "on the grounds that it [did] not describe a City standard, policy, or ordinance

28 that was misapplied by City staff in making a determination of the Site Plan Review Permit." The

17

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

1 City's Appeal Rejection claimed that the SPR Committee's decision was not discretionary. The

2 City's Appeal Rejection also claimed that the Project's impacts would be mitigated by the 2014

3 General Plan EIR. The City's Appeal Rejection indicated that the City would be returning

4 Petitioners' appeal fee.

5

6 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
(Code of Civil Procedure § 1085 Writ of Mandate; abuse of discretion in rejecting
7 administrative appeal of Site Plan Review Permit)

8 74. All of the above paragraphs are incorporated herein by reference as if set forth again in

9 full.

10 75. Respondent Bernal, in his capacity as Director of the City's Community Development

11 Department, and Respondent Planning Commission violated their ministerial duty to accept

12 Petitioners' appeal of the Site Plan Review Permit for the Project and to place the appeal on the

13 Planning Commission agenda as specified by VMC 17.28.050 and for Respondent Planning

14 Commission to hear the appeal.

15 76. Respondent Bernal, in his capacity as Director of the City's Community Development

16 Department, further committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion when, via correspondence dated May

17 16, 2022, he rejected Petitioners' appeal of the Site Plan Review Committee's actions regarding the

18 Project. Respondent Bernal erred as a matter of law by incorrectly inferring that, in order to be

19 accepted, an appeal pursuant to VMC § 17.28.050 was required to "describe a City standard, policy,

20 or ordinance that was misapplied by City staff in making a determination of the Site Plan Review

21 Permit." Even assuming there was such a requirement, Respondent Bernal further erred in
22 determining that Petitioners did not cite any City standard, policy, or ordinance that had been violated |

23 despite the alleged inconsistencies with the SPR Committee's ordinance, the TIA Procedures,

24 General Plan Policy AQ-P-9, and the 2014 General Plan EIR.

25 77. Petitioners are prejudiced by Respondent Bernal's arbitrary refusal to allow Petitioners

26 to present their appeal to the City's Planning Commission and Respondent Planning Commission's

27 failure to place the appeal on its agenda and hear the appeal. Petitioners met each of the prerequisites

28 for filing an appeal of the decision of the SPR Committee set forth at VMC $ 17.28.050. Petitioners
were denied the opportunity to prepare and provide meaningful written and oral comments to the 18

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

1 Planning Commission on the Project regarding the Project's potential significant impacts on

2 Petitioners and the environment and its consistency with the City's traffic analysis requirements.

3 78. For these reasons, the Court should issue a writ of mandate pursuant to Code of Civil

4 Procedure 1085 mandating that Respondents process Petitioners' appeal by placing it on the

5 Planning Commission's agenda and conduct the necessary review of the appeal and staying the City's

6 approvals of the Project pending the completion of the City's administrative appeal proceedings.

7

8 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
(Code of Civil Procedure § 1085 Writ of Mandate; CEQA § PRC §§ 21168.5 - abuse of
9 discretion in claiming ministerial exemption to CEQA)

10 79. All of the above paragraphs are incorporated herein by reference as if set forth again in
11 full.

12 80. Respondents violated CEQA by failing to conduct any environmental review of the

13 construction and operation of Real Parties in Interest's 320,000 square feet office/warehouse building
14 prior to issuing a Site Plan Review Permit and allowing the Project to proceed to apply for building
15 permits on May 4, 2022.

16 81. Real Parties in Interest's 320,000 square feet office/warehouse building is a project as
17 that term is defined by CEQA.

18 82. Petitioners allege that the Respondents abused their discretion and failed to act in the

19 manner required by law in violation of CEQA and Code Civ. Proc. § 1085 by claiming that the

20 project is ministerial and exempt from CEQA. Respondents' failure to conduct environmental review
21 of the Project violated CEQA, inter alia, because (1) the Project is not ministerial and therefore the
22 exemption was improper and (2) the City erroneously completed no initial study and made no effort

23 pursuant to CEQA to characterize any potentially significant environmental impacts, including
24 traffic, air pollution, hazardous materials, wildlife impacts, cumulative impacts, growth inducing
25 impacts, or land use impacts of the Project.

26 83. Respondents abused their discretion and failed to act in the manner required by law by
27 failing to conduct any environmental review under CEQA in conjunction with the Project. For these
28

19

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

1 reasons, the a Court should issue a writ of mandate vacating the approvals of the Project and directing

2 the City to comply with CEQA.

3

4 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION
(Code of Civil Procedure § 1085 Writ of Mandate; Project inconsistency with
5 City's General Plan)

6 84. All of the above paragraphs are incorporated herein by reference as if set forth again in

7 full.

8 85. Respondents abused their discretion by approving the Project despite the Project's

9 inconsistency with General Plan Policy AQ-P-9 and its inclusion as a mitigation measure in the 2014

10 General Plan EIR.

11 86. General Plan Policy AQ-P-9 directs the City to "[c]ontinue to mitigate short-term
12 construction impacts and long-term stationary source impacts on air quality on a case-by-case basis
13 and continue to assess air quality impacts through environmental review" as well as "[r]equire
14 developers to implement Best Management Practices (BMPs) to reduce air pollutant emissions
15 associated with the construction and operation of development projects." (See, e.g., 2014 General
16 Plan EIR, p. 3.3-26.)

17 87. Respondents failed to perform any Project-specific analysis regarding the Project's

18 construction impacts and long-term stationary source impacts on air quality.

19 88. Respondents failed to require Real Party in Interest to implement BMPs to reduce air

20 pollutant emissions associated with the construction and operation of the Project.
21 89. For these reasons, the Court should issue a writ of mandate vacating the approvals of
22 the Project and directing the City to comply with General Plan Policy AQ-P-9 prior to approval of the

23 Project.

24

25 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION
(Code of Civil Procedure 8 1085 Writ of Mandate; violation of duty and an abuse of discretion
26 for failure to comply with City's TIA Procedures)

27 90. All of the above paragraphs are incorporated herein by reference as if set forth again in
28 full.

20

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

1 91. The City's TIA Procedures require the preparation of a full TIA for, inter alia,

2 "[d]evelopments (nonresidential) which generate 100 or more peak hour trips but fewer than 500

3 trips." (TIA Procedures, p. 3.) Petitioners are informed and believe and thereupon allege that the

4 Project will generate more than 100 passenger car equivalent trips ("PCEs") during the AM peak

5 hour between 8 and 9 AM and between 6 and 7 PM. 7 Pursuant to the City's TIA Procedures, a Traffic

6 Impact Analysis must be prepared for the Project.

7 92. In approving the Project, the Site Plan Review Committee's decision not to require the

8 applicant to prepare and the Committee to consider a Traffic Impact Analysis is contrary to the City's
procedures and an abuse of discretion. By foregoing a Traffic Impact Analysis, the Site Plan Review

10 Committee abused its discretion and violated the Committee's duties pursuant to VMC §

11 17.28.020(B)(1) and (2) requiring the Committee to review the Project's site plan review permit
12 application for consistency with, inter alia, the "policies, regulations, and improvement standards of

13 the city" and to "[a]pply requirements to a site a to protect the public health, safety and general

14 welfare."

15 93. Petitioners are prejudiced by the City's arbitrary refusal to prepare a traffic impact
16 analysis consistent with the City's policies, As a result, Petitioners and, in the case of LIUNA Local

17 294, its members are threatened with excessive traffic and driving risks in the vicinity of the Project

18 because the Project's direct and cumulative traffic impacts have not been properly evaluated by the

19 City.

20 94. For this reason, the a Court should issue a writ of mandate pursuant to Code of Civil
21 Procedure § 1085 mandating that the SPR Committee vacate its actions regarding the Project taken at

22 its May 4, 2022 meeting.
23

24 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION
(Code of Civil Procedure § 1085 Writ of Mandate; CEQA § PRC §§ 21168.5 - abuse of
25 discretion in relying on 2014 General Plan EIR)

26 95. All of the above paragraphs are incorporated herein by reference as if set forth again in
27 full.

28

21

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

1 96. Respondents abused their discretion by relying on the 2014 General Plan EIR to

2 mitigate the Project's potentially significant impacts because new mitigation measures have become

3 available and/or feasible since certification of the 2014 General Plan EIR to address air quality

4 impacts from warehouse projects, including but not limited to mitigation measures identified by the

5 California Attorney General in California Department of Justice's "Warehouse Projects: Best

6 Practices and Mitigation Measures to Comply with the California Environmental Quality Act."

97. Public Resources Code section 21166 and Cal. Code Regs, tit. 14, section 15162

8 require that the City update the 2014 General Plan EIR because the City has failed to adopt mitigation
measures that are now feasible and/or materially different than the measures adopted in the 2014

10 General Plan EIR. (Pub Res. Code § 21166; 14 CCR § 15162(a)(3).)

11 98. Cal. Code Regs, tit. 14, section 15168 prohibits Respondents from relying on the 2014

12 General Plan EIR to determine that no further CEQA review of the Project is required because the

13 City has failed to adopt mitigation measures that are now feasible and/or materially different than the

14 measures adopted in the 2014 General Plan EIR. (14 CCR § 15168(c)(2).)

15 99. Due to the availability of new mitigation measures that are now feasible and/or
16 materially different than the measures adopted in the 2014 General Plan EIR, the Court should issue a
17 writ of mandate directing Respondents to update the 2014 General Plan EIR prior to relying on it to
18 adequately mitigate the Project's potentially significant impacts.

19

20 SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION
(Injunctive and Declaratory Relief Against Respondents and Real Parties in Interest)
21 100. All of the above paragraphs are incorporated herein by reference as if set forth again in
22 full.
23 101. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law. Unless enjoined,
24 Respondents and Real Parties in Interest will implement the Project despite Respondents' lack of
25 compliance with CEQA. Petitioners will suffer irreparable harm due to Respondents' failure to take
26 the steps required by CEQA to protect the environment.
27 PRAYER
28 WHEREFORE, Petitioners and Plaintiffs pray that the Court:

22

1 1. Issue a declaratory judgment declaring that:

2 a. Respondents' failed their ministerial duty to place Petitioners' appeal of the Site

3 Plan Review Committee's decision on the Planning Commission's agenda and for
A the Planning Commission to hear the appeal;
5 b. Respondents' approval of the Project is null and void and contrary to law;
6
C. The Site Plan Review Committee's approval of the Project is a discretionary action
7 subject to the requirements of CEQA;
8 d. Respondents violated CEQA by failing to prepare an initial study and an 9
appropriate environmental review document for the Project. 10
11 e. Respondents abused their discretion in approving the Project despite its

12 inconsistency with General Plan Policy AQ-P-9; and

s f. Respondents abused their discretion by failing to conduct a traffic impact analysis
14 as required by the City's TIA Procedures;

15 g. Respondents violated CEQA by relying on the 2014 General Plan EIR to mitigate

16 the Project's potentially significant impacts despite new mitigation measures that

17 are feasible and/or considerably different since certification of the 2014 General

18 Plan EIR;

19 2. Issue a peremptory writ of mandate directing Respondents to set aside any and all

20 approvals of the Project, including but not limited to the Site Plan Review Permit and

21 any other decision to proceed, unless and until Respondents have prepared, circulated,

22 and considered a legally adequate CEQA document and ensured compliance with
23 General Plan Policy AQ-P-9 prior to any subsequent approval action.
24 3. Issue a peremptory writ of mandate directing Respondents and Real Party in Interest to
25 suspend all activity in furtherance of the Project and to refrain from taking or 26 authorizing any activities in furtherance of the Project, including the issuance of any
27
building or grading permits, unless and until Respondents comply fully with the City's 28
appeal procedures, CEQA, the 2014 General Plan EIR, the City's General Plan, and
