INTRODUCTION
27

28 1. Through this action, Penman Springs Neighborhood Group
/("Petitioner") challenges the County of San Luis Obispo's ("County") approval of

VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY
AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 1-

Minor Use Permit No. DRC2018-00228 for a cannabis cultivation and processing

2 facility known as "SLOCAL Roots," "SloBloom Farms" and/or "Bloomfield Farms"

3 (the "Project") and subsequent denial of Petitioner's appeal to the San Luis Obispo

4 County Board of Supervisors ("BOS").

5 2. The mitigated negative declaration ("MND") prepared by the County

6 for the Project violates the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") and fails

7 as informational document because it (1) does not provide adequate analysis of the

8 Project or its potential impacts, (2) was not properly recirculated, and (3)
impermissibly defers formulation of mitigation measures. Furthermore, the County

10 abused its discretion when it conditionally approved the MUP and MND because

11 the associated findings are not supported by substantial evidence.
Babak Naficy 3.
12 If the approvals are not set aside, the surrounding community,
adjacent property owners, and especially the already critically endangered Paso
13 Robles Groundwater Basin will be irreparably harmed by the County's failure to
14

6 adequately analyze and weigh the myriad of potentially significant environmental
15
90!J0 MD] impacts that may be caused by the Project.
16 THE PARTIES

17 4. Petitioner and plaintiff NEIGHORS OF PENMAN SPRINGS
18 ("Neighbors") is an unincorporated association whose members are residents and
19 property owners/occupiers in northern San Luis Obispo County. Neighbors'
20 members are concerned about environment quality in general and in particular
21 about the Paso Robles Groundwater Basin on which they and their community

22 depend.

23 5. Petitioner and plaintiff CHRISTINA MALDONADO (collectively with

24 Neighbors "Petitioners") is an individual who lives and works in the vicinity of the

25 Project in northern San Luis Obispo County and is concerned about the Project's

26 potential environmental impacts in general and on the Paso Robles Groundwater

27 Basin in particular.

28 6. Respondent and defendant COUNTY OF SAN LUIS OBISPO
"County") is a local government agency with the authority to regulate and

VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY
AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 2.

administer land use and development within the County of San Luis Obispo,

2 California, but only in compliance with the duly adopted provisions of its zoning

3 ordinances, General Plan, Community Plans, County Code, and all applicable

4 provisions of state law, including the California Environmental Quality Act

5 ("CEQA") and the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act ("SGMA").

6 7. Respondent and defendant SAN LUIS OBISPO COUNTY BOARD OF

7 SUPERVISORS ("BOS" or, collectively with County, "Respondents") is the

8 legislative body and highest administrative body in the County. The BOS has the

9 authority to approve or disapprove proposed development applications and other
land use entitlements.
10
8. Petitioners do not know the identity of DOES 1 to 10 but will amend
Babak Naficy 11

12 the Petition as required to specifically identify each such person or entity as a
respondent and defendant if the identity, interest, and capacity of such party, if
13 any, becomes known.
14 9.
6 The Notice of Determination lists Project Applicant as Austen
15
00!J0 MD] Connella/ SLO BF, INC ("Applicant"). Therefore, consistent with Public Resources
16 Code section 21167.6.5, AUSTEN CONNELLA, acting as the chief executive officer
17 of SLO BF, Inc, and SLO BF, Inc. are real parties in interest.

18 10. Petitioners do not know the identity of ROES 11 to 20 but will amend
19 the Petition as required to specifically identify each such person or entity as a

20 respondent and defendant if the identity, interest, and capacity of such party, if

21 any becomes known.

22 JURISDICTION A D VENUE

23 11. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to California

24 Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5, and Public Resources Code

25 section 21167. This Court has the authority to issue a writ of mandate directing

26 Respondents to vacate and set aside their approval of the Project under the Code of

27 Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5. This Court also has authority to award

28 attorney's fees and costs under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5 where, as
here, Petitioners seek to enforce important rights affecting the public interest.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 3.

12.

2 Venue for this action properly lies in the Superior Court of San Luis

3 Obispo County because Respondents are the County of San Luis Obispo and its

4 highest legislative body and because the action concerns the approval of a Project
concerning real property entitlements in San Luis Obispo County.

5 PROCEDURAL ALLEGATIONS

6 13.

7 Petitioners have performed any and all conditions precedent to filing

8 the instant action and have exhausted any and all administrative remedies to the

9 extent required by law, by inter alia, opposing the Project in written and oral
comments and filing an appeal to the County Board of Supervisors. Petitioners

10 informed the County of their intention to formally challenge this Project in writing.

Law Office of Babak Naficy 11 14. Petitioners have complied with the requirements of Code of Civil

12 Procedure section 388 by mailing a copy of the Petition and Complaint to the

13 Attorney General of the State of California.

14 15. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the ordinary

15 course of law unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require

16 Respondents to comply with their duties and set aside the City's unlawful approval

17 of the Project. In the absence of such remedies, Respondents' approval will remain

18 in effect in violation of CEQA and other state and local laws.

16.

19 If Respondents are not enjoined from approving the Project and
undertaking and/or permitting acts in furtherance thereof, Petitioners, Neighbors'
20 members, and the residents of San Luis Obispo County, particularly those who
21

22 depend on the Paso Robles Groundwater Basin, will suffer irreparable harm from
which there is no adequate remedy at law.

23 17.

24 In pursuing this action. which involves enforcement of important

25 rights affecting the public interest, Petitioners will confer a substantial benefit on

26 the general public, including citizens of San Luis Obispo County and the State of
California, and therefore will be entitled to attorney's fees and costs pursuant to,

27 inter alia, Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5.

28 18. Petitioners bring this action in part pursuant to Public Resources Code
sections 21167, 21168, and/or 21168.5, Code of Civil Procedure section 1085, and/or

VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY
AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 4-

Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5, which require that an agency's approval of a
project be set aside if the

3 agency has prejudicially abused its discretion. Prejudicial
abuse of discretion occurs either where an agency has failed to proceed in a manner
required by law or where its determination or decision is not supported by
substantial evidence. Respondents have prejudicially abused their discretion

6 because the County failed to proceed in the manner required by law and/or the

7 County's findings and factual conclusions are not supported by substantial

8 evidence.

9 FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

10 19. In December 2018, Applicant sought an MUP from San Luis Obispo

Law Office of Babak Naficy 11 County Department of Planning and Building to develop a cannabis cultivation and

12 processing facility (the "Project"). The Project is located at 1255 Penman Springs

13 Road, Assessor's Parcel Number ("APN") 020-161-009 (the "Project Site"),

14 approximately one mile east of Paso Robles city limits in an unincorporated area of

15 northern San Luis Obispo County, California.
20.
16 The Project Site is a 52.91-acre parcel with an existing residence and

17 several agricultural buildings. Its land use category is agricultural, and it is within

18 the North County Planning Area, El Pomar-Estrella Sub Area. Adjacent properties

19 are primarily under agricultural use as well, including vineyards and ranches.
21.

20 According to the County's staff report to the May 3, 2022 BOS appeal

21 hearing, the three-phase Project (as revised in 2021 and/or 2022 to somewhat

22 reduce its scope) would disturb a total of about 6.5 acres of the Project Site and

23 ultimately result in: (1) 3.29 acres outdoor cannabis cultivation area; (2) 27,360

24 square feet ("SF") indoor cannabis cultivate area; (3) 10,800 SF indoor ancillary

25 nursery area; (4) 6,000 SF indoor cannabis processing facility; and approximately

26 25,000 SF of related improvements including areas for composting/recycling, water
storage, drainage basins, parking, etc.

27 22. The Project will draw its considerable and ongoing water needs from

28 an on-site well which in turn draws from the Paso Robles Groundwater Basin
("Paso Basin"). Groundwater levels in the Paso Basin have been in serious decline

VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY
AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 5-

for decades and are now considered critically depleted. Surrounding properties have

2 already experienced significant groundwater issues in recent years, including

3 declining water levels which have caused wells to run dry and forced adjacent
4 property owners to redrill new wells in alternate locations.

5 23. An initial study ("IS") was prepared by the County. The IS concluded

6 that the Project had the potential to cause a variety of significant environment

7 impacts on the environment, but that each of those impacts could be mitigated

8 below the threshold of significance. A mitigated negative declaration ("MND") was

9 prepared accordingly.

10 The County Planning Department Hearing Officer considered the Project

Babak Naficy 11 application at a hearing on November 20, 2020. Members of the public, including

12 surrounding property owners and members of Neighbors of Penman Springs,
opposed the Project based on environmental concerns, including but not limited to,
13 the Project's impacts on groundwater in local wells as well its overall impacts on the
14 increasingly fragile Paso Basin. The Hearing Officer approved the MUP, subject to
15
90!0 MD] various findings and conditions, on November 20, 2020. Several important
16  environmental concerns were not discussed or referred to during the hearing. These
17 include Air Quality (Cannabis Odor Impacts on Neighboring Properties) and Paso

18 Basin Hydrology and Drought Conditions that have resulted in well failures.

19 24. Some of Petitioner's members ("Appellants") timely appealed the MUP
20 approval on December 4, 2020. The initial appeal date, April 20, 2021, was

21 continued at the request of Appellants and/or Applicant to July 13, 2021. Applicant

22 requested another continuance, claiming that they wanted to revise the Project to

23 address concerns raised by Appellants. The BOS granted the continuance over

24 Appellants' objections.

25 25. Apparently, only two days before the initial appeal hearing, on April

26 18, 2021, the County Staff produced a memorandum entitled "Additional

27 Information to the Mitigated Negative Declaration for DRC2018-00228 /ED19-238

28 (SCH# 2020090567)," (the "Memorandum") documenting a large number of project
revisions, described below. Somewhat inconsistently, the County's May 3, 2022,

VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY
AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 6-

staff report to the BOS claims that the Applicant revised the project beginning in

2 July 2021 and the County's "Permit View" system reflects that a number of

3 additional Project documents with dates ranging from the second half of 2021

4 through the beginning of 2022 were uploaded in April 2022. Planning Staff,
moreover, consistently told the public that Project revisions were not made until
August 2021. The final version of the MND, including the April 18, 2021
Memorandum, was not provided to the public until April of 2022. Additional revised

8 "Plans" were provided before the May 3, 2022 BOS hearing. The project operating

9 plan posted as a May 3, 2022 hearing agenda item document is identified as a

10 Bloomfield Farms SLO Cal Roots Project with the comment "Supplemental
Development Information" revised November 2021.
Law Office of Babak Naficy 11
26.
12 Regardless, it is clear that at some point the Applicant submitted
updated project materials and additional supporting information including:
13 (1) Revised Project Description;
14 (2) Revised Site Plan;
15 (3) Odor Management Plan and various odor studies;
16 (4) Water Demand Estimate and Water Management Plan;
17 (5) Neighborhood Compatibility Plan; and

18 (6) Estimated Energy Demand Analysis.

19 27. Project components that were revised include:

20 (1) Outdoor cultivation canopy was reduced from 2.96 acres to 2.63
588&Y acres;

(2) Indoor cultivation area was reduced from 27,500 SF to 27,360 SF;
(3) Ancillary nursery canopy was reduced from 34,800 SF to 10,800 SF;
(4) Drainage basin and agriculture ("Ag") pond area were reduced from

25 14,500 SF to 9,000 SF;

26 (5) Water storage area increased from 600 SF to 2,000 SF; and

27 (6) Project disturbance area increased from 6.2 acres to 6.5 acres.
28.
28 The County's May 3, 2022 staff report attempts to excuse the County's
failure to recirculate the MND by claiming that recirculation was not required

VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY
AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 7-

pursuant to CEQA Guideline (14 CCR § 15000, et seq) section 15073.5 because "the

2 information does not identify a new, avoidable significant effect, mitigation
3 measure(s), or project revision that would reduce one or more significant impacts to

4 a level of insignificance."

29. The BOS heard the appeal on May 3, 2022. Environmental issues
discussed during the appeal and addressed by the MND and conditions of approval
include:

(1) Aesthetics;

9 (2) Air Quality, including but not limited to odor management;

10 (3) Biological Resources, including various special status species;

11 (4) Energy;
Babak Naficy (5) Greenhouse Emissions;
12 (6) Hazards/Hazardous Materials;
13 (7) Hydrology and Water Quality; and
14 (8) Noise.
6 15
90!0 MD] 30. Appellants and members of the public raised myriad issues and
16 concerns about the Project's environmental impact and the County's inadequate
17 analysis of those impacts, including the following: (1) the County's failure to publish

18 the Project application materials for public review prior to the November 20, 2020

19 hearing; (2) the Project's incompatibility with the surrounding neighborhood and
20 community and misleading description of the Project's setting; (3) the Project's
21 noncompliance with amendments to the County's cannabis regulations which

22 became effective November 6, 2020; (4) the MND's false and misleading conclusions

23 regarding the level of significance of Project impacts, inadequate analysis and

24 impermissible deferral of the formulation of mitigation measures, and incomplete

25 Project description; and (5) the lack of substantial evidence to support various

26 findings and conditions of approval related to the MUP and MND and the existencel

27 of a fair argument that the Project may result in significant environmental impacts
both on its own and cumulatively.
28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 8-

31. Public comments submitted by community members and neighboring

2 property owners to the BOS in advance of the appeal hearing were largely in

3 opposition to the Project. They cited concerns about its potential odor,

4 incompatibility with and deleterious effect on the surrounding community,

5 increased noise and traffic, safety concerns, etc.
32. The public's most urgent concern, however, was the Project's impacts 6

7 on the Paso Basin in general, and the neighboring wells in particular. The public

8 expressed grave concerns about the ongoing and worsening drought and the status

9 of the Paso Basin which is already in critical overdraft. Many neighbors pointed out

10 that their adjacent properties were already suffering from dried-up wells and acute
groundwater issues which would invariably be made more severe by the Project's
AOyON XDqD9 ! 11 considerable water needs.
12 33. The BOS ultimately denied the appeal and approved the MUP, subject
13 to various conditions and mitigation measures--many of which simply consist of
14 /performing additional analysis. The County issued a Notice of Determination
6 15
00!!0 MD] ("NOD") for the MND which was recorded on May 4, 2022.
16 34. Petitioner, by and through its attorney, sent a notice of intent to file
17 suit to Respondents County and BOS.

18 WATER SUPPLY ISSUES

19 35. The MND claims the Paso Basin is no longer in an Area of Severe
20 Decline. However, the Governor of California has declared the entire state to be in a
21 | prolonged drought and recent reports have indicated that the Paso Robles
22 Groundwater Basin is experiencing severe drought.

23 36. The May 3, 2022, staff report ("Staff Report") claimed that "[p]er
24 Section 22.40.050(D)(5) of the San Luis Obispo County Code ("SLOCC"), cannabis
25 projects located in an LOSI III basin are required to offset water use at a 1:1 ratio,

26

27

28 The San Luis Obispo Integrated Regional Water Management Plan defines Level of Severity ("LOS") III as a groundwater basin where "resource capacity has been met or exceeded."
VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY
AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 9-

1 and projects located in an Area of Severe Decline shall offset at a 2:1 ratio." Staff

2 Report at p 6. The MND repeats this claim. MND at p. 93. This is misleading and

3 inaccurate as the actual text of the SLOCC provides that "[a]ll water demand

4 within a groundwater basin at Level of Severity III shall offset at a minimum 1:1

5 ratio, unless a greater offset is required through land use permit approval."

6 SLOCC § 22.40.050(D)(5). The SLOCC thus clearly required the BOS to consider

7 whether a greater mitigation ratio than 1:1 is appropriate according to the

8 circumstances. This misleading statement is also repeated in the
37.
9 The Project as originally approved at the November 20, 2020, Planning|

10 Officer hearing was required to comply with a 2:1 Basin water offset regardless of

Babak Naficy 11 whether the project was located in a basin designated as an Area of Severe Decline

12 or not. This Condition was also approved by the BOS during the May 3, 2022
Appeal hearing. The final approved conditions of approval No. 44 b. that states in
13 part that "In the event that the site is later removed from an area of Severe Decline,
14 the project will still be required to offset water at 2:1 ratio".
6 15
90!0 MD] 38. The MND and Staff Report both report that "A pump test was
16 completed for the project in December 2018 and showed a sustained yield of 16
17 gallons per minute." This pump test, however, did not measure the impact of
18 pumping at maximum capacity on neighboring wells. The record shows that a

19 number of wells in the Project's vicinity have failed since the 2018 pump test.

20 39. The MND initially estimated the Project's water demand as 7.35 acre
21 feet per year ("AFY"). MND at p. 96. The Staff Report claims the original estimate

22 was "decreased due to the reduction in outdoor canopy and ancillary nursery

23 canopy" to 5.96 AFY. Staff Report at p. 6.

24 40. The MND's estimate of the Project's water demand is based on the

25 assumption that outdoor cannabis cultivation will only require 0.03 gallons of water

26 per square feet and 0.1 gallons of water per each square feet of canopy for indoor

27 grow operations. MND at p. 95. These estimates, however, were based on a 2017

28 Santa Cruz County Draft Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") for the Commercial
Cannabis Cultivation and Manufacturing Regulations and Licensing Program and a

VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY
AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 10-

1

2 Study conducted in Humboldt County by Milewide Nursery. A comment letter

3 submitted to the County on behalf of Petitioners pointed out that the County could

4 not reasonably rely on these estimates because the climate conditions at the Project

5 site are substantially different compared to the climate conditions in Humboldt
County where the study was conducted.

6 41.

7 Reliance on the Santa Cruz County EIR, moreover, was misplaced

8 because the Milewide Study, on which the Santa Cruz EIR relied, estimated water

9 usage per plant, but the Santa Cruz EIR incorrectly converted these estimates to

10 water usage per square foot of canopy. According to this incorrect analysis, outdoor

Babak Naficy 11 cannabis plants can grow to maturity using only half a cup of water per square foot

12 per day, even during spring and hot summer months in the Paso Robles region. As

13 Petitioner's comment letter indicated, this conclusion is patently absurd.
42.

14 Credible analysis submitted to the County by the public shows that a

6 15 more realistic estimate of cannabis demand shows that cannabis cultivation in

Law Office California requires six gallons of water per square foot of cannabis plant.
43.

16

17 The County's mitigation requirement for impacts on groundwater was
not based on a concrete water management plan. Instead, the County imposed

18 water mitigation as a condition of the MUP but impermissibly deferred the exact

19 formulation of the water conservation plan. The mitigation measure provides a

20 menu of options. The MND does not adequately analyze the feasibility and efficacy

21 of the various options open to the applicant.

22 44. ENERGY DEMAND REVISIONS

23 The MND originally estimated the Project's energy demand to be

24 12,460,000 kilowatt hours per year ("KWH/YR")). As set forth above, at some point

25 in 2021 and/or 2022, Applicant submitted additional information and estimates and

26 reduced the size of the project. As the County's Memorandum explained, based on

27 these new calculations, the new Project energy estimate claimed "the project's

28 estimated energy use based on the site design and proposed equipment (In Balance

AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY
11-

Green Consulting; August 12, 20212)" was reduced by an order of magnitude, to

2 985,052 KWH/YR.

3 45. The MND explained that the Project as proposed would have a
4 potentially significant impact due to wasteful, inefficient, or unnecessary
5 consumption of energy resources during operation "if it utilizes significantly more

6 energy (greater than 20%) than a typical commercial building of the same size."

7 MND at p. 74. Because the Project's original energy estimate was almost 12 times

8 the estimated energy demand of a typical commercial building of the same size

9 (1,129,650 KWH/YR), the MND concluded that the Project would have a significant
impact.
10
46.
Babak Naficy 11 In light of the new vastly reduced energy consumption estimates, the
MND Memorandum concluded that the Project would use less energy than a
12 commercial building of the same size. The Memorandum claimed, however, "the
13 lestimate in the MND is based on a more conservative worst-case scenario and
14 allows the applicant flexibility should there be equipment changes at the time of
6
00!J0 M0T 15 I construction. Therefore, the project is still required to comply with the mitigation
16 measures stated in the MND, which will result in less than significant impacts with
17 mitigation incorporated."

18 NOISE ANALYSIS AND MITIGATION ISSUES

19 47. The revised MND Appendix A claims that:

20 The new information does not result in the identification of
21 new impacts, but it does support the conclusions in the
22 MND that County noise thresholds might be exceeded at
the property line, which is a potentially significant impact.
23 To further strengthen the mechanism for ensuring noise

24 mitigation measures are implemented, mitigation measure N-1 has been amended to require a qualified noise

25 consultant to prepare and submit a report that

26

27

28 2 The fact that the "4/18/2021" Memorandum references analysis that was conducted in August 21, 2021, clearly shows that the earlier date is clearly inaccurate, suggesting that the Memorandum was backdated.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY
AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 12-

1 demonstrates the final equipment selection for air

2 conditioning, ventilation, and odor management complies with the County's noise thresholds. With the revisions to
3 N-1, impacts will be less than significant with mitigation
v incorporated.

5 48. The May 3, 2022 Appeal Hearing 23 page Staff Report (at page 13)

6 makes the following comments:

7 4f. Noise. Staff Response: The analysis of potential noise impacts is provided in Section XIII of the MND. The
8 analysis concludes that noise associated with proposed
9 cannabis activities, such as HVAC and odor controls, will
exceed the average hourly nighttime County noise
10 standard at the nearest property line based on a noise level of 85 dBA located 25 feet from the source. The MND
00!J0 MDT f Babak Naficy 11 recommends a mitigation measure (included as Condition
12 Number 67) that requires the noise associated with air
conditioning, ventilation, and odor management to be 13 enclosed or screened to ensure that County standards for
14 nighttime noise levels are satisfied at the property lines.
" This would include all associated equipment, including
15 fans. To provide additional clarity that ensures compliance

16 with this mitigation measure, Condition Number 67 has
been revised to require a qualified noise consultant to
17 prepare and submit a report that demonstrates the final equipment selection for air conditioning, ventilation, and 18 odor management complies with the County's noise
19 thresholds. (Emphasis added.)

20 49. Based on the foregoing, Condition of Approval #67 was modified to say:

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

5 (Violation of CEQA)

51. Petitioner incorporates by reference each and every allegation
7 contained in the preceding paragraphs of this Petition as though fully set forth

8 herein.

9 52. The County violated CEQA by certifying an MND that does not meet
10| the standards set by CEQA and fails as an informational document. The following is
6 Law Office of Babak Naficy 11 a non-exhaustive list of aspects of the MND that violate CEQA:

12 The MND fails to assess the significance of the Project's

13 potential odor impact based on the assertion that the County

14 could not identify any "objective" standards for odor;

15 The MND fails to discuss or identify any adequate and

16 meaningful mitigation to address cannabis odor that is expected |

17 from 2.63 acres of outdoor cannabis cultivation to protect

18 neighboring residences and businesses, some of whom are
located less than 1000 feet from the Project site.
19 The County failed to recirculate the MND for public comments
20 despite the fact that the applicant submitted substantial new
188 & information and project revisions, which the County described
only in cursory fashion in a memorandum that was simply
attached to the MND;
The MND fails to adequately analyze the Project's potential
25 impact on water supplies, including the potential impacts on
26 water wells at neighboring properties that are rely entirely on
27 groundwater for their domestic and agricultural needs;

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY
AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 14-

The MND fails to consider, discuss, or propose any adequate

2 mitigation measures to ensure the Project's potential impact on
UJ neighboring wells is less than significant;

A The MND impermissibly and unlawfully defers the formulation
4o of various mitigation measures, including the 2:1 water supply
mitigation. The MND does not include an adequate analysis of

7 the feasibility and efficacy of the various water-saving options

8 that are open to the applicant;

9 The MND does not explain why the water supply mitigation
plan could not be developed and approved by the County prior to

AyON MPqDS / Law Office 11 project approval;

12 The MND fails to adequately analyze, discuss, and estimate the
Project's greenhouse gas emissions; and
13 The MND fails to include a discussion of the feasibility and
14
5 efficacy of mitigation measures that will be employed to reduce
15 the significance of the Project's greenhouse gas emissions to an
16 insignificant level.
17 The County failed to recirculate the MND despite the many
18 substantial revisions, including but not limited to substantially

19 revised energy demand calculations.

20 53. The County also violated CEQA by failing to prepare an environmental
21 impact report ("EIR") despite the fact it can be fairly argued, based on substantial

22 evidence, that the Project may have one or more significant impacts on the

23 environment, including impacts on noise, air quality, odor, water resources, and

24 climate change.

3 54. Petitioner incorporates by reference each and every allegation

5 herein.

6 55. Some of the Count's findings in support of the Project are not
7 supported by substantial evidence. The following is a non-exhaustive list of such

8 findings:
o 2= g The conclusion that the Project's impact on water supplies will be less
than significant is not supported by substantial evidence;

Law '5 Office of Babak Naficy The MND's analysis, calculations and conclusions with respect to the
Project's water demand are not supported by substantial evidence;
13 The conclusion that with mitigation, the impact associated with the

14 Project's noise levels will be less than significant is not supported by

15 substantial evidence; and

16 The conclusion that the Project's odor impact will be reduced to a less a

17 than significant with mitigation is not supported by substantial
evidence.

19 WHEREFORE, Petitioners prey for judgment against Respondents, as set
forth below.
