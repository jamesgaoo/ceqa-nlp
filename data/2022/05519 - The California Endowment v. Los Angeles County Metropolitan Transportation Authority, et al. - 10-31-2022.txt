FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED
1 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Petitioner The California Endowment, a California Nonprofit Public Benefit
2 Corporation ("The Endowment"), brings this Petition for a Writ of Mandate, seeking
3 review and relief from the decisions of Respondent, Los Angeles County Metropolitan
4 |Transportation Authority ("Metro") to approve, without public disclosure and/or
5 involvement, a sole source determination to proceed with Real Party-in-Interest's Aerial

6 Rapid Transit Technologies, LLC's ("ARTT"') unsolicited proposal for a multi-million
7 dollar project involving the proposed use of aerial gondolas to transport individuals from

8 the Forecourt of Union Station, over a public right of way, a metro line, Chinatown, a
9 freeway, and multiple communities, to Dodger Stadium (the "Gondola Project" or
10 "Project"). Following Metro's sole source determination, it entered into a Memorandum of

11 Agreement ("MOA") that restricted its ability to examine competitive proposals through
12 an exclusive negotiating agreement ("ENA") clause. Such sole source approval and ENA
13 restrictions were taken in violation of Metro's own stated policies and procedures, which in
14 turn implement state competitive bidding laws, and, therefore, should be reversed through
15 this Petition brought pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure 1085.
16

17 A. PRELIMINARY STATEMENT

18 1. This Petition involves the determination by Metro to fast track for sole
19 source approval, a multi-million-dollar Gondola Project proposed by ARTT (which was
20 created by McCourt Global which is, in turn, owned by Frank McCourt, the former owner

21 of the Los Angeles Dodgers) in direct violation of Metro's own Unsolicited Proposals
22 Policy (UPP"). Compounding that violation, Metro's unsupported sole source
23 determination enabled this Project to move forward without being subject to the
24 competitive bidding requirements necessary for all significant public transportation
25 projects. Most importantly, all of these critical actions in matters of vital public interest,
26 were taken administratively, without public knowledge, oversight and/or involvement-
27 and all in direct violation of Metro's own procurement policies. Absent immediate judicial
28 review, these initial determinations_which set the course for a major investment of tax-

29 payer funds and direct impacts on the local community, service providers, and property
30 owners (including The Endowment)-will not be reviewable even as the Gondola Project

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED
2 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 proceeds towards the entitlement/construction phase. As such, The Endowment-who has
2 a direct and beneficial interest in this Gondola Project and the surrounding land-seeks
3 judicial review of Metro's arbitrary and capricious decision to pursue the Gondola Project

4 in violation of Metro's own regulations. Further, because the Endowment seeks to protect
5 the interests of its community, and to ensure that local agencies (like Metro) comply with
6 their own laws, the Endowment is beneficially interested and legally permitted to bring
7 this action.

8 2. Making Metro's actions even more suspect is the absolute dearth of
9 publicly available information about the Gondola Project and Metro's determination to
10 pursue it. Indeed, while some members of the public may have heard about the Gondola
11 Project in December 2019, Metro's sole source determination through the Office of
12 Extraordinary Innovation was not disclosed to the public. The Endowment itself was
13 unaware of its existence until September 2021 and only after The Endowment and other
14 organizations sought records regarding the Gondola Project. The Gondola Project,
15 therefore, appears to have all the earmarks of a clandestine, sweetheart deal, carefully
16 sidestepping the significant public engagement, outreach and transparency required of all
17 Metro public transportation projects while simultaneously avoiding the scrutiny and
18 competitive bidding required of private projects. By fast-tracking and sole-sourcing a
19 multi-million-dollar aerial tram through Metro's "Office of Extraordinary Innovation"
20 ("OEI") Metro deprived the public of knowledge and input regarding the Gondola Project

21 as it proceeded through Metro's internal review process.
22 3. Because no immediate and adequate relief is available, and because
23 there are no administrative remedies to exhaust, The Endowment asks this Court to issue

24 a writ of mandate compelling Metro immediately to halt its work on the Gondola Project,
25 including all Metro staff support provided in its role as lead agency for the Project, and to
26 terminate its sole source contract with ARTT. At a bare minimum, the determination that
27 the Gondola Project could proceed as a sole source project must be revisited and reversed,
28 thereby ensuring that the Gondola Project will be subject to public review, oversight and a
29 competitive bidding process.

1 B. GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

2 1. The Parties

3 4. Petitioner The California Endowment ("The Endowment") is a
4 nonprofit public benefit corporation organized under the laws of the State of California.
5 The Endowment was created in 1996 as a private foundation dedicated to expanding

6 access to affordable quality health care for underserved individuals and communities and
7 promoting fundamental improvement in the health of all Californians. The Endowment,

8 furthers its mission to promote greater health and racial equity by awarding grants to
9 non-profit organizations located in communities throughout California. The Endowment's
10 headquarters are located at 1000 N. Alameda St., Los Angeles, California (the "The
11 Endowment Headquarters"). At this location The Endowment's staff distributes over 1500
12 grants to charitable organizations each year, provides below-market office space to local
13 non-profit organizations that serve the greater Los Angeles community, and most
14 importantly, through The Endowment's Center for Healthy Communities, provides
15 essential meeting, convening and conference space free of charge, to nonprofit
16 organizations, grantees and public sector partners who bring together hundreds of people
17 to work together and further their community-based goals. Every year, The Endowment
18 welcomes over 150,000 guests to its campus. In 2019, The Endowment's Center for

19 Health Communities hosted over 500 Grantee conferences, 700 Government conferences,
20 and 800 non-profit organizational conferences. Thus, The Endowment Headquarters and

21 campus serves as a crucial anchor point for the Los Angeles nonprofit community, where
22 hundreds of individuals travel to and gather on a daily basis to use The Endowment's
23 parking lot, office space, and conference center.

24 5. Respondent Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation
25 Authority ("Metro") is the public entity charged with overseeing public transportation
26 projects in Los Angeles County and in the City of Los Angeles.
27 6. Real Party-in-Interest Aerial Rapid Transit Technologies, LLC

28 ("ARTT") is a limited liability company organized under the laws of Delaware in March
29 2018 and registered in California in February 2019. McCourt Global, LLC is its member,
30 and Frank McCourt signed the most recent Statement of Information filed on ARTT's

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED
4 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 behalf with the California Secretary of State. ARTT is seeking, through the project
2 described herein, the ability to pursue the Gondola Project in Los Angeles County.

3 7. The fictitious Respondents named as Does 1 through 10 are sued
4 pursuant to the provisions of California Code of Civil Procedure section 474. The
5 Endowment is ignorant of the true names and capacities, whether individual, corporate,
6 associate or otherwise, of such Respondents. The Endowment is informed and believes,
7 and thereon alleges, that each such fictitious Respondent is responsible for the decisions to

8 proceed with the Project. When the true names of such fictitious Respondents and, as
9 appropriate, their responsibility for, participation in and contribution to the matters and
10 things herein alleged, or their respective interests in the subject real property, if any, are
11 ascertained, The Endowment will seek leave to amend this Petition to insert the same.
12 2. Factual and Legal Background to Metro's Competitive

13 Bidding Policies Relevant to the Gondola Project
14 8. Metro, as a government agency charged with providing public
15 transportation for the residents of Los Angeles County, is a major purchaser of large-scale
16 construction projects. As a government agency, Metro has adopted numerous policies to
17 address how it pursues these projects.
18 9. As a state agency responsible for the expenditures of large amounts of public
19 funds, Metro is subject to various competitive bidding laws both at the state and local
20 level. Because it is recipient of federal transit funding, it must also comply with federal
21 competitive bidding guidance promulgated by the Federal Transit Agency ("FTA") to
22 remain eligible for federal funding. Statutes and ordinances that authorize or
23 require competitive bidding in the letting of public contracts ordinarily serve the purpose
24 "of inviting competition, to guard against favoritism, improvidence, extravagance, fraud
25 and corruption, and to secure the best work or supplies at the lowest price practicable.'»
26 (Domar Electric, Inc. V. City of Los Angeles (1994) 9 Cal.4th 161, 173.)
27 10. For example, Public Utilities Code section 130051.22(b) mandates, for public
28 projects, Metro shall require prospective bidders to submit a prequalification standardized
29 questionnaire and financial statement pursuant to Public Utilities Code Section 20101
30 subdivision (a).

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED
5 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 11. Public Utilities Code section 22002 (c) defines "public project" to include:
2 Construction, reconstruction, erection, alteration, renovation, improvement, demolition,

3 and repair work involving any publicly owned, leased, or operated facility.

4 12. The Administrative Code of the Los Angeles County Metropolitan
5 Transportation Authority, enacted pursuant to the above Public Utilities Code

6 includes the following sections: Section 4-05-050 which requires a Pre-Qualification
7 Questionnaire and establishes minimum information requirements for that questionnaire;

8 section 4-05-060, "Completion of Pre-Qualification Questionnaire" states: "Except as
9 otherwise exempted by this chapter, each business entity seeking a contract with the MTA
10 which, at the time of initial award, is reasonably expected to exceed the contract value
11 threshold shall complete a pre-qualification questionnaire..." ARTT did not complete such
12 a pre-qualification questionnaire.

13 13. Metro is a recipient of federal funding from the Federal Transit Authority.
14 As such, Metro must certify compliance with FTA's policies regarding procurement,
15 including policies related to unsolicited proposals and sole source contract awards. FTA
16 published Guidance for recipients of funding in FTA Circular 4220.1. FTA Circular 4220.1
17 sets forth requirements that include the process for review of unsolicited proposals and for
18 exceptions to competitive bidding (sole source awards). Chapter VI of FTA Circular 4220.1
19 addresses these. The requirements in the FTA Circular are reflected, often verbatim, in
20 Metro's Unsolicited Proposal Policy and its Acquisition Policy and Procedure Manual.

21 14. Metro's Acquisition Policy and Procedure Manual cites various California
22 statutes as basis for its policies and procedures.

23 15. Among the statutes cited in Metro's Acquisition Policy and Procedure Manual
24 is Public Utilities Code section 130232. This section states contracts "shall be let to the
25 lowest responsible bidder when the purchase price of the construction of all facilities
26 exceeds twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000). (2) The authority shall obtain a minimum
27 of three quotations, either written or oral, that permit prices and terms to be compared
28 whenever the expected expenditure required exceeds three thousand dollars ($3,000), but
29 not one hundred fifty thousand dollars ($150,000)."

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED
6 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 16. Public Contract Code sections 10335, 10339, and 10340 also contain
2 competitive bidding requirements for public contracts.

3 17. First promulgated in 2016 and revised in 2018, Metro has an
4 Unsolicited Proposals Policy, a true and correct copy of which was attached to the Original

5 Petition as Exhibit A. An Unsolicited Proposal is a written proposal that is submitted to
6 Metro on the initiative of the submitter to develop a partnership that is not in response to
7 a formal or informal request issued by Metro.

8 18. Additionally, Metro has publicly available Acquisition Policy and
9 Procedure Manual (the "Acquisition Policy") first issued in 2010. A true and correct copy
10 of the Acquisition Policy was attached to the Original Petition as Exhibit B.

11 19. Within Metro, there exists the Office of Extraordinary Innovation
12 ("OEI"), which allows collaboration between Metro and the private sector to facilitate
13 innovative projects. OEI acts as the evaluator of these projects and evaluates unsolicited
14 proposals for technical and/or financial merit. OEI evaluates unsolicited proposals through
15 a two-phase process. The first phase ("Phase I") reviews the proposal for conceptual

16 merit, applying a long list of factors laid out in the Unsolicited Proposals Policy. (Exh. A,
17 pp. 4-5). In Phase I, OEI, in cooperation with Metro Vendor/Contract Management
18 (collectively the "Review Team"), first does a threshold review to determine
19 whether the proposal meets the gating requirements of an unsolicited proposal and if the
20 proposal meets the threshold requirements. Then the Review Team reviews the conceptual
21 proposal against several factors, including but not limited to whether the proposal offers
22 direct or anticipated benefits to Metro, its passengers and the community, and whether
23 the proposal a satisfies a need for Metro that can be reasonably accommodated in Metro's
24 annual long-term capital and operating budgets without displacing other planned
25 expenditures, without placing other committed projects at risk, and without significantly
26 increasing the cost of the proposed items.
27 20. If a project satisfies all Phase I project evaluation criteria, it proceeds
28 to the second phase ("Phase II"). (Exh. A, Unsolicited Proposals Policy, pp. 5-7). In
29 Phase II, OEI receives more detailed technical and financial information to further
30 evaluate the proposal. In evaluating the project, the Review Team considers the relative

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED
7 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 costs and benefits of the proposal regarding improving mobility and accessibility in LA
2 County, in addition to other factors. Then the Review Team will make a recommendation

3 on the disposition of the detailed proposal to Metro's CEO for review and approval. If the
4 Board of Directors' approval is required, the proposer will be notified of the date of the
5 meeting when the proposal will be discussed. At the conclusion of this Phase II, Metro will

6 decide whether to forego the proposal, to proceed to a sole source agreement, or to pursue a
7 competitive solicitation. The proposal may not proceed to contract negotiation until Metro
8 completes the steps above.
9 3. The Gondola Project Proponent's Background, Purpose,
10 and Alleged Special Relationship with the Dodgers.
11 21. The Gondola Project is proposed by ARTT. One of the primary, if not the
12 primary, justification provided by Metro for determining a sole source award contract was
13 appropriate is an alleged special relationship between ARTT and the Dodgers baseball
14 organization. To understand this alleged special relationship, background facts are
15 necessary.
16 22. ARTT was formed a as a Delaware corporation in March 2018. One month
17 later, ARTT submitted a proposal for the gondola project in April 2018.
18 23. ARTT was formed by McCourt Global, which is controlled by Frank McCourt

19 ("McCourt"). McCourt Global also owns or controls a 50% interest in the parking lots
20 around Dodger Stadium.

21 24. The land surrounding Dodger Stadium, known as Chavez Ravine, represents
22 a large financial opportunity for the owner if developments are made. Currently, it is used
23 for surface parking, and the company proposing the gondola Los Angeles Aerial Rapid
24 Transit makes no mention of future development plans. But McCourt has long had
25 plans for an ambitious retail and entertainment complex around the stadium.

26 25. Those plans are evident in McCourt's "Next 50" plan, which was unveiled
27 when he owned the Dodgers. McCourt failed to secure funding for "Next 50,' but the
28 agreements revealed in the bankruptcy proceeding are still in force and provide insight
29| into the relationship between the proposed gondola, McCourt's plans to develop the
30 parking lots around Dodger Stadium, and the future of Chavez Ravine.

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED
8 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 26. The gondola project makes little or no sense economic sense without a major
2 development at Dodger Stadium, which a gondola could facilitate. There are only 81 home
3 games in the regular baseball season. a And even adding a maximum of 12 post-season

4 games, a couple of exhibition games, a maximum of four special events a month permitted
5 under the Conditional Use Permit issued by the City of Los Angeles for the stadium, and
6 the Los Angeles Marathon, at most the gondola is likely to be used at or near capacity on
7 only 144 days per year. Unless, that is, the Dodger Stadium parking lots are developed as

8 an entertainment, retail, and hospitality district like L.A. Live as Frank McCourt has long

9 envisioned.

10 27. In 2004, McCourt bought the Los Angeles Dodgers from Newscorp for $430
11 million. The purchase was financed primarily with loans, with over a third of the purchase
12 price lent directly from Newscorp. At the time of McCourt's purchase, no specific plans for
13 development of the parking lots surrounding the stadium were made public. However, on
14 April 25, 2008, McCourt unveiled a sprawling development plan for the stadium itself and
15 the surrounding lots. Marketed as the "Next 50" plan, the proposed development was
16 slated a to include a Dodger museum, a Dodger retail store, office space, and two new
17 parking structures. In addition, the project was advertised as a green initiative, including
18 the addition of 2,000 trees in the area around the stadium. The development was expected
19 to cost $500 million, more than McCourt's purchase price for the team.

20 28. The "Next 50" plan would have turned the stadium into a retail and a
21 entertainment venue to attract customers outside of game times, expanding the use of
22 Dodger Stadium beyond baseball. Photographs of McCourt presenting a scale model of
23 development plans at a press a conference beside then Mayor of Los Angeles Antonio
24 Villaraigosa showed the proposed changes, including large, terraced plazas lined with
25 trees and new buildings outside of the stadium. McCourt's planned development was
26 designed to make use of the parking lots surrounding the stadium to increase the
27 economic productivity of the land and turn Chavez a Ravine into a year-round destination.

28 29. As part of his plans for the "Next 50" development, McCourt discussed a
29 desire to connect Dodger Stadium to public transit, saying he "hoped local leaders would
30 'tweak and adjust subway lines' to add a Dodger Stadium stop and provide bus access in

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED
9 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 the interim." Then city council member Ed Reyes further endorsed connecting the
2 development to new public transit lines, saying that the "renovation hopefully can
3 stimulate a whole new transit system that gets us in and out of this great place.' In

4 developing plans for his additions to Dodger Stadium and the surrounding land, McCourt
5 clearly identified expanded public transit options as increasing potential visitors as well as
6 revenue in new retail and entertainment destinations.

7 30. Under McCourt's ownership the Dodgers fell deep into debt, ultimately filing
8 for bankruptcy on June 27, 2011. In addition to bankruptcy court conflicts with Major
9 League Baseball, McCourt was ordered to pay $150 million in a divorce settlement. The
10 "Next 50" development never materialized, as McCourt failed to secure funding.

11 31. McCourt was very resistant to selling the Dodgers, and only agreed to a sale
12 in November 2011 after a series of long court battles. After several rounds of negotiations,
13 a group led by Magic Johnson and financed by Guggenheim Partners won the bid to
14 purchase the Dodgers for $2 billion. As part of the deal, Guggenheim Partners entered into
15 a venture with a McCourt entity to jointly own the stadium parking lots.
16 32. The terms of the parking lot sale and any potential future development of the
17 land around the stadium were filed under court seal as part of the supplement to the
18 Dodger's chapter 11 bankruptcy plan on April 6, 2012 in United States Bankruptcy Court
19 for the District of Delaware, case number 11-12010 (KG). With nine sections totaling 139
20 pages, the exhibit is titled the "Declaration of Covenants, Conditions, Restrictions, and
21 Easements for Chavez Ravine," consisting of 93 pages of terms and agreements relating to
22 the current usage and future development of Chavez Ravine. The exhibit was
23 subsequently recorded by the Los Angeles County Recorder's Office, so it runs with the
24 land at Dodger Stadium.

25 33. The exhibit shows that Guggenheim Partners pays $14 million a year to the
26 McCourt entity Blue Landco LLC to rent the stadium parking lots. The document also
27 details possible future developments that "may include, but are not limited to (i) office
28 buildings, (ii) hotel and exhibition facilities, (iii) residential buildings, (iv) medical
29 buildings, (v) academic buildings, (vi) parking structures, and/or (vii) retail, dining, and
30 entertainment facilities." The document includes a provision stating that Guggenheim

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED
10 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Partners agrees "to cooperate with Landco, and to take all steps reasonably requested by
2 Landco, in connection with the general plan of improvement and development of the
3 Landco Parcels," and "not to oppose, or to interfere in any fashion (including, without
4 limitation, by speaking out at public hearings) with any efforts by Landco to complete
5 development of the Landco Parcels." This provision effectively grants Landco the sole

6 discretion to develop the stadium parking lot lands, including with such projects as the
7 Gondola Project station at Dodger Stadium. ARTT, which did not exist at the time of the
8 Declaration of Covenants, Conditions, Restrictions, and Easements for Chavez Ravine

9 (CCR's), has no role and is given no rights in these CCR's.
10 34. Although McCourt and Guggenheim Partners claimed at the time of the sale
11 that they did not have plans for development in the immediate future, McCourt's attorney
12 said that the document outlining potential plans was created to keep possibilities for
13 development open. The document includes an agreement with Guggenheim Partners for a
14 99-year lease of the land with the Landco LLC half-owned by McCourt. The agreement
15 states that the parking lots contain 19,000 parking spaces, and that any reduction of the
16 number of parking spaces below 16,500 must be approved by Major League Baseball and

17 the City of Los Angeles.
18 35. An additional section of the CCRs (section 5.1.2), however, provides a
19 workaround for this provision that is especially significant in light of McCourt's/ARTT's
20 proposed gondola. It states that with City of Los Angeles and stadium owner approval, "In
21 connection to any Mass Transportation…Landco shall have the right to provide less than
22 the 16,500 Required Parking Spaces." (Emphasis added.) This would allow for
23 developments in the parking lots that could significantly reduce the number of parking

24 spaces if the developments were completed after or concurrent with the addition of a mass
25 transit connection to Dodger Stadium. Under this agreement, construction of a gondola to
26 the stadium from Union Station could enable McCourt's vision for additional development
27 in Chavez Ravine to be realized. At the same time, it would displace parking spots and
28 contribute to more traffic and parking challenges in and around Chinatown and Union
29 Station.

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED
11 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 36. McCourt Global's website at one point trumpeted its ownership interest in
2 the 260-acre Chavez a Ravine land as a "current real estate project" through at least

3 October 2021, though that statement appears to have been removed from the website once
4 the company began facing significant opposition to its proposed gondola project.

5 37. On April 26, 2018, Aerial Rapid Transit Technologies LLC submitted an
6 unsolicited proposal to Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority for an
7 aerial gondola from Union Station to Dodger Stadium that it calls Los Angeles Aerial

8 Rapid Transit or "LA ART." LA ART was founded by Drew McCourt, Frank McCourt's son.

9 The company at one time claimed that the estimated $125 million project will be privately
10 funded by Frank McCourt's investment firm and others.

11 38. According to LA ART, each gondola cabin will hold 30 to 40 people and the
12 system will be able to move up to 5,000 people per hour to or from the stadium. LA ART
13 claims, without any documentation, that the gondola will take 3,000 cars off of
14 neighborhood streets and reduce traffic on the 110 freeway before and after Dodger games.
15 Current plans show gondola cars suspended from cables 150 to 175 feet above the ground
16 from Union Station to Dodger Stadium with an intermediate station at Los Angeles State
17 Historic Park adjacent to Chinatown.
18 39. The Los Angeles Times noted that even though the Gondola project director

19 Martha Welborne (formerly Metro's Chief Planning Officer before becoming ARTT's
20 gondola project director) claimed no future development was planned as of 2018, "]enders

21 might be more receptive to finance a gondola that goes to Dodger Stadium 365 days a year
22 rather than just on 81 home-game dates."
23 40. In essence, the Gondola Project is a proposed as a loss leader for the future
24 development of parking lots at Dodger Stadium.

25 41. The Gondola Project makes no economic sense on its own merits, but it does

26 make sense as a necessary part of a larger development scheme. Because the Gondola
27 Project does not pencil out on its own economics, it did not qualify for a sole source
28 determination from Metro, and there is no substantial evidence to justify such a
29 determination. Because the Gondola Project is not economically feasible and could not be
30 absorbed by the Metro Budget, it fails the threshold requirement of a public/private

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED
12 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 partnership and should not have qualified for sole source determination from Metro.
2 There is no evidence to justify such a determination.

3 4. The Gondola Project Background

4 42. On April 25, 2018, ARTT submitted the Gondola Project to Metro as an
5 unsolicited proposal through Metro's OEI and declared it a privately funded public
6 transportation project. A true and correct of this unsolicited proposal was attached to the
7 Original Petition as Exhibit C.

8 43. One day later, on April 26, 2018, Metro confirmed that it received ARTT's
9 Unsolicited Concept Proposal, and committed to completing review of the proposal within
10 a 60-day period.

11 44. Metro was aware that a proposed gondola system was not in itself a novel
12 idea. The Metro Library shared a KPCC article that emphasized the proposed Project is
13 not novel. The article begins: "The company behind the proposal wants to create a zero-
14 emission transit line up to Dodger Stadium. It's not the first time the idea has come up.'
15 KPCC reported that the gondola "isn't brand new technology, it's been implemented a
16 number of different places." Further, "it's not an original idea. Back in 1990, the Los
17 Angeles County Transportation Commission released the Dodger Stadium Transit Access
18 Study, which explored ideas like pedestrian escalators, a shuttle bus service and a

19 gondola."

20 45. On April 27, 2018, internal Metro emails noted the Gondola proposal

21 as originating from the Mayor's office, and the 1990 Dodger Stadium Transit Access
22 Study that included a gondola.

23 46. Before completing this review, in May 2018, Metro published its revised
24 Unsolicited Proposals Policy.
25 47. Shortly thereafter, on June 11, 2018, Metro responded and notified ARTT

26 that the Gondola Project would proceed to Phase II. Metro further noted that
27 if it implemented the Phase II proposal, that this proposal could support a Request for
28 Proposal ("RFP") for a competitive procurement, a sole source agreement, or some other
29 arrangement depending on Metro's role and relationship to the Gondola Project.
30 48. On August 10, 2018, Metro sent a Request for Information about the

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED
13 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Gondola Project to ARTT.

2 49. ARTT responded to this request on September 26, 2018. A
3 true and correct copy of this response was attached to the Original Petition as Exhibit D.
4 50. Without providing any notice to the public or opportunity for public review,

5 on October 11, 2018, less than six months after the receipt of the unsolicited proposal,
6 Metro determined that this multimillion-dollar public transportation project met Metro's
7 criteria for a sole source determination instead of circulating the Gondola Project in
8 compliance with Metro's normal competitive bidding procedures. Metro's determination

9 letter was attached to the Original Petition as Exhibit E. In so doing, Metro also
10 acknowledged that it would enter into exclusive negotiations for the Gondola Project with

11 ARTT.

12 51. Metro and ARTT executed a Letter of Intent ("LOI") for the Gondola
13 Project on October 31, 2018.

14 52. On December 3, 2018, the Chief of OEI sent a letter to
15 Metro's Board of Directors notifying the Board of Metro's decision to close the Unsolicited
16 Proposal process and to proceed with exclusive negotiations with ARTT under the signed
17 LOI.

18 53. On April 26, 2019, Metro and ARTT entered into a Memorandum of
19 Agreement between Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority and
20 Aerial Rapid Transit Technologies LLC (the "Metro MOA"). A copy of the Metro MOA was

21 attached to the Original Petition as Exhibit F. From the first submittal of the Unsolicited
22 Concept Proposal to execution of LOI, Metro took less than six months to move forward on
23 the Gondola Project, and then six months to determine the Gondola Project could be sole

24 sourced. No Metro Board meeting was held to consider or approve this sole source
25 determination.

26 54. It was not until December 2019, long after Metro had already awarded
27 ARTT a sole source agreement, when The Endowment first learned of the existence of the
28 Gondola Project. The Endowment received a preliminary presentation about the project
29 from ARTT's representative, Ms. Cindy Starrett of Latham & Watkins. It was then when
30 The Endowment was first made aware that ARTT planned to erect an enormous tower

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED
14 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 (subsequently revealed to be 195 feet in height) in the City right-of-way on Alameda
2 Triangle immediately adjacent to The Endowment Headquarters. The Endowment's
3 request for further information and details about the towers, the route, and the impact of
4 the project was denied by ARTT unless The Endowment was willing to sign a non-
5 disclosure agreement, which included a commitment to not oppose the project. The
6 Endowment respectfully declined to waive this right without a comprehensive
7 understanding of the Gondola Project and its social, economic, and environmental impacts

8 on the surrounding communities.

9 55. Since 2019, The Endowment has met with Metro many times to
10 request additional details on matters of vital interest to the surrounding community and
11 public including but not limited to the Gondola Project's scope, use of public property and
12 right of way; community impact, including community displacement, safety, pollution,
13 traffic, and parking; cost, including passenger ticket fees, maintenance, operation, and
14 interface with Metro. Unfortunately, in response, Metro and ARTT have provided only
15 general "back of the envelope" information claiming that more detailed information,

16 essential to determine Project viability, is "in process" and allegedly unavailable. (See
17 Letter from Metro to The California Endowment dated September 9, 2021, which was
18 attached to the Original Petition as Exhibit G). As described further below, this is
19 concerning because pursuant to the Unsolicited Proposals Policy, project viability must be
20 determined--prior to making a sole source determination or proceeding with contract
21 negotiation. (Exh. A, Unsolicited Proposals Policy, p. 6-7; 9). This failure to comply with
22 Metro's internal policies coupled with the lack of transparency surrounding the Gondola
23 Project has been a longstanding concern expressed by The Endowment and by similarly
24 concerned community stakeholders.

25 56. On October a 1, 2020, Metro issued a Notice of Preparation for an
26 environmental impact report under the California Environmental Quality Act for the
27 Gondola Project.

28 57. On June 24, 2021, The Metro Board approved a motion
29 by Directors Solis, Kuehl, Mitchell, Butts, Sandoval, and Garcetti ("the Unintended
30 Consequences Motion") that the Board of Directors direct the Chief Executive Officer to

1 60. On August 9, 2022, a non-profit entity known as Climate Resolve announced
2 in a press release, also circulated by ARTT, that ARTT had donated the Gondola Project to

3 Climate Resolve's newly-created subsidiary Zero Emission Transit (ZET). The terms and
4 timing of this donation were not made publicly available. However, it was reported in
5 press accounts of the donation that rides on the gondola to Dodger games would be free,
6 rather than cost $15 as had formerly been stated by ARTT. The announcement of the
7 donation of the Gondola Project and the new terms anticipated for gondola operation

8 undercut any earlier analysis supporting an award of a sole source determination and
9 entry into an ENA with ARTT. The fact that rides to Dodger stadium would be free
10 further corroborated the view that the gondola system was a loss leader for future
11 anticipated development of Dodger stadium parking lots, and was not intended as a
12 freestanding public transit system.

13 C. METRO ABUSED ITS DISCRETION IN APPROVING THE GONDOLA

14 PROJECT TO PROCEED TO PHASE I OF THE UNSOLICITED

15 PROPOSALS POLICY

16 61. As set forth above, OEI evaluates unsolicited proposals using a two-
17 phase process. Historically, OEI has accepted primarily small innovative proposals
18 meeting an important Metro need such as mobile tolling and mobile charger vending
19 machines not new private transportation systems of the scale proposed
20 by the Gondola Project. The record of Metro's internal evaluation of ARTT's unsolicited

21 proposal does not support OEI staff's recommendations nor Metro's decision to allow the
22 Gondola Project to proceed through this two-phase process because the Gondola Project
23 does not meet the basic threshold requirements or the evaluation criteria necessary to
24 advance to a sole-source agreement. It is clear from the record that Metro should not have
25 approved the Gondola Project proposal because the Gondola Project failed to meet Metro's
26 evaluation process, standards, and requirements.

27 62. As set forth in the Unsolicited Proposals Policy, upon receipt of a
28 conceptual proposal, the Review Team must first determine whether the proposal meets
29 the following threshold requirements before initiating Phase I evaluation: (i) satisfies the
30 definition of an unsolicited proposal; (ii) includes all required content and attachments;

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED
17 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 (iii) contains sufficient detail to enable Metro to perform an adequate evaluation, (iv) if
2 submitted by parties external to Metro, has been approved by a responsible official or
3 other representative authorized to contractually obligate the proposer; (v) complies with
4 the marking requirements for use and disclosure of data; and (vi) if submitted by parties
5 within Metro, has been approved with signature by a departmental Chief. (Exh. A,
6 Unsolicited Proposals Policy, p. 4). These are threshold evaluation criteria-failing to meet
7 these initial standards will prevent the project from proceeding to full Phase I review.

8 63. Here, based on records The Endowment has obtained, ARTT's
9 application package did not meet all threshold requirements to proceed to Phase I
10 assessment and therefore, should have been rejected outright and never have been
11 considered. The application materials did not provide sufficient project information to
12 allow Metro to perform an adequate initial evaluation of the Gondola Project as set out in
13 OEI Policy and Procedures for unsolicited proposals. As such, the Gondola Project should

14 not have been allowed to proceed to Phase I review.
15 D. METRO ABUSED ITS DISCRETION IN APPROVING THE GONDOLA

16 PROJECT IN PHASE I OF THE UNSOLICITED POLICY PROPOSAL

17 64. Under the OEI unsolicited proposal process, should a proposal meet
18 the threshold requirements, then during Phase I review, Metro considers an unsolicited
19 proposal based on whether each project: (i) offers direct or anticipated benefits to Metro,
20 its passengers and the community; (ii) is consistent with Metro's objectives and goals; (iii)
21 satisfies a need for Metro that can be reasonably accommodated in Metro's annual long-
22 term capital and operating budgets without displacing other planned expenditures,
23 without placing other committed projects at risk, and without significantly increasing the
24 cost of the proposed items; (iv) offers goods or services that Metro may not have intended
25 to procure or provide through the normal Metro contract process; (v) whether the project
26 proposal contains significant financial, technical and legal components; and (vi) whether
27 the proposal is within Metro's jurisdiction or control. (Exh. A, Unsolicited Proposals

28 Policy, p. 4). Here, the record will demonstrate that there was insufficient information for
29 Metro to make these findings that would allow the Gondola Project to satisfy the Phase I
30 criteria.

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED
18 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 65. Initially, under the first identified criteria, the Gondola Project
2 provides no discernable benefits to Metro, to Angeleno taxpayers, or to the broader
3 community. ARTT has made it abundantly clear that the Gondola Project will be a for-
4 profit income generator for ARTT, not Metro, Metro's ridership or the City. (Exh. D,
5 ARTT Response, p. 13). Because this is a privately owned public transportation project,
6 the Gondola Project will not take TAP payments, can set its own fees, transportation
7 schedule, and access, thereby providing little to no public benefit to the community. (Id.,

8 p. 12). Further, the Gondola Project is not self-sufficient. The Gondola Project was

9 designed as a "park-and-ride" facility which provides no additional parking in an already
10 congested area. Based on the documentation provided, Gondola Project patrons are likely
11 to park their vehicles at Union Station's limited parking facilities, or on the side streets
12 adjacent to other passenger stations - thus creating potential safety hazards and an
13 additional burden on existing Metro infrastructure and local community residents,
14 businesses, and service providers including The Endowment's Center for Healthy
15 Communities. This burden is not offset by any discernable public benefit.
16 66. As to the second criteria, Metro's approval of the Gondola Project is
17 inconsistent with Metro's stated long term goals. More specifically, the Gondola Project is
18 inconsistent with Metro's 2019 Climate Action Plan and planned improvements to the
19 Forecourt and Esplanade areas in front of Union Station all of which promote public
20 engagement, equity and inclusion in agency decision-making. However, with regard to the
21 Gondola Project, Metro has not been open or transparent with the public or interested
22 stakeholders, notwithstanding multiple meetings, letters, and requests for information
23 about the Project and its potential impacts. For these reasons, Metro's decision to withhold
24 fundamental Project information from the public under the guise that this information is
25 proprietary is inconsistent with Metro's own policies and objectives.
26 67. As to the third criteria, the Gondola Project also cannot satisfy an
27 actual need for Metro. Although the need for increased transit infrastructure in Los
28 Angeles is significant, the Gondola Project as proposed functions as a private tourist
29 attraction, not a public transportation line to serve Metro riders. This is evidenced by the
30 Gondola Project's lack of any reference to cost, affordability or connectivity to Metro's

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED
19 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 TAP system or any analysis as to whether it may be in the public's interest to explore
2 alternate less costly and disruptive measures such as expanding Metro's existing public
3 transportation to Dodger Stadium in the form of the Dodger Express busses, which are

4 free to the public and depart from various points along the Metro route rather than
5 concentrating entirely at Union Station. The Gondola Project cannot accommodate
6 Metro's ridership at a comparable price point. Ticket estimates for each trip (per
7 conversations with Metro) may exceed $20 per person - making carpooling, ride-sharing

8 services, or the Dodger Express bus service more affordable and efficient alternatives

9 none of which were considered by the OEI in assessing its award of a sole source
10 agreement to ARTT for this Project. The gondola thus has more attributes of a tourist
11 attraction and shuttle service for attendees of games and events and Dodger Stadium (not
12 necessarily for workers at the stadium because of limited hours of operation) rather than
13 mass transit that can address actual transportation needs for riders seeking
14 transportation to regular destinations such as work or school.
15 68. As to the fourth criteria (budget), ARTT has not provided an estimate
16 for the total cost of the Gondola Project, including operation and maintenance costs since
17 submitting its application in 2018. (Exh. D to Original Petition, ARTT Response, pp. 35,
18 43). This lack of crucial information regarding Gondola Project projected costs means that

19 Metro did not meet a critical threshold requirement for advancing this Project through
20 Phase I of the OEI process, namely:

21 "..(iii) satisfies a need for Metro that can be reasonably
22 accommodated in Metro's annual long-term capital and
23 operating budgets without displacing other planned
24 expenditures, without placing other committed projects at risk,
25 and without significantly increasing the cost of the proposed

26 items;"

27 (Exh. A, Unsolicited Proposals Policy, p. 4).

28 69. Without clear information regarding costs, feasibility and financing,
29 Metro has effectively accepted the word of Frank McCourt's company (McCourt Global)
30 that ARTT will "pay for" the construction, operation and maintenance of the Gondola

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED
20 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Project in perpetuity with absolutely no evidence in the record about whether and how
2 that responsibility will be accomplished. This significantly increases the risk that the
3 Gondola Project will become underfunded, half-built or abandoned, resulting in a burden

4 on the public if ARTT becomes insolvent or otherwise unable to complete, maintain, or
5 operate the Gondola Project safely. Metro should not have allowed the Gondola Project to
6 move forward without detailed financing and feasibility assessments including operation
7 and maintenance reserves for the life of the Gondola Project. Finally, the size and scope of

8 the Gondola Project necessitate significant financial, legal, and technical components.

9 However, despite multiple requests from The Endowment, information about these
10 components has not been provided to the public during the scoping meeting, the limited
11 attendance community outreach meetings, or in response to The Endowment's requests for
12 information. For these reasons, the Gondola Project does not satisfy Metro's Phase I

13 Unsolicited Proposal criteria and should have been rejected at that stage of the process.

14 For the reasons discussed above, Metro's decision to proceed to Phase II despite failing to
15 satisfy Metro's Phase I Unsolicited Proposal criteria was arbitrary and capricious.
16 E. METRO ABUSED ITS DISCRETION IN APPROVING THE GONDOLA

17 PROJECT IN PHASE II OF THE UNSOLICITED PROPOSALS POLICY

18 70. Only a after a project satisfies the Phase I evaluation process, I may the
19 project proceed to the Phase II review. Phase II requirements include whether: (i) the
20 proposer's capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques, or unique combinations of

21 these which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives; (ii) the proposer's
22 financial capacity to deliver the goods or services defined in the proposal; (iii) the viability
23 of the proposed schedule and Metro's ability to meet activities required; (iv) Metro's
24 capacity to enter into a contract under its debt authorization; (v) the qualifications,
25 capabilities and experience of key personnel who are critical in achieving the proposal
26 objectives; (vi) the relative costs and benefits of the proposal regarding improving mobility
27 and accessibility in LA County; (vii) the specific details of the cost/revenue generated; and
28 (viii) any other factors appropriate for the particular proposal. (Exh. A, Unsolicited
29 Proposals Policy, pp. 5-6).
30 71. With respect to the first criteria, ARTT appears to lack subject-matter

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED
21 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 competency, or the technical skills needed to successfully develop the Gondola Project.
2 Based on publicly available information, the applicant, Aerial Rapid Transit Technologies
3 was registered in California very recently, in 2019, and was organized, in Delaware, in
4 March 2018. In addition, there is no evidence to indicate that members of the ARTT team
5 have ever designed or constructed an aerial gondola. (Exh. C, ARTT Unsolicited Concept
6 Proposal, pp. 16-17). There is no evidence indicating the ARTT's experience, facilities, or
7 techniques make it the appropriate choice for any Gondola Project, much less one in

8 earthquake prone territory, that purports to move passengers via cables with suspended
9 gondola cars over a public right of way, a Metro railway (in two places), homes,
10 apartments, businesses, the freeway, and various communities before climbing uphill to

11 Dodger Stadium. (Exh. D, ARTT's Response, pp. 31, 35). Aerial gondolas utilizing the
12 same or similar technology are located around the world. Based on the scope of the
13 Gondola Project and its location within the public right-of-way, common sense mandates
14 that at minimum, a multi-million dollar Project of this complexity and scale, should be
15 competitively bid and awarded to an applicant with the requisite expertise. For these
16 reasons, Metro's approval of a sole source agreement with ARTT to proceed with this
17 Gondola Project despite having never built an Aerial Gondola previously or demonstrated
18 any subject-matter expertise or capacity to build an Aerial Gondola is clearly arbitrary
19 and capricious.

20 72. With respect to the second Phase II criteria (financial capability),
21 ARTT has also failed to demonstrate that the Gondola Project is adequately capitalized.
22 Without proof of adequate capitalization, the Gondola Project poses a substantial risk that
23 Metro or Angeleno taxpayers will become responsible for removing or maintaining this ill-
24 conceived development. Given the lack of a total Project budget, ARTT's financial
25 capacity to deliver, operate, and maintain the Gondola Project is unsupported by publicly
26 available documentation. Additionally, it appears that all revenue generated from the
27 Gondola Project will be entirely private. However, ARTT has provided no information to
28 the public about revenue projections.

29 73. With respect to the sixth and seventh Phase II criteria (the cost/benefit
30 analysis and revenue projections), the very tangible costs, impacts, and burdens that the

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED
22 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Gondola Project will have on the local community greatly outweigh the promised, but
2 unproven, benefits to a discrete sector of the public who may choose to use a pricey
3 privately-owned transportation mechanism masquerading as a public transportation

4 project. The need for real low-cost, commuter and environmentally-friendly alternatives to
5 address traffic congestion in the downtown area and at Union Station during Dodger game
6 days, can be dramatically improved by investing in alternatives such as expanding the
7 free Dodger Express Bus, carpooling, and ride-sharing. In addition, although Metro claims
8 the Gondola Project would reduce traffic congestion, there is no evidence supporting this
9 assertion. Available evidence suggests that instead, the Gondola Project will cause
10 increased traffic congestion, and pedestrian and cyclist safety concerns along Alameda

11 Street. For example, the location of the Project infrastructure within the public right-of-

12 way will create narrower traffic lanes in an already congested area, exacerbating traffic
13 congestion. ARTT has not directly addressed concerns about traffic impacts due to the
14 Gondola Project's location and lack of additional parking. Instead ARTT makes broad,
15 unsubstantiated claims about the Gondola Project's ability to meet regional air quality
16 standards without considering the indirect impacts on regional traffic and idling likely
17 to result from poor design. Additionally, it remains unclear how Metro will change its
18 schedule to accommodate potential "extra inning" games where fans may still be at
19 Dodger Stadium after the gondolas (or other public transit systems) shut down. Finally,
20 the Gondola Project's proposed location-in the center of bustling downtown Los
21 Angelesis likely to lead to an increase in traffic accidents and pedestrian injuries, given
22 the distracting nature of an aerial gondola system dangling in impacted traffic corridors.
23 These factors indicate that the Gondola Project's costs far exceed any discernable benefit

24 to the public as an alternative transportation option, and therefore, does not satisfy the
25 Phase II evaluation criteria.

26 74. Based on publicly-available information, the Gondola Project does not
27 satisfy the Unsolicited Proposals Phase II criteria, and, therefore, the Gondola Project
28 should not have advanced beyond Phase II. As such, Metro should have rejected the
29 Gondola Project or requested additional information supporting its determination to
30 proceed to contract negotiation.

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED
23 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 F. METRO ABUSED ITS DISCRETION IN DETERMINING THE PROJECT

2 COULD BE SOLE SOURCED

3 75. Sole source awards are appropriate only in very limited circumstances
4 a where a proposed project could not otherwise proceed. Metro considers a sole source
5 award only where "it is impossible to describe the property or services offered without
6 revealing proprietary information or disclosing the originality of thought or innovativeness
7 of the property or services sought." (Exh. A, Unsolicited Proposals Policy, p. 7). A sole

8 source award may not be based solely on the unique capability of the proposer to provide

9 the specific property or services proposed. (Exh. A, Unsolicited Proposals Policy, p. 41).
10 76. Here, Metro's decision to proceed with a sole source award for the Gondola
11 Project was in error. There is no indication that ARTT is the only provider capable of
12 building a gondola system - nor that it is impossible to develop the Gondola

13 Project without disclosing proprietary information. ARTT admits that other comparable
14 gondola systems exist throughout the world. Further, some of these systems also use
15 identical technology to the proposed Gondola Project. ARTT admits that this Gondola
16 Project would employ the Tricable Detachable Gondola (3S) system - the exact same
17 technology that can also be found in other cities. (Exh. C, ARTT Unsolicited Proposal, p.
18 5). There is no evidence that this particular gondola system or technology would be more
19 innovative or differ in any way from other gondola systems around the world. Further,
20 there is no evidence that ARTT holds any patents, proprietary design, property rights, or
21 other distinguishing factors consistent with sole source provider determination. ARTT
22 makes bold, yet unsupported assertions that it has a "unique ability to deliver the Gondola
23 Project, including the necessary station location at Dodger Stadium property and
24 proprietary information that it requires." (Id., p. 4). However, ARTT has provided no
25 evidence of a formal agreement with the Dodgers to substantiate this claim.
26 Notwithstanding the status of ARTT's property acquisitions, Metro's guidelines
27 specifically state that property access is not sufficient to support a sole source provider
28 determination (Exh. A, Unsolicited Proposals Policy, p. 7). As such, giving ARTT a sole
29 source contract simply because it owns the property where the Gondola Project will be
30 built is not supported by Metro's policies.

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED
24 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 77. ARTT also claims that its "proprietary" information regarding "travel
2 planning for Dodger employees and stadium attendees, rideshare usage information, and
3 parking lot usage information; and ability to develop and implement necessary
4 coordination with the Dodger ticketing system." (Exh. D, ARRT Response, p. 4) qualify
5 the Gondola Project for a Sole Source Award. However, information regarding Dodger
6 Stadium's capacity, event schedule, and traffic impacts on surrounding streets are well-
7 documented in the public record and cannot be considered "proprietary." Further, public-
8 facing Gondola Project brochures indicate that the relationship between Dodger Stadium

9 tickets, Metro's ticketing system, system pricing and system implementation have not yet
10 been designed or negotiated, indicating that this specific information cannot be integral to
11 developing the Gondola Project nor the basis for which it qualifies for a sole source award.
12 78. Based on publicly-available information, Metro's determination that
13 the Gondola Project qualifies for a sole source award is not supported by facts or evidence.

14 For this reason, the ARTT sole source agreement should be terminated because it was an
15 abuse of discretion to approve the Gondola Project.
16 G. METRO ABUSED ITS DISCRETION IN AGREEING TO EXCLUSIVE,

17 NON-COMPETITIVELY BID CONTRACT NEGOTIATION

18 79. Pursuant to its Unsolicited Proposals Policy, Metro may only move
19 forward with contract negotiation if the following requisites are satisfied:
20 i. An Unsolicited Proposal has received a favorable

21 comprehensive evaluation, including in comparison to any
22 proposals received following publication as provided in this
23 policy;

24 ii. The Metro technical office sponsoring the contract
25 supports its recommendation, furnishes the necessary funds
26 and provides a sole-source justification (if applicable); and
27 iii. Metro CEO or Metro Board of Directors approves (if
28 required).

29 (Exh. A, Unsolicited Proposals Policy, p. 8).

30 80. Here, for the reasons stated above, Metro's determination that the

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED
25 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Gondola Project satisfies Phase I and Phase II criteria is unsupported by facts or evidence
2 in publicly-available documents. Similarly, Metro's determination that the Gondola
3 Project is eligible for sole source procurement is inconsistent with Metro's Unsolicited
4 Proposals Policy. Because the Gondola Project did not satisfy these requirements, Metro's
5 October 11, 2018 decision to proceed with contract negotiation was arbitrary, capricious,

6 and in violation of the Unsolicited Proposals Policy.
7 H. THE ENDOWMENT NEEDS JUDICIAL REVIEW OF THE

8 DETERMINATION NOW-AFTER ATTEMPTS AT NEGOTIATION FAILED

9 81. The Endowment is beneficially interested in any outcome regarding
10 the Gondola Project. As alleged above, The Endowment Headquarters is located

11 immediately east of the proposed 195-foot Alameda/Alpine Tower, which ARTT plans to
12 erect in the City right-of-way on Alameda Triangle, as shown in the figure which was
13 attached to the Original Petition as Exhibit H. As a property owner immediately adjacent

14 to the anticipated Gondola Project's construction, The Endowment is, therefore, at direct
15 risk if the Gondola Project is pursued in an inappropriate and/or haphazard manner or if
16 ARTT lacks the financial or technical capacity to pursue the Gondola Project to a safe
17 conclusion and maintain its operations for the foreseeable future. Additionally, The
18 Endowment's offices, non-profit tenants, and the Center for Healthy Communities (which

19 provides free conference space to non-profit grantees and public sector institutions
20 throughout Los Angeles County) will be severely impacted by the construction and
21 disruption along Alameda Street. Indeed, The Endowment has its own interests and
22 potential future development on its land that may be impinged if the Gondola Project
23 proceeds. These are precisely the concerns that can (and must) be raised by interested
24 stakeholders through a public process-but, because Metro pursued the Gondola Project in
25 secret, The Endowment was unable to provide comments prior to the MOA being adopted
26 in direct contravention of Metro's own policies.
27 82. In addition to its interest as a property owner and taxpayer on land
28 that will be directly impacted by the Gondola Project, as a private foundation that
29 regularly partners and supports nonprofit charitable organizations and partners with
30 governmental agencies to support community well-being and health equity, The

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED
26 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Endowment has a vested interest in ensuring that local agencies (like Metro) comply with

2 and follow their own rules and procedures. Here, Metro plainly rushed through
3 consideration of the Gondola Project and advanced it (to the MOA and the sole source

4 award) without doing so and, therefore, The Endowment has standing to challenge those
5 determinations.

6 83. As alleged above, The Endowment only discovered the existence of
7 the Gondola Project in December 2019. For over two years, it has been seeking

8 information to determine the propriety of Metro's determination, meeting with Metro staff

9 and leadership, testifying before the Metro Executive Committee, and raising concerns
10 about the Gondola Project through formal letters, emails and verbal requests. Despite

11 these efforts, there remains a shocking lack of concrete details that would demonstrate

12 that Metro actually possessed sufficient information to make an informed decision to
13 pursue the Gondola Project with ARTT as its sole source awardee. Advancing the Gondola
14 Project to this point was a clear abuse of discretion, and The Endowment, as an interested
15| property owner and stakeholder in Los Angeles County, has the right to challenge Metro's
16 actions.

17 84. Metro's policies do not present a way for stakeholders and interested
18 parties (like The Endowment) to challenge Metro's determination that an unsolicited
19 proposal satisfies the Unsolicited Proposals Policy, nor is there a mechanism to challenge
20 the determination to designate a project as sole source. As such, there is no plain, speedy,

21 or adequate remedy at law other than to seek judicial review via a petition for a writ of
22 mandate. Nor are there any administrative remedies The Endowment must exhaust
23 before pursuing the extraordinary remedy of mandamus.

24 85. The Endowment's Petition is timely filed. Metro made its sole source
25 determination on October 11, 2018. Petitions for mandamus under Code of Civil

26 Procedure section 1085 have a three-year statute of limitations. However, pursuant to
27 California Emergency Rule of Court, Rule 9, all statutes of limitation were tolled from
28 April 6, 2020 to October 1, 2020. Accordingly, due to this tolling, the Petition is timely

29 filed.

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED
27 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

2 [Petition for Writ of Mandate - Code of Civil Procedure § 1085]

3 [Against All Respondents]
4 86. Petitioner respectfully alleges and incorporates herein by reference
5 each and every allegation set forth above.

6 87. At all times herein mentioned, Metro had a mandatory and ministerial
7 duty to apply its own rules and regulations regarding the procurement and pursuit of

8 unsolicited proposals, and to apply the publicly available evaluation criteria set forth in

9 the Unsolicited Proposals Policy.
10 88. As set forth above, Metro's determination to pursue the Gondola
11 Project and to enter into the MOA was arbitrary, capricious and in excess of Metro's
12 jurisdiction and authority, and were contrary to the controlling law of the State of
13 California and the regulations adopted by Metro to evaluate projects just like the Gondola

14 Project.
15 89. The Endowment has standing to seek mandamus through this Petition.
16 The Endowment has a clear, present, and beneficial right with respect to the Gondola
17 Project. Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 1986. As a non-profit property owner in Los Angeles
18 County, whose mission is to improve the fundamental health of all Californians, The
19 Endowment has an interest in ensuring that massive projects (including those undertaken
20 by Metro) with the potential to negatively impact communities neighboring its

21 Headquarters are properly sourced, financed, and pursued so as not to create safety issues
22 in the surrounding area, nor improper construction that negatively impacts The
23 Endowment's ability to use its Headquarters, provide free public educational
24 programming and desperately needed free conference and convening space to non-profit
25 organizations, grantees and governmental entities through its Center for Healthy

26 Communities. Further, because The Endowment is seeking to enforce a public right (i.e.,
27 to ensure that Metro complies with its own policies and procedures with respect to
28 massive projects in Los Angeles County), The Endowment is beneficially interested in
29 ensuring that the public duties are enforced. Additionally, because The Endowment pays
30

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED
28 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 taxes it has an interest in ensuring that local agencies comply with their own rules and

2 regulations.

3 90. The Endowment has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the
4 ordinary course of law to compel Metro to cease from continuing to engage with ARTT in
5 pursuit of the Gondola Project. The Endowment is therefore entitled to extraordinary
6 relief, by means of alternative and peremptory writ of mandate, pursuant to Code of Civil
7 Procedure sections 1085, et seq., directing and commanding that Metro terminate any

8 further work on the Gondola Project, revoke the Sole Source Award, and/or terminate the
9 MOA with LA ART.

10 91. The Endowment is not able to, nor is it obligated to, exhaust any

11 administrative remedies prior to seeking judicial review. The determinations made by
12 Metro (that the Gondola Project satisfied the criteria set forth in the Unsolicited Proposals
13 Policy and could be subject to a Sole Source Award) were made without any opportunity

14 for the general public and/or interested parties (like The Endowment) to provide
15 comments. Further, Metro's policies and procedures provide no ability or process through
16 which a party interested in the approval of an unsolicited proposal to proceed and/or be

17 sole sourced can appeal that decision. As such, The Endowment (which has been
18 attempting an informal resolution for years with Metro) is properly bringing this Petition

19 at this time.

20 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

21

22 WHEREFORE, The Endowment prays for judgment as follows:

23 1. For a judicial determination and declaration that the MOA and sole source
24 determination were improper and invalid, and the entering into by Metro (through its
25 former CEO), was an abuse of discretion because Metro did not follow its own policies and
26 procedures with respect to the Gondola Project;

27 2. For issuance of an alternative writ of mandate or order to show cause, and
28 after a hearing, for issuance of a peremptory writ of mandate, commanding and directing
29 Metro to terminate the MOA, rescind the sole source determination, and stop all work on
30 the Gondola Project;

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED
29 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 3. For temporary, preliminary, and permanent injunctive relief restraining
2 Metro, and any and all parties acting in concert with Metro, from pursuing the Gondola
3 a Project any further pending a full determination of the validity of the MOA and sole

4 source determination;

5 4. For recovery of The Endowment's reasonable attorney's fees

6 and costs of suit incurred herein; and
7 5. For such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper

8 under the circumstances.
