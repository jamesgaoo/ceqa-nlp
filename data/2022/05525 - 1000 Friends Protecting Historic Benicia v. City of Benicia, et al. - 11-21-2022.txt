Printed on Recycled Paper L PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

INTRODUCTION

2 1. This action challenges the unlawful approvals of two projects, the

3 Jefferson Ridge Project and 1451 Park Road Project (collectively, "Projects") that

4 received approvals from the City of Benicia (the "City") through a streamlined

5 ministerial process.

6 2. Both projects are proposed on sites located in the Benicia Arsenal
7 District, a historical district that has been listed on the federal National Register

8 since 1975.

9 3. The Jefferson Ridge Project proposes development of 22 three-story

10 buildings, 121 residential units, 2,000 square foot of commercial space, and

11 associated parking spaces on a 7.9-acre site located at the intersection of Park Road

12 and Adams Street in the City.

13 4. The 1451 Park Road Project proposes development of a three-story, 17-

14 unit apartment complex on a 0.56-acre parcel at 1451 Park Road in the City.

15 5. Both Project applications were submitted under Senate Bill 35, codified

16 at Government Code section 65913.4.

17 6. The City approved both Projects via streamlined ministerial permits,
18 claiming the Projects were exempt from the California Environmental Quality Act

19 ("CEQA"). Yet, the ministerial approvals were not appropriate given the Projects'
20 failure to satisfy the qualification criteria required under Senate Bill 35, and the
21 Projects' significant environmental impacts.
22 7. In approving the projects through streamlined ministerial approvals,
23 the City violated CEQA by not preparing or reviewing any environmental review
24 documents for the project, and therefore not analyzing or mitigating the Projects'
25 significant environmental impacts.

26 8. The City also violated its own Municipal Code by approving a project

27 that conflicted with its zoning code requirements and significant tree protection

28 ordinance.

Printed on Recycled Paper PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
2

9. The violations of CEQA by the City, and the City's failure to discharge
2 its clear legal duties under its own Municipal Code, have necessitated the filing of

3 this action to obtain a writ of mandate and other appropriate relief setting aside

4 approval of the projects. The violation of CEQA by the City in connection with the

5 projects render their approval, and claimed exceptions, invalid.

6 10. Accordingly, Petitioner requests that this Court issue a peremptory

7 writ of mandate to prevent the City or Real Party in Interest from taking actions

8 based on the faulty approvals.

9 JURISDICTION

10 11. This Court has jurisdiction over the writ action under section 1094.5 of

11 the Code of Civil Procedure ("CCP"), and sections 21168 and 21168.5 of the Public

12 Resources Code.

13 PARTIES

14 12. Petitioner 1000 Friends Protecting Historic Benicia is a nonprofit

15 corporation, formed in November 2022 to preserve the historic Benicia Arsenal
16 District. It is an organization of individuals who visit the Benicia Arsenal District
17 and support preservation of its historic resources, individuals who support
18 enforcement of local historic preservation ordinances and environmental review

19 requirements, and individuals who live in Benicia. Many of the members have long

20 been involved in historic preservation of the Arsenal.

21 13. Members of Petitioner's organization are residents and taxpayers who

22 live in the City of Benicia and will be adversely affected by impacts resulting from
23 the Projects described herein, and are aggrieved by the acts, decisions and
24 omissions of the City as alleged in this Petition. Members of Petitioner objected to
25 the approvals of the Projects. Petitioner is suing on behalf of their members, and
26 others who will be similarly affected. Petitioner brings this action on their own

27 behalf and in the interest of the general public.

11 STATEMENT OF FACTS

12 I. The Benicia Arsenal District and Applicable Land Use Plans.

13 18. The Benicia Arsenal District is unique among California and national

14 historic sites in the depth and significance of its historicity.

15 19. The Benicia Arsenal District was established in 1849 on 345 acres of

16 land east of the City, adjacent to the Carquinez Strait the gateway to the inland
17 coast - California Delta.

18 20. Benicia Arsenal contains 23 contributing buildings. In the 112 years of

19 its existence, it played a major role in United States military installations and in
20 the development of the Western frontier.
21 21. Benicia Arsenal began on April 9, 1849, when two companies of the
22 2nd Infantry set up camp to establish Benicia Barracks.

23 22. After over a century of active military use, the Arsenal was deactivated
24 in 1964 and the Defense Department transferred ownership to the City of Benicia

25 in 1965. (City of Benicia General Plan, p. 101.) The Benicia Arsenal was one of five
26 permanent arsenals in the country, and the first on the Pacific Coast. (p. 98.)
27 23. Before it was deactivated in 1964, the Benicia Arsenal played a long
28 and important role in the nation's military history. The site was home to several

Printed on Recycled Paper PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
4

different U.S. Army divisions, including many prominent military figures. (City of

2 Benicia Arsenal Historic Conservation Plan, p. iii.)

3 24. The Arsenal stood, and still stands apart from the rest of the City due

4 in part to its continued ties to industrial use, shipping and warehousing. "That the

5 Arsenal retains some of its distinctive character and separation from the rest of

6 the city is both cause for celebration and for planning for its future." (Arsenal

7 Historic Conservation Plan, p. ii.)

8 25. The Benicia Arsenal District has been listed on the federal National

9 Register (number 76000534) since 1975. It is also listed at the state level and is

10 designated as State Historical Landmark No. 176.

11 26. There have been at least six biennial reunions of Arsenal personnel

12 since the Arsenal's deactivation. The on-going efforts of the Camel Barn Museum's

13 Board, staff and volunteers are further indicators of the significance the Arsenal

14 holds for all the citizens of Benicia.

15 27. To promote the conservation, preservation, protection and

16 enhancement of Benicia's historical and architecturally significant structures, the
17 City adopted a Historic Overlay District (H) as part of the Benicia Zoning
18 Ordinance in 1987, including over the Benicia Arsenal District.

19 28. The Arsenal Historic Conservation Plan (AHCP) was formed in 1993 to
20 implement the Historic Overlay District over the Benicia Arsenal.

21 29. The City's General Plan was adopted in 1999. The General Plan
22 designated the Arsenal District as 'Lower Arsenal Mixed Use." (General Plan, p.

23 28.) The Plan describes the Arsenal area as "characterized by older, historic

24 buildings, and a multiplicity of uses and tenants, including studios, small
25 professional offices, and small industrial activities, such as cabinet making."

26 (General Plan, p. 46.)

27 30. The Arsenal "adds character and diversity to the City and allows for
28 alternative living and working arrangements quite different from those available

Printed on Recycled Paper PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
5

H

2 in other parts of the community." (General Plan, p. 47.) Policy 2.11.2 of the

3 General Plan allows for live/work uses in the lower Arsenal only where it can be

4 demonstrated that adequate buffers exist, including noise buffers, and that the

5 presence of residents would not significantly constrain industrial operations,

6 including the flow of goods and materials. (Ibid.)
31.

7 The Final Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for the General Plan

8 stated that future project-specific environmental review and Policy 2.11.2 would

9 prevent land use incompatibilities and impacts from the broadly defined Lower

10 Arsenal Mixed Use land use designation. (Final EIR, p. 154, p. 35.)
32.

11 The City published a draft Environmental Impact Report for a "Lower

12 Arsenal Mixed Use Specific Plan" in 2007, which would have encompassed both

13 sites, but did not proceed forward with a final Environmental Impact Report or

14 approval. This was because the State Department of Toxic Substance Control

15 required a recirculation and because of State Office of Historic Preservation

16 comments called for another recirculation for historic impacts and no further
action was taken.

17 33.

18 In 2011, the City published a Historic Context Statement, financed in
part with federal funds, stating:

19

20 Benicia managed to preserve a great deal of its historic character, such

21 that today it is recognized as a destination for heritage tourism. The
residents of the city have likewise responded to the challenges of

22 protecting their historic resources by undertaking historic surveys and

23 enacting various historic preservation ordinances, including the
Downtown and Benicia Arsenal Historic Conservation Plans. With the

24 addition of this historic context statement, Benicia is well positioned to

25 move forward into the 21st century with clear guidelines for
identifying, maintaining and promoting its significant historic
resources.

26

27 34. The Arsenal Historic Conservation Plan specifies several additional

28 planning standards for the historic Arsenal District, and even the particular

Printed on Recycled Paper
6 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

-

2 Subdistrict, including the following mandates: Retain designated major views and

3 view corridors noted in Figure 6, especially to landmark buildings and the water or

4 waterfront areas, and comply with the view preservation policies of Chapter Four;

5 Retain significant tree plantings on private sites and along streets, as shown in

6 Figure 5; Maintain the general topography which defines this subarea as a ridge,

7 especially the embankment north of Adams Street; Require landscaped setbacks

8 from the street for buildings, parking and loading areas consistent with the

9 pattern of historic buildings on Jefferson Street.
II. The Project Sites.

10 35.

11 Both Projects are proposed in the Lower Arsenal Mixed Use General

12 Plan land use designation within the Arsenal Historic District.
36.

13 The sites are particularly located within Subdistrict 2, the

14 Ridge/Officers' Row. This sub-district, which includes the officers' quarters along

15 Jefferson Street and the original Arsenal storehouse (Clocktower Building), houses

16 "the most outstanding ensemble of historic buildings in the district." (AHCP, p.

17 57.) Future development "on the slope south of Jefferson Street and on the slopes

18 below the promontory is of particular concern." (Ibid.)
37.

19 The Arsenal Historic Conservation Plan gives special significance to

20 the specimen trees and ornamental landscaping surrounding the officer's quarters

21 on the ridgetop, mature street trees which line Jefferson Street, and the

22 embankment above Adams and Washington Streets that been planted with oak

23 trees, including the "seldom seen" cork oak. (AHCP, p. 11.)

24 a. The Jefferson Ridge Project Site.

38.

25 The Jefferson Ridge Project is proposed on a site that is bounded to the

26 south by Adams Street, to the east by city-owned open space containing the
Commanding Officers Quarters, to the west by Park Road and the former
27 Lieutenant's Quarters, and to the north by Jefferson Street and a pipeline with
28 easement.

Printed on Recycled Paper
7 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

39. The site is zoned Office Commercial. The majority of the surrounding

2 sites are zoned General Commercial, General Industrial, Water Related Industrial,

3 and public and semi-public open space.

4 40. There are many trees on the southeast corner and along the northern

5 frontage of Jefferson Street designated as "Significant Trees" in the Arsenal

6 Historic Conservation Plan.

7 41. There are also over one hundred trees on the site, 24% of which are

8 cork oak, creating a "grove." (Applicant Arborist Report, 2014.) Based on the City's

9 definition, 78 of the 103 trees on-site are considered "Protected" trees. (Ibid.)

10 42. In June 2007, the City contracted LSA Associated to conduct

11 environmental studies on the site for the Lower Arsenal Mixed Use Plan Draft

12 Environmental Impact Report. The field surveys identified substantial areas of

13 ruderal grassland, native tree cover, and non-native tree cover on the site. The

14 biologists reported that this supports the following special-status species: Alkali
15 milk vetch (Astragalus tener var. tener); San Joaquin saltbush (Atriplex
16 joaquiniana); Big tarplant (Blepharizonia plumosa ssp. plumosa); Congdon's
17 tarplant (Centromadia parryi ssp. congdonii [Hemizonia parryi ssp. congdonüi);
18 and Pappose tarplant (Centromadia [Hemizonia] parryi ssp. parryi). Yet, protocol-
19 level rare plant surveys were never conducted.

20 43. The above-referenced habitat also supports the following special-status
21 animal species that have the potential to occur within the area: White-tailed kite
22 (Elanus leucurus); Northern harrier (Circus cyaneus); Cooper's hawk (Accipiter
23 cooperii); Ferruginous hawk (Buteo regalis); Merlin (Falco columbarius); Prairie
24 falcon (Falco mexicanus); Long-billed curlew (Numenius americanus); Western
25 burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia hypugea); California horned lark (Eremophila
26 alpestris actia); Loggerhead shrike (Lanius ludovicianus); Pallid bat (Antrozous
27 pallidus) and Townsend's western big-eared bat (Corynorhinus townsendii.)
28

Printed on Recycled Paper PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

44. Prior environmental surveys done by LSA Associates for the City of

2 Benicia further noted the presence of two seasonal wetlands along the north

3 boundary of the site, and recommended that a formal wetland delineation be

4 conducted before approval of any development project on Jefferson Ridge/Officers'

5 Row.

6 b. The Park Road Project Site.

7 45. The Park Road Project is proposed on a site that is on the northwest

8 corner of Jefferson Street and Park Road in the Arsenal Historic District. Both

9 sites have one road out Military East- in the event of refinery or port fire.

10 46. The site is bounded to the south by Jefferson Street, to the east by

11 Park Road, and to the north by a private road (Madison Street). The site is

12 relatively flat with increased elevation on the far north side. Just north of the
13 project site there is a steep grade change and a stand of trees. Similarly, there is a
14 steep grade change to the south of the property towards the Carquinez Strait.

15 47. The site is zoned as Planned Development. The General Plan defines
16 "Planned Development" as description of a proposed unified development,

17 consisting at a minimum of a
18 map and adopted ordinance setting forth the regulations governing, and the

19 location and phasing of all proposed uses and improvements to be included in the
20 development." (p. 202.) Benicia Municipal Code Section 17.44.020 states: "No use
21 other than an existing use shall be permitted in a PD district except in accord with
22 a valid PD plan or specific plan." The Project's Staff Report did not note any
23 existing ordinance guiding development on the site.
24 48. A 24-foot-tall oak tree lives on the southwestern side of the property,

25 designated as a "Significant Tree" under the Arsenal Historic Conservation Plan.
26 49. The AHCP specifically describes the property, stating: "Additionally,

27 the building at the Northwest corner of Jefferson Street and Park Street,
28 interrupts the continuity of the residential officer's row. Pedestrian and vehicular

Printed on Recycled Paper PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
9

- circulation must also be adequately planned for if new development is to occur,
2 given the lack of sidewalks, blocked access and private ownership of portions of

3 Jefferson Street." (AHCP, p. 57.)

4 III. The Administrative Process.

5 50. Senate Bill 35 allows for streamlining of multi-family projects that

6 include 10 percent affordable units only when proposed projects meet its specified

7 criteria, including compliance with all applicable objective planning and zoning

8 standards. Senate Bill 35 does not allow for streamlining where a project is

9 proposed on a site that features wetlands or habitat for protected species.

10 51. For both Projects, the City originally identified many inconsistencies

11 with its objective planning and zoning standards. It subsequently removed several

12 of these standards from consideration, on the grounds they were not applicable, or
13 not objective, despite the fact several standards were applicable and objective.

14 52. For example, after reviewing the Jefferson Ridge Project, the City

15 published a Draft Evaluation of Consistency with Applicable Adopted Objective

16 Standards that identified various inconsistencies with City Objective Planning and
17 Zoning Standards. This included conflicts with Policy 2.20.1 ("Maintain at least
18 Level of Service D on all city roads, street segments, and intersections"), Policy

19 2.36.1 ("Approve development only when a dependable and adequate water supply
20 to serve the development is assured"), Goal 2.40: ("Ensure adequate wastewater
21 treatment capacity to serve all development shown in the General Plan"), Policy
22 3.1.3 ("Preserve historic trees and landscapes"), and conflicts with setback

23 requirements and private open space, and conflicts with standards from the
24 Arsenal Historic Conservation Plan, among others, including multiple requests for

25 more information.

26 53. The City also found the Jefferson Ridge Project conflicted with

27 |Municipal Code Section 17.28.020 zoning designation, noting 'Multifamily
28 Residential Not permitted on ground level." The City further found conflict with

Printed on Recycled Paper PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
10

H

2 Municipal Code Section 17.100.020 subdivision (C), which requires grading be less

3 than 5,000 cubic yards, stating, "Grading exceeds 5,000 CY. Provide information in

4 accordance with 17.100.020." The City identified a number of conflicts. The

5 General Plan requires no net stormwater runoff.
54.

6 Members of the community highlighted several conflicts with the

7 AHCP and Objective Planning and Zoning Standards for both Projects. This
included several standards that the City claimed the Projects demonstrated
8 consistency. For example, in the Park Road Project, the City found consistency

9

10 with the requirement that a project provide residential type landscaping consisting

11 of a front lawn and landscaping and accent planting. Yet, the Project's Preliminary

12 Planting Plan (Sheet L-2.0) shows no landscaping for the area between the picket

13 fence and buildings except for two new trees on Jefferson Street.
55.

14 The City subsequently removed many of the standards it had

15 identified as conflicting with the Project as proposed.
56.

16 The City also failed to incorporate many standards from the AHCP. In

17 particular, a commenter stated that in reviewing the Park Road Project, the City

18 only applied 37 of the 64 design standards and guidelines from the AHCP that

19 apply to the design of residential buildings in Subdistrict 2 (Officer's Row).
57. The City failed to consider public safety standards. During the June
20 30, 2022, Planning Commission meeting, Commission staff stated that Senate Bill
21

22 35 applications where not subject to any public safety standards because those

23 standards contain subjective as well as objective elements, and therefore the entire

24 standard(s) had to be considered subjective. Yet, Park Road is a busy thoroughfare
for industrial traffic with a blind curve. a

25 58. Despite the various inconsistencies, on August 26, 2022, the City
26 issued ministerial approvals for both Projects.

27 59.

28 This action was timely filed.

Printed on Recycled Paper
11 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

2 AND INADEQUATE REMEDIES AT LAW

3 60. Although exhaustion of administrative remedies is not required when

4 an exemption is used, members of Petitioner objected to the project in the

5 administrative process, and fully exhausted administrative remedies.

6 61. Members of Petitioner appeared at public "oversight" meetings

7 regarding the projects and submitted written comments to the City raising the

8 issues set forth in this Petition.

9 62. On August 29, 2022, members of the public sent a letter to the City
10 informing the City it would be appealing the August 26, 2022 approvals of the
11 projects.

12 63. On September 1, 2022, the public filed an appeal of the City's approval
13 of the 1451 Park Road Project. On September 9, 2022, members of the public sent a
14 supplemental letter detailing reasons for the appeal.

15 64. On September 1, 2022, members of the public filed an appeal of the
16 City's approval of the Jefferson Ridge Project.
17 65. On September 14, 2022, the City a sent a letter in response, stating that
18 the City's appeals process does not apply to the Projects, thus denying to hear the
19 appeal.

20 66. After members of the public submitted another letter on September 30,
21 2022 requesting an appeal, the City sent a letter in response on October 13, 2022
22 denying to hear any appeal.

23 67. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the course of
24 ordinary law unless this Court grants the requested writs of mandate. In the

25 absence of such a remedy, Respondent's approval of the lot line adjustment, site

26 plan and design review will form the basis for a development project that will
27 proceed in violation of state law.
28

68. Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.7 by

2 sending a copy of this petition with the California Attorney General. (Exhibit A)

3 69. Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.5

4 by providing the City with notice of intention to commence the action. (Exhibit B)

5 70. Petitioner elects to prepare the administrative record. (Exhibit C)

6 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

7 (VIOLATION OF CEQA; A STATUTORY EXEMPTION IS NOT AVAILABLE

8 AND APPEAL IS REQUIRED)

9 71. Petitioner incorporates all previous paragraphs as if fully set forth.

10 72. CEQA requires the City to conduct an adequate environmental review
11 prior to making any formal decision regarding projects subject to the Act. (CEQA

12 Guidelines, 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15004).
13 73. The proposals to construct the 1451 Park Road Project and the

14 Jefferson Ridge Project ("Projects") are both projects within the meaning of CEQA.
15 74. Approval of the Projects is a discretionary action subject to CEQA.

16 75. The City claimed the Projects were exempt from CEQA under its
17 statutory exemption for ministerial permits and Government Code Section 65913.4.
18 76. A development project must meet a number of statutory criteria to

19 qualify for Senate Bill 35 streamlining. The proposed project must comply with
20 existing residential and mixed-use zoning, and be consistent with objective zoning
21 standards, objective subdivision standards, and objective design review standards
22 in effect at the time that the development is submitted to the local government
23 pursuant to this section. (Gov. Code, § 65913.4, subd. (5).)
24 77. Senate Bill 35 excludes any development proposed on sites that are
25 wetlands, as defined in the United States Fish and Wildlife Service Manual, Part
26 660 FW 2 (June 21, 1993), or sites that are habitat for protected species identified

27 as candidate, sensitive, or species of special status by state or federal agencies, fully
28 protected species, or species protected by the federal Endangered Species Act of

Printed on Recycled Paper PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
13

1973 (16 U.S.C. Sec. 1531 et seq.), the California Endangered Species Act (Chapter

2 1.5 (commencing with Section 2050) of Division 3 of the Fish and Game Code), or

3 the Native Plant Protection Act (Chapter 10 (commencing with Section 1900) of

4 Division 2 of the Fish and Game Code). (Gov. Code, § 65913.4 subd. (6)(C), (J).)

5 78. Because the Projects do not meet the criteria under Senate Bill 35, and

6 a Statutory Exemption is not applicable either project, CEQA requires that an

7 environmental review document be prepared and reviewed by the City prior to

8 issuing a decision on the Projects.

9 79. Neither Project meets the Senate Bill 35 criteria because the Projects

10 conflict with objective zoning standards, objective subdivision standards, and

11 objective design review standards. In particular, the Projects include residential

12 uses on the ground floor, despite the fact that the City's zoning code prohibits this.

13 80. The Projects also violated several design standards, including specified
14 setback requirements, required under the City's Arsenal Historic Conservation

15 Plan and Zoning Code.

16 81. There is already in place a ready-made system for judging the
17 significance of historic sites, and therefore, there is a system for judging the
18 significance of adverse impacts to historic sites. The system includes local,

19 county, state and federal registers of historic places. Destruction of a resource on a
20 county list has a lesser environment impact compared with destruction or
21 impairment of the value of a site on the National Register of Historic Places.

22 Projects that destroy or impair the significance of a site on the National Register,

23 as the Projects do, clearly have the most significant adverse impact on historic
24 resources for environmental review purposes.

25 82. The Projects also failed to demonstrate they do not conflict with
26 several objective General Plan standards, including Policy 2.20.1, which requires
27 that projects maintain of Level of Service D on all City roads, street segments, and
28 intersections.

Printed on Recycled Paper PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
14

83. Further, the Jefferson Ridge Project is proposed on a site that may

2 have wetlands and habit for protected species, as demonstrated by the City's own

3 environmental review studies, rendering the Project ineligible for streamlining as

4 a ministerial project.

5 84. The City's approval of the Projects thus violates CEQA because the

6 Projects do not qualify for the Senate Bill 35 ministerial approval, yet an
7 environmental review document was not prepared and reviewed prior to the City's

8 approval of the Projects.

9 85. Because the City's approvals of the Projects rely on an inapplicable

10 exemption in violation of CEQA, they must be set aside.

11 86. Additionally, members of the public filed appeals of the approvals

12 pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21151 subdivision (c) but the City

13 wrongly denied that such an appeal existed. The City did not have a hearing to
14 deny the appeal. Rather, the City merely stated such an appeal was not available

15 to the public. The City's action was erroneous and an error of law and abuse of

16 discretion.

17 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

18 (VIOLATION OF MUNICIPAL CODE)
19 87. Petitioner incorporates all previous paragraphs as if fully set forth.

20 88. The Jefferson Ridge Project is located in the Commercial Office (CO)
21 District. The Municipal Code states that in the CO District, Multifamily and
22 Single-Family Residential uses are "[n]ot permitted on ground level." The City's

23 approval of the Jefferson Ridge Project violated the Benicia Municipal Code section
24 17.28.020, because the Project proposes residential units that include the ground

25 level.

26 89. The City found that the Project conflicted with this provision of the
27 zoning code, 17.28.020. (Attachment 2 of Agenda Item No. 10.A for January 13,

2 2022 Meeting, p. 13.) Yet, the City ultimately reversed this finding without

3 explanation in its approval of the application on August 26, 2022.
90.

4 Both Projects further violate the Municipal Code Chapter 12.24, the

5 City's tree protection ordinance. Section 12.24.080 requires that a "city arborist

6 shall determine in writing" (1) all trees that could be affected by a project and (2)

7 which trees are required to be preserved. This determination shall be made part of

8 the staff report. Neither Project included such determination by a city arborist.
91.

9 Section 12.24.090 prescribes requirements for protection of trees on

10 property during construction. Section 12.24.120 requires a permit to remove a

11 protected tree and public notice to be posted for applications to remove a protected

12 street tree, which any citizen may appeal under Section 12.24.150. The Jefferson

13 Ridge Project Staff Report notes, "A number of additional trees would be removed"

14 but does not specify where. The Jefferson Ridge Project, which only used a

15 consultant arborist report, rather than a city arborist, reported the anticipated

16 removal of over 100 trees, almost half of them protected trees.

17 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

18 (VIOLATION OF PLANNING AND ZONING LAW, GOVERNMENT CODE

19 SECTION 65300 ET SEQ. AND CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE SECTION

20 1094.5)

92.

21 93. Petitioner incorporates all previous paragraphs as if fully set forth.

22 The California Planning and Zoning Law requires the legislative body

23 of each county to adopt a general plan for the physical development of the county.
State law provides that the City's General Plan is a fundamental land use
24 planning document and serves as the constitution for future development within
25 the City.

26 94. The General Plan incorporates and requires consistency with the
27 Arsenal Historic Conservation Plan. (General Plan, p. 103.)

16 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

95. Government Code section 65030.1 directs that decisions about growth

2 "should be guided by an effective planning process, including the local general

3 plan." Government Code section 65300.5 requires that the local general plan be

4 "integrated, internally consistent and compatible." Land use actions, including the

5 approvals associated with the Projects, also must be consistent with the General

6 Plan.

7 96. The Projects are inconsistent with numerous mandatory General Plan

8 policies, including, but not limited to Policy 3.1.5 (Permit new development ... in
historic districts when consistent with the policies of the applicable Historic

10 Conservation Plan); Policy 3.1.3 (Preserve historic trees and landscapes); Program
11 2.14.F (Where feasible, provide pedestrian sidewalks in all residential areas along

12 both sides of the street); Policy 2.20.1 (Maintain at least Level of Service D on all

13 city roads, street segments, and intersections); Policy 2.36.1 (Approve development

14 only when a dependable and adequate water supply is assured).
15 97. While state Planning and Zoning Law mandates that local
16 jurisdictions adopt a general plan, and mandates that certain elements be adopted
17 as part of a general plan, and those elements meet certain minimum requirements,
18 the state defers to the local agencies and allows them discretion in choosing

19 policies, goals, and the means to implement those policies. The state does not
20 overreach its traditional, constitutional role in the separation of powers model of
21 governance applied through the federal and state constitutions and governments.

22 General plans require horizontal and vertical consistency. That is, each element of
23 the general plan must be a statement of policy consistent with other elements of
24 the general plan. All project approvals that require conformity with the general

25 plan must also ensure consistency with the general plan's various elements and

26 policies. The Projects in this case must be consistent with the General Plan but
27 they are not.

Re: Challenge under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) to
the Jefferson Ridge Project and 1451 Park Road Project, Benicia, CA

Dear Ms. Wolfe,

Please take notice that 1000 Friends Protecting Historic Benicia plans to file a Petition for
Writ of Mandate challenging the City of Benicia's failure to comply with the California
Environmental Quality Act in approving the Jefferson Ridge Project and 1451 Park Road Project
(*Projects") via streamlined ministerial process. The ministerial approvals were not appropriate
given the Projects' failure to satisfy the qualification criteria required under Senate Bill 35, and
the Projects' significant environmental impacts.

Sincerely,
