Babak Naficy 11 PATRICK MCGIBNEY, an individual Case No.: 22CVP-0287

12 Petitioner and plaintiff,

13 VS. PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF

14 COUNTY OF SAN LUIS OBISPO; SAN MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR

7 15 LUIS OBISPO COUNTY BOARD OF DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE

SUPERVISORS; DOES 1 to 10, inclusive, RELIEF

GREENVIEW, LLC, a California limited Pub. Res. Code § 21000, et seq.

21

22 Petitioner and plaintiff PATRICK McGIBNEY hereby alleges as follows:
INTRODUCTION
23 1.
24 Through this action, Patrick McGibney ("Petitioner") challenges the County of

25 San Luis Obispo's (*County") approval of Minor Use Permit No. DRC2018-00010 for a

26 cannabis cultivation and processing facility (the "Project") operated by applicants Greenview,

27

28 PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 1-

1 LLC, Salvador Cano, and Rene Cano ("Real Parties") and subsequent denial of Petitioner's

2 appeal to the San Luis Obispo County Board of Supervisors ("BOS").

3 2. The mitigated negative declaration ("MND") prepared by the County for the
Project violates the California Environmental Quality Act (*CEQA") and fails as informational

5 document because it fails to adequately describe the Project's environmental baseline or to

6 adequately analyze the Project's potential environmental impacts. The MND is also inadequate
to the extent that it fails to adequately analyze feasible mitigation measures or to explore
7 alternatives. The County ultimately violated CEQA by failing to prepare an Environmental
8 Impact Report ("EIR") because substantial evidence in the record supports a conclusion that the
9 Project may cause one or more significant impacts on the environment.
10 3. If the approvals are not set aside, the surrounding community, adjacent property
Babak Naficy 11 owners, endangered species known to occur on or around the property, and especially the already

12 stressed Carrizo Groundwater Basin will be irreparably harmed by the County's failure to

13 adequately analyze and weigh the myriad of potentially significant environmental impacts that

14 may be caused by the Project.

6 15 THE PARTIES

03!J0 MD7 16 4. Petitioner and plaintiff PATRIC McGIBNEY is an individual who resides,

17 recreates, and farms in the vicinity of the Project. Mr. McGibney is deeply concerned about the

18 status of the groundwater aquifer and the impact of this and similar projects on the groundwater
supplies and the natural environment. Mr. Gibney brings this lawsuit in his own interest and in
19 the interest of the public, particularly the residents of California Valley.
20 5. Respondent and defendant COUNTY OF SAN LUIS OBISPO ("County") is a
21 local government agency with the authority to regulate and administer land use and development

22 within the County of San Luis Obispo, California, but only in compliance with the duly adopted

23 provisions of its zoning ordinances, General Plan, Community Plans, County Code, and all
24 applicable provisions of state law, including the California Environmental Quality Act

25 ("CEQA") and the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act ("SGMA").
6.
26 Respondent and defendant SAN LUIS OBISPO COUNTY BOARD OF

27 SUPERVISORS ("BOS" or, collectively with County, "Respondents") is the legislative body

28 PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 2-

and highest administrative body in the County. The BOS has the authority to approve or

•2 disapprove proposed development applications and other land use entitlements.

3 7. Petitioners do not know the identity of DOES 1 to 10 but will amend the Petition

4 as required to specifically identify each such person or entity a as a respondent and defendant if the

5 identity, interest, and capacity of such party, if any, becomes known.
8.
6 The Project applicant is listed in County planning documents as GREENVIEW,

7 LLC (*Applicant"). Therefore, Petitioners are informed and believe and on that basis allege that
Greenview, LLC, a California limited liability company formed in 2019 with offices located in
8 Santa Margarita, California, is a real party in interest.
9 9. Based on the County records, it appears that RENE CANO (collectively with
10 Applicant "Real Parties") is an individual applicant and a recipient of the MUP. Therefore,

Babak Naficy 11 Petitioners are informed and believe and on that basis allege that allege that Rene Cano is a real

12 party in interest.

13 10. Based on the County records, it appears that SALVADOR CANO (collectively

14 with Applicant "Real Parties") is an individual applicant and a recipient of the MUP. Therefore,

0 15 Petitioners are informed and believe and on that basis allege that allege that Salvador Cano is a
0J!J0 M0T 16 real party in interest.
11. Petitioners do not know the identity of ROES 11 to 20 but will amend the Petition
17 as required to specifically identify each such person or entity as a real party in interest if the
18 identity, interest, and capacity of such party, if any, becomes known.
19 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

20 12. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to California Code of Civil

21 Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5, and Public Resources Code section 21167. This Court has

22 the authority to issue a writ of mandate directing Respondents to vacate and set aside their

23 approval of the Project under Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5. This Court also

24 has authority to award attorney's fees and costs under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5

25 where, as here, Petitioners seek to enforce important rights affecting the public interest.
13.
26 Venue for this action properly lies in the Superior Court of San Luis Obispo

27 County because Respondents are the County of San Luis Obispo and its highest legislative body

28 PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 3-

1 and because the action concerns the approval of a Project concerning real property entitlements

•2 in San Luis Obispo County.

3 PROCEDURAL ALLEGATIONS

4 14. Petitioners have performed any and all conditions precedent to filing the instant

5 action and have exhausted any and all administrative remedies to the extent required by law, by

6 inter alia, opposing the Project in written and oral comments and filing an appeal to the County

7 Board of Supervisors.
15.
8 Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code ("Pub.
Res. Code") § 21167.5 by mailing a written notice of the commencement of this action to
9 Respondents prior to filing this petition and complaint. A true and correct copy of that
10 correspondence is attached hereto as EXHIBIT A.
DqDS Naficy 11 16. Petitioners have complied with the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure
12 section 388 by mailing a copy of the Petition and Complaint to the Attorney General of the State

13 of California.

14 17. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of
o 15 law unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to comply
00!0 Law 16 with their duties and set aside the City's unlawful approval of the Project. In the absence of such

17 remedies, Respondents' approval will remain in effect in violation of CEQA and other state and
local laws.
18 18. If Respondents are not enjoined from approving the Project and undertaking
19 and/or permitting acts in furtherance thereof, Petitioner and other residents of San Luis Obispo
20 County will suffer irreparable harm from which there is no adequate remedy at law.
21 19. In pursuing this action, which involves enforcement of important rights affecting

22 the public interest, Petitioners will confer a substantial benefit on the general public, including

23 citizens of San Luis Obispo County and the State of California, and therefore will be entitled to

24 attorney's fees and costs pursuant to, inter alia, Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5.

25 20. Petitioners bring this action in part pursuant to Public Resources Code sections

26 21167, 21168, and/or 21168.5, Code of Civil Procedure section 1085, and/or Code of Civil

27 Procedure section 1094.5, which require that an agency's approval of a project be set aside if the

28 PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 4-

1 agency has prejudicially abused its discretion. Prejudicial abuse of discretion occurs either where

•2 an agency has failed to a proceed in a manner required by law or where its determination or

3 decision is not supported by substantial evidence. Respondents have prejudicially abused their

4 discretion because the County failed to proceed in the manner required by law and/or the

5 County's findings and factual conclusions are not supported by substantial evidence.
FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
6

7 21. On November 5. 2021, the County Planning Department Hearing Officer

8 (Hearing Officer") considered the Project including Real Parties' application for Minor Use

9 Permit DRC2018-00010. The Hearing Officer conditionally approved the project subject to the
findings and conditions. On November 19, 2021, Petitioner timely appealed the Hearing
10 officers's approval.
Babak Naficy 11 22. The BOS considered and denied the appeal on September 13, 2022. To date, the
12 County has not filed a Notice of Determination.
13 23. The Project site is a 41-acre property located at 8770 Carrisa Highway in Santa
14 Margarita, California (Assessor's Parcel Number 072-301-012). The Project site falls within the
0 15
eO!JO MD7 Carrizo Planning Area in the northeastern area of San Luis Obispo County near the village of

16 California Valley.

17 24. The topography is flat to gently sloping. The Project site is partially located in a is

18 100-year flood hazard zone. There is an unnamed ephemeral drainage that traverses the property
and connects to Soda Lake. The drainage flows in a northwest to southeast direction.
19 25. According to a County a Staff Report prepared for the August 9, 2022 BOS
20 | meeting, 1,250 square feet of cannabis cultivation occurred on the Project site from
21 approximately 2016 to 2018. The Staff Report states that the site currently includes single-
22 family residence, multiple small accessory structures (shed, chicken coop, carport), a small

23 agricultural pond located on the southwestern corner of the property, and a larger agricultural

24 pond located near the central eastern edge of the property. Allegedly, cattle grazing occurs on the

25 northern portion of the property. The existing residential area, accessory structures, pond, and

26 cattle grazing would remain and are not proposed to be a part of the cannabis operations.

27

28 PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 5-

1 26. The County Staff Report states that the Project is a phased development of three

•2 acres of outdoor cannabis cultivation canopy within hoop structures, as well as ancillary onsite

3 processing activities, ancillary transportation of cannabis products, and other related site

4 improvements which potentially include substantial grading and site alterations.

5 27. The County Staff Report further explains that Phase will include the installation

6 of 136,500 square feet of hoop structures, security fencing and surveillance equipment, a 5,000-
gallon galvanized steel water tank, three 2,500-gallon tanks, a 120 square foot pesticide storage
7 shed, and improvements for parking and access. Phase II includes the installation of a 10,000
8 square foot processing facility.
9 28. The MND, prepared on August 23, 2021, admits fairy shrimp were observed on
10 site in and around the ponds within the ephemeral drainage. The MND further admits that the
Babak Naficy 11 fairy shrimp onsite may be the endangered Longhorn fairy shrimp (Branchinecta longiantenna)

12 or the threatened Vernal pool fairy shrimp (Branchinecta lynchi) which have been known to

13 occur in the area and on the property. Despite this admission, the County never conducted any

14 adequate surveys to identify the fairy shrimp that occurs on site.

6 29.
15 In his appeal of the Planning Hearing Officer's approval of the Project, Petitioner
00!0 Law argued that the County's failure to survey for the fairy shrimp was a CEQA violation. In
16 response, Staff argued surveys were unnecessary because the proposed mitigation, i.e., a 50-foot
17 buffer, would reduce any potential impact to less than significant.
18 30. More specifically, the Staff Report claims that "since the project site proposes a
19 50 foot setback back from the ephemeral drainage the pond fairy shrimp habitat will be avoided,

20 and no further survey or mitigation are required." The Staff Report does not explain, however,

21 how or why a 50-foot setback is adequate to avoid any significant potential impacts. In its

22 comments, Petitioner argued that neither the MND nor the Staff Report explain, or cite any

23 substantial evidence from which it can be seen why changes in site topography hydrology and

24 drainage patterns caused by Project's operation and grading will not detrimentally impact the

25 ephemeral drainage and ponds in which the fairy shrimp have been observed.
31. Likewise, the MND does not explain how the 50-foot setback is to be measured.
26 This is a significant problem because the MND admits both the pond and the drainage are
27

28 PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 6-

1 "ephemeral." The County's failure to adequately describe this mitigation measure was in itself a

.2 violation of CEQA.

3 32. The historic scarcity of water in Carrizo have been exacerbated by prolonged

4 drought conditions that will likely only worsen as a result of climate change. The County's 2014

5 report entitled California Valley Village Plan unambiguously confirmed that at that time the
Carrizo Plains area was in a state of overdraft.
6

7 Groundwater Supplies and Project Impacts on Groundwater

8
33. The County has never adequately analyzed the Carrizo Plain groundwater basin
9 and the basin's sustainable yield is unknown. Until recently, the County's planning decisions had
10 been based on the assumption that this basin has limited capacity and is unbale to sustain any
Babak Naficy 11 substantial development or intensive cultivation. This general understanding is reflected in the
12 comments of Supervisor Arnold when she told the San Luis Obispo New Times, "[w]ith the

13 limited availability of water and remoteness, I don't think that is an appropriate place for
14 cultivation." July 23, 2017, (www.sanluisobispo.com/news/local/article163119508.)

0 15 34. Supervisor Arnold's statement is echoed in the County Master Water Report,
e0!J0 Law 16 which acknowledges that "water availability in the region is limited."
35.
17 The historically low water levels in Carrizo have been exacerbated by prolonged
drought conditions that will likely only worsen as a result of climate change. A 2014 County
18 report entitled California Valley Village Plan unambiguously confirmed that the Carrizo Plains
19 area was in a state of overdraft.

20 36. Groundwater conditions have not improved since 2014. According to Drought
21 California (https://drought.ca.gov/current-drought-conditions),"[t]he water year that ended

22 September 30 [2021] was the second driest on record, due to extreme heat and lack of rain and

23 snow. All 58 counties in California are now under a drought emergency proclamation."

24 According to a March 21, 2022 California Drought Update, "January and February 2022 were

25 the driest consecutive January and February on record dating back over 100 years in the Sierra

26 Nevada." Current conditions are entirely consistent with climate models that predict prolonged
droughts and water shortage in California.
27

28 PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 7-

1 37. The available evidence, which shows that the historic water supply scarcity in the

2 Carrizo and the current drought will only worsen as global temperatures rise, casts doubt on the

3 MND's assumption that sufficient water supplies exist to adequately supply this Project in

4 addition to all existing demand on groundwater in the Project's vicinity. Staff's analysis and

5 conclusion to the contrary was based on cherry picking information that supports the MND's

6 conclusion and the exclusion of information and data that establish that the groundwater
resources in the Project area are scarce. For example, the fact that the 2019 Sustainable
7 Groundwater Management Act Basin Prioritization does not list the Carrizo Groundwater Basin
8 as a high priority basin in itself does not amount to substantial evidence that the basin is not in
9 overdraft or is not critically low. The Staff Report does not list the factors and considerations that

10 guide basin prioritization and fails to explain why the fact that Carrizo is not designated as a
Babak Naficy 11 highest priority basin necessarily supports a conclusion that the basin can accommodate active

12 cannabis cultivation. A review of the factors that inform the prioritization process shows that the

13 low-priority designation in this case simply means that the basin did not meet certain the DWR

14 criteria for prioritization such as population, number of public wells, projected population

o 15 growth, etc. The DWR itself has emphatically stated that a low-priority designation simply
00!J0 M0] 16 means the basin has not been studied and is NOT to be interpreted as an indicator of basin health
or sustainability.
17 33. The MND fails to discuss or analyze whether meeting the Project's demand is
18 capable of causing adverse impacts on the basin or neighboring wells. Vineyard Area Citizens
19 for Responsible Growth. Inc. v. City of Rancho Cordova (2007) 40 Cal.4th 412, 434, as

20 modified (Apr. 18, 2007) ("The ultimate question under CEQA, moreover, is not whether an
21 EIR establishes a likely source of water, but whether it adequately addresses the reasonably

22 foreseeable impacts of supplying water to the project.")

23 34. The MND and County Staff's consideration of the Project impacts on

24 groundwater was fatally flawed because the MND's analysis of the Project's water demand was

25 erroneous and underestimated the Project's true water demand. Expert comments submitted on
behalf of Petitioner established that the County relied on a cannabis industry study conducted by
26 Milewide Nursery located in Humboldt County, under conditions that are substantially different
27

28 PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 8-

1 compared to the Project's climate conditions. Humboldt County's average annual rainfall is 55

• 2 inches, compared to the Carrizo Plain's average annual rainfall of between 8 and 10 inches.

3 Humboldt County's average summer temperature is 82F, compared with Carrizo Plain's

4 average summer temperature of 90F.

5 35. Moreover, the County's water demand analysis failed to account for the water

6 usage by the 10,000 square foot ancillary processing facility.
36. The MND estimates the Project's water demand as "...0.03 gallons per square
7 foot of canopy for outdoor cannabis plants, and 0.1 gallons per square foot of canopy for indoor
8 grow operations." These estimates amount to a gross misrepresentation of the findings of the
9 Milewide study and a materially incorrect calculation. 0.03 gallons is only about ½ cup of water
10 per square foot per day. A cannabis plant cannot possibly be grown to maturity outdoors during a
Babak Naficy 11 roughly five-month growth period during the spring and summer on the Carrizo Plain on ½ cup

12 of water a day per square foot of canopy.

13 37. The MND's analysis of the Project's water demand contains another fundamental

14 flaw because the Milewide study for outdoor grows was based on water usage per plant in Santa

o 15 Cruz, but the Santa Cruz County's draft EIR preparer incorrectly converted it to water usage per
e0!J0 Law 16 square foot of canopy. The Santa Cruz County draft EIR preparer used 144 square feet of canopy|
because the growing method used for the outdoor control group in the Milewide study, as stated
17 in their report, was an orchard style plan with 1 plant per 12' x 12' plots in 1-gallon pots. The
18 Santa Cruz Draft EIR preparer erroneously assumed that in a typical industrial cannabis farm
19 only one plant will be grown in 144 square foot area (12'x12' plot).

20 38. The MND does not contain the number of plants per square foot that will be

21 cultivated in the outdoors hoops, however a study of the literature suggests a range from 6 to 12

22 square feet/plant for outdoor and indoor greenhouse grows. Based on this range, Petitioner's

23 expert estimated that the proposed Project water demand will be between 0.36 to 0.72 to gallon

24 per square foot per day, which is between 12 to 24 times greater than the County's estimate.
39.
25 Petitioner's expert further explained that even the 0.36 to 0.72 to gallon per
square foot per day estimate is likely too low, because other studies have shown that cannabis
26 plants typically need much more water. For example, according to a study published by the
27

28 PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 9-

1 Cannabis Team at the Central Coast RWQCB, average water demand for cannabis plants is 6

2 gallons per day per plant during the growing season, as calculated by California Department of

3 Fish & Wildlife using direct observation of the spatial arrangements of 32 outdoor and indoor

4 greenhouses'.

5 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

6 (Violation of CEQA)

7 40. Petitioner incorporates by reference each and every allegation contained in the

8 preceding paragraphs of this Petition as though fully set forth herein.

9 41. The County violated CEQA by certifying an MND that does not meet the

10 standards set by CEQA and fails as an informational document. In particular, the MND violates
CEQA because it does not include any adequate analysis of the Project's impacts on water
Babak Naficy 11 supplies and biological resources.
12 42. The MND failed to adequately analyze the Project's impacts, directly or through
13 habitat modifications, on any species identified as a candidate, sensitive, or special status
14 species, including endangered Longhorn fairy shrimp (Branchinecta longiantenna) or the
7
92!!0 MD] 15 threatened Vernal pool fairy shrimp (Branchinecta lynchi).

16 43. The MND fails to adequately discuss the Project's setting including the presence

17 or absence of endangered wildlife or the status of the groundwater basin underlying the Project

18 site.

44.
19 The MND fails to adequately discuss or analyze the Project's direct, indirect, and
cumulative impacts on the groundwater basin, as well as the neighboring wells and wildlife.
20
45. The MND fails to adequately analyze the feasibility of proposed mitigations,
21 which are impermissibly vague and inadequately described (e.g. 50 foot setback from ephemeral
22 drainage and pond.)
23 46. The MND fails to adequately analyze the Project's water demand, in part by
24 relying on inappropriate assumptions and demonstrably flawed studies.

• 2 The County violated CEQA by failing to prepare an environmental impact report

Project may have one or more significant adverse impacts on the environment (e.g. water

4 supplies and protected species).

7 (Abuse of Discretion: Findings Not Supported by Substantial Evidence)

48.
8 Petitioner incorporates by reference each and every allegation contained in the

fax: 805-593-0946 this notice of intent to commence litigation against the County of San Luis

babaknaficy@sbcglobal.net Obispo (County) unless the County immediately withdraws its conditional
approval of the Greenview, LLC Minor Use Permit (MUP) no. DRC2018-
00010 concerning development of a cannabis cultivation and processing facility at 8770 Carrisa Highway in Santa Margarita, California (the Project)
and denial of Mr. McGibney's appeal no. APPL2021-00020 to the Board of
Supervisors.

Mr. McGibney is an individual who resides, recreates, and farms in the
vicinity of the Project. He is deeply concerned about its impact on the natural
environment and especially on the Carrizo Groundwater Basin.

Mr. McGibney intends to commence litigation pursuant to California Code of
Civil Procedure section 1085/1094.5 and the California Environmental
Quality Act to overturn the County's approval of the Project's MUP.

LEGAL ARGUMENTS

Mr. McGibney contends that the County's Mitigated Negative Declaration
(MND) was legally inadequate and violated CEQA for a number of reasons,
including the following: the MND fails to adequately describe the

project setting and fails to adequately analyze project impacts on the
environment, such as the Carrizo groundwater basin, neighboring wells
and water supplies, and biological resources.

The MND also fails to adequately analyze the Project's water demands or the current status of the Carrizo Groundwater Basin. Mr. McGibney further contends that the MND violated CEQA by failing to adequately
analyze the proposed mitigations.

Furthermore, the County's findings in support of the MND and denial of
Mr. McGibney's appeal, including but not limited to findings regarding the Project's direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts on groundwater and impacts on biological resources, are not supported by substantial
evidence.

Feel free to contact the undersigned should you have any questions or
concerns.

Sincerely,
Babak Nafy

Attorney for Patrick McGibney
