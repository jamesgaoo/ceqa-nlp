VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

HNMENONDOO Introduction

1. This action challenges the action of the City of Los Angeles, Los Angeles City
Council (City Council), and Los Angeles Department of City Planning
(Department) (collectively, City or Respondents) on December 4, 2021,
certifying an environmental impact report (EIR) (No. ENV-2016-3991-EIR) for
land-use entitlements including amending the City's General Plan to change the
land-use designation for the Project Site from Light Industrial to Community
10 Commercial land use within the Central City Community Plan (Community
Plan), and increase Floor Area Ratio (FAR) to 3.9:1 in lieu of the 3:1 FAR
11 otherwise permitted for Height District 2D, a Vesting Zone Change and Height
12 District Change from M2-2D to (T)(Q)C2-2D, a Site Plan Review, a Master
Conditional Use Permit for on-site sales and consumption of alcoholic
14 beverages, a Vesting Tentative Tract Map, and other related actions (Project
Entitlements) for the Southern California Flower Market Project (Project), a 16 proposed mixed-use development that will encompass two buildings, the North
17 Building and South Building, and proposes to build 323 residential apartment
18 units and 64,363 square feet of office space, 4,385 square feet of retail space,
19 63,785 square feet of wholesale space and storage, 13,420 square feet of food and
20 beverage space, and 21,295 square feet of event space on a 3.86-net-acre site
21 located at 709-765 South Wall Street; 306-326 East 7th Street; 750-752 South
22 Maple Avenue (Project Site).
23 2. In approving the Project, the City violated the California Environmental Quality
24 Act, Public Resources Code $$ 21000-21189.3 (CEQA) and the CEQA
25 Guidelines, California Code of Regulations, title 14, $S 15000-15387 plus
26 appendices (CEQA Guidelines).
27 3.
28 The City abused its discretion in approving the Project and related
environmental documentation, as alleged below. 29

30 Parties
31 4. Plaintiff and Petitioner AIDS Healthcare Foundation, a California nonprofît
32 public benefit corporation (AHF or Petitioner), is a nonprofit organization in 33 Los Angeles whose mission is to rid the world of AIDS through a network of
34 pharmacies, thrift stores, healthcare contracts, and other strategic partnerships; 35

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

generating new, innovative ways of treatment, prevention, and advocacy. There 2 is a significant relationship between health outcomes and access to safe,

4 affordable housing. People with HIV are less likely to be able to stay adherent to
their medications and more likely to become sicker and more infectious when
they lack stable housing and/or are homeless. AHF also operates the Heathy
6 Housing Foundation, which provides affordable housing to hundreds of very 7 low-income people and people at risk of homelessness in Los Angeles. The
8 Healthy Housing Foundation also advocates for affordable housing and against 9

10 gentrification. Petitioner, its employees, customers, and the many persons whom
Petitioner serves are beneficially interested in and will be impacted by the
11 outcome of this Project.
12 5.
13 Defendant and Respondent City of Los Angeles is a California charter city

14 located in the County of Los Angeles, California. The Project is within the

15 jurisdictional limits of the City.

16 6. Defendant and Respondent Los Angeles City Council is the elected governing

17 body of the City and is the body responsible for the decision being challenged

18 herein.

19 7. Defendant and Respondent Los Angeles Department of City Planning

20 (Department) is an agency of the City responsible for developing, applying, and
21 enforcing state and local land-use and zoning laws within the jurisdictional
22 limits of the City.
23 8. Defendants and Respondents Does 1-10 are entities of which the true names and
24 capacities are unknown to Petitioner at this time. Petitioner therefore sues said
25 Respondents by fictitious names. Petitioner will amend this petition to show the
26 true names and capacities of Does 1-10 when ascertained.
27 9. Real Party in Interest Southern California Flower Growers, Inc. (Applicant), is a
28 California corporation that is the owner of the Project Site and is the applicant to
29 the City for the Project's General Plan amendments, vesting tentative tract map,
30 and other associated entitlements.
31 10. Real Parties in Interest Roes 1-10 are entities of which the true names and
32 capacities are unknown to Petitioner at this time. Petitioner therefore sues said
33 Real Parties in Interest by fictitious names. Roes 1-10 are agents of Applicant 34 who are responsible in some manner for the conduct described in this petition, 35

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

H N or other persons or entities who claim some legal or equitable interest in the
subject matter of this action. Petitioner will amend this petition to show the true 3 names and capacities of Roes 1-10 when ascertained.

5 Jurisdiction and Venue

6 11. Under Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) S$ 1085 and 1094.5 and Public Resources
7 Code §S 21168, 21168.5, and 21168.9, this Court has jurisdiction to issue a writ
8 of mandate to set aside Respondents' decision to certify the EIR and purported
9 approval of the Project.
10 12. Venue is proper in this Court because the Project lies entirely within the County 11 of Los Angeles and the environmental impacts of the Project will be acutely felt 12 in this County. The cause alleged in this petition, or some part of that cause, arise 13 in this county. (CCP $ 393; Cal. State Parks Foundation v. Super. Ct. (2007) 150 14 Cal.App.4th 826.) Venue is also proper in this Court pursuant to CCP §§ 394 15 (actions against a city, county, or local agency), and 395 (actions generally), since 16 the City of Los Angeles is in the County of Los Angeles. 17 13. This petition is timely filed within 30 days after Respondents' filing of a Notice of 18 Determination with the Los Angeles County Clerk, in accordance with Public 19 Resources Code $ 21167. 20
14. 21 This case is properly classified as an unlimited civil case, and therefore is within
the jurisdiction of this Court, because it is not one of the types of cases listed as 22
limited civil cases in CCP §S 86, 86.1, or 87. 23
24 15. Petitioner has provided written notice of its intention to file this petition to

25 Respondents in compliance with Public Resources Code $ 21167.5.

26 16. Petitioner has concurrently filed a notice of their election to prepare the record
27 of administrative proceedings relating to this action, in compliance with Public
28 Resources Code $ 21167.6 or other applicable laws.
29 17. Petitioner has performed any and all conditions precedent to filing this instant
30 action and has exhausted administrative remedies to the extent required by law
31 under Public Resources Code $ 21177. Petitioner or other agencies and
32 individuals raised each of the legal deficiencies asserted in this petition orally or
33 in writing during the Respondents' decision-making process.
34 18. The violations by Respondents as alleged herein have affected the beneficial 35

4

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

interests of Petitioner and its supporting members. The relief sought by way of
2 this Petition will redress this beneficial interest and the likelihood of future
3 injury and interference with Petitioner's interests, and those of its supporting
4 members.

19.
6 Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law

7 unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to

8 set aside its certification of the Project and environmental documents. In the

9 absence of such remedies, Respondents' decisions will remain in effect in

10 violation of state law and injurious to Petitioner.

11 Factual Background
12 The 2019 EIR
13 20. The original Draft EIR for the Project (the 2019 Draft EIR) was issued on
14 September 20, 2018.
15 21. Both AHF and CREED LA commented on the 2019 Draft EIR.
16

17 22. On April 12, 2019, the City issued the Final EIR for the Project, which concluded

18 that the Project would not result in any significant and unavoidable

19 environmental impacts.

20 23. After the City Planning Commission approved the Project, and certified the 2019

21 Draft and Final EIR (the 2019 EIR) AHF and CREED LA appealed the Project

22 approvals and the 2019 EIR to the City Council.

23 24. On October 29, 2019, the PLUM Committee of the Los Angeles City Council
24 held a public hearing to consider the Project and the pending appeals by
25 Petitioner and CREED LA for both Case Nos. CPC-2016-3990-GPA-VZC-HD-
26 MCUP-SPR and VTT Map No. 74568. PLUM made the following
27 recommendations for City Council action:
28 a. find that the Advisory Agency has reviewed and considered the
29 information contained in the EIR prepared for the Project; certify that the
30 EIR was completed in compliance with CEQA, that the EIR was presented
31 to the Advisory Agency as a decision-making body of the lead agency, and
32 that the EIR reflects the independent judgment and analysis of the lead
33 agency; and adopt the Mitigation Monitoring Program (MMP) prepared
34 for the EIR;
35

5

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 b. adopt the findings of the PLUM Committee as the Findings for Council;
2

3 c. resolve to grant in part and deny in part the appeals filed by Petitioner and
CREED LA;
4

5 d. approve the Vesting Tentative Tract Map;

6 e. request the applicant to work with CREED LA for the construction of the

7 Project,

8 f. request the applicant to further evaluate the cost and the affordability of the
9 housing project;
10 g. approve the Master Conditional Use Permit, Site Plan Review, General
11 Plan Amendment to the Central City Community Plan; Vesting Zone
12 Change, and Height District Change;
13 h. and other related recommendations.
14 25.
15 The PLUM Committee voted to forward the Project to the City Council for its
consideration.
16

17 26. On November 12, 2019, the City Council considered and adopted the PLUM

18 Committee Report related to the Project and the pending appeals, approving the

19 Project and certifying the 2019 EIR.

20

21 The Previous Lawsuit

22 27. On December 16, 2019, AHF filed a lawsuit in this Court challenging the 2019
23 EIR and the Project Entitlements, case No. 19STCP05445 (the 2019 Action).
24 That case was assigned to Department 86, Hon. Mitchell L. Beckloff.
25 28. After briefing and trial, the court, in an order issued on April 5, 2021, held that
26 the 2019 EIR was defective because:
27 a. The 2019 EIR's analysis of the Project's GHG emissions did not contain
28 substantial evidence supporting the City's conclusion that the Project's
29 GHG emissions would be insignificant;
30 b. One of the noise mitigation measures was shown to be ineffective in 31 reducing the Project's noise impacts below the threshold of significance. 32
33 29. The court issued a writ of mandate on June 17, 2021, ordering the City to set

34 aside its approvals of the Project and to decertify the 2019 EIR.

35 30. The City purported to comply with the June 17, 2021 writ, as described below,

6

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- and, on December 13, 2021, filed a return to the writ in the 2019 Action. AHF is
2 challenging the sufficiency of the City's compliance with the writ in the 2019
3 Action.
4

5 The PR-EIR
6

7 31. On September 16, 2021, the City circulated for comment a Partially Recirculated

8 Draft Environmental Impact Report (PR-DEIR), containing revised EIR

9 chapters on GHG and noise impacts. Only those two chapters, plus an

10 introduction and related appendices, were recirculated. The Notice of

11 Completion and Availability issued in conjunction with the PR-DEIR, stated that
202 300921 the City would not reconsider other sections of the EIR, and it requested that
reviewers of the PR-DEIR not make comments on other sections of the EIR.

32. AHF submitted comments on the PR-DEIR to the City on October 29, 2021.
33. On November 5, 2021, following the close of the PR-DEIR comment period, the
City issued Partially Recirculated Final Environmental Impact Report (PR-
FEIR) containing responses to comments, and a revised Mitigation Monitoring
18 • Program.
19 34. AHF submitted comments on the PR-FEIR to the City on November 29, 2021.
20 35. On November 30, 2021, the Planning and Land Use Management Committee of 21 the Los Angeles City Council (PLUM Committee), recommended to the City 22 Council that it:
23

24 a. Decertify the 2019 EIR and set aside the Project Entitlements;

25 b. Make appropriate findings;

26 C. Certify the PR-DEIR and PR-FEIR (collectively, the PR-EIR) as compliant

27 with CEQA;

28 d. Re-approve the Project Entitlements.
29 36. On December 3, 221, the City Council adopted the recommendation of the
30 PLUM Committee, certifying the PR-EIR and re-approving the Project
31 Entitlements.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Nm t First Cause of Action
(CCP 5 1085; Violations of CEQA, Los Angeles City Charter, and State Law on
5 Legislative Enactments by Cities)

6 37. Petitioner realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1-36 as if fully set forth here.
7 38. On August 14, 2001, the City Council authorized City departments with CEQA
8 responsibilities to use a 2001 version of the LA CEQA Thresholds Guide as
9 CEQA administrative guidance. The Thresholds Guide provided screening
10 instructions for various types of environmental impacts as well as "thresholds to
11 be used in the determination of the significance of environmental effects" under
12 CEQA Guidelines $ 15065.7(b).

14 39. In 2006, the City Council updated and approved the Thresholds Guide (the 2006
15 Thresholds).

16 40. On May 2, 2019, Vincent P. Bertoni, Director of City Planning, the chief

17 executive of the Department (Director), issued an "advisory memo" (the

18 Thresholds Memo) "adopting the State CEQA Guidelines and Appendix G
environmental checklist questions as the Department's CEQA thresholds of 19 significance pursuant to CEQA Guidelines Section 15064.7(b)" (the Appendix G 20 Thresholds). 21
22 41. The Thresholds Memo was adopted by the Department after a public-review

23 process, which included presentation of the policy change to the Planning

24 Commission on February 28, 2019. Neither the Planning Commission nor the

25 City Council approved the adoption of the Appendix G Thresholds as

26 replacements for the 2006 Thresholds.

27 42. The Department's adoption of the Appendix G Thresholds as City-wide CEQA
28 thresholds is invalid for the following reasons:
29 a. Neither the City Council nor the City Charter has delegated to the
30 Department the authority to adopt CEQA thresholds to be used for all City
31 departments.
32 b. The Thresholds Memo purports to repeal and replace the 2006 Thresholds
33 adopted by the City Council, but the Department does not have the
34 authority to repeal such actions of the City Council.
35

8

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- 2
A0 c. The Thresholds Memo states that the Appendix G Thresholds was adopted
by the Department of City Planning, but it would apply to all departments

5 in the City, because the Department evaluates CEQA compliance for many

O 0 N O projects where other City departments, such as the Bureau of Engineering,
and the Fire Department, are involved as responsible agencies.
d. The adoption of a citywide policy on CEQA thresholds is a legislative

e. matter, which the City Council may not delegate to an inferior body.

10 There is no substantial evidence supporting the Department's adoption of

11 the Appendix G Thresholds for general City-wide use.

90229 Second Cause of Action

43. (CCP § 1094.5; Violations of CEQA)

44. Petitioner realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1-42 as if fully set forth here.

17 As alleged above, the City's purported 2019 adoption of Appendix G as the City's
CEQA thresholds was ineffective. The threshold under which the City has

18 analyzed the Project's GHG impacts is therefore a case-specific threshold. CEQA

19 requires that case-specific thresholds be supported by substantial evidence in the

20 record, but the EIR contains no justification or substantial evidence for its

21 selection of the Appendix G CEQA thresholds as GHG thresholds in this case.

22 This lack of justification violates CEQA, because CEQA requires that thresholds

23 used to evaluate significance of environmental impacts are supported by
substantial evidence.

24 45.

25 The PR-EIR's analysis of GHG impacts includes a lengthy section on the

26 Project's purported consistency with AB-32. But AB-32's planning horizon

27 ended in 2020, so consistency with AB-32 is irrelevant to the PR-EIR's analysis of

28 the Project's GHG impacts. Including such an analysis violates CEQA because it

29 46. is misleading and confusing.

30 The CEQA Guidelines require the City to "consider a timeframe that is

31 appropriate for the project." (Guidelines § 15064.4(b).) The appropriate

32

33 timeframe for a GHG analysis of the Project is 50 years, since buildings like the

34 ones proposed for the Project tend to last approximately 50 years. Even if the

35 City failed to analyze the Project's GHG impacts out to the year 2071, the earliest
end date for a CEQA-compliant GHG analysis for the Project would be 2045,
when the State of California has established policy that the State would have

9

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

UP net-zero GHG emissions. The PR-EIR's failure to analyze the Project's GHG 2 emissions out to 2017 violates CEQA.
M 47. The PR-EIR's significance analysis suffers from the defect the Supreme Court 4 found in Center for Biological Diversity v. California Department of Fish and 5 Wildlife (2015) 62 Cal.4th 204 [Newhall]. There, the EIR claimed that measures 6 adopted to reduce the project's GHG emissions would reduce those emissions by 7 31% below a "No Action Taken" (NAT) scenario, which is below the 29% 8 reduction required by AB 32. But the Supreme Court held that the EIR violated 9 CEQA because it failed to provide substantial evidence that the 31% reduction in 10 the project was consistent with the 29% statewide goal. Here, the EIR claims a 11 reduction of 69% below the NAT scenario, compared to SB 32's target of N0310 reducing statewide GHG emissions by 40%. But the EIR fails to show that the
69% reduction is consistent with a statewide 40% GHG reduction.

48. The PR-EIR adopted a GHG significance threshold under which the Project
16 would have significant GHG emissions if it were to "conflict with an applicable

17 plan, policy or regulation adopted for the purpose of reducing the emissions of

18 greenhouse gases." This threshold does not allow the City to pick and choose

19 which plans, policies, and regulations the Project must be consistent with in

20 order for its emissions to be considered insignificant. The Project conflicts with

21 several such plans, and therefore its GHG emissions are significant. Such

22 conflicts include the following:

23 a. The CARB 2017 Scoping Plan contains a target of reducing the state's GHG

24 emissions 80% below 1990 levels by 2050. The PR-EIR does not establish

25 that the Project is consistent with this goal. The Project is in fact
26 inconsistent with it.

27 b. The CARB 2017 Scoping Plan contains a statewide annual GHG emissions-
28 reduction targets of 6 MTCO2e/capita in 2030 and 2 MTCO2e/capita in
29 2050. Information in the PR-EIR shows that the Project is inconsistent with
30 these targets.
31 C. The Project is also inconsistent with Executive Order B-55-18, which
32 a establishes a policy requiring statewide carbon neutrality in 2045. The
33 Project is inconsistent with this policy, in part because the Project would
34 burn natural gas, precluding the Project itself from becoming carbon-
35

10

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

-
2 neutral. The PR-EIR violates CEQA by not even considering the Project's

3 consistency with this applicable policy.

4 d. The Project is inconsistent with the L.A. Green New Deal Sustainability

5 Plan 2019, which sets goals of reducing building energy use per square foot

6 for all building types between 2025 and 2050 because the Project will use

7 more energy than allowed under that plan.

8 49. As a result of the foregoing defects and others according to proof, Respondents

9 prejudicially abused their discretion by certifying an EIR that does not comply

10 with CEQA and by approving the Project in reliance on it. Accordingly,

11 Respondents' certification of the PR-EIR and purported approval of the Project
12 must be set aside.

13 14 Prayer for Relief
15 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for judgment in its favor and for relief as follows:
16 A. For a writ of mandate commanding the City to vacate and withdraw the

17 certification of the PR-EIR and all Project Entitlements for the Project; requiring
18 the City to comply with CEQA, and ordering Respondents and Real Parties in
19 Interest to cease any and all activity related to the Project that may result in a

20 physical change to the environment unless and until the Project is re-approved

21 following the certification of a legally sufficient EIR for the Project;

22 B. For a writ of mandate ordering the City to set aside its adoption of CEQA

23 Guidelines Appendix G as CEQA thresholds of significance for the City;

24 C.

25 For Petitioner's fees and costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, as

26 authorized by California Code of Civil Procedure $ 1021.5 and any other
applicable provisions of law; and
27 D.

28 For such other relief as this Court deems appropriate and just.
