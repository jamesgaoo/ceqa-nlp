NOTICE TO CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL OF COMMENCEMENT OF CEQA ACTION

PLEASE TAKE NOTICE that on October 18, 2022, Petitioner and Plaintiff City of Los
2 Angeles, a California municipal corporation, acting by and through its Department of Water and
3 Power ("LADWP") filed a Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive and
4 Declaratory Relief alleging, inter alia, that the Great Basin Unified Air Pollution Control District,
5 the Board of Directors of the Great Basin Unified Air Pollution Control District ("Board"), and the

6 Air Pollution Control Officer of the Great Basin Unified Air Pollution Control District

7 (collectively the "District") failed to comply with the California Environmental Quality Act,
8 Public Resources Code sections 21000 et seq. by improperly converting a 2021 Board Order from

9 an order issued under a 2014 Stipulated Judgment to one issued under Health & Safety Code
10 section 42316 and assessing penalties against LADWP for an alleged violation of the 2021 Board
11 Order. The District's Order would require LADWP to construct a project over an area that the
12 District, in previous CEQA review, had avoided because of the presence of significant Tribal
13 Cultural Resources. The District has conducted no CEQA review of the new impacts its Order
14 would cause if construction is completed over the area with significant Tribal Cultural Resources.
15 Pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure section 388, a

Petitioner CITY OF LOS ANGELES, a California municipal corporation, ACTING BY

2 AND THROUGH ITS DEPARTMENT OF WATER AND POWER ("City" or "LADWP") brings
3 this action for writ of mandate under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085, a writ of administrative
4 mandamus under Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5, a writ of mandate for violations of the
5 California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) under Public Resources Code section 21167 and
6 21168, and complaint for equitable estoppel as follows:

7 INTRODUCTION

8 1. Respondents and Defendants the Great Basin Unified Air Pollution Control District,
9 the Board of Directors of the Great Basin Unified Air Pollution Control District, and the Air
10 Pollution Control Officer of the Great Basin Unified Air Pollution Control District (collectively, the
11  "District") have relentlessly sought to impose penalties on the City for the City's alleged "violation"
12 of the District's illegal and improper order to the City, which purports to compel the City to construct

13 a vegetation enhancement project, that has not been approved by the Environmental Protection
14 Agency ("EPA") as a Best Available Control Measure ("BACM") for mitigating air born particulate
15 matter of 10 microns in aerodynamic diameter ("PM1o") over an eligible cultural resource ("ECR")
16 area containing significant tribal cultural resources that are eligible for listing in the California
17 Registry of Historical Resources ("CRHR"). The District's monomania for imposing these penalties
18 is so great that the District has ignored and flouted the law, court rulings, the District's own rules

19 and regulations, the District Board's orders, and the opposition of the Native American Tribes whose
20 cultural resources this project would impact. As the Sacramento County Superior Court stated in
21 recently concluded litigation between the parties, the District seeks "unfettered discretion" to make
22 the City do whatever the District wants, whenever the District wants.

23 2. In the most recent example, the District has attempted to impose $1.4 million in fines
24 against the City through what can only be described as an act of transmutation. After the Sacramento
25 County Superior Court ruled that the District could not enforce the District's illegal and improper
26 order to compel the City to construct a non-BACM vegetation enhancement project over CRHR-
27 eligible tribal cultural resources through a Stipulated Judgment between the parties, the District
28 immediately issued a threatening letter to the City claiming that the previous order and Notice of
2
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR EQUITABLE ESTOPPEL, DECLARATORY
RELIEF, AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 Violation under the Stipulated Judgment was now actually an order under Health & Safety Code
2 section 42316.1 In the letter the "District withdraws its Order to Pay to the City to pay stipulated
3 penalties under the Stipulated Judgement. It instead issues this civil Penalty assessment to the City

4 under the Health & Safety Code."

5 3. To be clear, the istrict did not issue a new order pursuant to section 42316. Rather,
6 the District pretended that the prior order-which it issued pursuant to the 2014 Stipulated
7 Judgment-was actually issued pursuant to section 42316. In fact, neither the Board Order, Notice
8 to Comply, or Notice of Violation made any reference whatsoever to section 42316. The District

9 performed this purported transmutation with no notice to the City and with no hearing. The District,
10 in converting its previous order under the Stipulated Judgment to an order under section 42316, also
11 failed to comply with the District's adopted State Implementation Plan, District Rule 433, and
12 CEQA. Furthermore, in taking this action, the District went back on its word to consult with the
13 Fort Independence Tribe before taking any further actions regarding the significant tribal cultural
14 resource area.

15 4. The City attempted to meet and confer with the District between October 14 and
16 October 18, 2022 and brought to the District's attention the City's many concerns with the District's
17 purported conversion of the legal basis for its previous order. The District, however, was unwilling

18 to withdraw its illegal demands and declared the parties at an impasse. The City brings this action

19 so that the Court can overturn the District's illegal order and assessment of penalties.

20 BACKGROUND

21 5. LADWP has operated a water collection, storage, and distribution system in Inyo
22 County for over 100 years, including in and around Owens Lake in the Owens Valley. This system
23 provides water for millions of residents of the City, who are LADWP's customers. The City directs
24 its water system activities towards balancing the needs of the environment, the Native American
25 Tribes, who have historical affiliation with the area, and LADWP's customers. These activities

26

27

28 Health & Safety Code section 42316 hereinafter "section 42316."

3
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR EQUITABLE ESTOPPEL, DECLARATORY
RELIEF, AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 have included the construction of in excess of $2.5 billion in projects to protect the air quality of the
2 Owens Lake area. The City's efforts have had very beneficial impacts, including the reduction of
3 windblown dust from the Owens Valley area by 99.4 percent and transformation of the Owens

4 Lakebed into a vital habitat for water birds. The City has been, and continues to be, a committed
5 partner in achieving air quality goals for protecting human health and the environment in the Owens

6 Valley Area. This commitment includes indefinitely maintaining the current emissions control
7 infrastructure in place and undertaking additional measures that may become necessary to ensure
8 the protection of human health and the environment.

9 6. The main air quality challenge near Owens Lake is wind-borne dust from the Owens
10 Lakebed, contributing to elevated concentrations of PMio. Since 2000, the Owens Valley Planning
11 Area ("OVPA") has experienced : 99.4 percent reduction in PM10 emissions. PM10 a is a criterial air
12 pollutant regulated by the federal Clean Air Act ("CAA"), 42 U.S.C. section 7401 et seq. The
13 National Ambient Air Quality Standard ("NAAQS" or "Standard") adopted for PM10 under the CAA
14 sets a maximum ambient concentration level for PM1o levels averaged during a 24-hour period and
15 precludes the exceedance of that Standard more than one time per calendar year averaged over a
16 three-year period.

17 7. The CAA further requires the EPA to divide each state into air quality control
18 regions. Each region is characterized as either "attainment" or "non-attainment" for each identified
19 air pollutant, depending on whether the monitored level of that air pollutant in that region is at or
20 below (attainment) or above (non-attainment) the level mandated by the NAAOS.

21 8. Once the EPA establishes the NAAQS, the states have the primary responsibility to
22 establish and implement a State Implementation Plan ("SIP") for achieving and maintaining the
23 NAAQS within each air quality control region of the state. The SIP must establish enforceable
24  emission limitations and other control measures designed to, among other things, achieve attainment
25 in nonattainment areas within the state.

26 9. On August 7, 1987, the EPA designated the OVPA as one of the regions in California
27 in violation of the PM10 NAAQS. The EPA designated the OVPA as a "serious nonattainment area"

28 for PM10.
4
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR EQUITABLE ESTOPPEL, DECLARATORY
RELIEF, AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

10. The State has delegated the responsibility for achieving attainment of the PM10
2 NAAQS in the OVPA to the District. Health and Safety Code section 42316 (*section 42316"),

3 enacted by the Legislature in 1983, provides in part that the District has authority to require the City

4 to undertake reasonable measures at Owens Lake in order to address the impacts of the City's

5 activities.

6 11. The City's more than $2.5 billion in projects in the OVPA are assisting the OVPA to
7 achieve attainment for the PMio NAAQS.

8 The 2014 Stipulated Judgment Was Intended to Bring Finality to the City's Dust

9 Control Responsibilities

10 12. Between 1998 and 2011, the City and the District worked together through a number

11 of agreements to achieve attainment for the PM10 NAAQS in the OVPA.

12 13. However, disagreements arose in August 2011 when the District issued the 2011
13 Supplemental Control Requirement Determination ("SCRD"), which ordered the City to install
14 additional dust control measures on approximately 2.86 square miles of the Owens Lakebed to meet

15 the PMI0 NAAQS for the OVPA. The City appealed the 2011 SCRD under section 42316(b) to the
16 California Air Resources Board ("CARB") and subsequently challenged CARB's determination in
17 the Sacramento County Superior Court in the case titled City of Los Angeles v. California Air
18 Resources Board, et al., Case No. 34-2013-80001451-CU-WM-GDS ("Previous Action") in

19 December 2012.

20 14. While the City's appeal to CARB was pending, the District, on November 16, 2012,

21 issued the 2012 SCRD which ordered the City to install additional dust control measures known as
22 the Phase 10 dust control areas. The City also appealed the 2012 SCRD to CARB, and while that

23 appeal was pending, the District issued yet another SCRD, the "2013 SCRD.

24 15. In 2014, as part of the Previous Action, the City and the District (collectively, the
25 "Parties") entered into a Stipulated Judgment, which was approved and signed by the Sacramento
26 County Superior Court on December 30, 2014 (the "2014 Stipulated Judgment"). A true and correct
27 copy of the 2014 Stipulated Judgment 2014 is attached hereto as Exhibit A.

28 16. The Parties' intent in entering the 2014 Stipulated Judgment was to bring finality to
5
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR EQUITABLE ESTOPPEL, DECLARATORY
RELIEF, AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 the City's dust control responsibilities in the OVPA and to settle any remaining disputes between

2 the Parties. The 2014 Stipulated Judgment recognized the need to balance the requirements to
3 control dust emissions and conserve water with the requirements to minimize impacts to tribal

4 cultural resources and biological resources. (Exhibit A at 11 at 1 BB & CC.)

5 17. As part of the 2014 Stipulated Judgment, the Parties agreed that the District would

6 prepare a revision to the then-current SIP that combines the requirements of that SIP and the
7 additional requirements established by the 2014 Stipulated Judgment. This revised SIP would also
8 define the process for how ECR areas would be regulated. The Parties "developed the terms of this

9 Stipulated Judgment with the intention that its provisions will be incorporated into the 2015 SIP
10 Order and are consistent with applicable provisions of federal, state and local law, including section
11 42316 of the California Health and Safety Code and all applicable provisions of the CAA regarding
12 attainment of the NAAQS and exceptional events." (Exhibit A at | 11.)

13 18. The 2014 Stipulated Judgment establishes the overarching framework for the City to
14 implement dust control measures on the Owens Lakebed for attaining the PMio NAAQS in the
15 OVPA and fulfilling its dust control responsibilities. That framework required LADWP to complete
16 "the Phase 9 and Phase 10 dust controls" by December 31, 2017. (Exhibit A at 2.A.)

17 19. The 2014 Stipulated Judgment also allows the District to order the City to implement
18  dust control measures on an additional 4.8 square miles, for a total of 53.4 square miles dust controls

19 on the Owens Lakebed. The District may only order dust controls as "Contingency Measures" up
20 to the additional 4.8 square miles if the District determines an uncontrolled area of the Owens

21 Lakebed "has caused or contributed to an exceedance of the NAAQS or State Standard." (Exhibit

22 A at 3.A.)

23 20. The 2014 Stipulated Judgment only authorizes the District to require the City to
24 implement the "BACM Control Measures set forth in Paragraph A.2" in those cases where an
25 Eligible Cultural Resource ("ECR") area, an area of heightened tribal cultural sensitivity, satisfies
26 the three prerequisites laid out in the 2016 SIP and District Rule 433, discussed below. The only
27 BACM PM10 control measures approved for use included the following measures: BACM Shallow
28 Flooding; Tillage with BACM (Shallow Food) Backup; Brine with BACM (Shallow Flood) Backup;
6
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR EQUITABLE ESTOPPEL, DECLARATORY
RELIEF, AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 BACM Managed Vegetation; BACM Gravel Blanket; all of which must comply with stringent
2 monitoring and performance standards to achieve 99% control efficiency. As a part of the 2014
3 Stipulated Judgment, the City also agreed not to challenge the Best Available Control Measures
4 ("BACM"') Contingency Measures included in the 2016 SIP.

5 21. Other than the enumerated dust control measures specifically identified in the 2014
6 Stipulated Judgment, the District does not have authority under the 2014 Stipulated Judgment to
7 require LADWP to complete any other dust control measures

8 (See Exhibit A.) or projects on the Owens Lakebed.

9 22.

10 The 2014 Stipulated Judgment at Paragraph 15 allows for the assessment of agreed-

11 upon stipulated penalties under certain enumerated circumstances. "This Paragraph 15 applies only
to the failure to meet dust control measure completion deadlines as set forth in Paragraphs 2.A, 3.E
12 and 8.C and does not apply to any other notice of violation or enforcement of laws by the District

13 or its APCO." (Exhibit A at 1 15.)

14

15 In Accordance with the 2014 Stipulated Judgment, the City Prepared and Certified

16 The Phase 9/10 Project EIR Which Concluded That ECRs Should be Avoided For Dust

Mitigation

17 23. Following the 2014 Stipulated Judgment, the parties began preparation of the new
18 SIP contemplated by the Stipulated Judgment. Under Paragraph 11 of the 2014 Stipulated
19 Judgment, the City was to act as the lead agency under CEQA and prepare an Environmental Impact
20 Report ("EIR") for the Phase 9/10 Project. The District intended "to act as a responsible agency

21 and use the City's Phase 9/10 CEQA/NEPA documents to act on the SIP revision. If the City's
22 CEQA/NEPA document is not adequate for the District's approval purposes, the District shall have
23 until December 31, 2016 to act on the SIP revision." Id.

24 24. The City prepared an EIR for the Phase 9/10 Project and issued a Notice of
25 Determination for that project on June 8, 2015. In certifying the EIR and approving the Phase 9/10
26 Project, the City specifically approved an alternative to the Phase 9/10 Project that would avoid the
27 implementation of any dust mitigation projects on ECR areas as a means of avoiding the significant
28 and unavoidable impacts to tribal cultural resources that the EIR identified would occur if dust
~
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR EQUITABLE ESTOPPEL, DECLARATORY
RELIEF, AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 mitigation projects were implemented in these areas.

2 25. On or about April 13, 2016, the District's Board of Directors approved District
3 Resolution No. 2016-03 adopting the 2016 SIP and District Rule 433. In Resolution No. 2016-03,

4 the District stated that it "served as the Responsible Agency to assist with, and to rely upon the EIR

5 in considering the adoption of the 2016 SIP Order, District Rule 433 and the 2016 SIP." Resolution
6 No. 2016-03 further states that "For areas containing cultural resources, the EIR concluded that
7 impacts of the project could not be mitigated to less than significant levels, and therefore selected

8 the alternative of avoidance of those areas as the environmentally superior alternative" and that the
9 District "concurs with those findings."

10 26. Similarly, in the Findings of Fact, attached to, and incorporated within Resolution
11 No. 2016-03, the District found that "Significant impacts were identified for cultural resources for

12 the originally proposed Project that could not be mitigated to less than significant levels.... Based

13 on the analysis presented in the City EIR and public comments received, the Avoidance Alternative
14 has been identified as the environmentally superior alternative. The Avoidance Alternative avoids
15 significant impacts to cultural resources."

16 27. Based on these findings of fact, the District's Board concluded in Resolution 2016-
17 03 that "with respect to the significant or potentially significant effects of the 2016 SIP Order,
18 District Rule 433 and the 2016 SIP, that changes or alterations have been required in, or incorporated
19 into the project which mitigate or avoid many of the significant environmental effects thereof as

20 identified in the EIR."

21 28. Construction within an eligible cultural resource site is in direct conflict with the City
22 EIR's Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program and Public Resources Code 5097, which were

23 both adopted under the 16th Lease Amendment of PRC 8079.9 with the California State Lands
24 Commission, and developed in conformance with Public Resources Code section 21081.6 and
25 CEQA Guidelines section 15097.

26 29. Between 2018 and 2019, the City, the Native American Heritage Commission, and
27 California State Lands Commission worked collaboratively to identify a legal path that allows the
28 City to proceed without violating the rules, lease terms, and laws put in place to protect eligible
8
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR EQUITABLE ESTOPPEL, DECLARATORY
RELIEF, AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 cultural resource sites. To date, the Native American Heritage Commission, and California State
2 Lands Commission have not identified a path forward that relieves LADWP of legal liability
3 associated with performing any work on an ECR.

4 The Ensuing 2016 SIP and District Rule 433 Also Affirmed Specific Procedures For

5 Dust Control Measures In ECRs, Which The District Also Has Not Followed

6 30. The 2016 SIP recognizes at its outset that its purpose is to provide a plan to (1) attain
7 the PMI10 NAAQS established by EPA pursuant to section 109 of the CAA, and (2) implement the
8 provisions of the 2014 Stipulated Judgment between the District and the City which provides for
9 the continued operation of existing dust control measures and for the implementation of additional
10 control measures in order to attain and maintain compliance with state and federal standards for

11 PM10.

12 31. The 2016 SIP established specific procedures for implementing dust control
13 measures in ECR Areas, such as Sibi Patsiata-wae-tü at issue in this case, where sacred cultural
14 artifacts have been discovered and need to be preserved and protected for maintaining the cultural
15 heritage of the Owens Valley Tribes. Those procedures require the District to designate those ECR
16 areas as "deferred" areas and prohibits the implementation of any dust control measures on the ECR

17 areas unless and until certain conditions are satisfied. For purposes of demonstrating attainment
18 with the PM1o NAAQS, these ECR areas will be assumed to have no emissions after dust controls
19 are implemented on the vast majority of the non-ECR areas. The District's own modeling
20 demonstrated that emissions from ECR areas would dissipate once adjacent dust controls have been

21 installed.

22 32. The District has no authority to remove this "deferred" classification and require dust
23 control measures on any ECR area pursuant to the 2016 SIP (including District Rule 433) unless the
24 District makes an affirmative determination that the ECR area is causing or contributing to an
25 exceedance of the PM10 standard after dust controls are implemented in the areas adjacent to the

26 ECR area.

27 33. The prerequisites for allowing dust controls in "deferred" ECR areas are expressly
28 and repeatedly stated by the District throughout the 2016 SIP. For example, the 2016 SIP states:
9
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR EQUITABLE ESTOPPEL, DECLARATORY
RELIEF, AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

p "As a result of the 2014 Stipulated Judgment, the City of Los Angeles will be required to implement BACM PM1o control measures on 3.62 square miles of the
2 Owens Lake bed by December 31, 2017 (Phase 9/10 areas; see Figure S-2), with the exception for areas identified as ECR areas. The District will monitor the Phase
3 9/10 ECR areas following the implementation of dust controls in adjacent areas. It is anticipated that emissions from the ECR areas will be reduced once dust control
4 measures are implemented in adjacent areas. In the same manner as the off-lake dust source areas were created as a result of sand migration from the lake bed, the ECR 5 areas will have less sand migration from the adjacent areas after dust controls are in place and it is expected that emissions will be reduced as dust is winnowed from the 6 loose sand deposits. This emissions decay has been monitored by the District in off- lake areas that are adjacent to lake bed dust control areas.
7
For attainment demonstration purposes, the Phase 9/10 ECR areas will be assumed
8 to have no emissions after dust controls are implemented in 2017. However, if any ECR area is determined to have caused or contributed to an exceedance of 9 the standard after dust controls are implemented in adjacent areas, it will be

10 ordered for dust control under the contingency measure provisions in the SIP."

11 (Emphasis added.)

12 34. The 2016 SIP restates at least five additional times that the District must follow the

13 same procedures before a dust control measures can be implemented in "deferred" ECR areas.

14 35. These same requirements also are codified in District Rule 433, which is included as

15 part of the 2016 SIP and establishes the requirements and procedures for requiring dust control
16 projects on the Owens Lakebed. The 2016 SIP expressly states that Rule 433 "is incorporated into

17 this 2016 SIP and constitutes an integral part thereof."

18 36. Paragraph B.4 of Rule 433 further states: "For the Phase 9/10 Project Area consisting

19 of 3.62 square miles the City shall select and install BACM PMio Control Measures by December

20 31, 2017, except for ECR Areas, where PM10 BACM selection and implementation dates will

21 be deferred as set forth in Paragraph C.3." (Emphasis added.)

22 37. Paragraph C.3 of Rule 433 states the District is authorized "to select and implement
23 BACM PM10 Control Measures" in the deferred ECR Areas only "if monitoring and/or modeling
24 I demonstrates BACM PM10 control measures are needed in an ECR Area(s) to attain or
25 maintain the PMio NAAQS."

26 38. The 2016 SIP and District Rule 433 only authorizes the District to require the City
27 to implement the "BACM Control Measures set forth in Paragraph A.2" in those cases where the
28 ECR area satisfies the three prerequisites laid out in the 2016 SIP and District Rule 433.
10
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR EQUITABLE ESTOPPEL, DECLARATORY
RELIEF, AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 Specifically, District Rule 433 requires that (1) the ECR area must be emissive (have windblown
2 dust) after the City has implemented the required dust controls (specifically the BACM measures
3 that achieve 99 percent PM10 control efficiency) on all areas adjacent to the ECR area on Owens

4 Lake, as required by the 2014 Stipulated Judgment; (2) the windblown dust from the ECR area must
5 be causing or contributing to a violation of the PM10 NAAQS in the OVPA; and (3) "monitoring
6 and modeling demonstrates BACM control measures" are needed in ECR areas to attain or maintain

7 the PM10 NAAQS.

8 39. District Governing Board Order 160413-01 (the "2016 Board Order") also

9 established specific rules for implementing additional dust control measures in 3.62 square miles
10 within the Phase 9/10 areas while also specifically excluding ECR areas from those control
11 requirements. The 2016 Board Order authorized the removal of 418 acres (including the 5-acre site

12 at issue here) from the 3.62 square miles within the Phase 9/10 areas and thereby indefinitely
13 "deferred" controls on this small portion of the Phase 9/10 areas. This is confirmed in the District's
14 January 2018 report on Owens Valley Planning Area Reasonable Further Progress (*2018 District
15 Progress Report").

16 The 2021 Board Order Expressly Stated That Tribal Concurrence is Still Needed

17 Before Implementation, Yet The District Ignored Even A Formal Objection By One of

18 The Five Tribes

19 40. Starting in 2018, the City took steps to voluntarily work with and support local Tribes

20 on a vegetation enhancement project on the Sibi Patsiata-wae-tü ECR area. The City provided

21 design services, conducted field meetings with tribal representatives, designed the vegetation
22 enhancement project, developed schedules, and scope of work, and procured all necessary materials.

23 The City, however, could only actually construct the vegetation enhancement project if the City
24 received assurances that the City would not be held liable for any impacts to the cultural resources,

25 and would be relieved of any violation of local, State and Federal laws and regulations which
26 currently protect eligible cultural resources. The City collaborated with the California State Lands
27 Commission, Native American Commission, and Tribal representatives to seek authorization to
28 enter and construct on cultural sites and possible relief from the legal liability associated with
11

RELIEF, AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 impacting a cultural site.

2 41. On June 9, 2021, the Owens Lake Dust Mitigation Program Patsiata Cultural
3 Resources Task Force (*Task Force") met to discuss updates, identify next steps, and engage in
4 informational discussions with LADWP Operators working on Owens Lake, as reflected in the
5 "Draft Summary." The Draft Summary further reflects that Phillip Kiddoo, the APCO for the
6 District, represented that this is a "Tribal-led project" and so he would "advise the District Board to
7 issue an order consistent with the Tribal recommendation." The Fort Independence Tribe was not
8 present at this meeting.

9 42. On July 1, 2021, the District Governing Board considered an "Order to Implement
10 Dust Control Mitigation in the Sibi Patsiata-wae-tü Cultural Resource Area at Owens Lake."
11 Excerpts from the District Governing Board packet for the July 1, 2021 District Governing Board
12 meeting (the "July 2021 Board Packet") are included and attached hereto as Exhibit B. Exhibit B
13 includes pages 370-378 of the July 2021 Board Packet. The related materials begin at page 370 of
14 Exhibit B.

15 43. The Staff Recommendation in advance of the District Governing Board's meeting

16 stated that:

17 "To move efforts forward to control PMio emissions from the deferred CRA, District

18 staff recommends the most appropriate action to protect air quality and cultural resources is for the Governing Board to accept the Amended Recommendation of the PTOC [Patsiata Tribal Oversight Committee] and order LADWP to implement dust
19 control mitigation in the Sibi Patsiata-wae-tü CRA at Owens Lake consistent with the recommendation. This action will reinforce the collaborative partnership of the
20 PCTRF subcommittee, initiate subsequent procedural requirements, and provide the

21 necessary legal structure for LADWP."

22 (Exhibit B.)
23 The report also noted that "LADWP raised concerns about liability to the landowner and stated they
24 would be unable to proceed with the plan." (Exhibit B at 371.)

25 44. The proposed Board action was to "order [the City] to implement dust control
26 mitigation in the Sibi Patsiata-wae-tü Cultural Resource Area at Owens Lake consistent with the
27 Draft Amended Tribal Recommendations for the Patsiata Cultural Resource Task Force. (Exhibit
28 B at 371.)
12
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR EQUITABLE ESTOPPEL, DECLARATORY RELIEF, AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

45. The "Patsiata Tribal Oversite Committee Amended Tribal Recommendations for the
2 Patsiata Cultural Resource Task Force" were attached as part of the July 2021 Board Packet and
3 certain portions were marked as "REDACTED" from the public version of the July 2021 Board
4 Packet. (Exhibit B at 371.)

5 46. The Draft Amended Tribal Recommendations for the Patsiata Cultural Resource

6 Task Force ("Task Force"), dated May 22, 2021, were initially presented to the Task Force on June

7 9, 2021.

8 47. The Draft Amended Tribal Recommendations for the Task Force requested that the
9 District Governing Board issue an order to the City to implement the [REDACTED] Vegetation
10 Enhancement Project. It noted that under the current dust-control orders, the City is not authorized

11 to conduct any work within Phase 9/10b areas. The Task Force requested that the District amend
12 the current dust control orders by issuing an order to the City directing the City to implement the
13 [REDACTED] Vegetation Enhancement Project. (Exhibit B at 372.)

14 48. The Task Force recommendations expressly provide: "This recommendation is
15 considered draft until the Tribal Councils of Lone Pine Paiute Shoshone Tribe, the Fort
16 Independence Tribe, the Timbisha Shoshone Tribe, the Big Pine Paiute Tribe of Owens Valley, and
17 the Bishop Paiute Tribe have concurred." (Exhibit B at 372.) (emphasis added).

18 49. A District Governing Board meeting was held on July 1, 2021. A true and correct
19 copy of the District Governing Board meeting minutes for July 1, 2021 is attached hereto as Exhibit
20 C. The discussion of the proposed Order to Implement Dust Control Mitigation in the Sibi Patsiata-

21 wae-tü Cultural Resource Area at Owens Lake was Agenda Item #6. (Exhibit C at 4.) The City

22 provided limited public comment on the proposed Order based on the information included in the
23 2021 Board Packet, but there was no hearing on the motion to approve the proposed Order. As
24 reflected in the meeting minutes, LADWP requested that the District Governing Board wait to
25 approve the proposed Order and allow Staff from the District and LADWP to get together to
26 construct something that will work for everyone and complies with the requirements for
27 implementing dust controls in ECR areas. LADWP also expressed concerns about the District's
28 authority to order a project that does not use BACM. (See Exhibit C at 4-5.) During the meeting,
13
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR EQUITABLE ESTOPPEL, DECLARATORY
RELIEF, AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 the District's APCO incorrectly indicated to the District Board that the District had obtained
2 concurrence from all five Owens Valley Tribes on the proposed vegetation enhancement project. In
3 reality, the District had only obtained concurrence from two of the five Tribes at that point.

4 50. During the July 1, 2021 District Governing Board meeting, the Board approved the
5 motion to order LADWP to implement dust control mitigation in the Sibi Patsiata-wae-tü Cultural
6 Resource Area at Owens Lake consistent with the Draft Amended Tribal Recommendations for the

7 Task Force. See Exhibit C at 5. A true and correct copy of the Order to Implement Dust Control
8 Mitigation in the Sibi Patsiata-wae-tü Cultural Resource Area at Owens Lake dated July 1, 2021

9 (the "2021 Board Order") is attached hereto as Exhibit D. The order did not include deadlines,
10 milestones, monitoring criteria, and performance standards.

11 51. The 2021 Board Order was transmitted to LADWP on July 2, 2021. (See Exhibit D

12 at 1.)

13 52. The 2021 Board Order seeks vegetation enhancement measures that were never
14 demonstrated or otherwise determined to be necessary for attaining the PM10 NAAQS in the OVPA.
15 Furthermore, the 2021 Board Order imposes vegetation enhancement measures that are not a

16 BACM. See Exhibit D. Neither the 2016 SIP nor the 2014 Stipulated Judgment give the District
17 authority to order LADWP to implement non-BACM dust mitigation. Furthermore, without
18 monitoring and/or modeling to demonstrate the specific ordered 5-acre ECR area caused or
19 contributed to a violation, there is no legal basis for the Board Order.

20 53. On August 20, 2021, LADWP General Manager Martin Adams submitted a letter to
21 the District's Air Pollution Control Officer, Phillip Kiddoo. In this letter, LADWP represents,

22 among other things:

23 "LADWP is institutionally committed to working with all Tribes in the Owens

24 Valley on solutions pertaining to Owens Lake and beyond. We, however, also have questions about whether the order for the "Vegetation Enhancement Project" utilizes Best Available Control Measures, meets certain control efficiencies, and is premised
25 on monitored and/or modeled exceedance of the CAA Standards as required by the

26 SIP Section 9.3, pages 85-86. The answer to those questions must be resolved before LADWP can legally begin any work or undertake any project."
27 (Emphasis added.)

28 54. On December 7, 2021, the District's Air Pollution Control Officer, Phillip Kiddoo,
14
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR EQUITABLE ESTOPPEL, DECLARATORY
RELIEF, AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- wrote an email to Nelson Mejia of LADWP stating that LADWP is required to implement dust
2 control mitigation in the Sibi Patsiata-wae-tü Cultural Resource Area at Owens Lake consistent with

3 the Draft Amended Tribal Recommendations (Recommendation) for the Task Force by the never-
4 before-seen and arbitrary deadline of December 21, 2021. No previous discussion with Tribal
5 members or any document included mention that the vegetation enhancement project would need to
6 be completed by the end of December. LADWP responded on December 8, 2021 that
7 "Unfortunately, outstanding issues remain unresolved. Primarily, when your Board approved the
8 recommended project it conditioned commencement upon the formal approval of the five tribes in
9 the Owens Valley . . . To date, LADWP has not received written confirmation on the concurrence
10 from all the Tribal Councils on the Amended Recommendation." The District incorrectly responded

11 on December 8, 2021 that "Great Basin has no authority over Tribal Recommendations. DWP may
12 have outstanding issues that need to be resolved but these are solely the responsibility of DWP."

13 55. On December 16, 2021, the District issued a Notice to Comply to the City seeking
14 to require "immediate compliance" with the 2021 Board Order. A true and correct copy
15 Notice to Comply is attached hereto as Exhibit E. The Notice to Comply states that: of the

16

17 "On December 7, 2021, the District provided notice to LADWP of the requirement to implement dust control mitigation in the Sibi Patsiata-wae-tü Cultural Resource

18 Area at Owens Lake consistent with the Patsiata Cultural Resource Task Force Draft Amended Tribal Recommendations (Recommendations), as required under District

19 Governing Board Order 210701-06. In the five months since the District Governing Board Order 210701-06 was issued, the District has no record of any LADWP

20 communication or efforts to move the required dust mitigation forward. If LADWP contests this absence of communication or efforts, please provide the District a list or records proving otherwise.'

21 (Exhibit E.)

22 56. The Notice to Comply directed the City to provide the District with a written
23 response on or before December 21, 2021, including outlining immediate corrective actions to be
24 taken. (Exhibit E.)

25 57. On January 7, 2022, the District issued the Notice of Violation to the City for its
26 alleged failure to comply with District Governing Board Order 210701-06 and to require immediate
27 compliance. A true and correct copy of the NOV is attached hereto as Exhibit F.

28 58. The Notice of Violation noted that the City responded to the December 2021 Notice
15
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR EQUITABLE ESTOPPEL, DECLARATORY
RELIEF, AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- to Comply but the response "fails to comply." It further noted:

2

3 "The District has considered and rejects LADWP's purported arguments for its failure to comply. As the District has repeatedly and unequivocally stated, the

4 LADWP's duty to comply with the law, including the District Orders and the Stipulated Judgment, is not voluntary. The District has ordered the LADWP to

5 implement control measures consistent with the Draft Tribal Recommendation and has not made its Order contingent upon final recommendations of a Tribal council.

6 The District does not and cannot delegate the LADWP's duty to comply with laws to protect public health and the environment, and the District's responsibility to

7 enforce those laws, to any third-party. Authority to require implementation of dust controls resides solely with the District.

8 In addition, LADWP's actions regarding this matter violate the letter and spirit of the

9 2014 Stipulated Judgment to: 1) prevent disputes between our agencies and 2) prevent dust control implementation delays. The District hereby provides notice to

10 LADWP that it is in violation of the Stipulated Judgment and subject to all remedies available to address that violation."

11 (Exhibit F.)

12 59. The Notice of Violation stated that the City must "provide the District with a written
13 outline of corrective actions as soon as possible" and that "the required control strategy shall be
14 implemented within 60 days by March 8, 2022." (Exhibit F.)

15 60. On March 1, 2022, the Fort Independence Indian Community of Paiutes (the "Fort
16 Independence Tribe") sent a letter to Phillip Kiddoo, Air Pollution Control Officer for the District.

17 61. The Fort Independence Tribe's March 1, 2022 letter states that the District
18 "Governing Board's decision to implement the [Task Force] draft recommendation without the
19 consensus of all Tribal Councils or authorized Governing body undermines the collaborative spirit
20 of [Task Force] recommendations since, at least in our case, our duly elected official

21 representatives of our sovereign nation and government were disregarded and the Tribe's
22 concerns, as a sovereign nation, were disenfranchised." (Emphasis added).

23 62. The Fort Independence Tribe noted that it "questions the legal authority of the
24 District Governing Board to implement [the July 2021 Board Order] requiring [the City] to
25 implement dust control mitigation in the Sibi Patsiata-wae-tü Cultural Resource Area at Owens Lake
26 consistent with the Draft Amended Tribal Recommendations" for the Task Force. (Emphasis
27 added). It further noted that "In attempting to right the wrongs of historical actions, let us not
28 continue to assume that all the Tribes around Owens Lake share the same history and share the same
16
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR EQUITABLE ESTOPPEL, DECLARATORY
RELIEF, AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 position." (Id.)

2 63. Finally, the Fort Independence Tribe wrote "we respectfully request that [the 2021
3 Board Order] is withdrawn until there is a Tribally sanctioned understanding implementing the

4 Vegetation Enhancement Project at Sibi Patsiata-wae-tü."

5 The Current Order To Pay Improperly Calculates Exponential Daily Penalties When

6 The Original Order Did Not Identify A Compliance Deadline

7 64. On March 3, 2022, the City wrote a letter to the District Governing Board about its

8 failure to comply with the terms of the 2014 Stipulated Judgment and 2016 SIP. In the March 3,

9 2022 letter, the City identified deficiencies with the July 2021 Board Order and reiterated the City's

10 support for a "Tribally-led project which applied non-BACM to an ECR area, despite the lack of
11 evidence that the areas were emissive."

12 65. Board Order 210701-06 does not require submittal of a plan, and does not include
13 any deadlines for completion. In addition, Orders for dust control from the District typically have
14 a three-year time from the date the order was issued. Any later request to complete the work by
15 December 21, 2021, or any date, is unequivocally unreasonable because the order itself did not
16 identify a compliance deadline.

17 66. On March 9, 2022, the District issued the Order to Pay to the City, for its "violations
18 and failure to comply with District Governing Board Order 210701-06 and District Notice of

19 Violation 1008." A true and correct copy of the Order to Pay is attached hereto as Exhibit G. In
20 issuing the Order to Pay, the District left the mistaken impression that the five Owens Valley Tribes

21 were able to reach consensus on the development and implementation of the vegetation
22 enhancement program in the Sibi Patsiata-wae-tü ECR area.

23 67. The Order to Pay recognizes that in the case of Sibi Patsiata-wae-tü, the ECR area is
24 just 0.49 square miles, a small fraction of the almost 50 square miles of lakebed on which LADWP

25 has implemented PM10 BACM achieving a control efficiency of 99 percent. (Exhibit G at 2.)

26 68. The Order to Pay alleges that the City "has a clear, straightforward legal duty to
27 comply with the law and court orders to protect human health and the environment, including the
28 Court Orders and the 2014 Stipulated Judgment." It also alleges that the "City's refusal and failure
17
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR EQUITABLE ESTOPPEL, DECLARATORY
RELIEF, AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 to comply with the law, the Order and the Stipulated Judgment are knowing and intentional
2 violations of the law," and that the City "is also in contempt of the Stipulated Judgment." (Exhibit

3 G at 1-2.)

4 69. The District claims that the Order to pay is the result of "the City's failure after its
5 repeated opportunities to comply with its legal requirements under District Board Order 210701-06
6 and the Stipulated Judgment by the December 21, 2021, deadline, including dust control mitigation
7 of vegetation enhancement in 5 acres of the Phase 7b and Phase 9/10b Sibi Patsiata-wae-tü Cultural

8 Resource Area (0.49 square miles) at Owens Lake." (Exhibit G at 2.)

9 70. The Order to Pay further states that as a result of the City's alleged failure to comply,
10 "the City is hereby ordered and required to pay daily stipulated penalties pursuant to the formula
11 provided in Paragraph 15.A. of the Stipulated Judgment." "Based on 77 days of non-compliance
12 for the period from December 21, 221 through NOV 1008 deadline of March 8, 2022, at a stipulated
13 payment rate of $5,545.77 per day, this order to pay is issued to the City in the current amount of
14 $426,024.29."

15 71. Further, "[u]nder paragraph 15.B. of the Stipulated Judgment, the City must pay this
16 amount to the District within 90 days of the issuance of this notice (i.e., by June 7, 2022). Exhibit

17 G at 2. These penalties, assessed through April 6, 2022, are $587,851.62.

18 72. Finally, in the Order to Pay, the District represents that "the City is hereby provided
19 with notice of the District's intention to commence formal legal enforcement action against the City
20 unless the City responds to the District in writing with its clear and unconditional commitment to
21 timely comply with the Order within 14 days" of the Order to Pay. (Exhibit G at 2.)

22 73. On March 16, 2022, the City sent a letter to the District Governing Board in support

23 of the proper development and implementation of a vegetation enhancement project in the Sibi
24 Patsiata-wae-tü area. The City sent the letter in support of the Fort Independence Tribe's March 1,
25 2022 proposal on how best to move forward with the District's proposed vegetation enhancement
26 project and in response to the District's Order to Pay. The City's letter explained that it is
27| "imperative that the District adhere to all applicable requirements and conditions imposed by law
28 for undertaking any dust mitigation measures in ECR areas." The letter further explained in detail
18
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR EQUITABLE ESTOPPEL, DECLARATORY
RELIEF, AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 how the District had not done so. Finally and nonetheless, the City confirmed that it "stands ready
2 to work with the District and the Tribes in developing a pilot project at Sibi Patsiata-wae-tü that

3 does not violate the 2016 SIP" but still empowers local tribes to tailor the appropriate vegetation in

4 a manner that preserves and protects the Tribes' cultural resources.

5 74. The City has fulfilled all of its obligations to construct and implement dust control

6 measures on almost 48.6 square miles of the Owens Lakebed as required under the 2014 Stipulated
7 Judgment and the 2016 SIP. The only areas for which dust control measures have not yet been

8 implemented are limited to few, very small ECR areas, such as Sibi Patsiata-wae-tü, for which the

9 District has not removed the designation as a "deferred" ECR area and which are not subject to dust

10 control measures.

11 75. To date, the District has not adopted or imposed BACM Contingency Measures for
12 any ECR area within the OVPA, including the Sibi Patsiata-wae-tü Cultural Resource Area. In
13 addition, since 2018, monitoring in this area has not shown that this area would cause an emission.

14 76. The City has spent in excess of $2.5 billion dollars over the past two decades to

15 control windblown dust from manmade sources in the OVPA based on PM10 BACM.

16 77. The City's efforts have had very beneficial impacts, including the reduction of
17 windblown dust from the Owens Lake playa by 99.4 percent and transformation of the Owens

18 Lakebed into a vital habitat for water birds. The City has been, and continues to be, a committed
19 partner in achieving CAA goals for protecting human health and the environment in the OVPA.
20 This commitment includes indefinitely maintaining the current emissions control infrastructure in

21 place in the OVPA and undertaking additional measures that may become necessary to ensure the
22 protection of human health and the environment in the OVPA under the CAA.

23 The City Filed A Motion to Enforce the 2014 Stipulated Judgment, And The Court

24 Agreed That The District's Fines are Impermissible And The District Does Not Have

25 "Unfettered Authority"

26 78. Unable to reach an agreement with the District regarding the 2021 Board Order and
27 subsequent Notice to Comply, Notice of Violation, and Order to Pay, the City was compelled to file
28 a motion to enforce the 2014 Stipulated Judgment in the Previous Action.
19
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR EQUITABLE ESTOPPEL, DECLARATORY
RELIEF, AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

79. After receiving extensive briefing and oral arguments on the motion to enforce, the
2 Sacramento County Superior Court, the Honorable Shelleyanne W. L. Chang, presiding, issued a
3 decision on September 27, 2022. A true and correct copy of that decision is attached hereto as

4 Exhibit H.

5 80. In her decision, Judge Chang noted that:

6 "The District also acknowledged at the hearing on this matter that its position is that

7 the City would be unable to challenge any order issued concerning the Sibi Patsiata- wae-tü area, as the City has waived all such rights by signing the 2014 Stipulated Order. The Court has significant concerns about this position, as it would be contrary
8 to the public interest for a Court to determine a regulating body has unfettered authority to order a public agency to take action in a certain geographic area because 9 the public agency has ostensibly waived all rights to argue such an order is illegal."
10 (Id. at fn 4 (emphasis original).)

11 81. Judge Chang ultimately concluded that "there was no mutual agreement" between
12 the City and the District in the 2014 Stipulated Judgment "as to how a Phase 9/10 area deferred"
13 from dust control measures pursuant to the 2014 Stipulated Judgment "was to be treated once
14 deferral is no longer necessary and the area is ready to be ordered for dust control measures" and
15 that, as such, "the Court cannot enforce the mutual intent of the parties through this Motion when
16 there appears to be none." (Id. at 10.)

17 82. Judge Chang further found "that the 2014 Stipulated Judgment is unenforceable as

18 to the Sibi Patsiata-wae-tü area" and that:

19 The Court further finds that it need not address the City's arguments concerning the Order to Pay. The Order to Pay stems from the 2021 Order, which was issued 20 pursuant to the District's purported authority under the 2014 Stipulated
21 Judgment to order dust control measures in the Sibi Patsiata-wae-tü area. The Court has found unenforceable the 2014 Stipulated Judgment as it applies to the Sibi

22 Patsiata-wae-tü area given its status as an area that was deferred pursuant to Paragraph 2.B. Because the Order to Pay relies on the District's ability to seek

23 stipulated penalties for violations of the 2014 Stipulated Judgment, the Order to Pay is now unenforceable. The Court issues no opinion as to whether the City

24 may be subject to civil penalties pursuant to the Health and Safety Code for failing to comply with a valid order. Such a determination would exceed the limited scope
of the present motion.
25

26 (Id. at 11.) (Emphasis added).

27 83. The District served a notice of the Sacramento County Superior Court's ruling on
28| September 28, 2022.

2 The District Made An About-Face and Improperly Flipped on the Legal Authority and
Original Basis for the 2021 Board Order

3 84.

4 One week later, on October 5, 2022, the District sent the City a letter misrepresenting
the Sacramento County Superior Court's ruling and, even more inexplicably, rewriting the authority
5 for the 2021 Order and Notice of Violation from being based on the 2014 Stipulated Judgment to

6

7 being based on section 42316. A true and correct copy of the District's October 5, 2022 letter is
attached hereto as Exhibit I. Specifically, the District stated that it "withdraws its Order to Pay
8 stipulated penalties under the Stipulated Judgement, and instead assesses civil penalties against the

9

10 City under the Health & Safety Code." Neither the 2021 Board Order nor the Notice of Violation
even mention Health and Safety Code section 42316. To be clear, the District did not reissue the
11 2021 Order pursuant to section 42316. Rather, the District cited the same 2021 Order (which the
12 District issued pursuant to the 2014 Stipulated Judgment and which was found to be invalid by Judge
13 Chang) and simply asserted that it was issued pursuant to section 42316. The District cannot change
14 history or rewrite its legal authority for a previously issued order, particularly after the Sacramento
15 Superior Court found that order to be invalid. As Judge Chang recognized, if the District wants to
16 issue a new order pursuant to section 42316, it can do so, and the City will make its legal objections

17 to that new order in the proper proceeding. What the District cannot do, however, is rely on its prior
18 order based on its unsupported assertion that the 2021 Order was actually issued pursuant to section
19 42316 when it clearly was not. it

20 85.

21 The October 5, 2022 letter does not provide the City with an opportunity to be heard
on the District's purported conversion of its previous order under the 2014 Stipulated Judgment to
22 an order under section 42316. The District simply demands the payment of fines and compliance

23 with the apparently revised order and threatens the City with further fines and litigation should the
24 City object.

25 86. Following the City's receipt of the October 5, 2022 letter, the City attempted to meet
26 and confer with the District regarding its order and demands. The City asked that the District rescind
27 its unlawful orders and demands and that the parties discuss how to move forward. However, the
28 District refused the City's requests and indicated that the parties were at an impasse.

12 90. The City is unaware of the true names and identities of DOES 1-100 and sues such
13 unnamed Respondents and Defendants by their fictitious names. The City is informed and believes,
14 and thereon alleges, that the fictitiously named Respondents and Defendants are responsible for all
15 acts and omissions described herein. When the true identities and capacities of DOES 1-100 have
16 been determined, the City will, with leave of Court if necessary, amend this Petition and Complaint
17 to include such identities and capacities.

18 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

19 91. This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged herein pursuant to Code of Civil

20 Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5 and Public Resources Code sections 21168 and 21168.5.

21 92. Venue is proper in this Court because the District is enforcing the 2021 Order against
22 the City and the City resides in Los Angeles County. In addition, the City's ratepayers, who will be
23 responsible for paying the District's fines should the Court not overturn the District's
24 decision/action, reside in Los Angeles County.

25 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES AND INADEQUACY OF REMEDY

26 93. The City has performed any and all conditions precedent to filing the instant action
27 and has exhausted, or is excused from exhausting, all available administrative remedies to the extent
28 provided by law.
22
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR EQUITABLE ESTOPPEL, DECLARATORY
RELIEF, AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

94. The District performed no CEQA review and provided no administrative process of
2 any kind prior to its decision/action to convert the 2021 Order from an order issued under the 2014
3 Stipulated Judgment to an order issued under section 42316; thus, the City was unable to participate

4 in such a process. The requirement to exhaust administrative remedies is inapplicable where there
5 was no public hearing or other opportunity to be heard and to raise objections before the approval

6 of the District's decision/action. In addition, the District presented the October 5, 2022 letter as a
7 final decision. Any attempt by the City to exhaust administrative remedies after receiving the

8 October 5, 2022 letter would have been futile.

9 95. The City has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section
10 21167.5 by mailing written notice of this action to the District and also by electronic mail to counsel

11 of record for the District. A copy of this written notice and proof of service are attached hereto as

12 Exhibit J.

13 96. The City has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law
14 unless this Court grants the relief requested herein. In the absence of such remedies, the District's
15 unlawful attempt to convert the 2021 Order from an order issued under the 2014 Stipulated
16 Judgment to an order issued under section 42316 and to impose violations for the alleged violation
17 of this newly created order will remain unchecked, resulting in significant harm to the City and the
18 City's ratepayers.

19 97. As required by Public Resources Code section 21167(a), this action has been brought
20 within 180 days of the District's decision/action on October 5, 2022 to convert the 2021 Order from

21 an order issued under the 2014 Stipulated Judgment to an order issued under section 42316.

22 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

23 (Writ of Mandate Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1085)

24 (Collateral Estoppel)

25 98. The City incorporates Paragraphs 1 - 97 as if fully set forth herein.

26 99. "Collateral estoppel, or issue preclusion, 'precludes relitigation of issues argued and
27 decided in prior proceedings.""1 (Zevnik v. Superior Ct. (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 76, 82.) Collateral
28 estoppel precludes the re-litigation of an issue if "(1) the issue is identical to an issue decided in a
23
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR EQUITABLE ESTOPPEL, DECLARATORY
RELIEF, AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- prior proceeding; (2) the issue was actually litigated; (3) the issue was necessarily decided; (4) the
2 decision in the prior proceeding is final and on the merits; and (5) the party against whom collateral

3

4 estoppel is asserted was a party to the prior proceeding or in privity with a party to the prior
proceeding." (Id.)

5 100. Here, the District is collaterally estopped from arguing that the 2021 Board Order is

6 valid under section 42316.

7 101. Regarding the first and second elements of collateral estoppel, in the Previous
8 Action, the parties actually litigated the issue of whether the 2021 Board Order was a valid order

9 under the 2014 Stipulated Judgment.

10 102. Under the third and fourth elements, the Sacramento County Superior Court decided
11 that the 2021 Board Order was issued under the 2014 Stipulated Judgment and that the 2021 Board

12 Order was invalid. The Sacramento County Superior Court further found that the District might be
13 able to issue an order similar to the 2021 Board Order pursuant to section 42316, but that the 2021

14 Board Order was not such a valid order.

15 103.

16 104. Finally, there is no dispute that the District was a party to a the Previous Action.
As such, the Court should find that the District is collaterally estopped from now
17 claiming that the 2021 Board Order is a valid order issued pursuant to section 42316.

18 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

19 (Order Facially Invalid)

20 105. The City incorporates Paragraphs 1

21 106. 104 as if fully set forth herein.
The 2021 Board Order, issued on July 1, 2021, does not state that it was issued
22 pursuant to section 42316. Instead, the District relied on the 2014 Stipulated Judgment as the

23 authority to issue the 2021 Board Order.

24 107. The District's October 5, 2022 letter, issued well over a year after the 2021 Board
25 Order, purports to convert the authority for the 2021 Board Order to section 42316.

26 108. Any attempt by the District now to convert the 2021 Board Order to an order issued
27 pursuant to section 42316 is facially invalid because the District Board did not authorize the 2021
28 Board Order pursuant to section 42316.
24
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR EQUITABLE ESTOPPEL, DECLARATORY
RELIEF, AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

109. As such, a writ of mandate should issue finding that the attempt by the District in the
2 October 5, 2022 letter to convert the authority of the 2021 Board Order from the 2014 Stipulated
3 Judgment to section 42316 is facially invalid and void, and commanding the District to rescind the

4 attempted conversion of the 2021 Board Order.

5 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

6 (Writ of Mandate Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1085)

7 (Invalid Order Due to Lack of Notice)

8 110. The City incorporates Paragraphs 1 - 109 as if fully set forth herein.

9 111. On its face, the 2021 Board Order was issued pursuant to the 2014 Stipulated
10 Judgment. The 2021 Board Order does not state or provide notice that the District was issuing the

11 Order under section 42316.

12 112. The subsequent Notice to Comply, Notice of Violation, and Order to Pay also do not
13 provide notice that the District's 2021 Board Order was issued pursuant to section 42316.

14 113. To the contrary, the District asserted throughout the litigation concerning the City's
15 motion to enforce the 2014 Stipulated Judgment that the 2021 Order was issued pursuant to the 2014
16 Stipulated Judgment.

17 114. The first notice the City had that the District had purported to convert the 2021 Board

18 Order from one issued under the 2014 Stipulated Judgment to one issued under section 42316 was
19 the District's October 5, 2022 letter, which indicated that the purported conversion had already taken
20 place.

21 115. The District cannot convert its previous order issued under the 2014 Stipulated
22 Judgment to an order under section 42316 without first providing notice to the City.

23 116. The District's conversion of the 2021 Board Order from an order issued pursuant
24 under the 2014 Stipulated Judgment to and order issued pursuant to section 42316 is invalid for lack
25 of notice to the City.

26 117. The Court should issue a writ of mandate commanding the District to rescind the
27 converted Order and provide the City with appropriate notice before issuing any new order.

H FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

2

3 (Writ of Mandate Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1085)
(Invalid Order Due to Lack of Hearing)

4 118. The City incorporates Paragraphs 1 - 117 as if fully set forth herein.

5 119. The District did not provide the City with a hearing before converting the 2021 Board
6 Order from one issued under the 2014 Stipulated Judgment to one issued under section 42316. The
7 first time the City was informed about the conversion was the District's October 5, 2022 letter,
8 which indicated that the conversion had already taken place.

9 120. The District cannot convert its previous order issued under the 2014 Stipulated
10 Judgment to an order under section 42316 without first providing the City with a hearing.

11 121. The District's conversion of the 2021 Board Order from an order issued pursuant

12 under the 2014 Stipulated Judgment to an order issued pursuant to section 42316 is invalid for failure
13| to provide the City with a hearing.

14 122. The Court should issue a writ of mandate commanding the District to rescind the
15 converted Order and provide the City with an appropriate hearing before issuing any new order.

16 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

17

18 (Writ of Mandate Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1085)

(Ultra Vires)

19 123. The City incorporates Paragraphs

20 122 as if fully set forth herein.

124. The District's Board did not authorize the APCO to convert the 2021 Board Order

21 issued under the 2014 Stipulated Judgment to an order under section 42316.

22 125. The APCO had no authority to convert the 2021 Board Order from an order to
23 implement the 2014 Settlement Agreement to an order under section 42316.

24 126. As such, the APCO's action to convert the 2021 Board Order from an order to
25 implement the 2014 Settlement Agreement to an enforcement order under section 42316, was in

26 excess of the APCO's authority, is ultra vires, and is therefore void.

27 127. The Court should issue a writ of mandate commanding the APCO to rescind any
28 action to convert the 2021 Board Order from an order to implement the 2014 Settlement Agreement
26
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR EQUITABLE ESTOPPEL, DECLARATORY
RELIEF, AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- to an enforcement order under section 42316 because such action was in excess of the APCO's
2 authority, is ultra vires, and is therefore void.

5 or, alternatively Writ of Administrative Mandamus pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5)

6

7 128. (Failure to Comply with the 2016 SIP and District Rule 433)
The City incorporates Paragraphs 1

8 127 as if fully set forth herein.

129. The 2016 SIP and District Rule 433 require the District to follow certain procedures
9 and make certain findings prior to reordering a "deferred" ECR area for air quality controls.

10 130. Specifically, the District must first find that the ECR area is emissive (have
11 windblown dust) after the City has implemented the required dust controls (specifically the BACM

12 measures that achieve 99 percent PM10 control efficiency) on all areas adjacent to the ECR area on
13 Owens Lake. Second, the District must find that the windblown dust from the ECR area must be
14 causing or contributing to a violation of the PM10 NAAQS in the OVPA. Third, the District must

15 find that "monitoring and modeling demonstrates BACM control measures" are needed in ECR
16 areas to attain or maintain the PM1o NAAQS.

17 131.

18 The District made none of these findings in converting the 2021 Board Order from

19 an order under the 2014 Stipulated Judgment to an order under section 42316.

132. The 2016 SIP and District Rule 433 only allow the District to order implementation
20 of specified BACM on ECR areas.

21 133.

22 The 2021 Board Order, as converted by the District on October 5, 2022, required the
City to implement non-BACM on the Sibi Patsiata-wae-tü ECR area.

23 134.

24 and Rule 433. The District cannot issue, convert, or enforce an order that violates its own 2016 SIP

25 135. This Court should issue a writ of mandate commanding the District to rescind its
26 decision/action to convert the 2021 Board Order from one issued under the 2014 Stipulated
27 Judgment to an order issued under section 42316 because of the decision/action's noncompliance
28 with the 2016 SIP and District Rule 433.

H SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (Writ of Mandate pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1085

3 or, alternatively Writ of Administrative Mandamus pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5)

4 (Failure to Obtain Concurrence from all of the Owens Lake Tribes)

5 136. The City incorporates Paragraphs: - 135 as if fully set forth herein.

6 137. The 2021 Board Order, by its own terms, required concurrence of all five Owens
7 Lake Valley Tribes in the proposed measures to be implemented on the Sibi Patsiata-wae-tü ECR

8 area before the 2021 Board Order would become effective.

9 138. The District has not obtained concurrence of all five Owens Lake Valley Tribes in
10 the proposed measures to be implemented on the Sibi Patsiata-wae-tü ECR area.

11 139. In fact, the Fort Independence Tribe has specifically rejected the proposed measures
12 to be implemented on the Sibi Patsiata-wae-tü ECR area.

13 140. Nevertheless, in converting the 2021 Board Order from one issued under the 2014
14 Stipulated Judgment to an order issued under section 42316, the District seeks to enforce penalties
15 against the City for failure to comply with a 2021 Board Order that, by its own terms, is not effective.

16 141. The Court should issue a writ of mandate prohibiting the District from enforcing the
17 2021 Board Order or assessing any penalties against the City until such time as the District obtains

18 concurrence from all five Tribes.

19 EIGHTH CAUSE OF ACTION

20

21 (Writ of Mandate, or in the alternative, Writ of Administrative Mandamus under Public Resources Code section 21168 and 21168.5)

22 (Failure of the District to Comply With CEQA)

23 142. The City incorporates Paragraphs

24 141 as if fully set forth herein.

143. As set forth above, the District, acting as a responsible agency adopted the findings
25 of fact and conclusions of the City's EIR for the Phase 9/10 project and relied on these findings in
26 approving the 2016 SIP and District Rule 433.

27 144. Among these findings was that the adoption of the Avoidance Alternative, which
28 would avoid any dust mitigation project on ECR areas, would avoid the significant and unavoidable
28
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR EQUITABLE ESTOPPEL, DECLARATORY
RELIEF, AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 impacts to tribal cultural resources that would occur should the District require dust mitigation
2 projects on ECR areas.

3 145. Public Resources Code section 21166 and Code of Regulations, Title 14, section
4 151622 require the District to perform an analysis of whether subsequent environmental review is
5 required for a project after an EIR has been certified. Among the several reasons necessitating
6 performance of subsequent environmental review is when "Substantial changes are proposed in the

7 project which will require major revisions to the previous EIR due to the involvement of new

8 significant environmental impacts or a substantial increase in the severity of environmental

9 impacts." (CEQA Guidelines, § 15162(a)(1).)

10 146. On October 5, 2022, the District took a new action to convert the 2021 Board Order
11 from one under the 2014 Stipulated Judgment to an order under section 42316. The result of this
12 action is an order requiring the City to construct dust mitigation on ECR areas that the 2016 SIP and
13 Rule 433 required to be avoided in order to avoid significant and unavoidable impacts to tribal
a 14 cultural resources is a "substantial change" to the District's approval of the 2016 SIP and Rule 433

15 that will result in a "substantial increase in the severity" of the impacts to tribal cultural resources.
16 Specifically, with the new action on October 5, 2022, the 2016 SIP and Rule 433 will move from

17 an avoidance of impacts to tribal cultural resources to the significant and unavoidable impacts
18 disclosed in the EIR adopted by the District.

19 147. The District performed no analysis of the environmental impacts of the October 5,
20 2022 decision/action to convert the 2021 Board Order to one under the 2014 Stipulated Judgment

21 to an order under section 42316.

22 148. The District's lack of any environmental analysis a was a violation of CEQA.

23 149. The District did not provide any notice or public review period for any analysis of
24 the environmental impacts of the October 5, 2022 decision/action to convert the 2021 Board Order
25 to one under the 2014 Stipulated Judgment to an order under section 42316.

29
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR EQUITABLE ESTOPPEL, DECLARATORY

150. The District's failure to provide any notice or public review period for any analysis

2 of the environmental impacts of the October 5, 2022 decision/action to convert the 2021 Board

3 Order to one under the 2014 Stipulated Judgment to an order under section 42316 was a violation

4 of CEQA.

5 151. The District did not adopt any findings concerning the District's CEQA compliance
6 before making the decision/taking the action on October 5, 2022 to convert the 2021 Board Order
7 to one under the 2014 Stipulated Judgment to an order under section 42316.

8 152. The District's failure to adopt any findings concerning the District's CEQA

9 compliance before making the decision/taking the action on October 5, 2022 to convert the 2021
10 Board Order to one under the 2014 Stipulated Judgment to an order under section 42316 was a

11 violation of CEQA.

12 153. To the extent the District argues that its October 5, 2022 decision/action to convert

13 the 2021 Board Order to one under the 2014 Stipulated Judgment to an order under section 42316
14 was categorically exempt from CEQA, the exceptions to the categorical exemptions apply. (CEQA
15 Guidelines, § 15300.2.) Specifically, CEQA Guidelines section 15300.2, subdivision (c) prohibits
16 reliance on a categorical exemption "where there iS a reasonable possibility that the activity will
17 have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances." Here, the October 5,
18 2022 decision/action to convert the 2021 Board Order to one under the 2014 Stipulated Judgment

19 to an order under section 42316 will have a significant effect on the environment due to the unusual

20 circumstances that the ECR areas, and specifically the Sibi Patsiata-wae-tü ECR area, contain
21 significant tribal cultural resources that will be impacted by the District's decision/action.

22 154. The District violated its duty to comply with CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines prior

23 to making the decision/taking the action on October 5, 2022 to convert the 2021 Board Order to one
24 under the 2014 Stipulated Judgment to an order under section 42316. As such, this decision/action

25 is contrary to law and constitutes a prejudicial abuse a of discretion. Accordingly, the District's

26 decision/action must be vacated and set aside.

3 (Equitable Estoppel)

155.

4 156. The City incorporates Paragraphs 1 - 154 as if fully set forth herein.
The District was apprised of the fact that the District, at all times prior to October 5,
5 2022, treated the 2021 Board Order as one issued under the 2014 Stipulated Judgment. The District
6 previously sought penalties against the City under the 2014 Stipulated Judgment for the City's

7 alleged violation of the 2021 Board Order. Moreover, during the briefing and hearing on the City's
8 motion to enforce the 2014 Stipulated Judgment before the Sacramento County Superior Court, the
9 District vociferously argued that the District had authority to issue the 2021 Board Order and to
10 assess stipulated penalties for the City's alleged violation of the 2021 Board Order under the 2014
11 Stipulated Judgment.

12 157. The District intended that its conduct asserting that the 2021 Board Order was issued
13 under the 2014 Stipulated Judgment, and not under section 42316, would be acted upon by the City.
14 Alternatively, the City had the right to believe the District intended to issue the 2021 Board Order
15 and seek penalties against the City for alleged violation of the 2021 Board Order under the 2014
16 Stipulated Judgment and not under section 42316.

17 158. The City was ignorant of the fact that the District intended to assert that the 2021

18 Board Order was issued under section 42316 and not under the 2014 Stipulated Judgment until

19 receipt of the October 5, 2022 letter from the District.

20 159. The City relied on the District's conduct to the City's injury. Specifically, the City
21 did not challenge the 2021 Board Order under section 42316 at the time the District issued the 2021

22 Board Order.

23 160. Accordingly, the District is equitably estopped from asserting that the 2021 Board
24 Order was, at the time the District adopted the 2021 Board Order, an order issued under section

25 42316.

162. Present controversy exists between the City and the District concerning the District's
2 ability to convert the 2021 Board Order from an order issued under the 2014 Stipulated Judgment

3 to one issued under section 42316, and to do So without notice to the City or for the opportunity for

4 the City to be heard, and regarding the District's ability to assess penalties against the City for the
5 City's alleged noncompliance with the 2021 Board Order.

6 163. Further controversy exists between the City and the District concerning whether the
7 District complied with the 2016 SIP, Rule 433, and CEQA before converting the 2021 Board Order

8 from an order issued under the 2014 Stipulated Judgment to one issued under section 42316.

9 164. Further controversy exists between the City and the District concerning whether the
10 2021 Board Order is effective without the concurrence of all five Owens Valley Tribes.

11 165. The City believes that the District had no ability to convert the 2021 Board Order

12 from an order issued under the 2014 Stipulated Judgment to one issued under section 42316, that
13 the District must provide the City with notice and opportunity to be heard prior to approving any
14 such conversion, and that the District has no ability to assess penalties against the City for the City's
15 alleged noncompliance with the 2021 Board Order under section 42316. Furthermore, the City
16 believes that the District must comply with the 2016 SIP, Rule 433, and CEQA before converting

17 the 2021 Board Order from an order issued under the 2014 Stipulated Judgment to one issued under
18 section 42316. In addition, the City believes that the 2021 Board Order is ineffective by its own
19 terms unless and until the District obtains concurrence from all five Owens Valley Tribes.

20 166. The City is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges that the District believes

21 it has the ability to convert the 2021 Board Order from an order issued under the 2014 Stipulated
22 Judgment to one issued under section 42316, that the District does not need to provide the City with
23 notice and opportunity to be heard prior to approving any such conversion, and that the District has

24 the ability to assess penalties against the City for the City's alleged noncompliance with the 2021
25 Board Order under section 42316. Furthermore, the District believes that it does not need to comply
26 with the 2016 SIP, Rule 433, and CEQA before converting the 2021 Board Order from an order
27 issued under the 2014 Stipulated Judgment to one issued under section 42316. In addition, the
28 District believes that the 2021 Board Order is effective without concurrence from all five Owens

1 Valley Tribes.

2 167. Actual and justiciable controversies exist between the City, on one side, and the
3 District, on the other. The City has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary
4 law unless this Court makes the requested declarations that: (a) the District had no ability to convert
5 the 2021 Board Order from an order issued under the 2014 Stipulated Judgment to one issued under
6 section 42316; (b) that the District must provide the City with notice and opportunity to be heard

7 prior to approving any such conversion; (c) that the District has no ability to assess penalties against
8 the City for the City's alleged noncompliance with the 2021 Board Order under section 42316; (d)

9 that the District must comply with the 2016 SIP, Rule 433, and CEQA before converting the 2021
10 Board Order from an order issued under the 2014 Stipulated Judgment to one issued under section

16 169. For the reasons stated herein, the City a will seek a temporary restraining order, and
17 preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to prohibit the District from enforcing the 2021 Board
18 Order, as converted by the District on October 5, 2022, and from assessing any penalties for the

19 City's alleged violation of the 2021 Board Order.

20 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

STIPULATED JUDGMENT FOR RESPONDENT AND DEFENDANT
GREAT BASIN UNIFIED AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT

1 Petitioner and Plaintiff CITY OF LOS ANGELES, a California Municipal Corporation,

2 ACTING BY AND THROUGH ITS DEPARTMENT OF WATER AND POWER ("Petitioner"

3 or "City") and Respondent and Defendant GREAT BASIN UNIFIED AIR POLLUTION

4 CONTROL DISTRICT ("District") (collectively "Partics"), having agreed and consented to the

5 entry of this stipulated judgment for the Respondents and Defendants (*Stipulated Judgment")

6 containing the terms specified below, and the Court having been presented with the Stipulated

7

8 Judgment and reviewed its terms, the Court hercby approves the Stipulated Judgment and these
terms, and issues the following orders:
1o RECITALS BY THE PARTIES

10 A.

11 The District is a unified air pollution control district as provided by Division 26,

12 Part 3, Chapter : of the California Health and Safety Code and consists of all of Inyo, Mono and
Alpine counties.

13 B.

14 The City is a charter city in the State of California, and its Department of Water

15 and Power ("LADWP") is a proprietary department of the City. The LADWP is responsible for

16 providing water and power to the residents of Los Angeles. Its duties include operating the Los

17 Angeles Aqueduct, which transports water from the Eastern Sierra region to Southern California.

C.

18 The dispute between the parties concerns the control of air pollution from Owens

19 Lake. Owens Lake is located in Inyo County in eastern California, south of the town of Lone
Pine and north of the town of Olancha.

20 D.

21 Large portions of the Owens Lake bed are comprised primarily of dry saline soils

22 and crusts. The City's water diversions from the Owens Valley, including by the use of the Los
Angeles Aqueduct, has exposed lake bed areas.

23 E.

24 The lake bed soils and crusts are a source of wind-borne dust during significant

25 wind events, and contribute to elevated concentrations of particulate matter less than 10 microns
in diameter ("PM10").

26 F.

27 PM10 is a criteria pollutant regulated by the federal Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C.
Section 7401 et seq., as amended ("CAA").

28

la-1255083
STIPULATED JUDGMENT FOR RESPONDENT AND DEFENDANT
GREAT BASIN UNIFIED AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT

G. Under the National Ambient Air Quality Standard ("NAAQS") adopted pursuant

2 to the CAA, PM10 levels may not exceed an average concentration of 150 micrograms per cubic
meter ("ug/m') during a 24-hour period more than one time per calendar year averaged over

4 three years.

H. The CAA further requires the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") to

6 divide each state into air quality control regions. Each region is characterized as either

7 "attainment" or "non-attainment" for each identified air pollutant, depending on whether the

8 monitored level of that air pollutant in that region is at or below (attainment) or above (non-

9 attainment) the level mandated by the NAAQS.

10 I. Once the EPA establishes the NAAQS, the states have the primary responsibility

11 to prepare a State Implementation Plan ("SIP") for achieving and maintaining the NAAQS within

12 each air quality control region within the state. The SIP must establish "enforceable emission

13 limitations and other control measures" designed to, among other things, achieve attainment in

14 non-attainment regions within the state.

15 J. The California Legislature delegated responsibility and authority to meet the

16 CAA's SIP requirements to Respondent CARB and authorized CARB to implement this

17 requirement through the creation of thirty-five (35) air pollution control districts.

18 K. On August 7, 1987, the EPA designated the Owens Valley Planning Area

19 ("OVPA") as one of the regions in California in violation of the PM10 NAAQS. The EPA

20 designated the OVPA as a "serious nonattainment area" for PM10.

21 L. In addition to the federal NAAQS, the State of California has adopted a PM10

22 standard ("State Standard"). The State Standard is violated when monitors record PM10

23 concentrations greater than 50 ug/m' averaged over a 24-hour period.

24 M. The District has regulatory authority over air quality issues in the OVPA where

25 Owens Lake is situated.

26 N. Health and Safety Code Section 42316 ("Section 42316"), enacted by the

27 California Legislature in 1983, provides in part that the District has authority to require the City

28 to undertake reasonable measures at Owens Lake in order to address the impacts of its activities
la-1255083 2
STIPULATED JUDGMENT FOR RESPONDENT AND DEFENDANT
GREAT BASIN UNIFIED AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT

1 that cause or contribute to violations of federal and state air quality standards, including but not

2 limited to the NAAQS and State Standard for PM10.

3 O. In November 1998, the District submitted to EPA its 1998 SIP. In September

4 1999, the EPA approved the 1998 SIP. The District and the City agreed to the provisions in the

5 1998 SIP and requested EPA to extend the attainment deadline for the OVPA. In September

6 1999, the EPA approved the 1998 SIP and extended the attainment deadline by five years, from
December 31, 2001 to December 31, 2006.

P. The 1998 SIP provides three allowable mitigation control measures that are

9 approved as Best Available Control Measures ("BACM") that the City may select for use at the

10 dried Owens Lake bed: (1) shallow flooding; (2) managed vegetation; or (3) gravel cover.

11 Q. Under the CAA at 42 U.S.C. § 7513(e), for areas receiving extensions of the

12 original attainment date, the SIP shall provide for implementation of "the most stringent measures

13 that are included in the implementation plan of any State or are achieved in practice in any State,

14 and can feasibly be implemented in the [nonattainment] arca."

15 R. In 2003, the District revised the 1998 SIP and submitted the 2003 SIP to EPA for

16 approval. The 2003 SIP requires most stringent measures (*MSM") BACM controls. EPA has

17 not taken action on the 2003 SIP.

18 S. In 2005, the City disputed orders issued by the District under Section 42316 for

19 additional air pollution controls at the dried Owens Lake bed. To resolve this dispute, the City

20 and the District entered into a settlement agreement. Pursuant to that agreement, the District

21 agreed to submit revisions to the 2003 SIP. For this purpose, in 2008, the District adopted Board

22 Order No. 080128-01 and submitted the order as the 2008 SIP ("2008 SIP Order"). CARB

23 approved the 2008 SIP Order and submitted it to the EPA for approval, which is pending before

24 EPA. The 2008 SIP also requires MSM BACM controls.

25 T. On or about August 1, 2011, the District issued the 2011 SCRD which ordered the

26 City to install additional dust control measures on approximately 2.86 square miles of the dried

27 Owens Lake bed to meet the NAAQS for PM10. These are known as 9 the Phase 9 dust control

28 arcas.

la-1255083 3
STIPULATED JUDGMENT FOR RESPONDENT AND DEFENDANT GREAT BASIN UNIFIED AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT

1 U. The City appealed the 2011 SCRD under Section 42316(b). On June 15, 2012, the

2 Executive Officer of the CARB held a hearing on the City's appeal. On November 19, 2012, the

3 CARB issued its written decision denying the City's appeal and affirming the 2011 SCRD

4 ("CARB Decision").

5 V. On or about December 10, 2012, the City filed a Verified Petition for Writ of
Mandate in this action entitled City of Los Angeles, et al. v California Air Resources Board. Los
Angeles County Superior Court, Case No. BS140620 (the "Action"). This Action was transferred
to the Sacramento County Superior Court and the City filed a First Amended Verified Petition for

9 Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory Relief on or about August 30, 2013 (*Amended

10 Petition'). The District filed its Answer to the Amended Petition on September 30, 2013. The

11 Action in part appeals the CARB Decision pursuant to Sections 42316 and Civil Procedure Code

12 Section 1094.5. On September 25, 2014, the Court issued a tentative ruling denying the City's

13 petition for writ of mandate and ordering entry of judgment for Respondents and Defendants. A

14 hearing was held on September 26, 2014 and after oral argument, the Court took the matter under

15 submission pending the issuance of its final ruling and order.

16 W. On November 16, 2012, the District issued the 2012 SCRD which ordered the City

17 to install additional 0.76 square miles of dust control measures on the dried Owens Lake bed to

18 meet the NAAQS for PM10- These are known as the Phase 10 dust control areas.

19 X. The City appealed the 2012 SCRD under Section 42316(b). On April 18, 2014,

20 the Executive Officer of the CARB held a hearing on the City's appeal. A decision on this appeal
21 IS pending.

22 Y. On April 4, 2014, the District issued the 2013 SCRD which stated that no

23 additional areas of the lake bed required controls at that time. On August 6, 2014, the District

24 issued its preliminary 2014 SCRD which also stated that no additional areas of the lake bed

25 required controls at that time.

26 Z. Based on data collected, the 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 SCRDs, modeling and

27 expericnce by the District to date, the District estimates that the City's control of dust emissions

28 by applying BACM to 48.6 square miles of the dried Owens Lake bed, and the District's control
la-1255083 4
STIPULATED JUDGMENT FOR RESPONDENT AND DEFENDANT
GREAT BASIN UNIFIED AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT

1 of dust emissions from the adjacent Keeler Dunes will reduce emissions in the OVPA such that it

2 can attain the NAAQS. Further monitoring and data collection will be needed to confirm the

3 estimates of attainment.

4 AA. The Parties acknowledge the need to control dust from the lakebed caused by the

5 City's water production activities and for additional effective dust control measures that do not

6 rely on water that can be substituted in areas currently under control or applied in areas ordered to

7 be controlled.

8 BB. The Parties further acknowledge the need to balance the requirements to control

9 dust emissions and conserve water with the requirements to minimize impacts to cultural and

10 biological resources.

11 CC. Now, therefore, after extensive negotiations to resolve their disputes, the Parties

12 have reached a settlement with the terms contained herein, and agree to entry of this Stipulated

13 Judgment to resolve this action and their disputes including those stated in the Amended Petition

14 and the District's Answer, and those regarding the 2011 SCRD, 2012 SCRD, 2013 SCRD and

15 2014 SCRD under Section 42316.

16 STIPULATED JUDGMENT

17 1. Entry of Judgment. The Court orders that final judgment on the Petition and

18 Complaint in this action, including all terms contained herein, be entered for Respondent and

19 Defendant District against Petitioner and Plaintiff on all causes of action in the pending First

20 Amended Petition and Complaint ("Judgment"). The Judgment shall constitute final judgment
21 resolving all claims and defenses alleged in the Amended Petition and the Answer filed by the

22 District. The Parties agree not to appeal or further contest this Judgment. The Judgment shall

23 consists of any final ruling and order by this Court on the City's writ of mandate as referenced in

24 Preamble Paragraph V, which shall be attached as Attachment A to this Stipulated Judgment, and

25 the additional terms contained herein, which the Parties stipulate are consistent with the Court's
26 order.

STIPULATED JUDGMENT FOR RESPONDENT AND DEFENDANT
GREAT BASIN UNIFIED AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT

- 2. Phase 9/10 Project to Implement 2011 and 2012 Supplemental Control

2 Requirement Determinations

3 A. By December 31, 2017, the City shall construct a dust control project to

4 complete the Phase 9 and Phase 10 dust controls by selecting and installing BACM on 3.62

5 square miles of areas identified in the 2011 SCRD and 2012 SCRD (collectively referred to as the

6 "Phase 9/10" project). The Phase 9/10 project shall bring the total area of the City's dust controls
on the Owens Lake bed to 48.6 square miles. The construction deadline set forth in this

8 paragraph is subject to the Force Majeure and Stipulated Penalties provisions set forth in
Paragraphs 14 and 15 below.

10 B. The City may submit an application to the APCO to approve modifications

11 to the City's proposed project or measures on certain areas that are determined to contain

12

13 significant cultural resources. The District shall consider and decide the City's application under
the procedures contained in the 2013 Stipulated Abatement Order No. 130819-01.

14 C.

15 The Phase 9/10 project will use dust control measures that are waterless or

16 "water neutral" by offsetting any new or increased water use with water savings elsewhere on the

lakebed.

17 D.

18 shall Within 60 days of the court's entry of this Stipulated Judgment, the City

prepare

19 and submit for the APCO's consideration and written approval, which approval

20 shall not be unreasonably withheld, a Remedial Action Plan ("RAP") for the Phase 9/10 project

21 that provides for project completion by December 31, 2017. The plan shall contain intermediate

22 milestones specifying the completion dates for CEQA compliance (and to the extent joint

23 documents are prepared under CEQA and NEPA, for CEQA/NEPA compliance), construction bid
award and control measure compliance.

24 E.

25 Upon completion of the Phase 9/10 project, and any additional BACM

26 Contingency Measures as provided in Paragraph 3 below, the City shall permanently operate dust

27 controls with approved BACM on those areas and all other existing areas where the City has

28 installed and operates dust controls on the dried Owens Lake bed, except as provided by a SIP for
BACM testing and development.
la-1255083 6
STIPULATED JUDGMENT FOR RESPONDENT AND DEFENDANT
GREAT BASIN UNIFIED AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT

3. Additional BACM Contingency Measures

2 A. To provide the emission reductions necessary to meet the NAAQS in the
OVPA, the District's Air Pollution Control Officer ("APCO") may order the City on or any time

4 after January 1, 2016 to implement additional BACM contingency measure controls on up to 4.8

5 square miles (which need not be contiguous) of the dried Owens Lake bed ("BACM Contingency

6 Measures"). If the City implements the entire 4.8 square miles of BACM Contingency Measure

7 controls, there will be total of 53.4 square miles of dust controls on the Owens Lake bed. Any

8 BACM Contingency Measure orders shall be based on evidence presented to the APCO that the

9 area considered for such order has caused or contributed to an exceedance of the NAAQS or State

10 Standard. Areas that are deferred for controls under the procedures in Paragraph 2.B because of

11 the presence of significant cultural resources, then re-ordered for controls per those procedures,

12 shall not be counted as part of the 4.8 square miles allowed for BACM Contingency Measures.

13 Although the City may provide comment on a proposed BACM Contingency Measures order by

14 the APCO, the City shall not appeal or contest the APCO's order for dust controls included in the

15 combined 53.4 square miles now or in the future in any administrative or judicial forum, under

16 any law, statute or legal theory whatsoever including Section 42316.

17 B. Except for the 4.8 square mile BACM Contingency Measure arca and any

18 area re-ordered for control under Paragraph 2.B of this Judgment, the District shall not issue any

19 further orders for mitigation measures to the to City under Section 42316 or any other law, including

20 but not limited to SCRDs, requiring the City to control windblown dust emissions (including PM
21 10, PM 2.5 or any speciated components or products of PM) from any areas on the dried Owens

22 Lake bed beyond the combined 53.4 square miles. The provisions in this paragraph do not apply
23 to fee orders issued to the City under Section 42316, or any orders for areas that are not on the

24 dried Owens Lake bed.

25 C. The BACM Contingency Measures provided under this paragraph will be

26 limited to the Owens Lake bed below elevation 3,600.00 feet above mean sea level ("amsl") and

27 above the natural brine pool at elevation 3,553.55 feet amsl.

28 D. The BACM Contingency Measures areas will be controlled with waterless
la-1255083 7
STIPULATED JUDGMENT FOR RESPONDENT AND DEFENDANT
GREAT BASIN UNIFIED AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT

or water-neutral dust control measures by offsetting any new or increased water use with water

2 savings elsewhere on the lakebed.

3 E. The BACM Contingency Measures shall be installed by the City and be
operational within three years of the date that the APCO orders City to implement the BACM

5 Contingency Measures, except that if the City selects the use of managed vegetation for its

6 BACM for any of the areas ordered for BACM Contingency Measures, the City will be allowed

7 an additional two years to achieve full vegetation-cover compliance for those areas. The

8 implementation deadline set forth in this paragraph is subject to the Force Majeure and Stipulated

9 Penalties provisions set forth in Paragraphs 14 and 15 below. The City shall be solcly responsible

10 for all CEQA compliance, and to the extent joint documents are prepared under CEQA and

11 NEPA, for CEQA/NEPA compliance, and all lease and permit requirements associated with any

12 Contingency Measures.

13 F. Within 60 days of the date that the APCO orders City to implement the

14 BACM Contingency Measures, the City shall prepare and submit for the APCO's consideration

15 and written approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, a RAP that provides for

16 the completion of those measures by the time deadlines provided in Paragraph 3.E above. The

17 plan shall contain intermediate milestones specifying the completion dates for CEQA/NEPA

18 compliance, construction bid award and control measure compliance.

19 4. Monitoring

20 A. For PM10 monitoring, the City shall grant an irrevocable right in perpetuity

21 Lo the District to site air monitors on City-occupied or unoccupied property in communitics
22 located in the OVPA at the District's sole discretion, shall provide electric power to those

23 monitors if such is power source is under the City's control, and shall not interfere with the

24 operation of those monitors, cut off their power supply (except for planned or emergency system

25 outages), or take any other action to evict or remove the monitors.

26 5. Tillage with BACM Backup (TwB2)

27 A. In addition to the approved BACM in the 2008 SIP Order, the City may
28 select a variation on the Shallow Flood BACM called Tillage with BACM Backup (*TwB2").
la-1255083 8
STIPULATED JUDGMENT FOR RESPONDENT AND DEFENDANT GREAT BASIN UNIFIED AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT

1 TwB2 is a District-approved variation of the approved Shallow Flood BACM that wets and/or

2 roughens emissive Owens Lake bed surfaces to prevent air emissions. TwB2 consists of soil

3 tilling and/or wetting within all or portions of Shallow Flood BACM PM10 control areas (TwB2

4 Areas) where sufficient shallow flood infrastructure and available water supply exists. The City

5 shall at all times maintain all TwB2 areas in compliance with all conditions and procedures

6 contained in this Stipulated Judgment such that TwB2 areas do not cause or contribute to

7 exceedances of the PM10 Standard. The City shall have the sole duty to obtain all required

8 approvals and permits required by law for TwB2. The District will support the City's efforts to

9 obtain these approvals and permits in compliance with the law.

10 B. The City's selection and implementation of TwB2 shall comply with the

11 "Protocol for Operation and Maintenance of Owens Lake Tillage with BACM Backup" attached

12 hereto and made part of this Stipulated Judgment as Attachment B ("TwB2 Operations

13 Protocol"). The TwB2 Operations Protocol addresses site selection, site dry-down, measures to

14 prevent untilled drying surfaces from becoming emissive during dry-down, tilling, maintenance

15 and rewetting. The City shall have sole discretion to modify the Operations Protocol as necessary

16 to ensure efficient operation of TwB2.

17 C. The District's monitoring and enforcement of TwB2 Areas shall comply

18 with the "Protocol for Monitoring and Enforcing Owens Lake Tillage with BACM Backup"

19 attached hereto and made part of this Stipulated Judgment as Attachment C (*TwB2 Monitoring

20 Protocol"). This protocol describes the data to be collected and methods of analysis to determine

21 if TwB2 areas on the Owens Lake bed need maintenance and/or reflooding in order to maintain or

22 reestablish control efficiency for compliance with the PM10 NAAQS. Based on data and after

23 consulting with the City, the APCO shall have sole discretion to modify the TwB2 Monitoring

24 Protocol in writing as necessary to ensure air quality protection.

25 D. The APCO may order, and the City is required to reflood a TwB2 area as

26 provided in the TwB2 Monitoring Protocol. Within 37 days of notification by the APCO that a

27 TwB2 area must be reflooded, the City shall complete reflooding of that area in accordance with

28 approved Shallow Flooding BACM requirements. The City shall not appeal or contest the TwB2
la-1255083 q
STIPULATED JUDGMENT FOR RESPONDENT AND DEFENDANT
GREAT BASIN UNIFIED AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT

1 Protocol, any revisions to that protocol that comply with this Paragraph 5, or the APCO's order to

2 reflood a TwB2 area now or in the future in any administrative or judicial forum, under any law,

3 statute or legal theory whatsoever including Section 42316, except the City may contest an APCO

4 order to reflood a TwB2 area on the sole basis that the APCO did not follow the TwB2
Monitoring Protocol. Such challenge shall be brought exclusively to this Court to enforce this
Stipulated Judgment, and not by an appeal under Section 42316 or by any challenge in any other

7 administrative or judicial forum.

8 E. The Parties agrec to periodic joint inspections of the TwB2 Areas by the

9 District and the City. The Parties shall agree to a standing time for meetings at least every other

10 week after the City commences tillage for TwB2 to discuss the status of the surface conditions,

11 whether re-tilling or re-flooding should be ordered to avoid unlawful dust emissions, and to foster

12 collaboration and cooperation at the staff level. The District will provide the City with at least

13 24-hour notification of the time and location of the District's TwB2 field inspections and testing.

14 Although the presence of City staff is not required during these inspections and testing by the

15 District, this prior notification will give the City the opportunity to observe any TwB2 monitoring

16 that the APCO will use to determine if a TwB2 area should be flooded.

17 F. The City may at its discretion file an application with the District to seek

18 approval of tillage without TwB2 as BACM. The Parties shall follow the process in the 2008 SIP

19 Order for this application.

20 G. The City shall be solely responsible to obtain all required approvals and

21 permits required to implement TwB2. The District will support the City's efforts to obtain such

22 approvals in compliance with the law.

23 6. New and refined dust control measures

24 A. The District will review new or refined dust control measures proposed by

25 the City, and will approve a measure as MSM BACM if the District determines that the measure

26 is consistent with the federal EPA's interpretation of the term Best Available Control Measure
27 under the federal Clean Air Act and implementation of MSM as required for the Owens Valley
28 nonattainment area. In assessing whether a dust control measure (including a new measure or
la-1255083 10
STIPULATED JUDGMENT FOR RESPONDENT AND DEFENDANT
GREAT BASIN UNIFIED AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT

extension of a previously identified measure to a new area) is BACM, the District will consider

2 the technological feasibility of the measure, as well as energy, environmental, and economic

3 impacts and other costs.

SUPERIOR COURT OF CALIFORNIA
COUNTY OF SACRAMENTO

DATE: December 16, 2014 DEP.NO.: 24
JUDGE: ON. SHELLEYANNE W. L. CHANG CLERK: E. HIGGINBOTHAM

CITY OF LOS ANGELES, a California Municipal Case No. 34-2013-80001451
Corporation, ACTING BY AND THROUGH ITS DEPARTMENT OF WATER AND POWER,
Petitioner and Plaintiff,

CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD; EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD, in his official capacity, GREAT BASIN UNIFIED AIR POLLUTION CONTROL

Respondents and Defendants.

CALIFORNIA STATE LANDS COMMISSION; and
DOES 101-500,
Real Parties in Interest.

Nature of Proceedings: RULING ON SUBMITTED MATTER AND ORDER:
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

The Court issued a Tentative Ruling on September 25, 2014, in which it denied the Petition for Writ of Mandate. The parties appeared for oral argument on September 26, 2014, and were represented by counsel as stated on the record. After oral argument, the Court took the matter under submission. The Court rules as follows

The City of Los Angeles (City) petitions for a writ of mandate that (1) declares void the 2011 Supplemental Control Requirements Determination (2011 SCRD) issued by Respondent Great Basin Unified Air Pollution District (District), and (2) invalidates the decision of Respondent California Air Resources Board (CARB) affirming the 2011 SCRD. The Petition is DENIED.

I. BACKGROUND

a. Background Facts and Law
This litigation reflects the long-running dispute between the City and agencies such as Respondents, which have jurisdiction over air quality affected by the City's water diversion. The City has been drawing water from the Owens River for over 100 years.

Page - 1 - of 18

Attachment A to Stipulated Judgment

This diversion has dried the Owens Lake Bed, creating large volumes of dust, in particular, the pollutant PMt0.' (CARB OL A:006453.)4
The instant litigation arises from the District's issuance of an order (2011 SCRD) that requires the City to mitigate PM10 on an additional 2.863 square miles of the Owens Lakebed.

i. Background Law
Before discussing the facts, the Court provides an overview of the pertinent law to explain the regulatory relationship between the City, the District, and CARB.

Under the federal Clean Air Act, the United States Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) is charged with identifying air pollutants and setting National Ambient Air Quality
Standards (NAAQS), identifying areas that do not meet the NAAQS for criteria pollutants, and directing the creation of State Implementation Plans (SIPs) to attain the NAAQS for the pollutants. (See, First Amended Petition (FAP), 11 22-26; see also 42 U.S.C. 7410.) CARB has the responsibility and authority to meet the Clean Air Act's SIP requirements through each of the State's 35 air pollution control districts. (FAP, 1
28.) The District is one such air pollution control district.* (FAP, 11 22-26.)
In 1987, the EPA found that the Owens Valley Planning Area (OVPA) (in which the Owens Lake and District are located) did not meet the NAAQS for PM1o, a designated criteria pollutant. (AR: 2g:1769; CARB OL A:006454.) In 1993, the EPA reclassified
the OVPA as a "serious non-attainment area" for PM10. (Id.) The District manages air quality in the OVPA through SIPs, which are submitted to and approved by "the State" (CARB) and then to the EPA. (See 42 U.S.C. § 7410.) The District regulates the PM10 emissions caused by the City's water diversion through SIPs, SCRD orders, and an agreement, as described later in the ruling.
In 1983, Health and Safety Code' section 42316 was enacted to resolve disputes between the City and District regarding water diversion and air quality. Section
42316 provides in pertinent part:

PM1 refers to particulate matter 10 microns or less in diameter. (CARB OL A:006453.)
Citations to the administrative proceedings before CARB appear as "CARB OL A: Other citations
to the administrative record appear as "AR volume number, volume letter:bates number" (e.g., AR 2g:1789.)
Although the SCRD initially required the City to implement mitigation on 2.93 square miles, the District issued a revised SCRD reducing the new control area from 2.93 to 2.86 square miles. (CARL OL A:
6458.)

4 The District is formed pursuant to Health and Safety Code sections 40000 et seq.
5 Unless otherwise specified, all future references shall be to the Health and Safety Code.

(a) The Great Basin Air Pollution Control District may require the City of Los Angeles to undertake reasonable measures, including studies, to mitigate the air quality impacts of its activities in the production, diversion, storage, or conveyance of water and may require the city to pay, on an annual basis, reasonable fees, based on an estimate of the actual
costs to the district of its activities associated with the development of the mitigation measures and related air quality analysis with respect to those activities of the city. The mitigation measures shall not affect the right of the city to produce, divert, store, or convey water and, except for studies and monitoring activities, the mitigation measures may only be required or amended on the basis of substantial evidence establishing that water
production, diversion, storage, or conveyance by the city causes or
contributes to violations of state or federal ambient air quality standards.
(b) The city may appeal any measures or fees imposed by the district to the state board [CARB] within 30 days of the adoption of the measures or
fees. [CARB], on at least 30 days' notice, shall conduct an independent hearing on the validity of the measures or reasonableness of the fees which are the subject of the appeal. The decision of [CARB] shall be in writing and shall be served on both the district and the city. Pending a decision by [CARB], the city shall not be required to comply with any measures which have been appealed. Either the district or the city may bring a judicial action to challenge a decision by [CARBJ under this section. The action shall be brought pursuant to Section 1094.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure and shall be filed within 30 days of service of the decision of [CARB].... (Health & Saf. Code, 42316 (emphasis added).)
Thus, the District may require the City to undertake reasonable mitigation measures to mitigate the air quality impacts of diverting water, which must be supported by substantial evidence establishing that the City's water diversion causes the violations. Section 42316 also sets forth the process by which the City and District resolve disputes about the reasonableness of the mitigation measures. The City may appeal District orders
to CARB. CARB then "conduct[s] an independent hearing on the validity of the
measures." Either party may then file a petition for writ of mandate pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure, section 1094.5. (Health & Saf. Code, § 42316.)
The parties agree that Section 43216 governs this litigation.

b. Procedural Background
The City implements dust suppression measures on approximately 43 square miles of the Owens Lake Bed. (CARB OL A:6454-6455.) The City implements these measures
pursuant to Supplemental Control Requirements Determinations (SCRD) from the District that have been incorporated into various SIPS, and a 2006 Agreement between the City and District. (lbid; see also, AR 2g:1769-1770.)

Attachment A to Stipulated Judgment

In late 2006, the City and District entered into an Agreement to settle litigation in which the City challenged a SCRD issued by the District's Air Pollution Control Officer (APCO). (AR 2g:1769-1770.) The Court refers to this Agreement as the *2006 Agreement." Among other things, the City agreed to:
Apply Dust Control Measures on additional areas of the Owens Lakebed, beyond the 29.8 square miles required by the 2003 SIP. (AR 2g:1770.)
Work with the District to improve the current "Dust ID Program" used to monitor PM1 emissions. (AR 2g:1774-1775.)

Allow the APCO to "recommence" written SCRDs, under the "revisions to the 2003 SIP." Pertinent here, the SCRDs will use Dust ID Data collected after
April 1, 2010, and shall be made once every calendar year. (AR 2g: 1778.)

Abide by a particular dispute resolution process if it did not agree to a SCRD
issued by the APCO. If the City and District dispute a SCRD, "the City may
appeal future [SCRDs] to CARB under the provisions of... Section 42316…provided that the Parties expressly intend that this Agreement be the final resolution regarding existing disputes between the Parties that are the subject
of this Agreement....[TJhe City stipulates and agrees that all of the provisions and determinations, including the measures and procedures, contained in the 2003
SIP, the provisions of this Agreement to be included in modifications to the 2003 SIP pursuant to this Agreement, and the [SCRD] dated April 4, 2006, which the City in good faith disputed, shall be deemed to be valid and reasonable, and that the City will not challenge those provisions or determinations by appeal under Section 42316 or in any other proceedings, including any other administrative or judicial forum. Subject to this Paragraph, the City may challenge any future [SCRD] under Section 42316; however any arguments or challenges must be based on data or information that do not currently exist, but that exist after the execution of this Agreement. (AR 2g: 1779 (emphasis added).)

In 2008, the District issued order #080128-01 (2008 Order). The 2008 Order
incorporated the 2006 Agreement and approved the 2008 SIP, which regulated the PM10 emissions caused by the City's water diversion. The 2008 Order has been approved by CARB and the EPA under the 2010 Coso Junction Maintenance Plan, and has not been
challenged by the City. (See AR 2a:899-900; CARB OL A: 6457.)
The 2008 Order ordered the City to continue to implement certain PMi0 controls (Best Available Control Measures or BACMs) on 29.8 square miles of the Owens Lakebed, and then on other specified portions of the Lakebed for a total of 43.0 square miles of "Total Dust Control Area." (AR 3a:1815-1816.) The 2008 Order specified the BACM
mitigation measures that could be used by the City: shallow flooding, managed vegetation, and gravel blanket.° (AR 3a:1820-1842.)

6 The 2008 Order also specified that "Moat and Row," an alternative mitigation measure, was not currently approved by the District. (AR 3a:(825-1825.)
Page - 4 - of 18

Attachment A to Stipulated Judgment

The 2008 Order also provided that at least once: year, the District's APCO will make a written determination as to whether any areas, in addition to those required by the 2008 Order require additional mitigation to comply with the NAAQS for PMIa. (AR 3a:1817.) The 2008 Order further provided that once the APCO issues such a determination, the City must implement the BACM mitigation and comply with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and secure any necessary permits to implement the mitigation. (AR 3a:1818.)
On August 1, 2011, the District APCO issued the 2011 SCRD. The 2011 SCRD orders the City to "implement, operate and maintain air pollution control measures on an additional 2.86 square miles" of the Owens Lake Bed. (AR 2a:906.) The 2011 SCRD states that the City may use any combination of the three approved BACM measures:
shallow flooding, managed vegetation, or gravel. (Id.; CARB OL A 6457.)
The City appealed the 2011 SCRD to CARB pursuant to Section 42316. Following a June 15, 2012 administrative hearing, CARB issued a decision affirming the District's SCRD on November 19, 2012. (CARB OL A: 006451-006483.)
The City filed a petition for a writ of mandate in the Superior Court for Los Angeles County, which was then transferred to the Superior Court for Sacramento County. The City amended its petition to add claims for declaratory relief. In February 2014, the Court granted Respondents' motion for judgment on the pleadings as to each claim for declaratory relief. This ruling addresses the remaining writ causes of action.

II. DISCUSSION

a. Requests for Judicial Notice
On January 21, 2014, the City submitted a request for judicial notice (RJN) in support of its Reply Briefs. Because the RJN was unopposed by any party, the Court granted the City's request in its tentative ruling.
At the hearing, the District objected to the Court's ruling, because the exhibit attached to the RJN, a statement from Governor's Office "Declar[ing] a Drought State of Emergency," was not in the administrative record. The District had nine months to make this objection. Because it is untimely, the District's objection is OVERRULED. In any event, the Court's consideration of the City's Request for Judicial Notice does not alter
the outcome of the ruling.

The District also asked the Court at the hearing to disregard other evidence cited by the **
City in its Reply Brief (to the District) that was stricken from the administrative record. These objections are OVERRULED, as they are untimely. In any event the citations do not alter the Court's ruling.

b. California State Lands Commission

Real Party in Interest California State Lands Commission (CSLC) objects to being named as a party, because it did not take any actions subject to mandate. This contention is inapposite. A real party in interest includes any person or entity whose interest will be directly affected by the proceeding, or anyone having a direct interest in the result, which is therefore entitled to notice of the proceedings. (Sonoma County Nuclear Free Zone v. Superior Court (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 167, 173-174.) CSLC owns a portion of the Owens Lakebed upon which the City must implement mitigation measures. As its ownership interests could be affected, it is properly named a as a Real Party in Interest.
CSLC clarified at the hearing that it did not object to being named a Real Party in Interest, but objected to the extent that the City was trying to seek mandate relief against it. The City replied that it is not seeking mandate relief against the CSLC, and this contention is apparent from the Petition.

C. Standard of Review

i. The Court Reviews CARB's Decision

As a preliminary matter, the Court rejects the City's argument that because it "appealed" the 2011 SCRD issued by the District, the Court must review the District's decision to issue the 2011 SCRD, not the CARB decision that affirmed it. The plain language of
Section 42316 says otherwise: "Either the district or the city may bring a judicial action to challenge a decision by [CARB]" pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5. (Health & Saf. Code, § 42316, subd. (b).) This language indicates that the Court reviews CARB's decision.

The City argues that, by analogy, the Court may review the District's decision because Water Code sections 13320 and 13330 allow courts to review a regional water board's order, which is administratively appealable to the State Water Resources Control Board
(State Board). The Court rejects this argument.
Unlike Section 42316, Water Code sections 13330 and 13320 make express reference to the reviewability of regional board decisions for which the State Board denies review. (Water Code, § 13330, subd. (b).) Additionally, the California Supreme Court has interpreted these statutes to reflect that "decisions and orders of the [regional board], including the issuance and renewal of NPDES permits, are reviewable by administrative
appeal to the State Water Board, and then by petition for administrative mandamus in the superior court." (Voices of the Wetlands v. State Water Resources Control Board (2011) 52 Cal.4th 499, 516.) In contrast to these Water Code provisions, no published appellate authority has construed Section 42316. Thus, procedurally, these statutes are inapposite as Petitioner is not seeking review of a decision by a regional board and this is not a case
where the State Board has denied review.

Page - 6 - of 18

Attachment A to Stipulated Judgment

The City also contends that the Court may review the District's decision, because CARB's hearing was an appellate hearing and not a true de novo hearing. However, Section 42316 provides that the City may appeal any mitigation measures or fees imposed by the District to CARB, which shall conduct an "independent hearing on the validity of the measures." (Health & Saf. Code, § 42316, subd. (b).) The statute expressly provides that the hearing by CARB is de novo.
Accordingly, the Court reviews CARB's decision.

ii. Review of CARB's Decision

The Court reviews CARB's decision to determine "whether the respondent has proceeded
without, or in excess of, jurisdiction; whether there was a fair trial; and whether there was any prejudicial abuse of discretion. Abuse of discretion is established if the respondent has not proceeded in the manner required by law, the order or decision is not supported by the findings, or the findings are not supported by the evidence." (Code Civ. Proc., § 1094.5, subd. (b) (emphasis added).) "[A]buse of discretion is established if the court determines that the findings are not supported by substantial evidence in the light of the whole record." (lbid, § 1094.5, subd. (c).)
The parties agree that the standard of review for CARB's factual determinations,' e.g., whether the mitigation measures in the 2011 SCRD are "valid," is whether they are supported by substantial evidence. (Sierra Club V. California Coastal Comm'n (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 547, 556-557; Health & Saf. Code, § 42316, subd. (b).)

CARB's decision is presumed to be supported by substantial evidence, and Petitioner bears the burden of showing that there is no substantial evidence to support the findings of the agency. (Ross v. California Coastal Comm'n (2011) 199 Cal.App.4t 900, 921.) Petitioner argues that the Court must "weigh the evidence." This is incorrect. In
reviewing CARB's decision, the Court examines the entire administrative record and considers all relevant evidence, including evidence that detracts from the decision.
(Ibid.) Although this task may involve some weighing to fairly estimate the worth of the evidence, that limited weighing does not constitute independent review where the Court substitutes its own findings and inferences for the agency's. (Id. at p. 922.) Rather, it is for CARB to weigh the evidence, and the Court may reverse CARB's decision only if, based on the evidence, a reasonable person could not have reached the conclusion CARB
reached. (lbid.)

The parties agree that the Court reviews de novo whether CARB has complied with
procedural requirements (see Citizens for East Shore Parks v. California State Lands Comm'n. (2011) 202 Cal.App.4 549, 557) and issues of law (see Pasternak y. Boutris (2002) 99 Cal.App.4U 907, 918).

7 Such factual determinations include disagreements regarding the methodology used for assessing environmental impacts, and reliability or accuracy of data upon which the agency relics. (North Coast Rivers Alliance v. Marin Mun. Water Distr. (2013) 216 Cal.App.4°h 614, 642-643.)

Attachment A to Stipulated Judgment

d. The City Has Failed to Show that CARB Did Not Follow Proper
Procedures in Conducting the Hearing

The City argues that CARB abused its discretion by failing to comply with procedures required by law because CARB did not conduct a true "independent" hearing. Namely, the City argues that the CARB Executive Officer admitted some evidence but did not consider the City's. The City has shown no prejudicial abuse of discretion.
The Executive Officer conducting the hearing on behalf of CARB® declined to conduct a
"new unlimited evidentiary hearing." (CARB OL A:006458-6459.) He interpreted Section 42316's "independent hearing" requirement to mean that he would apply his independent judgment in reviewing the 2011 SCRD. He also decided to limit the evidence to the "administrative record" before the District, plus any additional evidence admitted to augment the record, and rule do novo on this evidence. (Ibid.) The Executive Officer outlined these rules in January 17, 2012 First Procedural Order issued
at the outset of the administrative process, and after argument and briefing from the parties. (CARB OL A:000915, et seq.)
Specifically, the Executive Officer issued a procedural order permitting the administrative record to be augmented only if (1) the evidence was presented to and accepted by the District but was mistakenly omitted from the record, (2) is relevant, but could not, with the exercise of reasonable diligence, have been presented to the District before the 2011 SCRD issued, or (3) the parties stipulated to admit the evidence. (CARB, OL A:000963.)

The City contends that the Executive Officer denied the City's motions and requests to introduce new evidence into the record. The City has failed to demonstrate how these
alleged errors were prejudicial, notably, by not describing what the evidence was and how its omission assisted CARB or how its admission would have assisted the City.
The City argues that CARB erroneously disallowed the City from presenting unidentified new evidence-first on March 7, 2012, and then on November 19, 2012 when the City submitted some "declarations and supporting documents" with its Opening and Reply briefs in the CARB hearing. (CARB OL A:006459-6460.) The improper exclusion of competent and material evidence may constitute a prejudicial abuse of discretion, particularly if it relates to a defense. (King v. Board of Med. Examiners (1944) 65 Cal.App.2d 644, 649.) Here, the City has not even identified what the evidence is and it how it is competent and material. Accordingly, the City has not shown that the Executive Officer prejudicially abused his discretion.
Second, the City argues that CARB "re-ran" technical data and allowed its staff to testify as witnesses, but did not allow the City to cross-examine those staff. CARB disputes the accuracy of these statements. The City has not shown that CARB prejudicially abused its

For the sake of convenience, this ruling may refer to the acts of the Executive Officer as "CARB." The City does not further explain the nature of the evidence it sought to introduce.
Page - 8 - of 18

Attachment A to Stipulated Judgment

discretion. Beyond these vague statements, the City does not describe the technical data that CARB "re-ran" or the statements of staff at the hearing, and explain how they were relevant or critical to the decision.
The City cites to one page of a CARB staff report prepared for the CARB hearing. In the report, staff note that the City argues that the District did not accurately account for background concentrations and emissions for "Lone Violator" and "Watch Areas," because on certain "exceedance days," the District did not account for attributing the
exceedances from other sources. CARB staff examined the exceedance days cited by the City and concluded that even if those days were omitted, there were a "sufficient number of other [violation] days in the modeling output records to qualify for control in each [2011 SCRD] area." (CARB OL A: 5814.)

The staff report rather notes that, even assuming that specific dates mentioned by the City were removed, it would not alter the District's findings. The City argues in a conclusory fashion that it is prejudiced because it could not respond to this conclusion. However, even if the City could "respond" to this conclusion, it would not alter the conclusions regarding the "Lone Violator" and "Watch Areas." (Id.) The City has shown no
prejudice.
The City next avers that CARB improperly allowed three additional documents not before the District-the District's quality assurance plan for another pollutant; a maintenance plan for a different planning area; and an abatement order to the City. (AR 3b:1964, 5:3629, 4089.) The Court disposes of this argument on two grounds.
CARB responds that Petitioner made no attempt during the hearing to exclude the
documents it now objects to. Accordingly, the City did not exhaust its administrative remedies for this argument.
Moreover, the City does not specify how the admission of these documents was improper or objectionable. First, the City does not identify how the documents were relevant to CARB's decision and to what extent the Executive Officer relied on them. Additionally, Petitioner has not established that the admission of this evidence was in error, namely that the Executive Officer admitted this evidence after a successful motion to augment the administrative record, e.g., he found that it was relevant but was omitted from the administrative record.

Generally, admission of improper evidence is generally not a prejudicial abuse of discretion if there is sufficient competent evidence to support the agency's decision. (Southern Cal. Jockey Club, Inc. v. California Horse Racing Bd. (1950) 36 Cal.2d 167, 175; Carden v. Board of Profl Eng'rs. (1985) 174 Cal.App.3d 736, 744.) As the City fails to identify how the admitted evidence was improper, it cannot show a prejudicial abuse of discretion.

Allachment A to Stipulated Judgment

e. The City's CEQA Challenge is Barred
The City contends that the 2011 SCRD Order (as affirmed by CARB) violates CEQA because it requires the City to implement one of three particular mitigation measures. (CARB OL A:6478-6479.) The gravamen of the City's argument is that it believes that the 2011 SCRD will require it to use additional water to mitigate PM10, emissions, which will create additional environmental impacts that the City must evaluate under CEQA,
The City argues that requiring additional PMio mitigation is a CEQA "project," but by restricting the mitigation measures, the District has precluded the City, as lead agency, from fully considering the environmental impacts of the 2011 SCRD, considering other alternatives and mitigation measures, and deciding whether to adopt a Statement of Overriding Considerations. The City also argues that the 2011 SCRD violates CEQA because implementing it will likely impact cultural resources in the area.
CARB found no substantial evidence that the 2011 SCRD violates CEQA. (CARB OL A:6480.) Having reviewed the administrative record, the Court agrees.
The City's CEQA challenge is based on its complaint that the 2011 SCRD restricts the City's choice of PMj mitigation. But the 2008 Order already outlined the types of permissible mitigation measures, which the City did not challenge. In fact, the City agreed not to do so in the 2006 Agreement with the District.

The 2011 SCRD requires the City to use one of three mitigation measures to mitigate
dust on an additional 2.86 square miles of the Owens Lakebed: shallow flooding,
managed vegetation, or gravel. The District issued the 2011 SCRD pursuant to the 2008 Order, which was approved by CARB and the EPA in the Coso Junction Maintenance Plan, and not challenged by the City. (AR 2a:899-900.) These mitigation measures are also set forth in the District's most recent (2008) SIP, which is confirmed by the District's 2008 Order. The 2008 Order also reflects that the City will assume the role of CEQA lead agency, and prepare any documentation, related to additional mitigation.
Respondents observe that City stipulated in the 2006 Agreement "not to challenge (the 2008 Order) under CEQA to the extent the Order is consistent with [the 2006 Agreement]." This 2006 Stipulation is incorporated into the 2008 Order. (AR 2h:233, para. G.)

The City does not meaningfully dispute these contentions-that it now brings a CEQA challenge to mitigation measures set forth in a 2008 Order which formed the authority for the 2011 SCRD. Moreover, the City does not assert that it may bring CEQA action now because the mitigation measures reflected in the 2011 SCRD and set forth in the 2008 Order are somehow inconsistent with the provisions of the 2006 Agreement. Rather, the City appears to argue that its 2006 Agreement was invalid: it could not stipulate to forego a CEQA challenge because the public has a right to be informed of
decisions under the CEQA process. However, the City should have asserted this in a

Page - 10 - of 18

tachment A to Stipulated Judgment

timely action to challenge the mitigation measures set forth in the 2008 Order, which it
failed to do.

The mitigation measures the City seeks to challenge are contained in the 2008 Order. The statute of limitations for CEQA action is "within 180 days from the date of the public agency's decision to carry out or approve the project." (Pub. Resources Code, § 21167, subd. (a).) Accordingly, the statute of limitations bars the City from asserting a CEQA challenge to particular mitigation measures that were the subject of the 2008 Order.

f. The City Has Not Shown that CARB's Factual Decisions are Unsupported by Substantial Evidence

As a preliminary matter, the Court addresses the City's contention that the 2008 Order (incorporating the 2006 Agreement and approving the 2008 SIP) does not bar the City's challenge to the SCRD. The City argues that by entering the 2006 Agreement, it did not waive its statutory right to challenge the mitigation measures in the SCRD, because
Section 43216 is a public interest statute.
"Civil Code section 3513 provides: 'Any one may waive the advantage of a law intended solely for his benefit. But a law established for a public reason cannot be a contravened by private agreement.' Nonetheless, statutory benefit may be waived if (1) the statute does
not prohibit waiver, (2) the statute's public purpose is incidental to its primary purpose, and (3) the waiver does not seriously undermine any public purpose the statute was designed to serve." (Lanigan City of Los Angeles (2011) 199 Cal.App.4 1020, 1030.)
The City argues that because it is asserting the violation of "'important public rights" (contained in either Section 43216 or the California Constitution), the City, as a public
agency, apparently could not enter into the 2006 Agreement, which the 2008 Order incorporated. Were the Court to accept the City's argument, the City could negate any past consent to procedures and methodologies governing issuance future SCRDs. Moreover, the City does not meaningfully argue that any waiver in the 2006 Agreement "seriously undermines any public purpose the statute (or any law) was designed to serve."
The Court concludes that the City's entry into the 2006 Agreement does not allow the City to then challenge procedures and methodologies to which it previously agreed. Additionally, the 2008 Order functions as an independent order barring the City's challenges, regardless of whether the Court finds that the City did not waive any statutory or constitutional claims under the 2006 Agreement.

However, other grounds exist to defeat the City's specific challenges to the 2011 SCRD,
which the Court will address.

The City argues the 2011 SCRD is unsupported by "substantial evidence establishing" that the City's water diversion causes the PM10, emissions for which the City must impose additional mitigation. (Health & Saf. Code, § 42316.) CARB decided that the

Page - 11 - of 18

Attachment A to Stipulated Judgment

mitigation measures in the 2011 SCRD were supported by substantial evidence. The Court affirms CARB's decision, and discusses each "substantial evidence" argument.

i. Shoreline

The 2011 SCRD defines the Owens lakebed "regulatory shoreline" at 3,600 feet above sea level (fasl), "below which is the City is responsible for air pollution emissions and above which air quality standards are expected to be maintained." (AR 2a:901-902.)
The City argues that the 2011 SCRD's selection of the 3,600 fasl level is not supported by substantial evidence, because, according to modeling done by the Desert Research Institute (DRI), the shoreline would have fluctuated during the 100 years in which the
City has been diverting water. The City argues that the regulatory shoreline should be
below 3,600 fasl.

The City stipulated in the 2006 Agreement not to challenge future SCRDs, unless the challenges were based on data that existed after the time of the 2006 Agreement. The
Executive Officer found that the location of the "historic" or "regulatory" shoreline was
data that existed at or before the time of the 2006 Agreement. Additionally, because the studies cited to by the City in support of its argument all predated the 2006 Agreement, the City's challenge was barred. (CARB OL A:006466.)
The SCRD procedure contained in the 2008 Order, 10 attachment B, allows the APCO to regulate the City if the monitored or modeled emissions exceed the NAAQS caused by
emissions occurring "at or above the historic shoreline." (AR 1f:6; CARB OL A:006465.) The SCRD procedure definitions define a "shoreline monitor" as one located
at the 3,600 feet elevation (historic shoreline) contour" or one in the "non-attainment
area." (AR 1f:5.) Moreover, the 2008 Order and District Rule 401.D respectively specify that the historic shoreline is 3,600 fasl, and that 3,600 fasl is the "control to" elevation. (AR 2h:356, 2a:974.)

Thus, the Executive Officer did not abuse his discretion in concluding that the City's challenge to the regulatory shoreline is barred.
The City claims that it may revive this argument, because Section 42316 requires that components of the 2011 SCRD be supported by substantial evidence. Even if the Court accepts this argument, however, the City's citation to another modeling report, indicating that the lake levels could have fluctuated over time, does not establish that the District's choice of a 3,600 fasl "regulatory" shoreline is somehow unsupported by substantial evidence.

ii. Modeling and Methods

In the CARB hearing, the City asserted that the modeling procedure used by the District to identify source areas for mitigation is flawed for several reasons, and does not

10 The Executive Officer refers to the 2008 Order as "Board Order 080128-01."
Page - 12 - of 18

Attachment A to Stipulated Judgment

constitute substantial evidence establishing that the City caused the PM1o emissions. The Court considers and rejects each argument.

1. Recommendation of Expert Panel
The City first contends that the 2011 SCRD Order is invalid because the District did not adequately implement the recommendations of agreed-on technical experts (Expert Panel) with regard to measurement and monitoring of the PM10 emissions (e.g., DUST ID
program).

As part of the 2006 Agreement, the City and District stipulated that they would select an Expert Panel to make recommendations to the DUST ID program, and that the District would "implement all mutually-agreeable changes to the DUST ID program." (AR 2g: 1774.) The City faults the District for not making sufficient changes to the DUST ID program after the Expert Panel concluded that some components of the program should be improved. The City contends that the District adopted "a number of," but not all of, the Expert Panel's recommendations.
However, by the City's own admission, the Settlement Agreement required the District to
implement all "mutually-agrecable" changes. Accordingly, the District's decision not make all changes recommended by the Expert Panel does not, in and of itself render the 2011 SCRD invalid.

The City argues that the 2006 Agreement is irrelevant, because under Section 42316,
"substantial evidence" must show that the City's water diversion causes PM10 emissions, and the Executive Officer should not be permitted to "disregard" findings of the Expert Panel that the DUST ID program needs improvement.
However, the Executive Officer did consider the Expert Panel's recommendations. He found that it was impossible for the District to adopt all recommendations, because adoption of all of the Expert Panel recommendations required both the City and District's
agreement, and that the City withheld its agreement by not meeting with the District to discuss implementing those recommendations. (CARB OL A:006470,)
The City does not appear to dispute this, but also argues that it offered its own solution to the potential problems caused by the DUST ID program, which the District rejected.
The Executive Officer further found that despite the City's lack of cooperation, the District implemented a "majority" of the Expert Panel's recommendations, that the record had substantial evidence to support the District's modeling approach, and even if the District could have, but did not, adopt all of the Expert Panel's recommendations, the SCRD was not invalid, as the City cited no substantial evidence that it tried to change the modeling protocols. (CARL OL A:006470.)

The Court has reviewed the record and concluded that the Expert Panel's statements do
not show that the 2011 SCRD and decision affirming it were unsupported by substantial
evidence..

The City cites its own technical data contending that the DUST ID model overpredicts PMIo concentrations by a factor of two and is inaccurate, and argues that the District improperly disregarded the recommendations of the Expert Panel. The District responds that the DUST ID program performs well based on comparisons to other air quality models, and that the DUST ID program's results are appropriate because they are conservative to protect public health and do not underestimate PM10 emissions.
While the City has shown that there may be a "battle of the experts" regarding the DUST ID program and that reasonable minds may differ, this is not a basis for finding that the 2011 SCRD was unsupported by substantial evidence to the extent that the District's mitigation measures were at variance with any recommendations of the Expert Panel. (Association of Irritated Residents v. County of Madera (2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 1383, 1397 (noting that "[w]hen the evidence on an issue conflicts, the decisionmaker is "permitted to give more weight to some of the evidence and to favor the opinions and estimates of some of the experts over the others.") (citation omitted).)

g. EPA Recommendations

The City also argues that CARB's decision affirming the 2011 SCRD is invalid because the District did not follow EPA rules and regulations in collecting the monitoring data is that is the basis for the SCRD. The Court rejects these arguments.

i. QAPP

The City first argues that the District did not collect certain data pursuant to an EPA- approved Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) to ensure that the District's methodologies are trustworthy. The District concedes that it used a "CARB-approved" QAPP, which it contends is sufficient. The City argues that this method is infirm, and renders the 2011 SCRD defective.

The Executive Officer found that the District was not required to operate under an EPA- approved QAPP. (CARB OL A:006473 (citing AR 5:3874, 4373).) However, other than challenging the QAPP-collected data on the basis that the CARB's approval is insufficient, the City does not identify the (1) specific data gathered under the QAPP, (2) its relationship to the SCRD, and (3) how the methodology or data is invalid. Additionally, the City cites no case law where particular data, that may otherwise be accurate, renders an agency enforcement order unsupported by substantial evidence because the EPA did not approve it. The City has not met its burden of showing that CARB's decision on this issue is unsupported by substantial evidence.

Attachment A to Stipulated Judgment

ii. CALPUFF

The City contends that the District improperly uses "CALPUFF," an "alternative" modeling tool that has not been approved by the EPA. The City argues that although CALPUFF is approved as a long-range dispersion model, it is not approved by the EPA for "near-field" assessments, that are used here.
The District contends that the EPA has approved CALPUFF for the SCRD modeling process. The Executive Officer found that CARB and the EPA approved the use of CALPUFF. Specifically, he found that the EPA approved the CALPUFF modeling system for the SCRD process when it approved the 2010 Coso Junction Management
Plan, and the 2008 Order (#08128-01). (CARB OL A:06468 (citing AR 2f:4994; AR
5:4371.)

The Court rejects the City's claims that CARB's decision is unsupported by substantial evidence for the same reasons as discussed above. Other than challenging the
CALPUFF-collected data on the basis that the CARB's approval is insufficient, the City
does not identify the (1) specific data gathered by CALPUFF, and why it is "near-field"
rather than "long range", (2) its relationship to the SCRD, and (3) how the methodology
or data is invalid. Additionally, the City cites no case law where particular data, that may
otherwise be accurate, renders an agency enforcement order unsupported by substantial evidence because the EPA did not approve it.

iii. Calibration of Data

The City also argues that the District improperly calibrates data from the DUST ID model by comparing model estimates and the actual PM1o measurements, a practice that is disapproved by the EPA. The City contends that the District "adjusts" the modeled K- factors to "force agreement" between the modeled K-factors and the actual observed PMIo concentrations at the shoreline. According to the City, this is improper
"calibration."

The District responds that it does not "calibrate" DUST ID data with its own results.
Rather, the District argues that it compares a small amount of paired predictions with actual emissions, to develop a K-Factor value for different areas and periods, to capture seasonal variations on the Owens Lakebed that cannot be predicted by independent
means.

The Executive Officer found that the DUST ID protocol was not improper calibration, because it did not "change" the inner workings of the model, but used the model with the actual values to "improve" emissions estimates. (CARB OL A:006488.)

The Court defers to the technical expertise of CARB in determining that the District did not engage in "calibration" that is disapproved of by the EPA. Petitioner has not shown that CARB's decision was unsupported by substantial evidence.

Page - 15 - of 18

Attachme A to Stipulated Judgment

iv. Other Federal Regulations

contends that the District did not comply with other federal regulations that The City require the District to account for PM10 emissions from other sources. Thus, the City argues that some amount of PM10 emissions are wrongly attributed to its water diversion. The City avers that off-lake sources cause a background level of dust that renders inaccurate the number of exceedances for a measured air quality level. The City also argues that the District did not properly consider the EPA's "exceptional events" policy.
The Executive Officer reviewed these arguments raised by the City, and found that, in this case, the identified federal regulations do not apply. (CARB OL A:006473-6477.) Additionally, the City has not attempted to quantify the amount of PMjo emissions attributable to other sources. Rather, the City appears to argue that if any PMio emissions could come from other sources, this renders the 2011 SCRD order invalid and unsupported by substantial evidence. The City has not shown that CARB's decision is invalid in this regard.

h. Watch Arcas

The City also contests the 2011 SCRD's order that the City to prepare 30 percent designs for dust controls on an additional 1.87 square miles, identified as "Watch Areas." (AR 2:a906; 4g:3544-3545.) The City argues is that there is no legal authority for this requirement, because Section 42316 requires that mitigation measures must be supported
with substantial evidence. The City argues that the District has not determined that
Watch Areas cause any NAAQS PMIo violation.
However, the Executive Officer found that the District's use of "Watch Areas" is supported by legal authorityspecifically the 2008 Order,
Section 11 of the 2008 Order, titled "CRITERIA FOR DETERMINING THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL PM10 CONTROLS" states that the APCO will use the criteria, methods, and procedures in the SCRD procedure, incorporated as Attachment B and the "2008 Owens Lake Dust Source Identification Program Protocol" in Attachment C. (CARB OL A:006464; AR 2:h193).)
The SCRD Procedure states that if the DUST ID model predicts that emissions from a source will cause shoreline PM10 concentrations at or greater than 100 ug/m° but less than 150 g/m*, with the inclusion of 20 ug/m' background concentration, the APCO will direct the City to choose the mitigation it wishes to implement in the identified area. The City must then develop a detailed "scope of work" for the "identified potential source areas." The District may deploy monitors upwind and downwind of the area, and will notify the City if "additional controls" are needed. (CARB PL A:006464; AR 2h:271- 274.) Although the SCRD Procedure in the 2008 Order does not use the term "Watch Area,' the Executive Officer found that "Watch Area" criteria and requirements in the 2011 SCRD match those in the 2008 Order.

Page - 16 - of 18

Attachment A to Stipulated Judgment

Accordingly, by designating : "Watch Area," the 2011 SCRD implicitly found that DUST ID model predicted that emissions from a source will cause shoreline PM10 concentrations within at or greater than 110 ug/m' but less than 150 ug/m', with the inclusion of 20 ug/m' background concentration. The City does not explain how this finding is not substantial evidence supporting the Order that the city prepare 30 percent design for dust controls on the "Watch Areas."
Accordingly, the City has not shown that CARB's decision is unsupported by substantial
evidence.

i. The City's Constitutional Claim

The City contends that the 2011 SCRD (1) permits a "waste" of water prohibited by the
California Constitution, and (2) interferes with its right to divert water under Section 42316. The Court rejects these arguments.

Although the City raised them in a slightly different context, the Executive Officer considered and rejected those claims. The Court agrees with CARB's decision.
First, the City agreed that the specific types of mitigation measures issued by the 201l
SCRD (shallow flooding, managed vegetation, gravel blanket) were valid and reasonable, and it agreed not to challenge them.
Further, the 2011 SCRD does allow the use of a mitigation measure (gravel blanket) that appears to require little or no water. The City discounts this mitigation measure as illusory. It observes that two of the three PM1o mitigation measures require it to use substantial amounts of water, and that CSLC, which owns the land upon which the City must implement mitigation, has opposed and effectively prevented the City from choosing the gravel blanket mitigation measure. Thus, the City argues that the 2011 SCRD will require it to use large amounts of water in violation of the California Constitution, and its right to divert water.

The Executive Officer found that this claim was speculative, because the City had not cited any substantial evidence where it communicated with CSLC about the issuance of
leases (for land CSLC owns) for implementing the 2011 SCRD. The City cites other evidence that CSLC has opposed the gravel blanket mitigation measure.
The Court cannot conclude that the 2011 SCRD Order which allows a choice of
mitigation measures, combined with past statements of CSLC opposing gravel mitigation on other areas of the Owens Lakebed, means that the City will necessarily use huge quantities of water for mitigation.

" Additionally, there may be a water use difference between the two mitigation measures that require water: shallow flooding and managed vegetation. The City does not explain this difference but asks the Court to assume that any use of water is nccessarily wasteful.
Page - 17 - of 18

Attachment A to Stipulated Judgment

Further, even if the City does use some water, the City has failed to demonstrate that such water use is a prohibited "waste" or constitutes "interference" with its ability to
divert water.

Attachment B to the Stipulated Judgment
Protocol for Operation and Maintenance of Owens Lake Tillage with BACM Backup

1.0 SITE SELECTION, OPERATION, AND MAINTENANCE

This report summarizes the methods used by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power
(LADWP) to select, operate, and maintain tilled areas with BACM backup (TwB2) on Owens
Lake.

1.1 Site Selection

TwB2 sites will be selected based on the following criteria, shown in order of priority:

1. Sites within existing shallow flood (SF) infrastructure

2. Sites with predominantly deep fine-textured soils

3. Sites with other than predominantly deep fine-textured soils

4. Sites outside of existing SF infrastructure as allowed by GBUAPCD with predominantly
deep fine-textured soils, provided an alternate source of water is in place to provide water for
soil wetting on an as-needed basis.

5. Sites outside of existing SF infrastructure with other than deep fine-textured soils,
provided an alternate source of water is in place to provide water for soil wetting on an as-
needed basis.

1.2 Site Operation

Site operations encompass selection of the tillage method, activities to minimize emissions
during the tilling operations, and the periodic inspections to ensure that the required site
roughness is being maintained, particularly after large wind, rain, or flood events, and to focus
maintenance activities where these are indicated. Each activity is discussed below.

1.2.1 Selection of Tillage Method
The method of tillage will be determined predominantly by soil type, texture, and moisture
content. Preliminary methods are listed below. Final methods will be determined in the field by
LADWP Operations, who will at that point understand site-specific constraints, and employ the
tool(s) that confer the greatest, most sustainable degree of roughness.

1. If the soils are too wet for other implements, an excavator (possibly on mats) will be
used.

Attachment B lo Stipulated Judgment, Page

2. If the soils are too wet for other implements but dry enough to use a switch plow, a
switch plow will be used.

3. If the soils are also dry enough to run a Towner disk, it may be used as an option to the
switch plow.

4. If soils are dry enough to operate a bull plow, a bull plow will be operated after switch
plowing or disking.

5. The direction of the final operation will be generally east-west, in a gently curving/wave
pattern, to the extent practicable.

6. If roughness conferred by other tools is not sufficiently durable, a Sandfighter or
equivalent may be used to rapidly restore roughness.

1.2.2 Minimizing Emissions During Tilling Operations
Primary tillage such as that practiced and planned at Owens Lake generally does not generate
excessive emissions because the objective is to avoid soil pulverization. The main approach to
minimizing emissions is to minimize the number of passes across a field to achieve the required
roughness.

A secondary protection from excessive emissions is soil moisture. Most soils on Owens Lake are
naturally moist, further limiting potential emissions. When soils are re-tilled, LADWP will
endeavor to take advantage of natural moisture (precipitation) to perform needed
maintenance events.

1.2.3 Periodic Site Inspection

LADWP will inspect all tillage sites on a weekly basis to ensure that there are no visible dust
plumes, and that the required site roughness is being maintained. LADWP's site inspection
program will consist of a combination of drone inspection, periodic LiDAR flights to quantify site
roughness, and ground-truth observations by human inspectors as determined useful by
LADWP. Each of these elements is discussed below.

1.2.3.1 Drone Observation

Drones will provide observations because of their ability to travel quickly over large areas of
rough terrain, recording videos as they go with GPS waypoint coordinates. If any areas of
reduced roughness are observed, which would be most likely after a high wind event,
rainstorm, or other type of inundation (e.g., berm breach, flash flooding), the drone would be
used to GPS the boundaries of the area for later mapping and maintenance decision-making.

Attachment B to Stipulated Judgment, Page 2

During their weekly flights, the drones will record the following parameters:
Roughness relative to goal and/or historic levels
Location and scale of any "blowouts," where roughness has been locally diminished by
deposition and/or erosion.
Evidence of excessively fine material deposition in areas where this poses a significant
risk due to re-suspension.

1.2.3.2 Periodic LiDAR Observations for Use in Mapping and Roughness Calculations

Quantitative characterization of Tillage morphology is essential for accurately mapping,
classifying, and evaluating compliance of the Tillage BACM over time.
On tilled areas, terrain analysis will be used to quantify measurements of Tillage elements, such
as RH and RS. Several methods are possible for quantifying Tillage roughness through terrain
analysis, including LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) and a new remote imaging.
At this juncture, LADWP believes that the best available method for quantifying tillage
roughness is with aerial LIDAR. The following steps summarize the process for analyzing aerial
LiDAR to assess tillage roughness:

1. Acquire Elevation Data: The first step in the roughness determination is to acquire
digital elevation data with sufficient resolution and accuracy to capture the variability at
different spatial scales. At least once a quarter, LADWP will capture high-resolution elevation
data with aerial LIDAR and use it to produce a DEM for each tilled area.

2. Identify Tillage Elements: The next step in the process is to identify and extract tillage
element morphological data from the DEM. Morphometric elements of interest include tillage
ridge, inter-ridge, and furrow positions.

3. Characterize Tillage Elements: After the DEM data are acquired and quantified,
elevation values for each identified Tillage element will then be estimated from the DEM and
used to quantify RH and RS. These calculations result in local height and spacing estimates
across the Tillage BACM area.

4. Reporting Scale: Tillage element characteristics will be aggregated to three spatial grid
scales (i.e., 1-acre, 10-acre, and 100-acre grids), similar to the approach used in the Managed
Vegetation BACM reporting process. Similar to Managed Vegetation, these reporting scales
were chosen to ensure compliance at different spatial scales while also providing operational
flexibility. This approach provides meaningful feedback on the Tillage row condition over time.
Standard summary statistics (minimum, maximum, mean, median, range, and standard

Attachment B to Stipulated Judgment, Page 3

deviation) will be summarized for row height and row spacing. A ratio of the representative
row height and row spacing will then be reported at each grid level.

5. Reporting Frequency and Operational Considerations: Comprehensive coverage of high-
resolution elevation data will be collected on quarterly basis to quantify and report Tillage
element characteristics using the methods outlined above. As part of the operational
management process, regular evaluation of Tillage will be completed using variety of tools,
including high-resolution optical data (i.e., satellite imagery). It is anticipated that visual
changes in texture of the Tillage site will be readily identified in the optical imagery and will
provide a prioritization tool, identifying potential biowouts (i.e., highly eroded areas) or
problems within the Tillage areas. If blowouts or areas of interest are identified, small-scale
acquisition of elevation data may be acquired to further quantify and assess the change in row
height and spacing. Elevation data acquisition for these localized areas will be accomplished
through survey-grade GPS, terrestrial LIDAR, or other appropriate methods. Once the elevation
data are captured, they will be analyzed using the same geomorphometric procedures outlined
above. This information, combined with other factors, will be used to determine if operational
enhancements to the localized Tillage problem areas are required.

1.2.3.3 Ground-based Observations

Ground observations are usually needed to complement aerial and satellite-based collections:

1. Important features that cannot be evaluated remotely with confidence, such as soil
structure.

2. Information needed to calibrate remotely sensed data or interpretations.

3. Tactical, spot observations where remote observations are impractical, inconvenient, or
in need of calibration.

Ground based observations will be employed sparingly, and focused on resolving questions and
testing hypotheses of the day.

Initially, regular observations are expected to be tied to key features (roughness, loose and fine
material deposition), and focused around the perimeter areas of tilled areas.

1.3 Site Maintenance

In this section, maintenance triggers and optional maintenance responses are described.

Attachment B to Stipulated Judgment, Page 4

1.3.1 Maintenance Triggers

Maintenance will be undertaken on that portion of each tilled area that falls below the range of
acceptable roughness as described in Section 3.3.2, Evaluating Tillage Control Efficiency Over
Large Areas, in the Tillage BACM Application (pp. 39-42). The procedure for determining which
portion of each tilled site is sufficient rough is described as follows.

1. Shortly after the initial tillage operation and periodically thereafter, roughness will be
assessed by remote sensing on one-acre blocks encompassing the entire tillage area. One-acre
blocks with an average RH/RS that exceeds the threshold RH/RS will be considered sufficiently
rough to control sand motion and PM10 emissions. One-acre blocks with an average RH/RS
that falls below the threshold RH/RS will be assigned a control efficiency (CE) based on the
maximum of either Equation 7 (see Appendix B of Application) or a fetch relationship from
SWEEP (described below). For mapping purposes, contiguous areas with similar roughness will
be merged into larger polygons using remote sensing techniques.

2. Based on the same one-acre remote sensing grid system, the fetch distance for the
merged polygons will be assessed along the predominant wind directions, which may vary for
different locations on the playa. The CE associated with each fetch distance will be assessed
using a set of relationships generated using the Single-event Wind Erosion Evaluation Program, or SWEEP. In this case, the CE is the fetch-limited sand motion relative to that achieved on the
open playa with unlimited fetch. A site-appropriate SWEEP curve will be used, representing the
unique soil and surface conditions that exist on each tilled site.

3. The CE generated by the SWEEP relationships in step #2 considers fetch effects but
assumes a smooth, erodible surface with no aerodynamic sheltering from existing roughness.
The CE in step #1 accounts for the aerodynamic sheltering but no fetch. Thus, the CE for each
roughness area is the maximum of steps #1 and #2.

4. The CE of the entire tilled site will then be determined using the area-weighted average
CE of the various roughness areas. The areas with high roughness (RH/RS > threshold RH/RS)
are assumed to have 100 percent control because u*t > u* using the methods described in
Appendix B of the Application.

5. The overall site will be judged "sufficiently rough" if the adjusted area-weighted average
CE is greater than or equal to the District-required CE for a site. Nominally, the control
efficiency is 99% but could vary depending on the location, frequency, and magnitude of dust
emissions from each tilled site.

is Even if the entire site is judged "sufficiently rough," LADWP will have the option to enter tilled
areas to re-roughen the surfaces that have degraded over time by a combination of wind and

Attachment B lo Stipulated Judgment, Page 5

water erosions. If the entire site is deemed "not sufficiently rough," then LADWP will have to
entire the site to maintain the surfaces using the methods summarized below.

1.3.2 Maintenance Options

When and where monitoring data so indicate, maintenance to re-roughen areas will be
undertaken. Areas warranting such activity must (a) approach or fall below the required
roughness thresholds, and (b) approach or exceed a scale large enough to produce emissions.

When/where/if, through field inspection or actual tillage, it is determined that no method of re-
tillage is likely to restore adequate roughness, or for any other operational reason, LADWP may
shift an area to some other method of dust control, or re-flooded. In the event of re-flooding,
once soil has been thoroughly wetted, it may be re-drained, and re-tilled to restore roughness.

Attachment B to Stipulated Judgment, Page 6

EXHIBIT C

Attachment C to the Stipulated Judgment Protocol for Monitoring and Enforcing Owens Lake Tillage with BACM Backup

A. Objective

The Great Basin Unified Air Pollution Control District (District) intends to use this protocol as a basis for monitoring and enforcing the Owens Lake PM10 control method known as 'Tillage with Best Available Control Measure (BACM) Backup" (TwB2). The District intends to use the methods set forth in this protocol as a basis for determining if TwB2 areas on the Owens Lake
bed need maintenance and/or reflooding in order to maintain or reestablish control efficiency
for compliance with the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for particulate matter less than
or equal to 10 microns (PM10). The District requires the Los Angeles Department of Water and
Power (LADWP) to at all times maintain all TwB2 areas in compliance with all conditions and procedures contained in this document such that TwB2 areas provide the 99 percent PM10
reduction levels associated with the most stringent measure BACM required on Owens Lake.

B. Introduction

1. TwB2 is a District-approved variation of the approved Shallow Flood BACM that wets
and/or roughens emissive Owens Lake bed surfaces to prevent air emissions. TwB2 consists of soil tilling and/or wetting within all or portions of Shallow Flood BACM PM10
control areas (TwB2 Areas) where sufficient shallow flood infrastructure and available
water supply exists.

2. TwB2 can be used by LADWP throughout the Owens Lake bed where backup Shallow
Flood BACM infrastructure exists and can be implemented as set forth in this protocol to
ensure that tilled areas do not cause or contribute to PM10 Standard exceedances.

3. LADWP is required to reflood TwB2 Areas as set forth herein upon a written order
issued by the District's Air Pollution Control Officer (APCO). LADWP may not appeal an
APCO order to reflood a TwB2 Area to the District Governing or Hearing Boards or any
other agency.

4. Within 37 calendar days of a written order by the APCO that all or part of a TwB2 Area
must be reflooded, LADWP shall reflood so as to reestablish compliant Shallow Flooding
in that area in accordance with the Shallow Flooding BACM requirements contained in
the latest Owens Valley Planning Area State Implementation Plan (SIP). If feasible,
reflooding can be limited to portions of TwB2 Areas that are determined by the APCO to
require reflooding and not to the entire TwB2 Area as defined by LADWP.

Attachment C to Stipulated Judgment, Page

5. Failure to comply with the Shallow Flooding BACM requirements in any area within 37 days of the APCO's written order to reflood may result in notices of violation from the
APCO for each day of non-compliance.

6. Initial TwB2 tillage decisions are at LADWP's sole discretion, but shall follow the "TwB2
Site Selection and Operations & Maintenance Protocols for Owens Lake" prepared by LADWP and dated May, 2014 (0&M Protocol, attached as Attachment B to the
Stipulated Judgment). LADWP reserves the right to modify the 0&M Protocol based on supporting data and after consultation with the APCO. LADWP's right to modify its 0&M Protocol does not extend to the sand flux or PM1o monitoring procedures or thresholds
set forth in the 0&M Protocol which may conflict with this overriding Monitoring and
Enforcement Protocol. Those provisions may only be modified by LADWP with consent
of the APCO.

7. LADWP shall also have sole discretion regarding implementing and maintaining TwB2
Areas such that they remain sufficiently non-emissive to maintain the 99 percent control
efficiency required for Owens Lake BACM. Implementation and maintenance efforts
shall follow the provisions of LADWP's 0&M Protocol and can include any combination
of retilling, reflooding, sprinkling, flattening, compacting or other measures intended to
maintain or restore the PM1 control efficiency of tilled surfaces.

8. The boundaries for each TwB2 Area proposed for tillage will be pre-defined by LADWP
prior to implementation. Each TwB2 Area will be monitored separately as specified in
Section D, "TwB2 Monitoring Tests," below, in order to limit maintenance operations to
the areas that require attention. LADWP shall notify the APCO of all pre-planned tillage
activities in writing at least 14 calendar days before any tillage begins in an area. LADWP
shall notify the APCO of emergency maintenance activities in writing as soon as
practicable, but no later than the start of tillage activities. Failure to provide
notifications may result in notices of violation from the APCO for each day on non-
compliance.

9. Tillage shall create rows and furrows in roughly east to west directions in order to create
maximum surface roughness for winds from the north and south. Additional roughness
to protect surfaces from west winds shall be created in tilled areas sufficient to prevent
emissions from east and west winds. Failure to protect tilled lakebed surfaces from all
wind directions may result in an APCO reflood order. See Section F for requirements to
provide protection from west winds.

10. If TwB2 maintenance is indicated by any of the below described TwB2 Monitoring Tests
(Section D - Tillage Roughness Test, Sand Flux Test, PM10 Monitor Test, Induced
Attachment C to Stipulated Judgment, Page

Particulate Emission Test or Surface Armoring Test) or by Surface Integrity Observations (Section E), LADWP will have 37 calendar days during the dust season (October 15 through June 30) and 74 calendar days during summer season (July 1 through October 14) to select and execute maintenance procedures. Any maintenance under way at the
start of the dust season (October 15) shall be completed by November 1. Failure to
execute maintenance procedures and reestablish a compliant tilled or flooded surface within specified time limits may result in notices of violation and/or reflood orders from
the APCO.

11. TwB2 maintenance options include re-tilling, wetting with sprinkler systems, re-flooding or any other techniques selected at LADWP's discretion in accordance with the 0&M
Protocol.

12. After the maintenance activities have been performed, re-testing using the tests set
forth in Section D will be conducted within 30 calendar days.

C. Dry-Down Period

1. A "dry down" period may be necessary to transition a Shallow Flood Area to TwB2. It is
recognized that there is the possibility of dust emissions during the dry-down period
after Shallow Flooding is shut off when the surface soils are emissive, but the deeper
soils are too wet to allow tilling. To reduce risk of emissions during this time, LADWP will
take reasonable precautions to prevent dust emissions during the dust season (October
15 - June 30). Reasonable precautions include installation of temporary controls (e.g.,
sand fencing, roughness elements, such as straw bales, or other wind barriers and
surface protections) and phased drying/tilling as may be required to prevent dust
emissions.

2. Failure to adequately control dust emissions during dry-down of TwB2 Areas may result
in notices of violation and/or reflood orders from the APCO.

D. TwB2 Monitoring Tests

The District will use the TwB2 monitoring tests set forth below to ensure TwB2 Areas provide
the 99 percent emission reduction associated with the most stringent measure BACM required
on the Owens Lake bed. The District acknowledges that the performance criteria set forth
below may be more stringent than is necessary to meet the 99 percent emission reduction
requirement, however, TwB2 did not go through the BACM development process set forth in
the District's 2008 Owens Valley PM10 State Implementation Plan. Therefore, in order to
provide assurance that TwB2 will provide the high level of public health protection associated
with most stringent measure BACM, the District will initially require that TwB2 Areas pass the

Attachment C to Stipulated Judgment, Page 3

following tests. During the first year of TwB2 operation, the District will meet regularly with the LADWP to review and evaluate TwB2 performance. After one year of TwB2 operation
experience, the APCO will consider revising the TwB2 performance criteria.

1. Tillage Roughness Test

a) The Tillage Roughness Test will use remote sensing and/or direct field
measurements to determine Ridge Spacing (RS) and Ridge Height (RH) in order
to calculate inverse roughness (RS divided by RH or RS/RH). The T-12 Tillage Test
site (heavy clay soils) was tilled with a ridge spacing of approximately 12 to 14
feet and a furrow bottom to ridge top difference of between 3.2 and 4 feet
(ridge height = 1.6 to 2 feet). This yields inverse roughness values of 6.00 to 8.75
and has, as of September 2014, been shown to provide sufficient PM10 control
efficiency. Assuming that ridge tops will weather and lower, the inverse
roughness value in Tw82 areas will be maintained at or below 10.0 (14/1.4) and
the average ridge height will be at or above 1.25 feet (furrow depth to ridge top
difference at least 2.5 feet). Averages will be calculated on 40-acre blocks as
described in LADWP's 0&M Protocol.

b) Lidar, aerial photography or other APCO-approved methods with comparable
accuracies will be used by LADWP to measure inverse roughness and ridge
height. Roughness measurements will be made in the north-to-south direction-
the direction of the primary dust producing winds. Roughness measurements
may also be made in other directions. See Section F for requirements to provide
protection from west winds. Roughness measurements will be reported to the
APCO within 30 days of measurement.

c) Inverse roughness and ridge height measurements will be made at 6 month, or more frequent, intervals. Inverse roughness and ridge height for a TwB2 Area
will be tracked and plotted as a function of time. Where feasible, field
measurements may also be taken to confirm lidar or other remotely sensed
results. LADWP will conduct regular roughness measurements and report the
measurements within 30 days to the APCO. The District reserves the right to
conduct its own roughness measurements at any time.

d) Tillage maintenance will be performed by LADWP if average inverse roughness is
between 10.1 and 12.0 or if average ridge height is less than 1.3 feet in a tilled a
area.

Attachment C to Stipulated Judgment, Page 4

e) The APCO may issue a full or partial TwB2 Area reflood order if inverse roughness exceeds 12.0 (12/1) or ridge height falls below 1.0 foot for any
defined 40-acre averaging area.

f) The APCO reserves the right to adjust the above criteria based on supporting
data and after consultation with LADWP.

2. Sand Flux Test

a) Each tilled area, as defined in Section B.8, will be instrumented by LADWP with
at least four Sensits and Cox sand catchers (CSCs) on untilled surfaces (circular
pads with 3 m radius) in the general northern, southern, eastern and western
portions of a tillage area. The APCO may require proportionally more sand
catchers in tilled areas greater than 320 acres such that there is approximately
one Sensit per 80 acres of TwB2 Area.

b) LADWP will pair CSCs with Sensits, radio equipment and dataloggers
programmed to record 5-minute sand motion data. All Sensit data will be
reported to the District via the District's radio data collection network. Sand
motion data from the CSCs and Sensits will be processed to calculate the sand
flux history of a site.

c) All sand flux monitoring equipment will be placed by LADWP as soon as
practicable as Shallow Flood areas dry, but no later than the start of tillage
activities. Failure to deploy monitoring equipment may result in notices of
violation and/or reflood orders from the APCO.

d) High sand flux values recorded during maintenance activities and non-tillage
sand flux sources shall be excluded from the sand flux data. Maintenance
activities and non-tillage sand flux sources may include, but are not limited to,
rain-splatters, bugs, adjacent grading and road construction activities, as well as
vehicle traffic. Sensits should be placed SO as to minimize impacts from non-
tillage sand flux sources. The APCO shall have sole authority to determine if
Sensits have been impacted by non-tillage area sand flux sources or activities.

e) When (other than during maintenance activities taking place in the tillage area)
the sand flux exceeds 0.50 g/cm7/day, LADWP will perform maintenance in the
tillage area.

f) The APCO may issue a partial or full TwB2 Area reflood order if sand flux exceeds
1.0 g/cm7/day at any sand flux site within a TwB2 Area.

Attachment C to Stipulated Judgment, Page 5

g) The APCO acknowledges that these sand flux triggers may be conservative for
TwB2 areas located away from the regulatory shoreline. The APCO may adjust the sand flux trigger value on a case-by-case basis for each TwB2 area based on
its distance from the regulatory shoreline.

h) The APCO reserves the right to adjust the above criteria based on supporting
data and after consultation with LADWP.

3. PM10 Monitor Test

a) Each TwB2 area will be assigned upwind and downwind PM10 monitors (not
necessarily at the TwB2 Area boundary) to monitor PM10 emissions from the
tillage area. For a given wind direction, the downwind monitors shall be within
22 degrees (t11.5°) of the upwind monitors. Upwind/downwind monitor
assignments will be requested by LADWP and approved by the APCO. Existing
monitors operated by the District may be used as upwind/downwind monitors. Additional EPA-approved monitors shall be operated by LADWP, unless mutually
agreed otherwise. If a monitor is operated by LADWP, its operation and
maintenance must follow District procedures and data collection must be
incorporated into the District communications network. The District reserves the
right to audit monitors and monitoring data collected by LADWP. The District
also reserves the right to install and operate or require the LADWP to install and
operate additional PM10 monitors to adequately monitor the PM10 emissions
coming from tilled areas.

b) All PM1 monitoring equipment will be in place as soon as practicable as Shallow
Flood areas dry, but no later than the start of tillage activities. Failure to deploy
PM10 monitoring equipment may result in notices of violation and/or reflood
orders from the APCO.

c) Impacts caused by maintenance activities and non-tillage sources shall be
excluded from the PM10 data. Maintenance activities and non-tillage PM10
sources may include, but are not limited to, adjacent grading and road
construction activities, as well as vehicle traffic. PM10 monitors should be placed
so as to minimize impacts from non-tillage sources. The APCO shall have sole
authority to determine if monitors have been impacted by maintenance activities and/or non-tillage area sources.

d) When the daily downwind to upwind PM10 concentration difference for any dust
event (other than during maintenance activities in the tillage area) exceeds 50

Attachment C to Stipulated Judgment, Page

is ug/m3 and there is no evidence to show that the additional downwind PM10 did
not come from the TwB2 Area, maintenance will be performed in the tillage

area.

e) The APCO may issue a reflood order if the daily PM10 difference between the if
downwind and upwind monitors exceeds 100 ug/ml.

f) The APCO reserves the right to adjust the above criteria based on supporting
data and after consultation with LADWP.

4. Induced Particulate Emission Test

a) The District will utilize the Induced Particulate Erosion Test (IPET) method to
determine if tilled area surfaces are starting to become emissive and to advise
LADWP with erosion potential alerts. The method described below may be
modified based on the results of a study being conducted by the Desert Research
Institute for the District. The District will discuss the results of the IPET study
with LADWP.

b) The IPET method proposes to use a small radio-controlled helicopter-type craft
(Radio-Controlled Wind Induction Device or RCWInD) to create wind on the
surface. Because the winds created by the RCWInD will vary with differing craft
designs, each craft will be pre-tested to determine the test height above the
surface (H) at which the craft creates a target maximum horizontal wind speed
(TWS) measured at 1 centimeter (Up.o1) above a flat surface. The initial TWS is
11.3 meters per second (m/s). The TWS may be modified by the APCO based on
supporting data and after consultation with LADWP. If the payload on a craft is
changed, e.g. a different camera is used, then Ht must be re-determined for the
new payload since it will affect the amount of thrust needed to keep the RCWinD
aloft. Testing to determine He and TWS will be done on a smooth flat surface, e.g.
concrete or asphalt pavement or plywood test platform with calm ambient
winds (< 2 m/s). The maximum wind speed for any flight height is taken at a
height one centimeter above the surface at a point that is one rotor blade length
away from the point beneath the center of the fastest rotor blade taken on a line
extending outward from the rotor arm. The wind speed measurement is taken
a with a pitot tube pointing toward the center of the rotor blade. The RCWInD
must be flown in a stationary position to get a sustained measurement from the
anemometer. When the craft is flown over a ridged surface, the flight height is
measured from the bottom of the craft's rotor blades to the highest surface
projection anywhere irectly below the craft.

Attachment C to Stipulated Judgment, Page

c) The District will give LADWP field operations staff at least 24 hour notice of the
time and place for RCWInD runs in order to allow LADWP staff an opportunity to
observe those tests. LADWP staff does not need to be present for RCWInD
testing to be used to call erosion alerts.

d) Three erosion alert levels are set using the IPET method: 1) an early warning of
possible clod and surface stability deterioration, 2) a warning level to alert
LADWP of a potential breakdown of the surface stability and to advise voluntary
maintenance efforts, and 3) a mitigation action level to require retilling and/or
reflooding of all or part of a TwB2 Area. The IPET method will be used to
determine erosion alert levels as follows:

i. Level 1 - An erosion early warning is indicated when is any visible dust is
observed to be emitted from a surface or particles are dislodged when
the RCWinD is flown at a is height below one half of Ht. Voluntary
mitigation may be appropriate to prevent further surface degradation.

ii. Level 2 • An erosion warning is indicated when any visible dust is
observed to be emitted from a surface when the RCWInD is flown at a
height below Ht and above one half of Ht. Voluntary mitigation is advised
to prevent further surface degradation.

iii. Level 3 - Mitigation action is required if visible dust is observed to be
emitted from a surface when the RCWInD is flown at a height of Ht or
higher. If ordered by the APCO, LADWP must retill and/or reflood all or
part of a TwB2 Area that triggers a Level 3 alert.

The APCO acknowledges that warning and mitigation triggers may be
conservative for TwB2 areas located away from the regulatory shoreline. The
warning and mitigation trigger values may be adjusted on a case-by-case basis by
the APCO for each TwB2 area based on its distance from the regulatory
shoreline. After one year of experience with TwB2 and the IPET test, LADWP and
the District will meet to discuss the results of the testing and consider
adjustments to the triggers

e) The APCO reserves the right to adjust these criteria based on supporting data
and after consultation with LADWP.

Attachment C to Stipulated Judgment, Page 8

5. Surface Armoring Test

a) Previous studies indicate surface armoring with clods is essential to creating a
tilled surface that prevents dust emissions. The District intends to review existing
studies and conduct tests to develop a technique to measure the surface armoring or "cloddiness" of a tilled area and set a minimum required level of
surface armoring.

b) In order to assure TwB2 areas do not cause or contribute to exceedances of the
PM10 standard, an initial target clod cover of 60 percent will be used. Soil clods must be 1/2 inch diameter or larger. The APCO may issue a reflood order if the clod cover in a tilled area is less than 60 percent. This value will be reevaluated
by the APCO after one year of TwB2 implementation and as appropriate
thereafter.

c) Clod coverage will be measured concurrently with roughness measurements by
LADWP and/or the District. Lidar, aerial photography, point-frame, or other APCO-approved methods with comparable accuracies will be used by LADWP to
measure clod coverage. Clod cover measurements will be reported to the APCO
within 30 days of measurement. The APCO shall approve the clod cover
measurement method.

d) Upon completion of any additional testing or observation of TwB2 Areas, and
after consultation with LADWP, the APCO reserves the right to adjust these
criteria.

E. Surface Integrity Observations

1. The District will notify LADWP's designated representatives on monthly basis or as
otherwise required during the dust season (October 15 through June 30) of District field
observations to evaluate the overall erosion stability of the tillage areas based on
surface observations, soil conditions, and the results of the above described TwB2
monitoring tests.

2. The District will use on-site visual observations, as well as photography, video or other remote sensing techniques to document the condition and potential emissivity of tilled areas. Conditions including, but not limited to, the presence or absence of ridge-top and
furrow-bottom clods, loose soil deposits, efflorescence and ridge erosion will be used to
evaluate the overall integrity of tilled areas. These observations will be used in
conjunction with the above described tests to recommend that LADWP undertake
maintenance activities or as a basis for an APCO reflood order.

Attachment C to Stipulated Judgment, Page 9

F. Protection from Winds Parallel to Tillage Rows
1. Paragraph B.9., above, requires tillage rows and furrows in roughly east to west
directions in order to create maximum surface roughness for winds from the north and
south.

2. In order to ensure that tillage areas are protected from all wind directions, tilled areas
will be jointly evaluated by District and LADWP staffs within 5 calendar days after initial
tillage activities to determine if the tillage configuration and clodding will provide
sufficient protection. If the District determines that the tilled areas will not provide
protection from all wind directions the APCO will notify LADWP that additional
protection measures will be required.

3. Upon such notification by the APCO, LADWP will take further actions to create
additional protection from winds parallel to the initial rows and furrows, it will deploy
other protection measures (e.g., additional tillage ridges oriented perpendicular to the
original tillage or creation of clod clover greater than 60%), or it may abandon tillage in the area of concern and reestablish compliant Shallow Flooding. The DWP must
implement the additional protection measures within 15 days of being notified by the
APCO.

4. Failure to protect tilled lakebed surfaces from all wind directions may result in an APCO
reflood order.

BOARD REPORT

Mtg. Date: July 1, 2021
To: District Governing Board
From: Phillip L. Kiddoo, Air Pollution Control Officer
Subject: Order to Implement Dust Control Mitigation in the Sibi Patsiata-wae-tü Cultural Resource Area at Owens Lake (Action)

Background:
On August 19, 2013, the Great Basin Unified Air Pollution Control District (District) Governing
Board adopted a modified Stipulated Abatement Order (2013 SOA) where special consideration
was given for cultural resource areas (CRAs) meeting California Register of Historic Resources
eligibility. Under these provisions, 0.65 square miles of the City of Los Angeles Department of
Water and Power's (LADWP) Phase 9/10 Project were determined to meet Eligible Cultural Resource Area criteria (Rule 433, A.3.; Board Order #160413-01, paragraphs 2.A. and 3.A.) and determined to be mitigated on a deferred schedule due the presence of significant cultural resource areas if reordered for dust control in the future by the District Governing Board. This is
in addition to 0.55 square miles of the Phase 7 project, meeting the same Eligible Cultural
Resource Area criteria.

Phase 7b and 9/10b areas are exceptions to District requirements for the City of Los Angeles
Department of Water and Power (LADWP) requiring Best Available Control Measures (BACM) by statutory deadlines (Rule 433 B.2.). Except for the Deerborn Springs, all CRAs remain in a
current state of deferral.

Discussion:
For the past three years, a subcommittee of the Patsiata Cultural Resource Task Force (PCRTF) has been meeting in a collaborative partnership forum consisting of local Tribes, District, LADWP, and the California State Lands Commission (CSLC). During this time, participants of the subcommittee developed a plan and scope of work for a pilot project in one area designed to minimize ground disturbance and encourage the growth and expansion of existing vegetation through seasonal surface watering. However, LADWP raised concerns about liability to the landowner and stated they would be unable to proceed with the plan.
On June 9, 2021, the Patsiata Tribal Oversight Committee (PTOC) brought forth an Amended Tribal Recommendation for Dust Control Treatment for this area (Attachment 1). Upon conclusion of this agenda item at the PCRTF meeting on June 9, 2021, all stakeholders present in

Order to Implement Dust Control Mitigation in the Sibi Patsiata-wae-tü

their capacity, unanimously supported the Amended Recommendation (Attachment 2). Subsequent concurrence from Tribal Councils of the Lone Pine Paiute Shoshone Tribe, the Fort
Independence Tribe, the Big Pine Paiute Tribe of the Owens Valley, and the Bishop Paiute Tribe
are still pending. Approval from the Timbisha Shoshone Tribal Council was received on June 17, 2021 (Attachment 3). An update on the status of Tribal Council concurrence will be provided at the Governing Board meeting. Also, an update on a scheduled proposed resolution
for consideration by the California State Lands Commission on June 29, 2021, in support of the Amended Recommendation by will also be provided at the Governing Board meeting
(Attachment 4).

Staff Recommendation:
To move efforts forward to control PM10 emissions from the deferred CRA, District staff
recommends the most appropriate action to protect air quality and cultural resources is for the Governing Board to accept the Amended Recommendation of the PTOC and order LADWP to implement dust control mitigation in the Sibi Patsiata-wae-tü CRA at Owens Lake consistent
with the recommendation. This action will reinforce the collaborative partnership of the PCTRF
subcommittee, initiate subsequent procedural requirements, and provide the necessary legal
structure for LADWP.

Board Action:
Staff recommends the Governing Board order the City of Los Angeles Department of Water and
Power to implement dust control mitigation in the Sibi Patsiata-wae-tü Cultural Resource Area at
Owens Lake consistent with the Draft Amended Tribal Recommendations for the Patsiata
Cultural Resource Task Force.

Amended Tribal Recommendation for Dust Control Treatment of
For the Patsiata Cultural Resources Task Force
By the Patsiata Tribal Oversight Committee, May 22, 2021

This recommendation is considered draft until the Tribal Councils of the Lone Pine Paiute Shoshone
Tribe, the Fort Independence Tribe, the Timbisha Shoshone Tribe, the Big Pine Paiute Tribe of the
Owens Valley, and the Bishop Paiute Tribe have concurred.

Proposed Recommendation: The Patsiata Tribal Oversight Committee (PTOC) recommends that the
Patsiata Cultural Resources Task Force (PCRTF) request that the Governing Board for the Great Basin
Unified Air Pollution Control District issue an order to the City of Los Angeles Department of Water
and Power to implement the Vegetation Enhancement Project.

Background: On September 11, 2017, representatives of the Lone Pine Paiute Shoshone Tribe, Fort
Independence Tribe, Timbisha Shoshone Tribe, the Big Pine Paiute Tribe of the Owens Valley, and the Bishop Paiute Tribe presented recommendations to their fellow members of the Cultural Resources Task Force (CRTF). Those recommendations, titled "'Tribes' Initial and Interim Recommendation on
Best Way to Balance Cultural Resource Protection and Dust Control for Sensitive Areas in Phase
9/10B Proposed Final Version," were adopted by the CRTF, and incorporated into the Great Basin
Unified Air Pollution Control District's dust-control orders. In effect, this meant that dust-control
treatments of the culturally sensitive areas originally slated for dust-control treatments as part of Phase
9/10 were postponed until appropriate methods of controlling dust while protecting the cultural
resources could be recommended. Accordingly, working with its Tribal representatives, the PCRTF (successor to the CRTF) developed a proposal to treat DCA with a Vegetation Enhancement
Project.

Vegetation Enhancement Project: The Vegetation Enhancement Project has been designed to minimize ground disturbance and encourage the growth and expansion of existing vegetation within through seasonal watering. The enhanced vegetation would slow winds near the ground surface and anchor soils enough to reduce dust emissions. A water line laid on top of the ground would feed three hose bibs or spigots placed to supply water to the existing vegetation at crucial seasons to enhance their growth. Water would be supplied by a water trailer, which would be parked on the existing berm
road. The water, equipment, and supplies would be provided by LADWP, and labor would be provided by a crew composed of members of the Lone Pine Paiute Shoshone Reservation who have experience in vegetation enhancement and cultural resource monitoring.
Need for PCRTF and Governing Board Action: Under the current dust-control orders, LADWP is not authorized to conduct any work within Phase 9/10b areas. Under the 2013 Settlement Agreement, incorporated into the 2016 State Implementation Plan, the CRTF (and its successor, the PCRTF) can
make non-binding recommendations to the Governing Board regarding new treatments, and the Governing Board can then issue an order for implementation.

Agenda Item No. 6 - Attachment 1
210701 BOARD PACKET ~ Page 372 of 397

Proposed PCRTF Resolution: The Patsiata Cultural Resources Task Force (PCRTF) requests that the Governing Board for the Great Basin Unified Air Pollution Control District amend the current dust- control orders by issuing an order to the City of Los Angeles Department of Water and Power to
implement the Vegetation Enhancement Project as shared at the PCRTF meeting held virtually on August 18, 2020. The map and description below are adapted from Jaime Valenzuela's presentation
at that meeting.

Vegetation Enhancement Project
Portion of Dust Control Area where water line laid on top of the ground would be placed to
bring water to the existing vegetation. Critical design elements: (1) ground disturbance will be
avoided; (2) a 1000-foot-long water line would be laid on top of ground surface; (3) the water line
would have three hose bibs or spigots where hoses can be attached to allow a Tribal crew to water the
vegetation; (4) water would be supplied by a trailer parked on the existing berm road. The Tribal crew
will monitor any soil movement caused by the watering and inform the Lone Pine Paiute Shoshone
Tribal Historic Preservation Officer if any artifacts or features are uncovered.

Re: Patsiata Cultural Resources Task Force General Support of Amended Tribal Recommendation for Dust Control Treatment of

This memo serves to provide a synopsis of discussions related to the Amended Tribal
Recommendation for Dust Control Treatment of held during the June 9, 2021 Patsiata Cultural
Resources Task Force (PCRTF) meeting.

During the June 9, 2021 PCRTF meeting, Patsiata Tribal Oversight Committee (PTOC) members presented a recommendation for the PCRTF to request that the Governing Board for the Great Basin Unified Air Pollution Control District issue an order to the City of Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) to implement the Vegetation Enhancement Project.

Rationale for this recommendation was provided at the meeting and described in a draft Amended
Tribal Recommendation for Dust Control Treatment of dated May 22, 2021. The
recommendation is considered draft until the Tribal Councils of the Lone Pine Paiute Shoshone Tribe,
the Fort Independence Tribe, the Timbisha Shoshone Tribe, the Big Pine Paiute Tribe of the Owens
Valley, and the Bishop Paiute Tribe have concurred.

Following discussion, a representative from each Tribe, agency and consulting firm was invited to share their level of concurrence for the recommendation. Support for the recommendation, pending approval by each Tribal Council, was issued by the following bodies in their capacity as participating PCRTF
members:

Tribal Historic Preservation Officer for Big Pine Paiute Tribe of the Owens Valley Tribal Historic Preservation Officer for Bishop Paiute Tribe
Tribal Historic Preservation Officer for Lone Pine Paiute Shoshone Tribe
Los Angeles Department of Water and Power
Great Basin Unified Air Pollution Control District
California State Lands Commission
TEAM Engineering and Management, Inc.
Far Western

No opposition was expressed.

The draft amendment was approved by the Timbisha Shoshone Tribe on June 8, 2021 and will be brought to the four other Tribal Councils in summer.

Agenda Item #4
Approval of the Chris Howard, Senior Research & Systems Analyst, gave a staff report as outlined in
Exceptional the Board Packet. He noted that due to milestones being met by LADWP, in 2010 the
Event Coso Junction Planning Area came into attainment. The Exceptional Events
Demonstration
for Wildfire document is required by the Coso Junction Maintenance Plan to demonstrate
Smoke Impacts to attainment according to state and federal requirements. One particular exceedance the Coso Junction pertains to a wildfire that occurred on September 7, 2020, and will count towards PM10 Monitor on National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) unless the District solicits the September 7,
2020 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region IX administrator to invoke the
(Action) exceptional events rule to show that the exceedance was caused by wildfire smoke. The document went out for public review and no comments were received during the public comment period. The Coso Junction Maintenance Plan, which will be
discussed in item #5, is contingent on approval of the Exceptional Event
Demonstration document.

APCO Kiddoo added that this exceedance itself has regulatory consequences which
is why it is necessary to submit such a lengthy document.

Discussion with staff and the Board occurred regarding future exceptional events classifications and possible blanket policies specific to wildfires as well as EPA
regulations.

Board Chair Wentworth asked for public comment at 10:17 am.

Nelson Mejia, City of Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP),
noted that LADWP submitted written comments.

Second 10-Year
Maintenance from LADWP.

Plan
(Action) APCO Kiddoo noted that comments received from EPA have been incorporated into
the maintenance plan. As the comments from LADWP were received the night before
the Board meeting, their comments have not been incorporated.

Board Chair Wentworth asked for public comment at 10:39 am.

Nelson Mejia commented that LADWP has gone above and beyond what is reasonable, over the years. LADWP would like to be able to apply the exceptional
events rule to occurrences at Owens Lake.

The public hearing was closed at 10:40 am.

Motion (Griffith/Hames) following a public hearing and after considering all
testimony and comments received, a motion was made approving Resolution #2021-
04, which adopts the second PM10 maintenance plan to ensure that compliance with
the federal PM10 standard is maintained in the Coso Junction Planning Area. The
Board further directed the Air Pollution Control Officer to submit the revised draft
(with highlighted changes) as presented by staff, to the State of California Air
Resources Board.

Agenda Item #6
Order to APCO Kiddoo gave a presentation on this item. He noted that the specific location
Implement Dust information for this area has been redacted as it is confidential. He recapped for the
Control Board the path taken thus far, which has led up until this point. He also added that
Mitigation in the
Sibi Patsiata- tribal recommendations and concurrences from the Timbisha Shoshone Tribe and Big
wae-tü Cultural Pine Paiute Tribe, have been received recently. The tribal councils for the Lone Pine
Resource Area at Paiute Shoshone Reservation, Bishop Paiute Tribe and the Fort Independence Tribe
Owens Lake
(Action) will be meeting soon.

Board Chair Wentworth asked for public comment at 11:04 am.

Nelson Mejia said that it is important that the Board and California State Lands understands that LADWP is excited about this project as well. He added that this is
probably the first time in Owens Lake history that these groups have all come together on a project. He expressed his personal commitment to get this project done. However, the legalities of the project need to be realized. As excited as everyone is, the legal obligations must be considered. The way the Board Order is written now 1S very vague and may leave LADWP open to legal challenges. LADWP requests that the Board wait to approve and allow staff from the District and LADWP to get together to construct something that will work for everyone.

Jennifer Mattox, California State Lands Commission, on a staff level she would ask
that considerations be made for the kind of pressure Mr. Mejia is under and hopefully everyone can work things out. However, regarding the recently approved resolution by the CSLC, there is a level of urgency due to the dryer years which have more
emissions and a tipping point that you can not come back from. There are impacts to public trust values which also incurs a level of urgency. She noted that the approved resolution in support was in no way trying to dictate to the GBUAPCD Board what they should do. Instead, as the landowner do not feel like CSLC will be an obstacle.
The CSLC is supportive of District staff and APCO Kiddoo on this project.
Nelson Mejia complimented APCO Kiddoo on his efforts to move forward with this project. He added that LADWP just has concerns specifically to the APCO's

July 1, 2021 Regular Board Meeting Page 4 of 9

authority to order a project that does not use Best Available Control Measures
(BACM).

The Board discussed few of the comments made concerning the flexibility of the order which they felt was broad enough to accommodate any issues that may not have been considered yet. They also agreed that the urgency expressed by CSLC is
valid and may impact the success of the project.

Motion (Corless/Duggan) ordering the City of Los Angeles Department of Water
and Power to implement dust control mitigation in the Sibi Patsiata-wae-tü Cultural
Resource Area at Owens Lake consistent with the Draft Amended Tribal
Recommendations for the Patsiata Cultural Resource Task Force.

Agenda Item #7
Approval of APCO Kiddoo gave the staff report. He noted that the purpose of this item today is
Letter from the two parts: 1) to inform the Board of the air quality issues at Mono Lake as well as the
Governing Board non-attainment issues in the Mono Basin; 2) to request the Governing Board review
to the Los
Angeles and approve the attached letter to the LADWP Board of Commissioners in Los
Department of Angeles regarding this violation of the air quality standards. He then added that the Water and Power intent of this letter is not to be confrontational. APCO Kiddoo carefully crafted the
Board of
Commissioners letter with input and expertise from various people. The purpose of the letter is to
Regarding Mono open a solution-oriented dialogue to address the air quality issues in the Mono Basin
Lake Air Quality which allows the Governing Board to fulfill their obligations to protect public health. (Action) This action also allows the APCO to fulfill his duty to enforce the law.
Emissions have increased, and lake-level directly relates to controlling those
emissions. The current control strategy is not working as quickly as expected. Calls
and emails from the APCO to staff at LADWP have gone unanswered concerning this issue. District staff is asking the Board to send this letter to open a dialogue. The a APCO expressed concern that the LADWP Board of Commissioners is not receiving the information that they need from their staff and recent comments made by LADWP staff indicate that they may be trying to avoid their responsibilities at Mono
Lake. He then outlined the content of the letter and noted a couple edits that he has to
the letter that was submitted to the Governing Board in the Board Packet.

Board member Griffith left at 11:31 am.

July 1, 2021 Regular Board Meeting
Page 5 of 9

Board member Totheroh noted that it is not just the locals that are affected, health wise, by emissions from Mono Lake. It is the visitors from all over the world that
come here including the visitors from Los Angeles. He then asked, on behalf of Supervisor Kingsley who was not at the meeting, do we have the same legal standing
at Mono Lake as we do at Owens Lake to deal with dust abatement?

APCO Kiddoo replied, yes. The SB 270 legislation was written because of Mono Lake. In the 80's Owens Lake was dead and Mono Lake was a dying patient and it
was triage. That is when staff started monitoring air quality at Mono Lake. It was
designated as non-attainment which allowed the recognition needed to start planning
how to fix it. All of the early BACM tests for Owens Lake were developed at Mono
Lake. Yes, it falls under 42316, which is disputed by LADWP but no legal judgment
has been made saying otherwise.
Board Vice Chair Hames acknowledged that the APCO has been saying that this situation was coming. LADWP knew it and so did the Board. He asked if there is any other alternative other than stopping water gathering activities.

APCO Kiddoo replied that there are but a lot of that is outside of the District's control. The landowner (federal government) has a large say in what happens. He added that he does not know if LADWP has been in discussion with the landowner.
Other BACM options such as gravel may be possible, but it will take a lot of work
and ignoring the discussions on what those might be is not expediting anything.

Board Vice Chair added that it seemed like there were solutions here using what has been done at Owens Lake. He then asked if the emissions are predominantly blown
east.

APCO Kiddoo responded that it is a rare circumstance that it would blow in a
different direction.

Board member Roeser noted a point of clarity, the options in the District's purview
would be to enforce BACM or to give a violation. She then asked for explanation regarding the other options that APCO Kiddoo mentioned that he noted as being
outside of the District's purview.

APCO Kiddoo explained that an order from the District would entail requiring
LADWP to do something. However, nothing precludes LADWP from working with the landowners or others to come up with a solution to fulfill their obligations with dust control.

Board Chair Wentworth asked for public comment at 11:48 am.

Nelson Mejia noted that at this point in time LADWP has no comment. Obviously,
the letter has not yet been received by the LADWP Board of Commissioners so he

July 1, 2021 Regular Board Meeting
Page 6 of 9

does not know what their directions to staff would be. He stated that he reserved the
right for comments in the future.

Geoff McQuilkin, Mono Lake Committee (the Committee), the Committee has been
working with the District for a number of years, although it is not the responsibility
of the Board there are a number of other issues that are connected to the Mono Lake
level including the ecological productivity, wildlife, visitation, the public trust values, and the land bridge that emerges at these lower lake levels which has to be dealt with in order to protect the nesting gul colony. These are problems that the State Water
Board's order was designed to solve along with the air quality. As of September 28,
2020, a hearing with the State Water Board has been triggered which makes these
issues very timely and brings about urgency regarding this issue. Mr. McQuilkin then handed out a one-year forecast handout (this will be added to the record by the Clerk of the Board).

Jennifer Mattox, CSLC, noted that there is complicated ownership at Mono Lake
including ownership by CSLC. One of the most import court decisions that have shaped the Public Trust Doctrine and how we interpret public trust values and
resources is based on a Mono Lake decision which uplifted and added the value of
open space and environmental protection as a legitimate public trust use and value.
Originally the Public Trust Doctrine was basically commerce, navigation, fishing, recreation. So, we can thank Mono Lake and Audubon Society for helping to add natural state and environmental protection to public trust value. Also, for context, the
Kuzadika'a tribe has initiated government-to-government consultation with the
CSLC under the umbrella of our 2021-2025 strategic plan. So that is ongoing. A
couple things that we are working on with them via government-to-government consultation is looking for opportunities for co-stewardship/co-management and implementation of tribal led land preservation and educational opportunities on and
around Mono Lake, which is not necessarily directly tied to this letter but just for
some context.

The Board then began deliberations. Some thoughts/comments were as follows:

Board Chair Wentworth proposed that staff Cc all the land management interests on the letter. CSLC; Armand Quintero, Director of State Parks; Catherine Jones, Superintendent at Mono Lake tufa area; and any other landowners that are identified. He also indicated that the visitors to the Eastern Sierra should be added to the text of
the letter along with the people of the Eastern Sierra.

Board Vice Chair Hames noted that this is the beginning of a problem unless we get
started on it. Considering the money that the LADWP lost and had to pay out in previous lawsuits with the District he encouraged them to look proactively into
stopping this before it gets into that kind of problem.

Board member Corless added that she supports the suggestion to Cc land managers/owners including CSLC. She also said that possibly the state legislators

July 1, 2021 Regular Board Meeting
Page 7 of 9

and congressional representative should be Cc'd as well. She also elaborated on some minor edits that she will pass along to the Clerk of the Board following the meeting.

Motion (Wentworth/Hames) recommending that staff send a letter, as presented,
from the Governing Board to the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power
Board of Commissioners regarding air quality at Mono Lake. With respect to the letter itself, staff will include relevant land managers and the suggested editorial
corrections as the Air Pollution Control Officer has recommended and also some
typographical changes, which Board member Corless will forward to staff.

which may be of interest to the District and other local agencies. This would pertain to fuels management and may spill over into recreation. The Sierra Nevada Conservancy (SNC) has also given out grants. Separately, there is also a significant real estate
development application that has been submitted in Mammoth.

Board Vice Chair Hames: Looking forward to upcoming SNC meeting.

Amended Tribal Recommendation for Dust Control Treatment of
For the Patsiata Cultural Resources Task Force
By the Patsiata Tribal Oversight Committee, May 22, 2021

This recommendation is considered draft until the Tribal Councils of the Lone Pine Paiute Shoshone Tribe, the Fort Independence Tribe, the Timbisha Shoshone Tribe, the Big Pine Paiute Tribe of the
Owens Valley, and the Bishop Paiute Tribe have concurred.

Proposed Recommendation: The Patsiata Tribal Oversight Committee (PTOC) recommends that the Patsiata Cultural Resources Task Force (PCRTF) request that the Governing Board for the Great Basin
Unified Air Pollution Control District issue an order to the City of Los Angeles Department of Water
and Power to implement the Vegetation Enhancement Project.

Background: On September 11, 2017, representatives of the Lone Pine Paiute Shoshone Tribe, Fort Independence Tribe, Timbisha Shoshone Tribe, the Big Pine Paiute Tribe of the Owens Valley, and the Bishop Paiute Tribe presented recommendations to their fellow members of the Cultural Resources Task Force (CRTF). Those recommendations, titled "Tribes' Initial and Interim Recommendation on Best Way to Balance Cultural Resource Protection and Dust Control for Sensitive Areas in Phase
9/10B Proposed Final Version," were adopted by the CRTF, and incorporated into the Great Basin Unified Air Pollution Control District's dust-control orders. In effect, this meant that dust-control
treatments of the culturally sensitive areas originally slated for dust-control treatments as part of Phase 9/10 were postponed until appropriate method: of controlling dust while protecting the cultural resources could be recommended. Accordingly, working with its Tribal representatives, the PCRTF (successor to the CRTF) developed a proposal to treat DCA with a Vegetation Enhancement
Project.

Vegetation Enhancement Project: The Vegetation Enhancement Project has been designed to
minimize ground disturbance and encourage the growth and expansion of existing vegetation within through seasonal watering. The enhanced vegetation would slow winds near the ground surface and anchor soils enough to reduce dust emissions. A water line laid on top of the ground would feed three hose bibs or spigots placed to supply water to the existing vegetation at crucial seasons to enhance their growth. Water would be supplied by a water trailer, which would be parked on the existing berm
road. The water, equipment, and supplies would be provided by LADWP, and labor would be provided by a crew composed of members of the Lone Pine Paiute Shoshone Reservation who have experience
in vegetation enhancement and cultural resource monitoring.

Need for PCRTF and Governing Board Action: Under the current dust-control orders, LADWP is not authorized to conduct any work within Phase 9/10b areas. Under the 2013 Settlement Agreement, incorporated into the 2016 State Implementation Plan, the CRTF (and its successor, the PCRTF) can
make non-binding recommendations to the Governing Board regarding new treatments, and the Governing Board can then issue an order for implementation.

Agenda Item No. 6 - Attachment 1
210701 BOARD PACKET ~ Page 372 of 397

Proposed PCRTF Resolution: The Patsiata Cultural Resources Task Force (PCRTF) requests that the Governing Board for the Great Basin Unified Air Pollution Control District amend the current dust-
control orders by issuing an order to the City of Los Angeles Department of Water and Power to
implement the Vegetation Enhancement Project as shared at the PCRTF meeting held virtually on August 18, 2020. The map and description below are adapted from Jaime Valenzuela's presentation
at that meeting.

Portion of Dust Control Area Vegetation Enhancement Project
where a water line laid on top of the ground would be placed to bring water to the existing vegetation. Critical design elements: (1) ground disturbance will be avoided; (2) a 1000-foot-long water line would be laid on top of ground surface; (3) the water line
would have three hose bibs or spigots where hoses can be attached to allow a Tribal crew to water the vegetation; (4) water would be supplied by a trailer parked on the existing berm road. The Tribal crew will monitor any soil movement caused by the watering and inform the Lone Pine Paiute Shoshone Tribal Historic Preservation Officer if any artifacts or features are uncovered.

failure to comply with District Governing Board Order 210701-06, and to require LADWP's
immediate compliance.
On December 7, 2021, the District provided notice to LADWP of the requirement to implement dust control mitigation in the Sibi Patsiata-wae-tü Cultural Resource Area at Owens Lake
consistent with the Patsiata Cultural Resource Task Force Draft Amended Tribal
Recommendations (Recommendations), as required under District Governing Board Order
210701-06. In the five months since the District Board Order 210701-06 was issued, the District
has no record of any LADWP communication or efforts to move the required dust mitigation
forward. If LADWP contests this absence of communication or efforts, please provide the
District a list or records proving otherwise.
Due to LADWP's failure to make progress to comply District Governing Board Order 210701- 06, the District is issuing Notice to Comply 2001. As detailed in the Notice to Comply, LADWP
shall provide the District a written response on or before December 21, 2021, outlining
immediate corrective actions to be taken.

To support the issuance of District Governing Board Order 210701-06, significant time and efforts have gone into addressing dust mitigation for the Sibi Patsiata-wae-tü Cultural Resource Area. The Great Basin Governing Board approved the deferment of Eligible Cultural Resource

Enclosure 20220309a

Areas in Phase 7a and Phase 9/10 dust controls in the T32-2 area on December 7, 2015
(BO#151207-04) and January 11, 2018 (BO180111-04) respectively. During this period of deferment commencing over six years ago, the District and LADWP have proceeded under our obligations under the 2013 Stipulated Order of Abatement. The Patsiata Cultural Resource Task
Force, with participation of our agencies, the landowner, and Tribal entities of the Owens Valley, successfully established a T32-2 Pilot Project Subcommittee that met regularly over the course of the three-year period between 2018 - 2020 to develop a suitable treatment of dust emissions for the deferred area. As a testament of power of collaboration and cooperation, all parties jointly developed a vegetation enhancement pilot project. Over a year ago, voluntary implementation of the project was about to commence until LADWP came forward with its attempts to delay the implementation of these important measures to protect the environment, human health, and safety.
On February 22, 2021, an Action Item from our Patsiata Cultural Resource Task Force meeting was for parties of the T32-2 Pilot Project to hold a follow-up discussion to identify necessary sleps to move the project forward. At our collaborative Patsiata Cultural Resource Task Force meeting on June 9, 2021, the Palsiata Tribal Oversight Committee (PTOC) presented the Tribal Recommendations for treatment of T32-2. Qualified support of the proposed recommendation was unanimous by all parties at the meeting including LADWP. The Tribal Recommendations for treatment of the T32-2 area were drafted with goals to 1) stop emissions, 2) protect cultural resources, 3) comply with all laws and regulations, 4) avoid fines, 5) implement new cooperative practices for dust control that are less-invasive. Following the procedures outlined in the 2014 Stipulated Judgment, District Board Order 160413-01, 2013 Stipulated Abatement Order No. 130819-0, and District Board Order 130916-0, the District considered the Recommendations and
proceeded with issuance of a separate Board Order, District Board Order 210701-06, on July 1, 2021.

Immediate action is required by LADWP to comply and avoid further enforcement action. The District looks forward to assisting LADWP in resolving Notice to Comply 2001 and fulfilling the requirements of District Board Order 210701-06 to implement dust control mitigation in the Sibi
Patsiata-wae-tü Cultural Resource Area at Owens Lake.

Subject: Notice of Violation 1008 to the City of Los Angeles Department of Water and
Power

Dear Mr. Adams:

The Great Basin Unified Air Pollution Control District (District) hereby issues this Notice of Violation to the City of Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) for its failure to
comply with District Governing Board Order 210701-06, and to require LADWP's compliance.
On December 7, 2021, the District provided notice to LADWP of the requirement to implement dust control mitigation in the Sibi Patsiata-wae-tü Cultural Resource Area at Owens Lake
consistent with the Patsiata Cultural Resource Task Force Draft Amended Tribal
Recommendations, as required under District Governing Board Order 210701-06. In the following five months since the District Board Order 210701-06 was issued, LADWP failed to
properly communicate or implement the required dust mitigation measures.
On December 16, 2021, the District issued Notice to Comply 2001 (NTC) for LADWP's failure
to make progress to comply District Governing Board Order 210701-06. On December 21, 2021, LADWP responded by email. This response fails to comply with the NTC. LADWP failed to provide an outline for its immediate corrcctive actions.

The District has considered and rejects LADWP's purported arguments for its failure to comply.
As the District has repeatedly and unequivocally stated, the LADWP's duty to comply with the
law, including the District Orders and the Stipulated Judgment is not voluntary. The District has ordered LADWP to implement control measures consistent with the Draft Tribal
Recommendation and has not made its Order contingent upon final recommendations of a tribal council. The District does not and cannot delegate the LADWP's duty to comply with laws to protect public hcalth and the environment, and the District's responsibility to enforce those laws,
to any third-party. Authority to require implementation of dust control requirements resides
solely with the District.
Page of2

Enclosure 20220309b

In addition, LADWP's actions regarding this matter violate the letter and spirt of the 2014
Stipulated Judgment to; 1) prevent disputes between our agencies and 2) prevent dust control implementation delays. The District hereby provides LADWP with noticc that it is in violation of the Stipulated Judgment and subject to all remedies available to address that violation.
The District has and continues to make every effort to obtain LADWP's compliance and work
cooperatively with all parties involved to implement the required controls. The District
understands that LADWP has the resources and ability to immediately comply. The dust control measures are logical, efficient, and cost-effective. LADWP staff and the District agree on the technical solution to the problem. Yet LADWP continues its refusals to comply with the law.

Immediate action is required by LADWP to comply and avoid further enforcement action and
stipulated penalties. LADWP shall provide the District with a written outline of corrective
actions as soon as possible. The required control strategy shall be implemented within 60 days by March 8, 2022. The District looks forward to assisting LADWP in resolving Notice to Comply 2001 and Notice of Violation 1008 and fulfilling the requirements of District Board Order
210701-06 to implement dust control mitigation in the Sibi Patsiata-wae-tü Cultural Resource
Area at Owens Lake.

RE: Notice of Violation 1008 and Order to Pay to the City of Los Angeles Department of
Water and Power

Dear Mr. Adams:

The Great Basin Unified Air Pollution Control District (District) hereby issues this Order to Pay to
the City of Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (City) for its violations and failure to comply with District Governing Board Order 210701-06, and District Notice of Violation 1008.
On December 16, 2021, the District issued Notice to Comply 2001 (NTC) for the City's failure to make progress to comply District Governing Board Order 210701-06 (Enclosure 20220309a). The City provided a written response via email, dated December 21, 2021, that did not comply with the Order or provide a commitment to implement appropriate and adequate corrective actions.
On January 7, 2022, the District issued Notice of Violation 1008 (NOV) for the City's failure to take corrective actions and make progress to comply with District Governing Board Order 210701- 06 (Enclosure 20220309b). The City has failed to comply with the NOV and the Order to provide the District with a written outline of corrective actions. The City has also failed and refused to implement the required control strategy by the March 8, 2022 deadline specified in the NOV.

On March 3, 2022, the District received the City's response to the NOV (Enclosure 20220309c). The District has repeatedly addressed and refuted all of the City's purported arguments, and rejects them as meritless. The City a has a clear, straightforward legal duty to comply with the law and court orders to protect human health and the environment, including the District Orders and the
2014 Stipulated Judgment.

Page 1 of 4

Order to Pay

Due to the City's failure after its repeated opportunities to comply with its legal requirements under District Board Order 210701-06 and the Stipulated Judgment by the December 21, 2021 deadline, including dust control mitigation of vegetation enhancement in 5 acres of the Phase 7b and Phase 9/10b Sibi Patsiata-wae-tü Cultural Resource Area (0.49 square miles) at Owens Lake, the City is hereby ordered and required to pay daily stipulated penalties pursuant to the formula
provided in Paragraph 15.A. of the Stipulated Judgment.' Based on 77 days of non-compliance for the period from December 21, 2021 through NOV 1008 deadline of March 8, 2022, at a stipulated payment rate of $5,545.77 per day, this order to pay is issued to the City in the current amount of
$427,024.29.

Under paragraph 15.B. of the Stipulated Judgment, the City must pay this amount to the District within 90 days of the issuance of this notice (i.e., by June 7, 2022).
These penalties are continuing to accrue. Under the law, the City continues to be liable for daily stipulated penalties until the required control measures are successfully completed and are fully operational. However, if (a) the City submits timely payment for stipulated penalties in full as set forth above, and (b) clearly demonstrates its best efforts and due diligence to overcome the City's failure of performance of its duty to construct dust controls in the subject area, and (c) submits a compliance plan to the District for approval within 30 days (i.e., by April 8, 2022) describing the steps the City will undertake including a detailed schedule for when compliance will be achieved, the District plans to exercise its enforcement discretion and not seek future stipulated penalties for this on-going violation.

Notice of Commencement of Legal Enforcement Action

The assessment of these stipulated penalties is without limitation or waiver of the District's
authority and ability to seek additional and supplemental penalties and other remedies against the City for its violations and non-compliance. The City's refusals and failure to comply with the law, the Order and the Stipulated Judgment are knowing and intentional violations of the law. The City is also in contempt of the Stipulated Judgment. These important laws and orders are to prevent the threatened and actual injury to human health and the environment.

The City's further delay in compliance cannot be accepted. Therefore, the City is hereby provided with notice of the District's intention to commence formal legal enforcement action against the City unless the City responds to the District in writing with its clear and unconditional commitment to timely comply with the Order within 14 days of this letter (i.e., by March 23, 2022).

In addition, pursuant to Paragraph 16 of the Stipulated Judgment, we invite you and your staff to attend a telephone conference with District staff on March 15, at 3:00pm or 4:00pm, or on March 21 or 22, at 10:00am, to meet and confer in an attempt to resolve this dispute before we move to
enforce the Court's orders and Stipulated Judgment against the City.

1 Stipulated daily penalty ($/day) = $10,000 - $4500 (Ac/AR), where Ac = Dust control area required by the APCO that is completed and compliant (47.78 square miles), AR =Total dust control area required by the APCO (48.27 square miles).

Background

On August 19, 2013, the District Governing Board adopted a modified Stipulated Abatement Order (2013 SOA) where special consideration was given for cultural resource areas meeting California Register of Historic Resources eligibility. Under these provisions, 0.65 square miles of the City's Phase 9/10 Project were determined to meet Eligible Cultural Resource Area criteria (Rule 433, A.3.; Board Order 160413-01, paragraphs 2.A. and 3.A.) and determined to be mitigated on a deferred schedule due the presence of significant cultural resource areas if reordered for dust control in the future by the District Governing Board. This is in addition to 0.55 square miles of the Phase 7 project, meeting the same Eligible Cultural Resource Area criteria.
These deferred areas, known as Phase 7b and 9/10b areas, are exceptions to the District requirements for the City requiring Best Available Control Measures (BACM) by statutory deadlines (Rule 433 B.2.). Except for the Dearborn Springs and Sibi Patsiata-wae-tü Cultural Resource Area, all remaining non-reordered Cultural Resource Areas, remain in a current state of
deferral.

For the past three years, a subcommittee of the Patsiata Cultural Resource Task Force (PCRTF) has been meeting in a collaborative partnership forum consisting of local Tribes, District, the City, and the California State Lands Commission. During this time, participants of the subcommittee developed a plan and scope of work to address dust emissions from a Cultural Resource Area where controls had previously been deferred, the Sibi Patsiata-wae-tü Cultural Resource Area. The plan was designed to minimize ground disturbance and encourage the growth and expansion of existing vegetation through seasonal surface watering.
On June 9. 2021, the Patsiata Tribal Oversight Committee conveyed these plans as a Draft Amended Tribal Recommendation for Dust Control Treatment (Amended Recommendation) for
this area. Upon conclusion of this agenda item at the PCRTF meeting on June 9, 2021, stakeholders present in their capacity supported the Amended Recommendation and no opposition was expressed. Subsequently, on July 1, 2021, the District Governing Board, issued Board Order 210701-06 to the LADWP, consistent with Amended Recommendations to implement controls in
the Sibi Patsiata-wae-tü Cultural Resource Area.

These recommendations are reasonable, practical, and cost-effective. They are also the most efficient way for the City to implement air pollution controls. Implementing these controls is in the City's best interest and will avoid formal enforcement action.

Page of 4

Continuing Absence of Air Pollution Controls in the Subject Area

The District urges the City to take immediate steps to implement the necessary air pollution controls. The District is committed to working with and seeing the City achieve successful dust control mitigation in the Sibi Patsiata-wae-tü Cultural Resource Area by pursuing a different and more responsive approach.

Sincerely,

Phillip L. Kiddoo

Subject: Notice to Comply 2001 to the City of Los Angeles Department of Water and
Power

Dear Mr. Adams:

The Great Basin Unified Air Pollution Control District (District) hereby issues this Notice to Comply 2001 to the City of Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) for its failure to comply with District Governing Board Order 210701-06, and to require LADWP's immediate compliance.

On December 7, 2021, the District provided notice to LADWP of the requirement to implement
dust control mitigation in the Sibi Patsiata-wae-tü Cultural Resource Area at Owens Lake consistent with the Patsiata Cultural Resource Task Force Draft Amended Tribal
Recommendations (Recommendations), as required under District Governing Board Order 210701-06. In the five months since the District Board Order 210701-06 was issued, the District
has no record of any LADWP communication or efforts to move the required dust mitigation
forward. If LADWP contests this absence of communication or efforts, please provide the District list or records proving otherwise.
Due to LADWP's failure to make progress to comply District Governing Board Order 210701- 06, the District is issuing Notice to Comply 2001. As detailed in the Notice to Comply, LADWP
shall provide the District a written response on or before December 21, 2021, outlining
immediate corrective actions to be taken.

To support the issuance of District Governing Board Order 210701-06, significant time and efforts have gone into addressing dust mitigation for the Sibi Patsiata-wae-tü Cultural Resource Area. The Great Basin Governing Board approved the deferment of Eligible Cultural Resource

Enclosure 20220309a

Areas in Phase 7a and Phase 9/10 dust controls in the T32-2 area on December 7, 2015 (BO#151207-04) and January 11, 2018 (BO180111-04) respectively. During this period of deferment commencing over six years ago, the District and LADWP have proceeded under our obligations under the 2013 Stipulated Order of Abatement. The Patsiata Cultural Resource Task Force, with participation of our agencies, the landowner, and Tribal entities of the Owens Valley, successfully established a T32-2 Pilot Project Subcommittee that met regularly over the course of the three-year period between 2018 - 2020 to develop a suitable treatment of dust emissions for the deferred area. As a testament of power of collaboration and cooperation, all parties jointly developed a vegetation enhancement pilot project. Over a year ago, voluntary implementation of the project was about to commence until LADWP came forward with its attempts to delay the implementation of these important measures to protect the environment, human health, and safety.
On February 22, 2021, an Action Item from our Patsiata Cultural Resource Task Force meeting was for parties of the T32-2 Pilot Project to hold a follow-up discussion to identify necessary steps to move the project forward. At our collaborative Patsiata Cultural Resource Task Force meeting on June 9, 2021, the Patsiata Tribal Oversight Committee (PTOC) presented the Tribal Recommendations for treatment of T32-2. Qualified support of the proposed recommendation was unanimous by all parties at the meeting including LADWP. The Tribal Recommendations for treatment of the T32-2 area were drafted with goals to 1) stop emissions, 2) protect cultural resources, 3) comply with all laws and regulations, 4) avoid fines, 5) implement new cooperative practices for dust control that are less-invasive. Following the procedures outlined in the 2014 Stipulated Judgment, District Board Order 160413-01, 2013 Stipulated Abatement Order No. 130819-0, and District Board Order 130916-0, the District considered the Recommendations and

VIA ELECTRONIC DELIVERY AND CERTIFIED MAIL: 7018 3090 0001 0378 6902

Subject: Notice of Violation 1008 to the City of Los Angeles Department of Water and
Power

Dear Mr. Adams:

The Great Basin Unified Air Pollution Control District (District) hereby issues this Notice of Violation to the City of Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) for its failure to comply with District Governing Board Order 210701-06, and to require LADWP's compliance.
On December 7, 2021, the District provided notice to LADWP of the requirement to implement dust control mitigation in the Sibi Patsiata-wae-tü Cultural Resource Area at Owens Lake consistent with the Patsiata Cultural Resource Task Force Draft Amended Tribal Recommendations, as required under District Governing Board Order 210701-06. In the following five months since the District Board Order 210701-06 was issued, LADWP failed to properly communicate or implement the required dust mitigation measures.
On December 16, 2021, the District issued Notice to Comply 2001 (NTC) for LADWP's failure to make progress to comply District Governing Board Order 210701-06. On December 21, 2021, LADWP responded by email. This response fails to comply with the NTC. LADWP failed to provide an outline for its immediate corrective actions.
The District has considered and rejects LADWP's purported arguments for its failure to comply. As the District has repeatedly and unequivocally stated, the LADWP's duty to comply with the law, including the District Orders and the Stipulated Judgment is not voluntary. The District has ordered LADWP to implement control measures consistent with the Draft Tribal Recommendation and has not made its Order contingent upon final recommendations of a tribal council. The District does not and cannot delegate the LADWP's duty to comply with laws to protect public health and the environment, and the District's responsibility to enforce those laws, to any third-party. Authority to require implementation of dust control requirements resides solely with the District.
Page 1 of 2

Enclosure 20220309b

In addition, LADWP's actions regarding this matter violate the letter and spirt of the 2014 Stipulated Judgment to; 1) prevent disputes between our agencies and 2) prevent dust control implementation delays. The District hereby provides LADWP with notice that it is in violation
of the Stipulated Judgment and subject to all remedies available to address that violation.

The District has and continues to make every effort to obtain LADWP's compliance and work cooperatively with all parties involved to implement the required controls. The District understands that LADWP has the resources and ability to immediately comply. The dust control measures are logical, efficient, and cost-effective. LADWP staff and the District agree on the technical solution to the problem. Yet LADWP continues its refusals to comply with the law.
Immediate action is required by LADWP to comply and avoid further enforcement action and stipulated penalties. LADWP shall provide the District with a written outline of corrective
actions as soon as possible. The required control strategy shall be implemented within 60 days by March 8, 2022. The District looks forward to assisting LADWP in resolving Notice to Comply 2001 and Notice of Violation 1008 and fulfilling the requirements of District Board Order
210701-06 to implement dust control mitigation in the Sibi Patsiata-wae-tü Cultural Resource
Area at Owens Lake.

Dear Governing Board Members:
Subject: District Governing Board Order 210701-06 and its Failure to Comply With Terms of 2014 Stipulated Judgment and the 2016 State Implementation Plan
The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) is in receipt of Notice of Violation No. 1008 (NOV) issued by Great Basin Unified Air Pollution Control District (District) on January 7, 2022; District Notice to Comply No. 2001 (NTC) issued on December 16, 2021; and the email from the District's Air Pollution Control Officer (APCO) dated December 7, 2021. These recent correspondences are all premised on Governing Board Order 210701-06 (Order), issued on July 2, 2021, requiring LADWP to implement a Tribally-led1, non-BACM2, irrigation pilot project within a cultural resource site (a.k.a. Sibi Patsiata-wae-tü) of Dust Control Area (DCA) T32-2, densely covered with artifacts eligible for inclusion in the California Registry for Historical Resources (CRHR). After conducting a detailed review of the Order, and subsequent NTC and NOV, procedures employed to validate and execute the Order, and the type of dust control requested in the order, LADWP has concluded that they all expressly violate the established regulatory rules and procedures of the 2014 Stipulated Judgement (2014 SJ), 2016 State Implementation Plan (2016 SIP), and the various Board Orders referenced in the District's correspondences, and therefore, are not legally enforceable
under existing regulatory authority.
Furthermore, LADWP questions how the District determined that LADWP is in violation of any District Order when the plain language of the Order required concurrence by the five Owens Valley Tribes and such concurrence has not occurred. Also, LADWP is interested in knowing how the District harmonizes the requirements of Governing Board Order 210701-06 with the terms of the EPA-approved 2016 SIP because that document
specifically assumed the Owens Valley Planning Area (OVPA) would come into compliance with federal air quality laws without requiring dust mitigation infrastructure on areas that were previously avoided due to the presence of eligible cultural resources. It also allowed the District to issue new dust control orders to LADWP if it demonstrated

- 2. Tribally-led: Tribal members have directed the design and goals of the project. Non-BACM: A dust control measure not approved under the 2016 SIP or any other regulatory documents. Typical BACM types include Gravel, Managed Vegetation, and Shallow Flood.

those previously-avoided areas were emissive, but the District has provided no such evidence.

Finally, The Eligible Cultural Resource (ECR) site, along with several others, was avoided during construction of the Phase 9/10 Dust Mitigation Project to ensure protection of the resources and remain in avoidance as recommended by Cultural Resources Task Force (CRTF). The details of these sites are considered confidential due to the significance to local Tribes and nature of the discovery. Avoidance was conducted in accordance with the mitigation measures of the Phase 9/10 Environmental Impact Report developed under California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), and the regulatory provisions governing dust mitigation within ECR areas, as codified in the
2014 SJ, the 2016 SIP. Any subsequent orders to perform dust control in an ECR must strictly follow the established rules and procedures, as outlined in the 2016 SIP.
As discussed, the ECR areas outlined in the Order were specifically designated for avoidance and were assumed to be non-emissive by the 2016 SIP. Although LADWP demonstrated it was willing to support a Tribally-led project which applied non-BACM to an ECR areas, despite the lack of evidence that the areas were emissive, LADWP was clear that it would not participate in a project that would violate the 2016 SIP. Unfortunately, the District failed to achieve tribal concurrence for its experimental proposal, and now seeks to unlawfully compel LADWP to adhere to an Order that stands in direct conflict with the SIP, and potentially more troubling seeks to have LADWP perform a project a that was designed to be Tribally-led.
Therefore, in order to remain in compliance with the 2016 SIP and to avoid impacting sacred cultural resources without direct Tribal approval and participation, LADWP respectfully requests that Great Basin withdraw its Order and rescind its NOV.

COUNTY OF SACRAMENTO By D. Lashlev. Dopaty Clerk
DATE/TIME SEPTEMBER 27, 2022 DEPT.NO 21
JUDGE HON. SHELLEYANNE W.L. CHANG CLERK D. LASHLEY

CITY OF LOS ANGELES, a California Municipal Case No.: 34-2013-80001451
Corporation, ACTING BY AND THROUGH ITS
DEPARTMENT OF WATER AND POWER,

Petitioner and Plaintiff,

CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD;
EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE CALIFORNIA
AIR RESOURCES BOARD, in its official capacity;
GREAT BASIN UNIFIED AIR POLLUTION
CONTROL DISTRICT; and DOES 1-100,

Respondents and Defendants.

Nature of Proceedings: RULING ON SUBMITTED MATTER RE:
MOTION TO ENFORCE THE 2014 STIPULATED
I JUDGMENT

This matter came on for a hearing on the City's Motion to Enforce the 2014 Stipulated Judgment on September 2, 2022. After hearing oral argument, the Court took the matter under
submission. The Court now issues its ruling on submitted matter.

I. Factual and Procedural Background

The dispute between the parties concerns the control of air pollution from Owens Lake. Owens Lake is located in Inyo County in eastern California, south of the town of Lone Pine and north of the town of Olancha. Large portions of the Owens Lake bed are comprised primarily of
dry saline soils and crusts. The City's water diversions from the Owens Valley, including by the use of the Los Angeles Aqueduct, has exposed lake bed areas. The lake bed soils and crusts are a source of wind-borne dust during significant wind events, and contribute to elevated
concentrations of particulate matter less than 10 microns in diameter.

The Great Basin Unified Air Pollution Control District (the "District") has regulatory
authority over air quality issues in the Owens Valley Planning Area where Owens Lake is
situated, including authority to require the City to undertake reasonable measures at Owens Lake
to address the impacts of its activities that cause or contribute to violations of federal and state air quality standards.

In 2012, the City initiated this matter by filing a verified petition for writ of mandate, and while the matter was pending judgment, the parties reached a settlement and agreed to entry of a Stipulated Judgment. Pursuant to this agreement, judgment was entered for Respondent District against the City on all causes of action pending in the First Amended Petition and Complaint.

Under the terms of the Stipulated Judgment,

"By December. 31, 2017, the City shall construct a dust control project to complete the Phase 9 and Phase 10 dust controls by selecting and installing BACM on 3.62 square miles of areas identified in the 2011 SCRD and 2012 SCRD...The Phase 9/10 project shall bring the total area of the City's dust controls on the Owns Lake bed to 48.6 square miles.' Upon completion of this project, the City "shall permanently operate dust controls with approved BACM on those
areas and all other existing areas were the City has installed and operates dust controls on the driest Owens Lake bed, except as provided by a SIP for BACM testing and development."
The District's Air Pollution Control Officer may order the City on or after January 1, 2016 "to implement additional BACM contingency measure controls on up to 4.8 square miles (which need not be contiguous) of the direct Owens Lake bed ("BACM Contingency Measures"). If the City implements the entire 4.8 square miles of BACM Contingency Measure controls, there will be a total of 53.4 square miles of dust controls on the Owens Lake bed." Except for these identified areas, the District "shall not issue any further orders for mitigation measures to the City under Section 42316 or any other law…requiring the City to control windblown dust emissions…from any areas on the dried Owens Lake Bed.'
"Cultural and biological resource protection and mitigation shall be incorporated to the extent feasible as required by law into the design of dust control areas."

The 2014 Stipulated Judgment, Paragraph 15., provides for daily penalties to be
calculated for each missed deadline. These stipulated penalties apply only to the failure to meet dust control measure completion deadlines identified in the 2014 Stipulated Judgment and do not
"apply to any other notice of violation or enforcement of laws by the District."

In 2016 the District adopted a State Implementation Plan (*2016 SIP"). The purpose of the 2016 SIP is to:

provide a plan to (1) attain the National Ambient Air Quality Standard
(NAAQS) for particulate matter less than 10 microns in diameter (PM10) as required by the Clean Air Act (CAA) and its 1990 Amendments and (2)
implement the provisions of the 2014 Stipulated Judgment between the Great Basin Unified Air Pollution Control District (GBUAPCD or "District") and the
City of Los Angeles ("City") (*2014 Stipulated Judgment") which provides for the continued operation of existing dust control measures and for the implementation of additional control measures in order to attain and maintain
compliance with state and federal air quality standards (City of Los Angeles, et V al. v California Air Resources Board, Sacramento County Superior Court, Case No. 34-2013-80001451-CU-WM-GDS).

On July 21, 2021, the District adopted the 2021 Board Order entitled "Order to Implement Dust Control Mitigation in the Sibi Patsiata-wae-tü Cultural Resource Area at Owens Lake" (the "2021 Order".) The 2021 Order provides that the City is ordered to implement dust control mitigation in the subject area "consistent with the Draft Amended Tribal Recommendations for the Patsiata Cultural Resource Task Force." (Edwards Decl., Exh. F.) The Draft Amended Tribal Recommendations indicate that the task force requests the District "amend the current dust-control orders by issuing an order to the [City] to implement the [redacted] Vegetation Enhancement Project as shared at the PCRTF meeting..." The Vegetation
Enhancement Project is described as:

Portion of Dust Control Area [redacted] where a water line laid on top of the ground would be placed to bring water to the existing vegetation. Critical design elements: (1) ground disturbance will be avoided; (2) a 1000-foot-long water
line would be laid on top of ground surface; (3) the water line would have three hose bibs or spigots where hoses can be attached to allow a Tribal crew to water the vegetation; (4) water would be supplied by a trailer parked on the existing
berm road. The Tribal crew will monitor any soil movement caused by the watering and inform the Lone Pine Paiute Shoshone Tribal Historic Preservation Officer if any artifacts or features are uncovered.
The City took no action to comply with the 2021 Order.
On December 16, 2021, the District issued a Notice to Comply to the City for its failure to comply with the 2021 Order. The letter accompanying the Notice indicates that in the five months since the 2021 Order was issued; the District had "no record of any LADWP communication or efforts to move the required dust mitigation forward." The Notice directs the City to provide a written response by December 21, 2021 indicating what it would do to comply
with the 2021 Order. The Notice indicates that failure to take corrective action:

may result in further enforcement action by the District. If corrective action is
not possible by the due date, an extension or variance may be requested by
contacting the District. To appeal the issuance of this Notice to Comply, send a written appeal to the APCO within 10 days of receipt of this notice. Specify in detail why you believe these allegations are incorrect and attach a copy of the
Notice to Comply and all supporting documentation. (Edwards Decl., Exh. H.)
On January 7, 2022, the District issued a Notice of Violation to the City for its failure to comply with the 2021 Order. (Edwards Decl., Exh. I.) Pursuant to the cover letter accompanying
this notice:

The District has considered and rejects [the City's] purported arguments for its failure to comply. As the District has repeatedly and unequivocally stated, [the City's] duty to comply with the law, including the District Orders and the
Stipulated Judgment is not voluntary. The District has ordered [the City] to implement control measures consistent with the Draft Tribal Recommendation

and has not made its Order contingent upon final recommendations of a tribal council. The District does not and cannot delegate [the City's] duty to comply with laws to protect public health and the environment, and the District's responsibility to enforce those laws, to any third-party. Authority to require implementation of dust control requirements resides solely with the District.

In addition, [the City's] actions regarding this matter violate the letter and spirit of the 2014 Stipulated Judgment to; 1) prevent disputes between our agencies and 2) prevent dust control implementation delays. The District hereby provides [the City] with notice that it is in violation of the Stipulated Judgment and
subject to all remedies available to address that violation.
The Notice of Violation directed the City to comply by March 8, 2022. On March 3, 2022, the City sent a letter to the District indicating that it believed the 2021 Order, Notice to Comply and Notice of Violation violated the 2014 Stipulated Judgment, 2016 SIP and were not legally enforceable. (Edwards Decl., Exh. K.) "[I]n order to remain in compliance with the 2016 SIP and to avoid impacting sacred cultural resources without direct Tribal approval and participation, [the City] respectfully requests that [the District] withdraw its Order and rescind its NOV." (Edwards Decl., Exh. K.)

On March 9, 2022, the District issued an Order to Pay to the City. The notice stated that the City had failed to comply with its legal requirements to provide "dust control mitigation of vegetation enhancement in 5 acers of the Phase 7b 5 and Phase 9/10b Sibi Patsiata-wae-tü Cultural
Resource Area (0.49 square miles) at Owens Lake" and was ordered to pay stipulated penalties pursuant to the formula provided by Paragraph 15.A. of the 2014 Stipulated Judgment. (Edwards Decl., Exh. L.) The District calculated these penalties as beginning to accrue on December 21, 2021 through March 8, 2022 at a rate of $5,545.77 per day. The District calculated the current amount due as being $427,024.29. "Under paragraph 15.B. of the Stipulated Judgment, the City must pay this amount to the District within 90 days of the issuance of this notice (i.e., by June 7, 2022.)

On March 16, 2022, the City notified the District that it believed all five Owens Lake
Tribes must agree on mitigation measures in the subject area before any such measures could be undertaken. (Edwards Decl., Exh. M.) The City recommended the District "grant the Tribe's request to establish 'a formal consultation on dust mitigation' so that all five Owens Lake Tribes can develop *a Tribally sanctioned understanding implementing the vegetation enhancement project at Sibi Patsiata-wae-tü." The Tribe's proposed approach is the only option available for
the District to cure this major deficiency in the Board Order."
The City subsequently filed this Motion to Enforce the Stipulated Judgment. This matter was initially scheduled for a hearing on July 15, 2022, which the Court continued on its own motion to August 12, 2022. After further consideration, the Court determined further briefing was necessary, and directed the parties to respond to certain questions not addressed by the initial briefing. The parties have submitted supplemental briefs in response to those questions, which the Court has considered.

II. Discussion

The City's burden on the instant motion is to demonstrate that the District has violated a term or terms of the 2014 Stipulated Judgment. Numerous arguments are raised that go beyond the issue of whether the District is in violation of the 2014 Stipulated Judgment. The Court will
not address these arguments.'
A. Enforcement of the 2016 SIP
The City argues the Court should enforce the terms of the 2016 SIP as its terms were incorporated into the 2014 Stipulated Judgment. The City maintains the 2016 SIP is the "implementation and enforcement mechanism for the 2014 Stipulated Judgment." The City refers to statements in District Rule 433 and the 2016 SIP indicating that the purpose of those documents/regulations is to implement the Stipulated Judgment.

Respondent asserts that the terms of the 2014 Stipulated Judgment were incorporated into
the 2016 SIP, but the reverse is not true.

"A written agreement may, by reference expressly made thereto, incorporate other written agreements; and in the event such incorporation is made, the original agreement and those referred to must be considered and construed as one." (Bell Rio Grande Oil Co. (1937) 23 Cal.App.2d 436, 440.) "The phrase "incorporation by reference" is almost universally understood, both by lawyers and nonlawyers, to mean the inclusion, within a body of a document, of text which, although physically separate from the document, becomes as much a part of the document as if it had been typed in directly." (Republic Bank v. Marine Nat. Bank (1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 919, 922.)
"[W]hat is being incorporated must actually exist at the time of incorporation, so the parties can know exactly what they are incorporating." (Gilbert Street Developers, LLC v. La Quinta Homes, LLC (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 1185, 1194.) "Put another way, to have a valid incorporation by reference, the terms of the document being incorporated must be known or easily available to the contracting parties." (Ibid.; see also Kleveland v. Chicago Title Ins. Co. (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 761, 765 ["Incorporation by reference requires that (1) the reference to another document was clear and unequivocal; (2) the reference was called to the attention of the
other party, who consented to that term; and (3) the terms of the incorporated documents were
known or easily available to the contracting parties.'

The 2016 SIP was drafted after the 2014 Stipulated Judgment was entered. Thus, the 2016 SIP did not actually exist at the time of incorporation, as required for a document to be incorporated by reference. Further, the 2016 SIP is incredibly voluminous at 1,494 pages. There is no evidence before the Court that the terms of this 1,494 page document were known or easily available at the time the parties entered the 2014 Stipulated Judgment.

For example, the Court will not address any of Petitioner's CEQA compliance arguments. These arguments were not included in the original briefing and exceed the scope of the Court's order directing further briefing.

On these bases alone, the 2014 Stipulated Judgment could not incorporate by reference the 2016 SIP. Further, the 2014 Stipulated Judgment does not incorporate by reference the terms of the 2016 SIP or contain any express statement that the 2016 SIP was to be enforceable through the 2014 Stipulated Judgment.
Subsequent to the entry of the 2014 Stipulated Judgment, the 2016 SIP was created. The 2016 SIP provides that it "does not alter or supersede any provision in the Stipulated Judgment, nor does it relieve any party from full compliance with the requirements of the Stipulated Judgment." Thus, consistent with the parties' intent, the 2014 Stipulated Judgment remains a separate document with which the parties must comply, despite any contradictory language contained in the 2016 SIP. There has been ample time between the entry of the 2014 Stipulated Judgment, the drafting of the 2016 SIP, and the issuance of the 2021 Order for the parties to
amend the 2014 Stipulated Judgment to incorporate the terms of the 2016 SIP. No such amendment has occurred, despite the parties having amended the Stipulated Judgment in 2015.
Further, there is no statement in the 2016 SIP to suggest that the parties intended for it to be
enforceable through the 2014 Stipulated Judgment.

In addition to the fact that the 2014 Stipulated Judgment does not explicitly state that it is a mechanism for enforcement of the 2016 SIP. the parties do not agree that they intended the
2016 SIP to be enforceable via the 2014 Stipulated Judgment. This lack of a mutual agreement supports the Court's determination that while the parties intended to draft the 2016 SIP pursuant
to the 2014 Stipulated Judgment, they did not intend that a violation of the 2016 SIP would also
be considered to be a violation of the 2014 Stipulated Judgment. The only way to determine that a violation of the 2014 Stipulated Judgment has occurred iS to look at the language of the 2014 Stipulated Judgment itself.

B. District Rule 433

The City also argues that the 2021 Order violates the 2014 Stipulated Judgment because it directs the City to take action in contradiction of District Rule 433.

District Rule 433 was adopted on April 13, 2016. The purpose of the rule is to:

effectuate a regulatory mechanism under the federal Clean Air Act to attain the
National Ambient Air Quality Standards ("NAAQS") and to implement the
Stipulated Judgment between [the District] and [the City]...This regulation does not alter or supersede any provision in the Stipulated Judgment, nor does it relieve any party from full compliance with the requirements of the Stipulated Judgment. This regulation sets the basic requirements for the Best Available Control Measures ("BACM") and defines the areal extent of these controls at Owens Lake, California required in order to meet the NAAQS. This regulation does not preclude the City or the District from implementing more stringing or additional mitigation pursuant to the Stipulated Judgment.

6

For the same reasons identified above, the Court finds Rule 433 was not incorporated into
the 2014 Stipulated Judgment, and is therefore not enforceable through the 2014 Stipulated
Judgment.

C. The Sibi Patsiata-wae-tü area

The City argues the District is in violation of the 2014 Stipulated Judgment because the Sibi-Patsiata-wae-tü area received "deferred" designation, and the District has not followed the processes required to take the area out of "deferral." In support of this argument the City cites to the 2016 SIP and Rule 433. The Court has already determined that Rule 433 and the 2016 SIP are not enforceable through the 2014 Stipulated Judgment. Accordingly, the Court will not address these arguments further.

The City further argues the dust control measures provided by the 2021 Order cannot be
required under Health & Safety Code section 42316. The City asserts the District has failed to
provide "any monitored or modeled exceedance data demonstrating the Sibi Patsiata wae-tü ECR
area is causing or contributing to a violation of the PM10 NAAQS on the owns Lakebed. Nor has
the District provided any such data or other information indicating vegetation enhancement
measures are needed to remedy a violation of PM10 NAAQS." (MPAs, p. 14.)

In supplemental briefing, the City cites to the 2014 Stipulated Judgment as allowing in Paragraph 2.B for deferral of certain areas "determined to contain significant cultural resources" and to Paragraph 9's statement that "[c]ultural and biological resource protection and mitigation shall be incorporated to the extent feasible by law into the design of dust control areas." (Supp. Op. Br., p. 10.) The City then argues that a 2016 Board Order and the 2016 SIP have established specific processes by which the District must proceed in order to impose dust controls on deferred ERC areas.

Lastly, the City argues the 2014 Stipulated Judgment authorizes the District to order only
BACM on all Phase 9/10 ECR areas, and that while managed vegetation is BACM, the
Vegetation Enhancement Project is not BACM. (Supp. Op. Br., p. 15.)

The District argues that Paragraph 3 of the 2014 Stipulated Judgment provides for
BACM Contingency Measures, but that these measures are not applicable to the Sibi Patsiata- wae-tü area because it is part of the area addressed in Paragraph 2.B. The District argues that because this area was deferred and reordered under Paragraph 2.B, the District may select "reasonable measures" under Health and Safety Code section 42316.3
The City agrees with the District that Paragraph 3 does not apply, but argues that because the Sibi Patsiata-wae-tü area was originally part of the Phase 9/10 area before it was deferred, once it is removed from deferral the provisions of the 2014 Stipulated Judgment concerning measures applicable to the Phase 9/10 area once again apply.

2 Health and Safety Code section 42316 provides in part, "The Great Basin Air Pollution Control District may require the City of Los Angeles to undertake reasonable measures, including studies, to mitigate the air quality impacts of its activities in the production, diversion, storage, or conveyance of water..."

At the hearing on this matter, the District argued that the 2014 Stipulated Judgment
requires the parties to follow the process in the Stipulated Order of Abatement 130819-01 (*Abatement Order")' in both approving an area for deferral as well as issuing an order for dust control mitigation. Specifically, the District repeatedly referred to page 5, sections I.c., subdivisions i, and ii of the Abatement Order. Section I.c. is titled "Cultural Resource Task Force
("CRTF") and provides:

i. LADWP and District commit to form the CRTF and host its initial meeting within
ninety (90) days after the Effective Date of the Modified Order. The CRTF will be an
advisory group consisting of representatives from LADWP, the District, CSLC, State Historical Preservation Office, and Local Tribal Representatives. The CRTF may draw upon outside resources and experts, as needed, to aid the CRTF's process. LADWP shall be responsible for paying the CRTF's reasonable costs, including reimbursing CRTF members for reasonable travel expenses. The CRTF shall exist to make recommendations for the Initial Phase 7b Areas and any Additional Phase 7b Areas.
ii. The CRTF will be advisory in nature only, and the District and LADWP will
each retain its final decision-making authority as to the treatment of ECR areas.
The District reserves the right to issue a future order or orders requiring L'ADWP to install dust controls on Phase 7b areas and LADWP reserves the
right to contest any such order or orders.

(Kiddoo Decl., Exh. D.)

The District argued at the hearing that this language directs and reflects the parties' intent
at the time of drafting that when an area is no longer deferred the District has the authority pursuant to Health and Safety Code section 42316 to order the City to undertake "reasonable measures" to mitigate dust, which measures are not limited to BACM.
The District further argued that Paragraph 3.B of the 2014 Stipulated Judgment clearly denotes that an area taken out of deferral is one "re-ordered for control under Paragraph 2.B" which is consistent with the parties' intent that an area taken out of deferral does not return to Paragraph 2.A status, but becomes its own 2.B area, subject only to Health and Safety Code section 42316.:4 Paragraph 3.B provides, in part:

The Court notes that the Abatement Order was drafted before the 2014 Stipulated Order and does not refer to any of the geographic areas at issue in the 2014 Stipulated Order, but instead addresses a completely different area referred to as Phase 7. It appears the parties intended the Abatement Order's procedures to apply, while recognizing that the actual geographic locations referred to in the Abatement Order were irrelevant.
* The District also acknowledged at the hearing on this matter that its position is that the City would be unable to challenge any order issued concerning the Sibi Patsiata-wae-tül area, as the City has waived all. such rights by signing the 2014 Stipulated Order. The Court has significant concerns about this position, as it would be contrary to the public interest for a Court to determine a regulating body has unfettered authority to order a public agency to take action in a certain geographic area because the public agency has ostensibly waived all rights to argue such an order is illegal. In light of the Court's conclusion on this motion, the Court will not discuss these concerns further.

[e]xcept for the 4.8 square mile BACM Contingency Measure area and any area re-ordered for control under Paragraph 2.B of this Judgment, the District shall not issue any further orders for mitigation measures to the City under section 42316 or any other law...

The District maintains this language "re-ordered for control" refers to the process of taking an area out of deferral and issuing a new order for dust control mitigation. In all of its
briefing, the District did not include any documentation such as contemporaneous communications between the parties or a declaration by the document drafter which would support its interpretation of, or clarify the terms "re-ordered for control."
At the hearing, the City argued that Paragraph 2.B only refers to the process for deferring a particular geographic area, and does not address the District's authority once an area is removed from deferral. The City noted that the Abatement. Order does not specifically refer to any authority to order "reasonable measures" that are not BACM, and asserted that the
Abatement Order never contemplated that removing an area from deferral would give the District the authority to order dust control measures that would have been unauthorized had the
area never been deferred.

Based upon the oral arguments, it became apparent to the Court that the parties have vastly divergent interpretations of what the 2014 Stipulated Judgment directs should occur to the Sibi Patsiata wae-tü ECR area that was deferred and is now to be ordered for dust control
measures. Although the District referred the Court to the Abatement Order, it was apparent that the City did not agree that the Abatement Order granted the District the broad authority over the disputed area, and the Court agrees, as stated above. In other words, the hearing revealed that
there was no common understanding or mutual agreement as to the treatment of this area. The Court further expressed its concern that it may not be within its authority to enforce the Stipulated Judgment when the parties had no agreement and could not articulate the parties' mutual intent as to this area when they drafted the language of the Stipulated Judgment.
As to extrinsic evidence to assist the Court in its interpretation of the Stipulated Judgment, the District has attached to witness Kiddoo's declaration a letter that purports to show the City acknowledging that the District can order non-BACM on the Sibi Patsiata-wae-tü area. This letter was drafted several months after the 2014 Stipulated Judgment was entered, and is signed by the Manager of Owens Lake Planning. There is no evidence before the Court that this individual was involved in the drafting of the 2014 Stipulated Judgment, or that this individual's opinion as to the meaning of the 2014 Stipulated Judgment represents the City's official position, and is therefore, representative of the City's intent at the time of signing the 2014 Stipulated Judgment.
The Court is also aware of terms in the 2016 SIP and Rule 433 that if monitoring demonstrates BACM is needed in an ECR area, the District shall order the City to select and implement BACM control measures. While the Court has already determined these terms were not incorporated by reference into the 2014 Stipulated Judgment, the Court did consider whether these terms could be considered extrinsic evidence of the parties' intent in drafting the language of the 2014 Stipulated Judgment and therefore, aid in its interpretation. However, it remains that

the 2016 SIP was entered over a year after the 2014 Stipulated Judgment was finalized, and the
2014 Stipulated Judgment is markedly silent as to what should occur to an area once it is
removed from deferred status.

Ordinarily, the objective intent of the contracting parties is a legal question determined a solely by reference to the contract's terms. (Civ. Code, § 1639 ["[w]hen a contract is reduced to writing, the intention of the parties is to be ascertained from the writing alone, if possible. "]; Civ. Code, § 1638 [the "language of a contract is to govern its interpretation ..."].) Extrinsic evidence is admissible, however, to interpret an agreement when a material term is ambiguous. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1856, subd. (g); Pacific Gas & Electric Co v. G. W. Thomas Drayage etc. Co. (1968) 69 Cal.2d 33, 37 [if extrinsic evidence reveals that apparently clear language in the contract is, in fact, susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation, then extrinsic evidence may be used to determine the cöntracting parties' objective intent]; Los Angeles Citÿ Employees Union V. •City of El Monte (1985) 177 Cal. App. 3d 615, 622.
"The test of admissibility of extrinsic evidence to explain the meaning of a written instrument is not whether it appears to the court to be plain and unambiguous on its face, but whether the offered evidence is relevant to prove a meaning to which the language of the instrument is reasonably susceptible.' (Pacific Gas & E. Co. v. G.W. Thomas Drayage etc. Co. (1968) 69 Cal.2d 33, 37.) Thus, even considering the documents referenced above, the Court finds that 2014 Stipulated Judgment is silent as to what dust control measures the District may order when a portion of the Phase 9/10 area is deferred and then removed from deferral. As the 2014 Stipulated Judgment has no language for which the Court could utilize to interpret its "reasonably susceptible" meaning, extrinsic evidence cannot aid, as the Court cannot interpret the parties' intent when the document is absolutely silent.
"Without mutual assent, there is no [agreement]." (Merced County Sheriff's Employees' Ass'n v. County of Merced (1987) 188 Cal.App.3d 662, 670.) "There is no manifestation of
mutual assent to an exchange if the parties attach materially different meanings to their manifestations and [para. (a) neither party knows or has reason to know the meaning attached by the other; or [para. ] (b) each party knows or each party has reason to know the meaning attached by the other. Under these rules no contract is formed if neither party is at fault or if both parties are equally at fault." (Ibid.)(citations omitted.) Stated another way, if there is no meeting of the minds as to essential terms of an agreement which can be "traced to ambiguity for which neither party is to blame" then there is no enforceable agreement. (Tex-Cal Land Management, Inc. V. Agricultural Labor Relations Bd. (1982) 135 Cal.App.3d 906, 916.)

Based upon the record before it, the Court finds there was no mutual agreement as to how
a Phase 9/10 area deferred pursuant to Paragraph 2.B was to be treated once deferral is no longer necessary and the area is ready to be ordered for dust control measures. The 2014 Stipulated Judgment does not appear to the Court to directly address such a situation, and the parties' recollections and minimal evidence of their intent is so disparate the Court cannot find that they ever actually "agreed" on the treatment of this area at the time the 2014 Stipulated Judgment was entered. This ambiguity as to what should occur under these circumstances does not appear to be the "fault" of either party, but the Court cannot enforce the mutual intent of the parties through this Motion when there appears to be none.

Paragraph 18.I of the 2014 Stipulated Judgment provides a severability clause, such that if any portion of the Stipulated Judgment is "found to be invalid, void or unenforceable" such portion shall be "deemed severable from the remainder of this Stipulated Judgment and shall not invalidate the remainder" of the judgment. As such, the Court finds that the 2014 Stipulated Judgment is unenforceable as to the Sibi Patsiata-wae-tü area because of its status as an area that
was deferred pursuant to Paragraph 2.B.' The remainder of the 2014 Stipulated Judgment is not impacted by this determination, and the Court makes no findings as to the legality or enforceability of those provisions as such a determination would exceed the scope of the instant
motion.

The Court further finds that it need not address the City's arguments concerning the Order to Pay. The Order to Pay stems from the 2021 Order, which was issued pursuant to the District's purported authority under the 2014 Stipulated Judgment to order dust control measures in the Sibi Patsiata-wae-tü area. The Court has found unenforceable the 2014 Stipulated
Judgment as it applies to the Sibi Patsiata-wae-tü area given its status as an area that was deferred pursuant to Paragraph 2.B. Because the Order to Pay relies on the District's ability to seek stipulated penalties for violations of the 2014 Stipulated Judgment, the Order to Pay is now unenforceable. The Court issues no opinion as to whether the City may be subject to civil penalties pursuant to the Health and Safety Code for failing to comply with a valid order. Such a determination would exceed the limited scope of the present motion.

III. Conclusion

The motion to enforce the Stipulated Judgment is DENIED as the Court cannot enforce
portions of the Stipulated Judgment found to be unenforceable because the parties never had a mutual agreement as to the treatment of the deferred area.

DATED: September 27, 2022

In light of the Court's ruling, it does not address the City's argument that all five Owens Lake Tribes must agree on mitigation measures in the subject area before the District can Order the City to undertake any such measures.

VIA ELECTRONIC DELIVERY AND CERTIFIED MAIL: 7019 0700 0000 3251 8368

RE: Notice of Violation 1008 to the City of Los Angeles Department of Water and Power

Dear Mr. Adams:

The Great Basin Unified Air Pollution Control District (District) has reviewed the Ruling of the Sacramento Superior Court dated September 27, 2022 in this matter ("Court's Ruling").

In summary, the Court denied the City's motion under the 2014 Stipulated Judgment to seek relief or otherwise invalidate its violations and failure to comply with District Governing Board Order 210701-06 ("Order") issued to the City by the District under California Health & Safety Code
Section 42316.

The Court found that stipulated penalties under Paragraph 15 of the Stipulated Judgment were not the proper remedy, but issued no opinion as to whether the City may be subject to civil penalties under the Health and Safety Code for the City's failure to comply with a valid order, finding that such a determination exceeded the limited scope of the City's motion.
Given the Court's Ruling, the District hereby requires the City to resolve the pending Notice of Violation 1008 by providing its written unconditional commitment to comply with the Order within seven days of this letter, or by Wednesday, October 12, 2022. If the City complies, the
District will apply its enforcement discretion to stop the accrual of daily civil penalties up to the date of the Court's Ruling, totaling 280 days of violations, even though the City will not have
implemented the project. Otherwise, the District will proceed to seek a court order for injunctive relief to compel the City to comply with the Order. The District will also withdraw this offer and daily civil penalties will continue to accrue until the City implements the Order.
In addition, the District has determined that civil penalties are warranted against the City for its daily violations during this time period. Given the Court's Ruling, the District withdraws its Order
to Pay stipulated penalties under the Stipulated Judgment, and instead assesses civil penalties
against the City under the Health & Safety Code. The District offers to settle the City's liability for

Notice of Violation 1008
October 5, 2022

these civil penalties under Notice of Violation 1008, if the City agrees in writing by October 12 to pay the amount of $1,400,000. This payment is to be made within 60 days of this letter, or by December 4, 2022. Upon receipt of written unconditional commitment to comply with the Order and Settlement, the District will commit to assisting the City resolve any outstanding issues, if any, with the Timbisha Shoshone Tribe of Death Valley, Lone Pine Paiute-Shoshone Reservation, Fort
Independence Indian Community of Paiutes, Big Pine Paiute Tribe of the Owens Valley, and Bishop Paiute Tribe to implement the Vegetation Fnhancement Project. If the City does not agree to this settlement offer, the offer is deemed withdrawn and the District will proceed to seek a court
order for a larger amount of civil penalties and any other relief provided by law.

I. Background

A. The Cooperative Effort to Implement Air Pollution Controls for the Owens Lake
Bed Areas That Contain Cultural Resourees

On August 19, 2013, the District Governing Board adopted a modified Stipulated Abatement Order (2013 SOA) where special consideration was given for cultural resource areas meeting California Register of Historic Resources eligibility. Under these provisions, 0.65 square miles of the City's Phase 9/10 Project were determined to meet Eligible Cultural Resource Area criteria (Rule 433, A.3.; Board Order 160413-01, paragraphs 2.A. and 3.A.) and determined to be
mitigated on a deferred schedule due the presence of significant cultural resource areas if reordered for dust control in the future by the District Governing Board. This is in addition to 0.55 square miles of the Phase 7 project, meeting the same Eligible Cultural Resource Area criteria.
These deferred areas, known as Phase 7b and 9/10b areas, are exceptions to the District
requirements for the City requiring Best Available Control Measures by statutory deadlines (Rule
433 B.2 and B.4). Except for the Dearborn Springs and Sibi Patsiata-wae-tü Cultural Resource Area, all remaining non-reordered Cultural Resource a Areas, remain in a current state of deferral.

For over three years, a subcommittee of the Patsiata Cultural Resource Task Force (PCRTF) met in
a collaborative partnership forum consisting of local Tribes, District, the City and the California State Lands Commission. During this time, participants of the subcommittee developed a plan and a scope of work to address dust emissions from a Cultural Resource Area where controls had previously been deferred, the Sibi Patsiata-wae-tü Cultural Resource Area. The plan was designed to minimize ground disturbance and encourage the growth and expansion of existing vegetation through seasonal surface watering.

On June 9, 2021, the Patsiata Tribal Oversight Committee conveyed these vegetation enhancement plans as a Draft Amended Tribal Recommendation for Dust Control Treatment (Amended Recommendation) for this area. Upon conclusion of this agenda item at the PCRTF meeting on June 9, 2021, all stakeholders present in their capacity, unanimously supported the Amended
Recommendation.

On July 1, 2021, the District Governing Board issued Board Order 210701-06 to the LADWP as
provided by Health & Safety Code Section 42316, subdivision (a). The air pollution control measures followed the Amended Recommendations to implement controls in the Sibi Patsiata-
wae-tü Cultural Resource Area.

Notice of Violation 1008
October 5, 2022

The City refused to comply with this Board Order, even though these measures were reasonable, cost-effective and developed with the City's participation. The District finds the City's arguments for its refusal to comply lack merit. The City argued there was not unanimous consent by the tribal members for these less-intrusive control measures. The City failed to acknowledge that all tribal nations were invited to participate in the development of these control measures, and the measures were recommended by the PCRTF and ordered by the District as set forth in the 2013 SOA.
In addition, the subject control area is not on tribal nation land. It is located on land held in the public trust by the State Lands Commission, which supports the implementation of air pollution controls. The City has never explained, and later admits in its communication with the District that no single tribal nation has a veto power over an air pollution control measure to protect the health and safety of the community.
The District has reviewed the City's press releases and other statements regarding this matter, and believe they do not accurately inform the public or its Board of Commissioners regarding the true facts, that these measures were cooperatively designed to protect cultural resources with the participation of the tribal nations. LADWP can both protect the air quality, for the benefit of the entire community including the tribal communities, and at the same time protect cultural resources.
The City simply refused. The City, however, also failed to appeal the Board Order under Health & Safety Code Section 42316, subdivision (b). All of its challenges to the Order are thereby waived as a matter of law.

B. The City Repeatedly Made Knowing and Intentional Decisions to Violate the District Order in Open Violation of the Health and Safety Code
The District has repeatedly attempted to work with LADWP to assist them in complying with the District Order. The City is charged with knowledge of the law and has no discretion to disregard its requirement to comply with an Order issued under the Health & Safety Code. The City has been, and remains in continuous violation of the District Order due to its refusal to implement the controls.

On December 16, 2021, the District issued Notice to Comply 2001 (NTC) for the City's failure to make progress to comply District Governing Board Order 210701-06. The City provided a written response via email, dated December 21, 2021, that did not comply with the Order or provide a commitment to implement appropriate and adequate corrective actions. The City decided to refuse to comply with the Board Order at its own risk, where the Health & Safety Code provides that each and every day of non-compliance is a separate violation of law, and subjects the City to a civil penalty for each violation. To date, the City has decided to take no action to cease its violations.
and to thereby stop the accrual of daily civil penalties against it.

The Sacramento County Superior Court made this finding of fact, that "[t]he City took no action to
comply with the 2021 Order." (Court's Ruling at p. 3.)
After the City ignored the plain notice and warning in the NTC, on January 7, 2022, the District issued Notice of Violation 1008 (NOV) for the City's failure to take corrective actions and make progress to comply with District Governing Board Order 210701-06. The City again refused and failed to comply with the NOV and the Order to provide the a District with a written outline of
Page 3 of 7

Notice of Violation 1008
October 5, 2022

corrective actions. The City has also failed and refused to implement the required control strategy by the March 8, 2022 deadline specified in the NOV.
On March 3, 2022, the District received the City's response to the NOV, which contained arguments that the District has repeatedly addressed and refuted. The District met and conferred with the City, and again was unable to obtain its compliance with the law.
C. The Sacramento County Superior Court Issues its September 2022 Ruling Against
the City
On April 6, 2022, the City filed its motion to compel compliance with the 2014 Stipulated Judgment in the Sacramento County Superior Court to raise its arguments for judicial review. On September 27, 2022, after extensive briefing and hearing, the Court rejected the City's arguments and denied its motion. (Court's Ruling at p. 11). The Court considered and rejected most of the City's arguments, and denied its motion to enforce portions of the Stipulated Judgment as to the treatment of the deferred areas, finding that the parties never had a mutual agreement as to the
treatment of the deferred area. (Ibid.)
The Court also changed the portion of its tentative ruling that Health & Safety Code Section 42316 does not apply to the lakebed. It does, and under the final Ruling, the District retains all of its rights and abilities to enforce that section against the City, to require that it implement reasonable measures to control air pollution in the deferred areas on the lakebed.
With the denial of its motion, the City has obtained no relief from Notice of Violation 1008.
The Court also found that the stipulated penalty provisions of the 2014 Stipulated Judgment did not apply to the City's violation of the District's Order, and issued no opinion about whether the City may be subject to civil penalties pursuant to the Health & Safety Code for failing to comply with a valid order:

The Court has found unenforceable the 2014 Stipulated Judgment as it applies to the Sibi Patsiata-wae-tii area given its status as an area that was deferred pursuant to Paragraph 2.B. Because the Order to Pay relies on the District's ability to seek stipulated penalties for violations of the 2014 Stipulated Judgment, the Order to Pay is now unenforceable. The Court issues no opinion as to whether the City may be subject to civil penalties pursuant to the Health and Safety Code for failing to comply with a valid order. Such a determination would exceed the limited scope of the present motion.

Ruling at p. 13.
Accordingly, the District withdraws its Order to Pay to the City to pay stipulated penalties under the Stipulated Judgment. It instead issues this civil penalty assessment to the City under the Health & Safety Code for the City's failure to comply with a valid Order.

The District is required to enforce District orders and other requirements under California Health & Safety Code Sections 39002, 40000, 40001, 40702 and 40752. The District has the authority to resolve this violation under Health & Safety Code Sections 42402.5 and 42403(b), or to proceed with formal enforcement action against the City in the California Superior Court.
Here, the City admits, and the Court Ruling found that the District's Order was issued under Health & Safety Code Section 42316. The Court Ruling further found the City did not to comply with the Order. And the City has waived its challenges to the Order.
Under the Health & Safety Code, each day a of violation is a separate offense. (See Health & Safety Code Section 42400(e).) The City's briefing argued that the stipulated penalty previously sought by the District was too high, but that was because the City had incurred so many days of violation, a multiplied by a fixed amount of penalties that the parties had agreed to by stipulation.
The City's argument is also counterproductive where the stipulated penalty provision was
negotiated to result in lower penalties in most cases as compared to the penalties provided by the Health & Safety Code. The City has now obtained a court order to deprive it of those benefits for deferred cultural resource areas that are reordered for controls.
The days of violation continue to accrue under the Health & Safety Code's penalty provisions. The City appeared to argue that the penalty should be smaller while it continued to delay taking corrective action. The opposite is true, as the penalty grows larger while the City delays in complying with the Order.
To stop this accrual and limit the days of violation, the City must come into compliance with the Order. The City is required to provide its written unconditional commitment to comply with the Order within seven days of this letter, or by Wednesday, October 12, 2022. If the City complies (a) with its agreement, (b) by clearly demonstrating its best efforts and due diligence to overcome the City's failure of performance of its duty to construct dust controls in the subject area, and submits a compliance plan to the District for approval within 30 days, describing the steps the City will undertake including a detailed schedule for when compliance will be achieved, the District plans to exercise its enforcement discretion and not seek additional penalties for these on-going violations. The District also plans to include the tribal nations and the LADWP in future discussions regarding implementation of the plan.

B. Civil Penalty Assessment Under the Health & Safety Code
The District finds the City's refusal to comply with the Order is knowing and intentional. The District also finds the City's assertions that it was seeking to protect cultural resources to lack merit given the process of collaboration with the tribal nations to develop the plan for a less- intrusive means of pollution control in these areas. Moreover, as shown below, the Health & Safety Code includes strict liability provisions that would make the City's excuses irrelevant to a finding of its liability.

The District finds the City has violated the following four provisions of the Health & Safety Code apply to the City's violations, with the daily penalties to be increased by the inflation adjustment factor:

Notice of Violation 1008
October 5, 2022

1. Health & Safety Code Section 42402. Any person who violates air pollution laws is strictly liable for a penalty up to $5,000. Any person who violates air pollution laws is strictly liable for a penalty up to $10,000, unless the person (except at a Title V source) establishes by affirmative defense that the violation was not the result of intentional or negligent conduct.

2. Hcalth & Safcty Code Section 42402.1. Any person who negligently emits an air
contaminant in violation of air pollution laws is subject to a penalty up to $25,000.

3. Health & Safety Code Section 42402.2. Any person who knowingly emits an air contaminant in violation of air pollution laws and fails to take corrective action within a reasonable time is subject to a penalty up to $40,000.

4. Health & Safety Code Section 42402.3. Any person who willfully and intentionally emits an air contaminant in violation of air pollution laws is subject to a penalty up to $75,000.
The City has failed its repeated opportunities to comply with its legal requirements under District Board Order 210701-06. The District offers to settle the City's liability for civil penalties for $5,000 per day, or $1,400,000 for 280 days of violation (from December 21, 2021 to the Court's Ruling dated September 27, 2022). The payment shall be made within 60 days of this letter, or by December 4, 2022. This settlement offer must be unconditionally accepted by the City by October 12, 2022, or it is deemed withdrawn.
The District reserves all of its rights without limitation or waiver should the City decline to accept the settlement offer, including the application of the full time period of the City's failure to comply to calculate the number of violations and the civil penalty, and the application of the larger potential penalty amounts. The District believes the City will be unable under these facts to carry its burden to mitigate the amount of these penalties. The District retains all of its authority and ability to seek additional and supplemental penalties and other remedies against the City for its
violations.

The City's actions also violate the "grand bargain" of the 2014 Stipulated Judgement without good cause or good reason. That agreement was intended to provide finality to the dispute of the extent of controls on the Owens Lake. Paragraphs 2 and 3 of the 2014 Stipulated Judgment adopt the City' agreement to comply with District Orders to implement controls on 48.6 square miles of the lakebed, plus up to 4.8 additional square miles if needed. This total area of 53.4 square miles includes areas where controls were deferred due to the presence of cultural resources. The grand bargain is that the City thereby obtained a cap on the total area that could be ordered for controls by the District, in return for the City's agreement not to challenge those orders. (See Paragraph 3.B.) The City's actions to oppose the Order for implementation of controls on an area previously deferred but within the 53.4 square miles is in clear violation of this "grand bargain". The District attempted to work cooperatively with the City on low-impact controls in this area, which are easier and less expensive for the City to implement.
While the District is proceeding under the Health & Safety Code to enforce its Orders under Notice of Violation 1008, it reserves all of its rights to seek additional remedies for the City's violation of Paragraphs 2 and 3, including for violations of a court order and contempt of court. The City should also carefully consider the consequences of its breach of the grand bargain.

Should you wish to further discuss this matter, we invite you and your staff to attend a telephone conference with District staff on October 6, 2022, at 2 p.m. or October 11, 2022 at 11 a.m. to meet
and confer.

The District urges the City to take immediate steps to implement the necessary air pollution controls and resolve its accumulative violations of law. The District is committed to working with
and seeing the City achieve successful dust control mitigation in the Sibi Patsiata-wae-tü Cultural
Resource Area.

Sincerely.

Re: Notice of Intent to File Suit Under the California Environmental Quality Act
(CEQA) Regarding District's October 5, 2022 Action Converting its 2021 Board
Order

Dear: Mr. Kiddoo and Ms. DeHaven:

am writing on behalf of City of Los Angeles, a California Municipal Corporation, acting by
and through its Department of Water and Power ("City" or "LADWP") regarding the
District's decision/action on October 5, 2022 converting a 2021 Board Order from one issued
under the 2014 Stipulated Judgment to one issued under Health & Safety Code Section
42316.

Please take notice, pursuant to Public Resources Code ("PRC") section 21167.5, that
LADWP intends to file a Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and
Injunctive Relief ("Petition"), under the provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), PRC §21000 et seq., against Respondents and Defendants Great Basin Unified Air Pollution Control District, the Board of Directors of the Great Basin Unified Air
Pollution Control District ("Board"), and the Air Pollution Control Officer of the Great Basin Unified Air Pollution Control District (collectively the "District") in the Superior Court of Los Angeles challenging the District's Decision to convert the 2021 Board Order without complying with CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines prior to taking this action.
The Petition being filed will request the following relief related to CEQA:
Writ of Mandate, or in the alternative, Writ of Administrative Mandamus under Public Resources Code section 21168 and 21168.5 (Failure of the District to Comply With
CEQA)

As set forth in the Petition and Complaint, the District, acting as responsible agency, adopted the findings of fact and conclusions of the City's EIR for the Phase 9/10 project and

relied on these findings in approving the 2016 State Implementation Plan ("'SIP") and District
Rule 433.

Among these findings was that the adoption of the Avoidance Alternative, which would avoid any dust mitigation project on Eligible Cultural Resource ("ECR") areas, would avoid
the significant and unavoidable impacts to tribal cultural resources that would occur should the District require dust mitigation projects on ECR areas.
Public Resources Code section 21166 and Code of Regulations, Title 14, section 151621
require the District to perform an analysis of whether subsequent environmental review is required for a project after an EIR has been certified. Among the several reasons necessitating performance of subsequent environmental review is when "[s]ubstantial changes are proposed in the project which will require major revisions to the previous EIR due to the involvement of new significant environmental impacts or a substantial increase in
the severity of environmental impacts." (CEQA Guidelines, § 15162(a)(1).)

On October 5, 2022, the District took an new action to convert the 2021 Board Order from
one under the 2014 Stipulated Judgment to an order under Health and Safety Code section 42316 ("Section 42316"). The result of this new action is an order that the City construct
dust mitigation on ECR areas that the 2016 SIP and Rule 433 required to be avoided in order to avoid significant and unavoidable impacts to tribal cultural resources, is a "substantial
change" to the District's approval of the 2016 SIP and Rule 433 that will result in a
"substantial increase in the severity" of the impacts to tribal cultural resources. Specifically, the 2016 SIP and Rule 433 will move from an avoidance of impacts to tribal cultural resources to the significant and unavoidable impacts disclosed in the EIR adopted by the
District.

The District performed no analysis of the environmental impacts of the October 5, 2022
decision/action to convert the 2021 Board Order from one under the 2014 Stipulated Judgment to an order under Section 42316. The District's lack of any environmental analysis a was a violation of CEQA.
The District did not provide any notice or public review period for any analysis of the
environmental impacts of the October 5, 2022 decision/action to convert the 2021 Board Order from one under the 2014 Stipulated Judgment to an order under Section 42316. The District's failure to provide any notice or public review period for any analysis of the
environmental impacts of the October 5, 2022 decision/action to convert the 2021 Board Order from one under the 2014 Stipulated Judgment to an order under Section 42316 was a violation of CEQA.

The District did not adopt any findings concerning the District's CEQA compliance before
making the decision/taking the action on October 5, 2022 to convert the 2021 Board Order
from one under the 2014 Stipulated Judgment to an order under Section 42316. The District's failure to adopt any findings concerning the District's CEQA compliance before

Code of Regulations, title 14, section 15000 et seq., hereinafter the "CEQA Guidelines."

making the decision/taking the action on October 5, 2022 to convert the 2021 Board Order
from one under the 2014 Stipulated Judgement to an order under Section 42316 was a
violation of CEQA.

To the extent the District argues that its October 5, 2022 decision/action to convert the 2021 Board Order from one under the 2014 Stipulated Judgment to an order under Section 42316 was categorically exempt from CEQA, the exceptions to the categorical exemptions apply.
(CEQA Guidelines, § 15300.2.) Specifically, CEQA Guidelines section 15300.2, subdivision (c) prohibits reliance on a categorical exemption "where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances."
Here, the October 5, 2022 decision/action to convert the 2021 Board Order from one under
the 2014 Stipulated Judgment to an order under Section 42316 will have a significant effect
on the environment due to the unusual circumstances that the ECR areas, and specifically the Sibi Patsiata-wae-tü ECR area, contain significant tribal cultural resources that will be
impacted by the District's decision/action.
The District violated its duty to comply with CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines prior to making the decision/taking the action on October 5, 2022 to convert the 2021 Board Order
from one under the 2014 Stipulated Judgement to an order under Section 42316. As such,
this decision/action is contrary to law and constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion. Accordingly, the District's decision/action must be vacated and set aside.

Very truly yours,

Amrit S. Kulkarni
