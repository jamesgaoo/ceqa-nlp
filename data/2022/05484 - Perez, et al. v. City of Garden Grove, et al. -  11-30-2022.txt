VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 INTRODUCTION

2 1.

3 By this action, Petitioners Marlene Perez, VietRISE, Maria Guadalupe Ortiz, and

A UNITE HERE Local 11 ("Local 11") (collectively "Petitioners") challenge the unlawful actions

5 of the City of Garden Grove, City of Garden Grove as Successor Agency to the Agency for

6 Community Development and the Garden Grove Housing Authority, (collectively "City" or

7 "Respondents") in approving the B2 Site 500-room, 23-story hotel with the 600-seat Nick Studio

8 theater ("Project") at the 3.72-acre site at the northwest corner of Harbor Boulevard and Twintree

9 Avenue including 11261, 12241, 12271, 12291, 12311 and 12323 Harbor Boulevard and 12246,

10 12252, 12262, 2282, 12292, 12312, 12322, 12251, 12261, 12281, 12291, 12311 and 12321
Thackery Drive ("Site") in the City.

11 2.

12 Specifically, on September 13, 2022, the City approved the following actions

13 challenged herein for the Project: Planned Unit Development No. PUD-141-01(A) (*PUD"), Site

14 Plan Review No. SP-107-2022 ("SPR"), and Street Vacation No. SV-002-2022 ("Street

15 Vacation") (collectively "Entitlements"); Mitigated Negative Declaration (SCH No. 2022060174)

16 ("MND") under the California Environmental Quality Act Pub. Res. Code § 21000 et seq.

17 ("CEQA"); disposition or sale of City-owned land 12291 and 12311 Thackery Drive; and a

18 Disposition and Development Agreement (*DDA") for sale and development of 3.72 acres of

19 City land (collectively "Approvals") to Real Parties in Interest applicant Newage Garden Grove
II, LLC and Kam Sang Company ("Real Parties").

20 3.

21 Petitioners allege that the City abused its discretion by approving the Entitlements,

22 the MND, and the Approvals including but not limited to the sale or disposition of City-owned

23 land and the DDA. As set forth in the First Cause of Action, the City throughout the approval

24 process failed to support its CEQA analysis and land-use findings for all the Project Approvals

25. with substantial evidence. Because a MND was used for the Project's environmental review,

26 instead of a more comprehensive environmental impact report ("EIR"), the Project is subject to

27 the less deferential "fair argument" standard, which requires a lead agency to prepare an EIR

28 whenever substantial evidence in the record supports a fair argument that project may have a

-2-

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 significant effect on the environment. Pub. Res. Code §§ 21100,21151; Laurel Heights

2 Improvement Ass'n v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal. (1993) 6 Cal.4th 1112, 1123. This is a very a

3 large Project not appropriate for a MND. There is a "fair argument" here of the Project's

4 significant impacts to transportation and vehicle miles traveled ("VMT"), air quality, land use and

5 greenhouse gas emissions ("GHG") and an EIR must be prepared. Moreover, as set forth in the

6 Second Cause of Action, the Entitlements findings do not adequately characterize and address

7 inconsistencies with the City's General Plan and other applicable provisions of the Garden Grove

8 Municipal Code ("Code" or "GGMC"). By rezoning the property from R-1 to PUD, the City

9 violates various City General Plan goals, objectives, and policies, such as utilizing City land for

10 much-needed housing. All these flaws invalidate Code-required findings necessary to grant the

11 Entitlements. Finally, because the Project involved disposition of City-owned land previously

12 owned by the City Redevelopment Agency, the Third Cause of Action alleges a procedural claim
13 for "reverse validation" - an in rem proceeding under Code. Civ. Proc. §§ 860 and 863. Under

14 the validation statutes, all persons interested in those sales contracts are also parties to this case as

15 identified in the case caption.

16 JURISDICTION

17 4. This Court has jurisdiction under Pub. Res. Code §§ 21168 or 21168.5 (CEQA

18 actions), Code Civ. Proc. §§ 1085 or 1094.5 (mandamus actions), or Code Civ. Proc. § 860 et seq.

19 ("Validation" actions). The Project Site is located in the County of Orange. The within action

20 has been timely brought within 90 days of Project Approval pursuant to Gov. Code § 65009.

21 Under Pub. Res. Code § 21167, the within action has been timely brought within 30 days of the

22 (premature as discussed below) August 24, 2022 posting of a CEQA Notice of Determination

23 ("NOD") for the Project. Per Pub. Res. Code § 21167.5, Petitioners served a Notice of Intent to

2.4. File this Petition on the Clerk of the City by mail on September 21, 2022 and November 10, 2022

25 as reflected in Exhibit A hereto. Concurrent with the filing of this action, Petitioners notified the

26 Attorney General of the State of California of the filing of the action in accordance with Pub. Res.

27 Code § 21167.7.

PARTIES

2 5. Petitioners Marlene Perez and Maria Guadalupe Ortiz are resident of City, having

3 a beneficial interest and impacted by the matters set forth in this Petition. Their interests will be

4 directly affected by the Project and the City's failure to comply with the requirements of CEQA

5 and governing laws in connection with the Project. Petitioners Perez and Ortiz live nearby and

6 frequent the vicinity of the Site and will be affected by the Project's negative environmental

7 impacts including, but not limited to traffic, air quality and inconsistency with applicable land use

8 plans. Petitioners participated in the Project Approval processes by submission of written and

9 oral comments.

10 6. Petitioner VietRISE is an unincorporated community-based non-profit association

11 established in 2018 based in the heart of Orange County's Little Saigon located within

12 Respondents City of Garden Grove. Its mission is to advance social justice and build power with

13 working-class Vietnamese and immigrant communities in Orange County. VietRISE advocates

14 on issues including but not limited to accountability of elected officials, civic engagement and

15 promoting housing, particularly for working-class immigrants and refugees. It fights housing

16 displacement and works for sustainable development consistent with zoning rules to address

17 Orange County's desperate need for affordable housing. VietRISE objected to the Project in

18 writing and orally during the Project hearing. Its interests are impacted by the Project's

19 environmental impacts and the City's failure to enforce zoning laws. VietRISE and its staff reside

20 in the City, and conduct organizational activities near the Site and, thus, have a beneficial interest

21 in the matters set forth in this Petition. VietRISE has associational and public interest standing to

22 enforce applicable environmental and zoning laws. See e.g., Save the Plastic Bag Coalition v.

23 City of Manhattan Beach (2011) 52 Cal.4th 155, 166; Weiss v. City of Los Angeles (2016) 2

24 Cal.App.5th 194, 205-206.

25 7. Petitioner Unite Here Local 11 is a non-profit labor organization representing more

26 than 25,000 workers employed in hotels, restaurants, airports, sports arenas, and convention

27 centers throughout Southern California and Phoenix, Arizona. Its members, including hundreds

28 -4

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

-

2 who live or work in the City, join together to fight for improved living standards and working

3 conditions. Local 1 I's members reside near and frequently visit the vicinity of the Site and will

4 suffer from Project impacts, particularly related to inadequate housing and environmental

5 impacts, which are core issues to the members of Local 11 and therefore core areas of concern for

6 the Union. Hence, Local 11 has both public interest standing and associational standing to bring

7 this Action. Petitioner participated throughout the Project Approval processes with submission of

8 comment letters and testifying before the City. Petitioner, individually and through its members,

9 objected to the Project Approvals before the close of the Project's public hearing.

8.

10 Petitioners have exhausted all administrative remedies, the City's determinations

11 are final, and no further administrative appeals are available under State or local law. All issues

12 submitted for judicial review in this Petition were sufficiently raised and disputed with

13 Respondents before the Project was approved. Respondents were given notice and the opportunity

14 to act in compliance with CEQA and other applicable law but failed to do so. It is well-

15 established that any party who participates in the administrative process can assert all factual and

**: 16 legal issues raised by any commenting party, official or agency, See Citizens for Open

: 17 Government v. City of Lodi (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 865, 875. Hence, this Petition incorporates in

18 its entirety all factual and legal claims presented to the City during the Project Approval process,

19 whether by Petitioners, their agents, members, or any commenting party participating in the
Project's approval process.

20 9.

21 Respondent City is local governmental general law municipal corporation in
Orange County,

22 California. Its City Council acts as its Housing Authority and Successor Agency

23 to the Agency for Community Development. The City approved all the Entitlements and Project
Approvals.

24 10.

25 Real Party in Interest Newage Garden Grove II, LLC is California limited

26 liability company doing business under the laws of the State of California with its principal place

27 of business in Arcadia, CA, which is believed to be a recipient of the Project Approvals.

-.a,..o-.. s 1 11. Real Party in Interest Kam Sang Company, Inc. is a California corporation doing

2 business under the laws of the State of California with its principal place of business in Arcadia,

3 CA, which is believed to be the recipient of a Project Approvals.

4 12. The true names, capacities, corporate, associate or otherwise of Respondents and

5 Real Parties named herein as DOES through 10, inclusive, are unknown to Petitioners who,

6 therefore, sue said Respondents and Real Parties by fictitious names. Petitioners will amend this

7 Petition to show the true names and capacities when they have been ascertained.

8 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

9 13. This action, in part, is an in rem proceeding under Code. Civ. Proc. §§ 860 and 863

10 Validation statutes to invalidate certain contracts relating to the Project Approvals, including the

11 Entitlements, MND, DDA and all Project Approvals approved and/or authorized by the City on

12 September 13, 2022. In accordance with the Validation statutes, all persons interested in those

13 contracts are also parties to this case.

14 14. On July 7, 2022, the City Planning Commission conditionally approved the

15 Project's PUD, SPR and Street Vacation No. SV-002-2022 relying on the MND. The public

16 including Petitioners submitted comments raising significant environmental impacts to air quality,

17 land use, VMT/transportation and GHG emissions necessitating an EIR instead of a MND,

18 questioning the required Code findings and noting inconsistency with General Plan requirements

19 because of the rezoning the Project Site from R-1 to PUD thereby removing the ability for the

20 Site to be used for high-density residential.

21 15. On July 27, 2022, in accordance with the GGMC, Petitioners Lopez and Local 11

22 appealed the Planning Commission's conditional approval of the Entitlements (*Appeal") to the

23 City Council on grounds of noncompliance with CEQA and required Code land use findings.

24 16. On or around August 17, 2022, without any notice to Petitioners, the City

25 uploaded onto the City's website a Final MND that included an errata and response to comments

26 (*Final MND"). That Final MND was referenced for the first time in the City Council staff report

27 that was released on Friday, August 19, 2022, for the City Council's Entitlements and Appeal

28 -6-

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

hearing scheduled for Tuesday, August 23, 2022-thereby giving the public two business days to

2 review the Final MND.

3 17. In response, the public including Petitioners provided comments on August 23,

4 2022, including two expert letters highlighting the inadequacies of the Entitlements and Final

5 MND. The comments raised concerns about significant environmental impacts to air quality,

6 land use, VMT/transportation and GHG emissions necessitating an EIR instead of a MND. The

7 comments also questioned the Entitlements' land use findings for compliance with the Code, the

8 City General Plan, the Surplus Land Act and the "No Net Loss Law" for housing, Cal. Gov. Code

9 § 65863.

10 18. On August 23, 2022, just before the start of the City Council Appeal hearing, the

11 City provided a 14-page hardcopy of a new, updated Final MND that was dated that same day
12 (August 23, 2022) ("Updated Final MND"), giving the public and Petitioners effectively no time
13 to review it. Despite Petitioners' objections, the City gave Petitioners merely three minutes during
14 the meeting to respond to the Final MND and Updated Final MND. Petitioner VietRISE spoke in
15 opposition to the Project at this hearing.

SUR: 16 19. At the conclusion of the August 23, 2022 Council meeting (after minimal

17 discussion) the City denied the Appeal, contingently approved the MND and Entitlements, and

18 introduced and conducted the first reading of the PUD Ordinance confirming that under the Code

19 a second reading was required for the Project to be approved.
20 20. On August 24, 2022, a premature CEQA Notice of Determination was filed with

21 the Orange County Clerk - even though the Project and its Entitlements had yet to be finally

22 approved because the PUD was not yet final.

23 21. On September 9, 2022, the City released a staff report concerning the second
24 reading of the Project's PUD and-for the first time--new documents about the Project's DA and
25 the City land proposed for sale/disposition to the Real Parties-all of which were scheduled for

26 the Council's decision on September 13, 2022.

27

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

22. On September 13, 2022, Petitioners submitted another comment letter with

2 additional expert evidence. The letter stated that there is a fair argument of significant impacts

3 requiring preparation of an EIR. The comments also again questioned whether the sale of the

4 City parcels complied with the requirements of the Code, the Surplus Land Act, and Gov. Code con

5 65863.

6 23. On September 13, 2022, the Council finally approved the Entitlements, MND and

7 Project Approvals including the land sales.

8 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
*** 9 (Writ of Administrative Mandamus - Code Civ. Proc. § 1094.5 - CEQA Violations)

10 24. Petitioners restate and reallege Paragraphs 1-23 as if fully set forth herein.

11 25. Pursuant to Code Civ. Proc. § 1094.5, Petitioners seek a writ of mandate to

12 overturn the Project Approvals for CEQA violations including the MND's failure to adequately

13 analyze and/or mitigate impacts related to VMT/transportation, air quality, land use inconsistency

14 and GHG emissions.

15 26. A project "may" have a significant effect on the environment if there is a

16 "reasonable probability" that it will result in a significant impact. This is a "low threshold"

17 requiring the preparation of an EIR and preference for resolving doubts in favor of environmental

18 review, even if the overall effect of the project is beneficial. Meiia v. City of Los Angeles (2005)

19 130 Cal.App.4th 322, 332; CEQA Guidelines 15063(b)(1).) "[T]he existence of contrary

20 evidence does not excuse a lead agency from its duty to prepare an EIR." Pocket Protectors v.

21 City of Sacramento (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 903, 931; see also Friends of "B" Street v. City of

22 Hayward (1980) 106 Cal.App.3d 988, 1002; Sierra Club v. County of Sonoma (1992) 6
Cal.App.4th 1307, 1318 ["decision not to require an EIR can be upheld only when there is no 23

24 credible evidence to the contrary."].

25 27. Premature NOD. Here, the SPR and Street Vacation were contingent on the

26 approval of the PUD. The City's own Appeal correspondence confirms this. The PUD was not
final until the second reading on September 13, 2022. Hence, no Entitlements were final and, 27

28 -8-

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

- thus, the CEQA review was not final until September 13, 2022. The August 24, 2022 NOD was

2 prematurely filed in advance of the actual Project Approvals (i.e., second reading of PUD). (See

3 e.g., Coalition for Clean Air v. City of Visalia (2012) 209 Cal.App.4th 408, 418, 425 [a
prematurely filed notice of CEQA exemption is "invalid"]; County of Amador v. El Dorado

5 County Water Agency (1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 931, 963, fn. 16 [holding notice of CEQA

6 exemption cannot be filed until after the project is approved, a "contrary conclusion would be

7 tantamount to requiring opponents to bring challenges before a project is finally approved, lest

over 8 they be barred by the statute of limitations. It would also thwart attempts to resolve disputes

9 a project."]; San Franciscans for Reasonable Growth v. San Francisco (1984) 151 Cal.App.3d

10 61, 70 n9 [discussed in NOD context].). This premature NOD was prejudicial, and sought to

11 prematurely force legal action and close the administrative record for the CEQA compliance and

12 Updated Final MND which as a matter of law remained open until the final September 13, 2022

13 Project Approvals.
14 28. Procedural Violation of CEQA Requiring Recirculation. CEQA requires a
15 lead agency to recirculate a CEQA review when significant new information is added after the
F6 public review but before adoption of the CEQA document. Pub. Res. Code § 21092.1. New
17 information is significant if the review is changed in a way that deprives the public of a

18 meaningful opportunity to comment. CEQA Guidelines § 15088.5. Here, significant changes

19 were made. Just hours before City Council's August 23, 2022 hearing to consider the Appeal and

20 MND, the Updated Final MND was released with a brand new qualitative threshold analysis for

21 GHG emissions prepared that same day. Petitioners and public had essentially no time to review

22 the new CEQA threshold for GHGs in the Updated Final MND - even though the GHG threshold

23 issue was a central point of the Appeal and CEQA compliance. The City cannot abandon a

24 quantitative CEQA threshold for GHG emissions at the last minute the night of the Project

25 approval hearing and rely on an entirely new qualitative GHG threshold released that night

26 without recirculating the document for public review. This tactic violates CEQA whereby lead
27 agencies could rely on flawed CEQA thresholds, and after being thoroughly discredited on

28
-9.

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 Appeal, switch the thresholds out for different thresholds the very eve of the CEQA document's

2 approval----thus avoiding any meaningful public review and comment on a new different CEQA
m+ n threshold (such as the case here). This circumvents one of CEQA's main goals of informing
decision makers and the public. CEQA Guidelines § 15002(a)(1); Citizens of Goleta Valley v.
Board of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 564.

6 29. "Fair Argument" VMT/Transportation Impacts. A fair argument of

7 unmitigated VMT/transportation impacts exists. Expert evidence demonstrates, among other

8 things:

9 The Project appears overparked by as much as 18.4 percent, which is evidence that the Project

10 is not exempt from a more comprehensive VMT analysis than the one performed in the MND,

11 Final MND and Updated Final MND.

12 The new Regional Transportation Plan/Sustainable Communities Strategy ("RTP/SCS")

13 consistency analysis is inadequate given the claimed VMT reduction strategies do not mitigate the

14 Project's chief VMT inducing activities (namely the hotel/theater patrons) and also fails to utilize

15 the Site in the most efficient means a from a VMT perspective (i.e., including consideration of

16 multi-family residential use for some component of the Project).

17 The new RTP/SCS analysis in the MND fails to consider numerous project-level mitigation
......... . 18 measures discussed in the RTP/SCS Program EIR.

19 Nor does the new RTP/SCS analysis in the MND account for the workforce housing problem,

20 which indicates adding more jobs in the area will generate an average commute distance of 30.2
service population 21 VMTs per employee round trip-which exceeds the City's 22.56 VMT per
and the County's 29.01 average VMT per service population metrics that are based on the City's 22

23 analysis using the Orange County Transportation Model ("OCTAM") described in its General

24 Plan Update.

25 Nor is the proposed mitigation measure GHG-7 likely to reduce VMTs significantly, and it fails

26 to adequately implement an enforceable trip reduction program.

27

-10- 28

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 Because there is a fair argument that the Project will generate significant VMTs, additional

2 mitigation measures should be considered, like those suggested in the new guidance provided by

3 California Air Pollution Control Officers Association ("CAPCOA"), such as incorporating the

4 following:

5 i. Measure T-5 Implement Commute Trip Reduction Program (Voluntary) - up to

6 4.0% of employce VMT

7 ii. Measure T-7 Implement Commute Trip Reduction Program (Mandatory

8 Implementation and Monitoring -- up to 26.0% of employee VMT

9 ili. Measure T-8 Provide Ridesharing Program (employer subsidized) - up to 8.0% of

10 employee VMT

11 jv. Measure T-9 Implement Subsidized or Discounted Transit Program - up to 5.5%

12 of employee VMT
13 V. Measure T-12 Price Workplace Parking - up to 20.0% of employee VMT
14 vi. Measure T-13 Implement Employee Parking Cash Out - up to 12% of employee
13 VMT

h 16% 30. "Fair Argument" of Air Quality Impacts. A fair argument of unmitigated air
17 quality impacts exists. Expert evidence demonstrates, among other things, that:

18 Construction oxides of nitrogen ("NOx"), particulate matter PM2.5, and PM10 emissions are

..5al 19 likely to be significant and unmitigated.

20 The MND and Updated Final MND's mitigation measures to lessen air quality impacts

21 associated with construction are unenforceable.

22 The MND, Updated MND and Updated Final MND fail to require additional, feasible

23 mitigation for what are likely to be significant construction PM10 and PM2.5 impacts.

24 Air quality health impacts from construction activities were not analyzed in the MND and

25 Updated Final MND and are likely significant.

26 Acute health impacts of diesel particulate matter during Project construction and operation

27 were not evaluated in the MND and Updated Final MND and are likely significant.

28 -11-

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

*. 1 The MND and Updated Final MND rely on faulty parameters to model air emissions and

2 conclude that they are not significant. Expert revised modeling shows potentially significant

3 volatile organic compounds ("VOC(s)*) emissions exceeding thresholds.

4 31. "Fair Argument" of Land Use Impacts. The MND, Final MND and Updated
Final MND fail to accurately characterize and address a fair argument of land use inconsistencies

6 with the City's General Plan and other applicable land use laws. See e.g., CEQA Guidelines §

7 15125(d); Pfeiffer v. City of Sunnyvale City Council (2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 1552, 1566. There is

8 no discussion in any of the MND documents whether the Project complies with various required

9 housing rules, including whether the rezoning of the Project Site harms the City's ability to meet

10 its Regional Housing Needs Assessment ("RHNA") or complies with the "No Net Loss Law" in

11 Gov. Code § 65863 that requires adequate housing sites be maintained through the planning

12 period. Here, by rezoning the property from R-1 to PUD, the City is removing the ability for the

13 Site to be used for residential purposes. This rezoning may create a shortfall requiring corrective

14 rezoning elsewhere in the City. The abovementioned issues violate various City General Plan

15 goals, objectives, and policies, such as utilizing General Plan-designated International West

16 Mixed Use (*IW") designated properties such as the Project Site for "some higher density

17 residential that are appropriate for a major entertainment and tourism destinations." General Plan,

18 pp. 2-24 -2-25, policies LU-1.5, LU-IMP-IC, and LU-2.1. Similarly, there is no discussion how

19 this Project is consistent with the City's Housing Element, which calls for over 19,000 units

20 needed and the City to play "a key role in promoting sites for future development." Housing

21 Element, pp. 12-31, 12-116, goal H-3 and associated policies; p. 12-124 [Program 8]. Here, the

22 City permits no housing component for this Site--which is inconsistent with its General Plan

23 designation (i.e., IW) and does nothing for the City's RHNA obligations, Additionally, the

24 Project may in fact exacerbate housing shortage issues by creating more service jobs without the

25 commensurate workforce housing needed (as mentioned by VMT experts). These land use

26 inconsistencies are not properly disclosed in the MND, Final MND and Updated Final MND.

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 32. "Fair Argument" of GHG Impacts. A fair argument of unmitigated GHG

2 impacts exists. Expert evidence demonstrates, among other things:

3 The MND, Final MND and Updated Final MND utilize unsubstantiated input parameters to

4 estimate GHG emissions,

5 The MND documents fail to correctly apply Tier 4 final mitigation as indicated by the South

6 Coast Air Quality Management District ("SCAQMD").

7 The MND documents' qualitative analysis utilizes a flawed business-as-usual ("BAU")

8 methodology that is outdated, inconsistent with SCAQMD guidance, and even contrary to the

9 City's past practices. •*

10 The Project exceeds applicable SCAQMD Tier 4 thresholds showing impacts are significant

11 and requiring additional mitigation.

12 The Project is inconsistent with qualitative and quantitative measures under California Air

13 Resources Board ("CARB")'s Scoping Plan.

14 The new RTP/SCS consistency analysis in the Final Updated MND is inadequate for numerous

15° reasons, including being inconsistent with various qualitative and quantitative measures under the
1 6* RTP/SCS. Moreover, even if the Project is consistent with the RTP/SCS, which it is not, that

17 alone is not enough to meet the State's longer-term goals (i.e., 2030 and 2050 GHG reduction

18 goals).

:.4 19 Because the Project appears to have a significant GHG impacts, from a quantitative and

20 qualitative perspective, additional mitigation measures are warranted, such as those proposed in

21 the RTP/SCS.

22 33. The Project fails to incorporate and impose all feasible, performance-based

23 mitigation measures that a have a likelihood of being implemented and enforced. City of Maywood

24 V. Los Angeles Unified School Dist. (2012) 208 Cal.App.4th 362, 407 (CEQA requires lead
25 agencies to "craft mitigation measures that would satisfy enforceable performance criteria").

26 34. The Project fails to support findings and determinations with substantial evidence.

A response that "all available data" indicates sufficient groundwater supplies held insufficient where

5 the agency fails to identify said data).

6 35. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law other than the relief

7 sought in this Petition. If the City persists in its refusal to rescind the Project Approvals, and if

8 City and Real Parties are not enjoined or stayed from undertaking acts in furtherance of the

9 Project, Petitioners and the public will suffer irreparable harm from which there is no adequate

10 remedy at law in that the Project will be built in violation of CEQA, operations commence and

11 significant adverse impacts on the environment would occur, contrary to State and local law.

12 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

13 (Writ of Mandate and Administrative Mandamus Code Civ. Proc. §§ 1085, 1094.5 -

14 Violations of City Code)

15 36. Petitioners restate and reallege Paragraphs 1-35 as if fully set forth herein.
asia.- A. .. 16 37. Actions involving quasi-judicial zoning approvals, such as the case here, are

17 subject to an abuse of discretion standard, which is established when the local agency: (a) has not

18 proceeded in the manner required by law; (b) the decision is not supported by findings; and/or (c)

19 the evidence does not support the findings. Code Civ. Proc. § 1094.5.

20 38. While planning agencies enjoy some discretion interpreting their zoning laws,

21 "deference has limits" and courts are not bound by unreasonable interpretations contrary to the

22 plain language of regulations and statutes. Orange Citizens for Parks & Recreation v. Superior

23 Court (2016) 2 Cal.5th 141, 146, 156-157 (rejecting attempts to "downplay the facial
24 inconsistency," Court held city abused its discretion finding residential project consistent with

25 general plan designation where "no reasonable person could conclude that the Property could be

26 developed without a general plan amendment"); see also Stolman v. City of Los Angeles (2003)

-

2 114 Cal.App.4th 916, 928-930 (vacating variance based on zoning administrator's interpretation
contradicted by the plain language of the municipal code).

3 39. Here, the City failed to

4 support PUD and SPR Code required findings for the

5 Entitlements with substantial evidence: See Topanga Assn. for a Scenic Community v. County of

6 Los Angeles (1974) 11 Cal.3d 506, 515 (this inquiry may not be perfunctory or mechanically

7 superficial, but requires the agency to "set forth findings to bridge the analytic gap between the

8 raw evidence and ultimate decision or order"); see also West Chandler Boulevard Neighborhood

9 Assn. v. City of Los Angeles (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 1506, 1522 (city abused its discretion when it

10 "acted on evidence not in the record" where the "conclusory findings did not show how the city

11 council traveled from evidence to action"). In particular, the PUD and SPR findings do not

12 characterize and address inconsistencies with the City's General Plan and other applicable

13 provisions of the Code. There is no discussion whether the Project harms the City's ability to

14 meet its Regional RHNA or complies with the "No Net Loss Law" in Gov. Code § 65863 that
requires adequate housing sites be maintained through the planning period. By rezoning the
15% property from R-1 to PUD, the City violates various City General Plan goals, objectives, and
16% policies, such as utilizing General Plan-designated IW designated properties such as the Project

17

18 Site for "some higher density residential that are appropriate for a major entertainment and

19 tourism destinations." General Plan. pp. 2-24 - 2-25; see policies LU-1.5, LU-IMP-1C, and LU-

20 2.1. Similarly, there is no discussion how this Project is consistent with the City's Housing

21 Element, which calls for over 19,000 units needed and the City to play "a key role in promoting

22 sites for future development." (Housing Element, pp. 12-31, 12-116; see also id. goal H-3 and

23 associated policies; p. 12-124 [Program 8].) Here, the City is not considering any housing

2.4 component for this Site-which is inconsistent with its General Plan designation (i.e., IW) and

25 does nothing for the City's RHNA obligations. All these issues cut against the various Code-

26 required findings necessary to grant the PUD and SPR. (See e.g., GGMC §§ 9.32.030-D.3.b &

9.12.030.02-F.)

7 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

•4 8 (Reverse Validation Action, Writ and Declaratory and Injunctive Relief Under Mandamus

15 for the reasons set forth in this Petition/Complaint.

16 43. As required by Code Civ. Proc. § 860, this action has been filed within 60 days

17 after the City's final approval of the Project Approvals and therefore is timely. Pursuant to the

18 Validation statutes, Code Civ. Proc. § 1060, and other provisions of the law, Petitioners request

19 that each of the unlawful Project Approvals made by one of more of the Respondents be

20 invalidated; that this Court issue one or more peremptory writs of mandamus ordering the Board

21 or Agency to rescind, set aside and invalidate all or part of the unlawful Project Approvals as

22 proven at trial or hearing on this matter; and request that the Court issue a temporary restraining

Dear Hon. Mayor and City Councilmembers:
On behalf of Petitioners Garden Grove residents Marlene Perez and Maria Guadalupe Ortiz,
and UNITE HERE Local 11 ("Local 11") ("Petitioners"), this letter is provided to the CITY OF
GARDEN GROVE; CITY OF GARDEN GROVE AS SUCCESSOR AGENCY TO THE AGENCY FOR
COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT and GARDEN GROVE HOUSING AUTHORITY ("City") in accordance
with Pub. Res. Code § 21167.5.

Please take notice that pursuant to Pub. Res. Code § 21167, Petitioners will file a Petition for
Writ of Mandate ("Petition") challenging the City's approval referenced above of the B2 Site 500-
room, 23-story hotel with the 600-seat Nick Studio theater ("Project") at the 3.72-acre site at the
northwest corner of Harbor Boulevard and Twintree Avenue including 11261, 12241, 12271,
12291, 12311 and 12323 Harbor Boulevard and 12246, 12252, 12262, 2282, 12292, 12312, 12322,
12251, 12261, 12281, 12291, 12311 and 12321 Thackery Drive ("Site") in the City.

Specifically, on September 13, 2022, the City finally approved the following actions
challenged herein for the Project including but not limited to: Planned Unit Development No. PUD- 141-01(A), Site Plan Review No. SP-107-2Q2Z, and Street Vacation No. SV-002-2022 (collectively "Entitlements"); Mitigated Negative Declaration (SCH No. 2022060174) ("MND") under the
California Environmental Quality Act Pub. Res. Code § 21000 et seq. ("CEQA"); disposition or sale of City-owned land 12291 and 12311 Thackery Drive; a and a Disposition and Development Agreement ("DDA") for sale and development of 3.72 acres of City land (collectively "Approvals") to Real Parties in Interest applicant Newage Garden Grove II, LLC and Kam Sang Company ("Real Parties").

RE: B2 Hotel Project & Disposition of Public Land September 21, 2022
Page 2 of 2

Petitioners will allege that the City abused its discretion by approving all the Entitlements, the MND, and all the Project Approvals including but not limited to the sale or disposition of City-
owned land and the DDA.

In particular, the City throughout the approval process failed to support its CEQA analysis
and land-use findings for the Project Approvals as required by law. Because a MND was used for
the Project's environmental review, instead of a more comprehensive environmental impact report ("EIR"), the Project is subject to the less deferential "fair argument" standard, which requires a lead agency to prepare an EIR whenever substantial evidence in the record supports a fair argument
that a project may have a significant effect on the environment. Pub. Res. Code §§ 21100, 21151; Laurel Heights Improvement Ass'n v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal. (1993) 6 Cal.4th 1112, 1123. This is a very large Project not appropriate for a MND. There is a "fair argument" here of the Project's significant impacts to transportation and vehicle miles traveled ("VMT"), air quality, land use and greenhouse gas emissions ("GHG") and an EIR must be prepared. Moreover, the MND should have
been recirculated under CEQA when new information and GHG thresholds were added at the last
minute by the City Council. So too, the August 24, 2022 CEQA Notice of Determination filed by the City was premature and invalid because it was filed before any of the Project Approvals were final. Also, the MND lacks all feasible, appropriate and enforceable mitigation as CEQA requires.

Petitioners will seek to have the Project Approvals and CEQA environmental approvals
enjoined and set aside, along with such other relief as the Court deems proper.

Sincerely,
