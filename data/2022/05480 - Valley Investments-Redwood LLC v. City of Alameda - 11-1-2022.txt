2 Plaintiff Valley Investments - Redwood LLC, a California limited liability company doing

3 business as Barnhill Marina & Boatyard ("Plaintiff" or "Barnhill Marina") files this Complaint

4 against Defendants City of Alameda (*Defendant" or the "City"), and DOES 1-10, inclusive.
INTRODUCTION

5 1.

6 Barnhill Marina is a family-run, privately-maintained marina home to dozens of

7 floating homes and liveaboard vessels on Alameda Island. Plaintiff provides these marina residents

8 with access to the berths, other common areas and facilities, and utility connections, in exchange for a
monthly berthing fee. Each floating home or liveaboard vessel at the marina is owned by one or more
third parties, not by Plaintiff.

10 2.

11 After purchasing the marina in December 2021, Plaintiff notified all persons owning a

12 floating home or liveaboard vessel berthed at the marina that management would be increasing each

13 of their berthing fees. The notices disclosed that the planned increases were necessary for several

14 reasons, including, without limitation, that the previous owners of the marina had not acquired flood

15 insurance, had failed to make necessary repairs, had relatively lower property tax obligations due to

16 their inheriting the marina from the previous owner, and the addition of debt servicing obligations in

17 connection with Plaintiff's purchase of the marina. Even with the planned fee increases, Plaintiff

18 expected to sustain losses as a result of operating the marina, which losses Plaintiff hoped to offset in

19 the future with revenue generated from other potential improvements to the marina.
3.

20 Plaintiff met, or offered to meet, with every marina resident and committed to fairly

21 working to resolve any financial hardship issues arising from the planned fee increase set to become

22 effective as of April 1, 2022. To that end, Plaintiff informed the marina residents that they could take

23 an additional thirty days past April to pay the initial increased fee, offered to disclose relevant

24 financial information relating to the operational costs of the marina, and offered to vary the
proportion of fees borne by any financially vulnerable residents.
25 4.

26 The City, acting at the request of some of the marina residents, abruptly ended these

27 discussions by rushing to enact a series of ordinances, Ordinances 3317, 3321, and 3326, in an

28 attempt to retroactively extend the City's rent control program to the berthing fees collected by

1 Plaintiff-and only Plaintiff. All other marinas in Alameda are not required to comply with any of the

2 City's rent control requirements.

3 5. The City's knee-jerk decision to retroactively extend the City's rent control program in

4 this novel way was made without fairly conferring with Plaintiff, without studying the reasonably

5 foreseeable negative impacts such an action may have on the environment in and around the marina,

6 and with the plainly evident intent of punishing Plaintiff for increasing the berthing fees, which

7 Plaintiff conveyed all marina residents in a manner fully compliant with existing California law

8 governing floating home marinas.
9 6. The City's enactment of Ordinances 3317, 3321, and 3326 in this manner violates the
10 Contracts Clause of the United State Constitution; the U.S. Constitution's prohibitions against bills of
11 attainder and ex post facto laws; the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth
12 Amendment to the U.S. Constitution; and the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA").
13 PARTIES

14 7. Plaintiff Valley Investments - Redwood LLC is a California limited liability company
15 doing business as Barnhill Marina & Boatyard in Alameda, California. Plaintiff operates Barnhill
16 Marina, which is located on and adjacent to the waters of the San Francisco Bay on Alameda Island.
17 8. Defendant City of Alameda is a city organized and existing pursuant to the laws of the
18 State of California. The City is located primarily on Alameda Island in the County of Alameda in the
19 East Bay region of the Bay Area.

20 9. 1 Defendants DOES 1 through 10 are members, managers, partners, employees, agents,
21 joint-venturers, and/or sureties of the City. DOES 1 through 10, and each of them, acted within the
22 scope of said membership, management, partnership, employment, agency, venture, or suretyship
23 with the knowledge and consent or ratification of one or more of the other Defendants in committing
24 the acts and/or omissions alleged herein. Plaintiff is unaware of the true names and capacities of
25 DOES 1 through 10, and therefore sues said defendants under fictitious names. Plaintiff will amend

26 this Verified Complaint to allege their true names and capacities when such information has been
27 ascertained.

1 10. At all relevant times, Defendants, including the DOES through 10, were acting as the
2 partners, agents, servants, employees, alter egos, co-conspirators, successors or predecessors in

3 interest, or contractors of others of the defendants, and were acting within the course and scope of

4 such relationship, with the knowledge, express or implied, of each such other named defendants.

5 JURISDICTION & VENUE

6 11. This Court has federal subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C.
7 1331 (federal question) and 28 U.S.C § 1343 (federal civil rights), because this action arises under

8 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in relation to the City's deprivation of Plaintiff's rights protected by the U.S.
9 Constitution.

10 12. This Court has supplemental jurisdiction over the related state law claim pursuant to 28
11 U.S.C. § 1367 because that claim forms part of the same case or controversy under Article III of the
12 U.S. Constitution. Plaintiff's state law claim shares a common nucleus of operative facts with
13 Plaintiff's federal law claims. Resolving these claims in a single action serves the interests of judicial
14 economy, convenience, consistency, and fairness to the parties.
15 13. Venue is proper in, and Defendants are subject to the personal jurisdiction of, this Court
16 because the City is located in this judicia district; a substantial part of the events or omissions giving
17 rise to the claims asserted herein occurred in this district; and Barnhill Marina is physically located in
18 this district. 28 U.S.C. §§ 1391(b)(1)-(2).

19 CEQA

20 14. Regarding the related state law claim under CEQA, Plaintiff has performed any and all
21 conditions precedent to filing this action and has exhausted any and all available administrative
22 remedies to the extent reasonably possible and required by law. As discussed further below, Plaintiff
23 or others acting on Plaintiff's behalf, submitted written correspondence and verbal comments
24 objecting to the passage and adoption of the ordinances challenged herein prior to the adoption of the
25 ordinances.

26 15. On October 25, 2022, Plaintiff complied with Public Resources Code Section 21167.5
27 by emailing and mailing to the City a letter stating that Plaintiff planned to file this Verified

1 Complaint seeking to invalidate and enjoin Ordinance 3317, 3321, and 3326. A true and correct copy
2 of this letter is attached hereto as Exhibit 1.

3 16. Plaintiff will comply with Public Resources Code Section 21167.7 and Code of Civil

4 Procedure section 388 by furnishing to the Attorney General of the State of California a copy of this
5 Verified Complaint. A true and correct copy of the letter Plaintiff plans to send to the Attorney

6 General is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.

7 17. Pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.6(a), Plaintiff concurrently files

8 Plaintiff's Notice Requesting Preparation of the Record of Proceedings to inform and request that the
9 City prepare the administrative record of proceedings regarding the City's adoption of Ordinances
10 3317, 3321, and 3326, as it relates to this action.

11 18. Plaintiff has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law unless
12 this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require the City to set aside the adoption of
13 Ordinance 3317, 3321, and 3326. In the absence of such remedies, the City's approvals of its
14 extension of rent control to Barnhill Marina will remain in effect in violation of California law, and
15 Plaintiff will be irreparably harmed. No money damages or legal remedy could adequately
16 compensate Plaintiff or the public for the environmental harm risked by the City's actions.
17 19. This Verified Complaint is timely filed for purposes of CEQA pursuant to Public
18 Resources Code Section 21167(d).

19 DIVISIONAL ASSIGNMENT

20 20. Assignment of this case to the Oakland or San Francisco Divisions of this Court is
21 proper pursuant to Civil Local Rule 3-2(c), because substantially all of the events or omissions which
22 give rise to these claims occurred in the County of Alameda.
23 FACTUAL BACKGROUND

24 21. Barnhill Marina is a private marina located in the City of Alameda on the water of the
25 Oakland Estuary, which connects directly to the San Francisco Bay. The marina is located directly
26 above or adjacent to the Webster Street and Posey Tubes, which connect the cities of Oakland and
27 Alameda through underwater tunnels.

Case 4:22-cv-06509-DMR Document 1 Filed 10/25/22 Page 6 of 21

1 22. Founded in the 1960's by Audley Barnhill, the marina has grown over the years to
2 accommodate dozens of floating homes and liveaboard vessels. A floating home, unlike a houseboat

3 or liveaboard vessel, is generally not capable of self-propulsion over water and is typically

4 permanently, or semi-permanently, connected to dryland and land-based utilities.

5 23. Ownership of the marina has changed at least twice in the decades since its founding,

6 ultimately being purchased by Plaintiff in December 2021. Unfortunately, a prior owner, or all prior
7 owners, did not adequately maintain the premises or even procure flood insurance.

8 Plaintiff Purchases Barnhill Marina
9 24. In December 2021, Plaintiff purchased Barnhill Marina with the intent to rehabilitate
10 and manage the marina.
11 25. Barnhill Marina has fifty-six berths which are all occupied by floating homes and
12 vessels, some of which are liveaboards. Each of these units are owned by third parties.
13 26. Plaintiff does not own or lease any of the residential floating homes or liveaboard
14 vessels berthed at Barnhill Marina. By extension, Plaintiff does not and cannot hold open for rent or
15 lease any of the floating homes or liveaboard vessels at the marina. Some of the floating homeowners
16 may lease their floating home to third parties. Plaintiff does not monitor or arrange such relationships,
17 nor does it have the lawful ability to control or restrict the fees or rent being charged by these
18 homeowners to their respective tenants. Whether floating homeowners procure a tenant, or charge
19 that tenant any amount of rent, is outside Plaintiff's control.

20 27. While it is unknown how many homeowners lease their floating home to other third
21 parties, several homeowners at Barnhill Marina do not use their floating homes as a primary
22 residence, but instead use the home as a rental, vacation, or secondary home. The financial value of
23 each of the floating homes ranges considerably but often constitutes an asset worth several hundred
24 thousand dollars to over one million dollars.

25 Plaintiff Notifies Floating Homeowners and Liveaboards
26 of Increases to their Berthing Fees

27 28. The owners of each floating home and liveaboard vessel berthed at Barnhill Marina are

28 contractually obligated to pay Plaintiff a monthly berthing fee for their use of the berth connection

1 and other land-side common facilities or amenities provided for by Plaintiff. Since approximately
2 1991, the California Floating Home Residency Law ("FHRL"), Cal. Civ. Code § 800, et seq., has

3 governed the relationship between the owner of the marina, now Plaintiff, and the residents of the

4 floating homes berthed at the marina, including by requiring thirty days' advanced notice for
5 increasing the monthly berthing fee and sixty days' advanced notice before imposing charges for

6 services actually rendered which are not listed in the berthing agreement.

7 29. At the time of Plaintiff's purchase of the marina, the City of Alameda's rent control

8 ordinance-Municipal Code Article XV, Chapter VI ("Rent Control Ordinance")did not extend to
9 berthing fees, floating homes, or liveaboard vessels at Barnhill Marina or any other marina. There
10 were also no announcements or public records known to Plaintiff that disclosed any intention by the
11 City to expand the scope of its Rent Control Ordinance.
12 30. Beginning in January 2022, in full compliance with the FHRL, Plaintiff notified each
13 floating homeowner and liveaboard resident of the need to increase berthing fees a as a necessary step
14 to maintain the marina's solvency and functionality.
15 31. Prior to the scheduled increases, the berthing fees, which averaged $574 across all
16 floating homeowners, were approximately 29-40% of the market rate, i.e., 60-71% below market rate.
17 On information and belief, the prior owners were able to maintain below-market-rate berthing fees for
18 a variety of reasons including, without limitation, that the prior owners: did not adequately maintain
19 the premises; did not procure flood insurance; did inherit the property from the previous owner and
20 therefore enjoyed a substantially lower property tax obligation; and did not have the considerable
21 debt servicing obligations necessarily incurred by the marina in conjunction with Plaintiff's
22 acquisition of the property.
23 32. floating homes and vessels berthed at The precise fee increase varied for each of the
24 Barnhill Marina and was based on multiple factors, including the location and size of each berth. The
25 increased fee for the majority of berths ranged from 0-80% with the average increase being around
26 30%. There were outliers, including one floating homeowner who saw his berthing fee raised by
27 approximately 178%, but the resulting rate for that homeowner remained well-below market rate for

1 floating homes of a comparable nature and size. The increased berthing fees were scheduled take
2 effect on or before April 1, 2022.

3 33. To minimize the financial strain on the floating homeowners from the increased fees,

4 Plaintiff endeavored to be more than fair, including by increasing the berthing fees to a total amount

5 resulting in a net monthly loss to Plaintiff-losses that Plaintiff hoped to offset in future months and

6 years with additional revenue generating improvements to the marina. Plaintiff also extended each
7 resident's deadline to pay the initial increased fee by thirty days.

8 34. Plaintiff further offered to meet with each of the homeowners and liveaboards to

9 discuss any concerns they had regarding the fee increases, and it did so with approximately one-half
10 of the floating homeowners, along with the Alameda Floating Home Association, which represents
11 the interest of the marina residents. Plaintiff offered a variety of concessions including by offering to
12 disclose relevant financial documentation, and to modify the proportion of berthing fees to be paid for
13 by any financially vulnerable residents. Such efforts proved, at most, to be rendered ineffective by the
14 City's subsequent actions and, at worst, to be little more than a stalling tactic by certain residents
15 who, unbeknownst to Plaintiff at the time, were separately requesting that the City urgently extend
16 rent control to the marina.

17 35. Prior to April 26, 2022, Plaintiff was unaware that any of the owners of the floating
18 homes or liveaboards had requested the City to intervene and impair Plaintiff's contractual
19 relationships with the marina residents by retroactively limiting or preventing the increase in berthing
20 fees.

21 The City of Alameda Retroactively Expands Its Rent Control Ordinance
22 in an Attempt to Preclude Plaintiffs from Collecting the Increased Berthing Fees

23 36. On April 26, 2022, Plaintiff learned from a reporter that the City planned to hold a
24 Special Council Meeting on April 28, 2022, to consider the adoption of an "urgency" ordinance for
25 the purpose of extending the City's Rent Control Ordinance to "a Rental Unit lawfully docked at a
26 Marina." A true and correct copy of the ordinance resulting from the April 28 Special Council
27 Meeting, Ordinance 3317, is attached here as Exhibit 3.

Case 4:22-cv-06509-DMR Document 1 Filed 10/25/22 Page 9 of 21

1 37. According to documents obtained by Plaintiff, the City, including by and through

2 Special Counsel for the City, Michael Roush, shared a proposed version of Ordinance 3317 on or

3 around April 14, 2022, with all or several of the floating homeowners at Barnhill Marina. Plaintiff, on

4 the other hand, received no letter, notice, or request for input from the City concerning the proposed

5 ordinance or the April 28 Special Council Meeting.

6 38. With little time to act, Plaintiff, by and through its counsel, Galin Luk, contacted the

7 City by letter and email requesting to continue the April 28 Special Council Meeting by sixty days to

8 allow time for all interested parties to attempt to seek a fair resolution of the issues addressed by the
proposal in a manner that protects the relevant parties, helps maintain the equity of the floating

10 homes, continues to provide a safe marina for the floating homes to berth, and allows for the long
11 term viability of the marina. Plaintiff further offered not to charge the increased berthing fee or any
12 penalty or interest to the floating homeowners and liveaboards for the duration of the requested
13 continuation. The City refused or ignored the offer and proceeded with the April 28 meeting.
14 39. Several people attended and spoke at the April 28 Special Council Meeting. According
15 to meeting minutes, Plaintiff's counsel, Galin Luk, informed the Council that "the owners of Barnhill

16 Marina take the community concerns seriously" and that "in order to fashion an appropriate solution
17 addressing the concerns, Council must be adequately informed of many more issues and facts." Luk
18 further informed the Council, according to the meeting minutes, that "there has not been an
19 opportunity to gather facts" and "expressed concern about the ordinance[] not tailoring language and
20 the long-term viability of Barnhill Marina." Drishti Narang, a representative Plaintiff, also spoke at
21 the meeting and, according to meeting minutes, "urged Council to consider a much broader set of
22 data before making a decision; discussed running a sustainable operation; expressed concern over the
23 future of floating home marinas in Alameda; [and] stated that the matter is a one-sided presentation of
24 facts."

25 40. The City's mayor, Ezzy Ashcraft, according to meeting minutes, "expressed support for
26 passing the emergency ordinance.; stated that she has heard many alarming accounts from residents
27 of Barnhill Marina...[and] the owner's background does not excuse the kind of behavior experienced
28 by the residents of Barnhill Marina."

MICHAEL YAMAMOTO LUP Case No. 4:22-cv-6509

Case 4:22-cv-06509-DMR Document 1 Filed 10/25/22 Page 10 of 21

1 41. The Mayor also inquired of the City Attorney whether the proposed ordinance could be
2 applied retroactively to the date the ordinance was purportedly first published on April 14, 2022, or

3 even further to April 1, 2022. On information and belief, the Mayor sought to ensure Plaintiff's

4 notices that the berthing fees would be increased effective April 1, 2022, would be rendered

5 ineffective. According to meeting minutes, the Mayor indicated that "she expects the owners of

6 Barnhill Marina to challenge the ordinance in court" and inquired of the City Attorney the safest

7 course of action with respect to the ordinance's retroactivity.

8 42. Ultimately, the City structured Ordinance 3317 in such a way as to appear to apply
retroactively only to April 14, 2022 (the purported date of first publication of the proposed
10 ordinance). In effect, however, the ordinance retroactively extends rent control to Barnhill Marina as
11 of April 1, 2022, or earlier. It does so by altering the proposed retroactivity provision, Section 2(E) of
12 Ordinance 3317, to state that "no person who imposes rent for a Rental Unit shall increase the rent
13 that was in effect on April 14, 2022," but then defining "rent that was in effect on April 14, 2022" to
14 mean "rent that had been paid on or before April 14, 2022 but not rent to be paid their after."
15 (emphasis added). In other words, Ordinance 3317 applies retroactively to the date of the most recent
16 payment made by each floating homeowner or liveaboard on or before April 14, 2022, not to any
17 specific, uniform date.

18 43. According to the public records made available by the City online, Ordinance 3317's
19 unique definition of "rent that was in effect on April 14, 2022" was not included in the draft
20 ordinances prepared by the City leading up to the April 28 Special Counsel Meeting.
21 44. On May 17, 2022, the City's Council approved and adopted Ordinance 3321, which the
22 City deemed to be "Final Passage of Ordinance Introduction of Uncodified Ordinance Concerning
23 Rent Control and Limitations on Evictions Applicable to Maritime Residential Tenancies including
24 Floating Homes." A true and correct copy of Ordinance 3321 is attached here as Exhibit 4. While
25 Ordinances 3317 and 3321 differ in terms of informational recitals that introduce each ordinance, the
26 substantive portions of the ordinances are identical or substantially identical.
27 45. At or around the time Ordinance 3321 was adopted, the Mayor instructed the City staff
28 to notify all marina owners of the City's separate and then on-going discussions with landlords

1 concerning amendments to the City's Capital Improvement Plan (CIP") as it relates to the City's

2 Rent Control Ordinance. Despite this instruction, the City did not notify or include Plaintiff in those
3 discussions--excluding Plaintiff for a second time from the political process.

4 Facing Criticism from Other Alameda Marinas, the City Adopts Ordinance 3326 to Ensure that
5 the City's Rent Control Extends Only to Barnhill Marina

6 46. In June 2022, the City informed all Alameda marina owners (including Plaintiff) of

7 their new obligation to register for the City's rent control program as to all floating homes and

8 liveaboard vessels docked at their marinas, pursuant to Ordinances 3317 and 3321. Confused, several
9 marina owners contested the Ordinances' applicability to their marinas, arguing that Ordinances 3317
10 and 3321 extend rent control to "floating homes," such as those berthed at Barnhill Marina, not to the

11 "liveaboard" vessels docked in significant numbers at each of the Alameda marinas, including
12 Barnhill.

13 47. In the face of the marinas' opposition, the City adopted Ordinance 3326 on September
14 6, 2022, for the purpose of carving out all marinas other than Barnhill Marina from the City's rent
15 control expansion. A true and correct copy of Ordinance 3326 is attached here as Exhibit 5.
16 48. As summarized by the City's September 1, 2022 letter to Barnhill Marina, the purpose
17 of Ordinance 3326 is to "limit[] the application of the City's Rent Control Ordinance to floating
18 homes and to maritime residential tenancies at floating home marinas" (emphasis added). In other

19 words, the City intends for its rent control expansion to apply to both floating homes and liveaboards

20 berthed at Barnhill Marina, but not to extend these same protections to the other so-called
21 "recreational" marinas in the City, even though those marinas also have a number of liveaboards
22 berthed there.

23 49. The result of this entirely new and arbitrary distinction is that Barnhill Marina is the
24 only marina in Alameda that the City expects to comply with rent control obligations for liveaboards,
25 and since Barnhill Marina is also the only marina with floating homes, it is the only marina subject to

1 exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. These justifications are clearly pretextual. Indeed, no

2 floating home resident has been evicted from an Alameda marina in this century, nor was there any

3 evidence of a threatened eviction at Barnhill Marina or any other marina. The individuals benefiting

4 from the a Ordinances also own a significant asset worth hundreds of thousands of dollars that is

5 financially out of reach for most renters: i.e., a floating home or liveaboard vessel.

6 51. The City's actual and apparent desire in adopting Ordinances 3317, 3321, and 3326 was

7 to retroactively nullify Barnhill Marina's berthing fee increases and to prospectively restrict any

8 additional increases.

9 52. Ordinances 3317, 3321, and 3326 substantially impair previously existing contractual
10 obligations of the homeowners and liveaboards at Barnhill Marina to pay Plaintiff the increased

11 berthing fees, as noticed, which were set to become effective no later than April 1, 2022.

12 53. The City adopted Ordinances 3317, 3321, and 3326, retroactively expanding rent
13 control to Barnhill Marina, and only Barnhill Marina, for the purpose of punishing Plaintiff for

14 increasing its berthing fees to amounts the City evidently finds disagreeable. It carried out that

15 punishment without judicial trial or even providing minimal notice to Plaintiff of its intent to do so.

16 54. With respect to the California Environmental Quality Act, Ordinances 3317, 3321, and
17 3326 state that they are "exempt from review .. under CEQA Guidelines Section 15378 (not a

18 project) and 15601(b)(3) (no significant environmental impact)."

19 55. The City did not, on information and belief, submit any notices of exemption from
20 CEQA to the California Office of Planning and Research or the City or County Clerk with respect to
21 Ordinances 3317, 3321, or 3326. Despite Plaintiff's reasonable efforts, including by informing the
22 City of Plaintiff's position, the City has made no claim that it has done so.

23 56. If the floating homeowners and liveaboards at Barnhill Marina continue to fail to pay
24 their berthing fees as duly noticed by Plaintiff pursuant to FHRL, the likely eventual-if not rapidly
25 approaching--result will be the bankruptcy and permanent closure of the marina, displacing all of the
26 people the City's recent Ordinances seek to protect.

CAUSES OF ACTION
N FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
Violation of Contracts Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, § 10, cl. 1

4 (42 U.S.C. § 1983)
By Plaintiff Against All Defendants

5 57.

6 58. Plaintiff incorporates by reference all the above allegations as if fully set forth herein.
Ordinances 3317, 3321, and 3326 constitute official acts taken by the City and
7 approved by City Council under color of state law. See Monell v. Dep't of Soc. Servs., 436 U.S. 658,
8 690 (1978).
59.

10 The Contracts Clause of the Constitution of the United States, U.S. Const. art. I, § 10,
cl. 1, prohibits or restricts the City from legislatively relieving particular persons of preexisting
11 | contractual obligations.
12 60.

13 Upon purchasing the marina in December 2021, Plaintiff and the third-party residents
of the floating homes and liveaboards berthed at the marina entered into binding contractual
14 agreements, whether written or oral, express or implied by conduct, obligating those homeowners and
15 liveaboards to pay a monthly berthing fee which, under state law, can only be raised following
16| advanced notice by Plaintiff.
17 61.

18 In accordance with those contractual obligations, and in compliance with state law,

19 Plaintiff notified the marina residents of the increase in berthing fees for each residential floating home

20 and liveaboard berthed at Barnhill Marina, which increases were to become effective on April 1, 2022.
62.

21 Ordinances 3317, 3321, and 3326, collectively and separately, impermissibly impair

22 these contractual obligations in violation of the Contracts Clause. The City's actions are neither
reasonable, nor necessary to serve any legitimate public purpose, but are instead intended to advantage
23 particular individuals residing at Barnhill Marina by relieving them of their contractual burdens.
24 63. As a direct and proximate result of the City's conduct, Plaintiff has suffered irreparable
25 harm, including the violation of its constitutional right to be free from the City's substantial
26

27 impairment of its preexisting contractual arrangements, entitling Plaintiff to declaratory and injunctive
relief.

1 64. Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, Plaintiff seeks injunctive and declaratory relief enjoining
2 the City from enforcing Ordinances 3317, 3321, and/or 3326 and declaring the same as violating the
3 Contracts Clause of the U.S. Constitution.

5 rights under the law. Plaintiff is therefore entitled to an award of attorneys' fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C.

9 (42 U.S.C. 8 1983)

10 By Plaintiff Against All Defendants

11 66. Plaintiff incorporates by reference all the above allegations as if fully set forth herein.

12 67. Ordinances 3317, 3321, and 3326 constitute official acts taken by the City and

13 approved by City Council under color of state law. See Monell v. Dep't of Soc. Servs., 436 U.S. 658,

14 690 (1978).

15 68. The Constitution of the United States, U.S. Const. art. I, § 10, cl. 1, prohibits the

16 legislative enactment of a bill of attainder or ex post facto law. "A bill of attainder is a legislative act

17 which inflicts punishment without a judicial trial ....[L ]egislative acts, no matter what their form, that

18 apply either to named individuals or to easily ascertainable members of a group in such a way as to

19 inflict punishment on them without a judicial trial are bills of attainder prohibited by the Constitution."

20 United States v. Lovett, 328 U.S. 303, 315 (1946). "The Ex Post Facto Clause protects liberty by

21 | preventing governments from enacting statutes with 'manifestly unjust and oppressive' retroactive

22 effects. In such a case, the government refuses 'to play by its own rules.' It has deprived the

23 defendant of the 'fair warning,' (citation) that might have led him to preserve exculpatory evidence."

24 Stronger v. California, 539 U.S. 607, 611 (2003).

25 69. Ordinances 3317, 3321, and 3326 constitute bills of attainder and ex post facto laws

26 because the City enacted these ordinances to retroactively inflict punishment on Plaintiff, without

27 judicial trial, by retroactively nullifying or attempting to nullify Plaintiff's increase of its berthing fees

28 to amounts the City evidently finds disagreeable.

2 harm, including the violation of its constitutional right to be free from the enactment of a bill of

3 attainder or ex post facto law, entitling Plaintiff to declaratory and injunctive relief.

4 71. Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, Plaintiff seeks temporary, preliminary, and permanent
5 injunctive relief enjoining the City from enforcing Ordinances 3317, 3321, and/or 3326; and a judicial
6 declaration that the Ordinances violate the U.S. Constitution's prohibition against the enactment of
7 bills of attainder and ex post facto laws.

11 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

12 Violation of Equal Protection, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1 (42 U.S.C. § 1983)
13 By Plaintiff Against All Defendants

14 73. Plaintiff incorporates by reference all the above allegations as if fully set forth herein.
15 74. Ordinances 3317, 3321, and 3326 constitute official acts taken by the City and
16 approved by City Council under color of state law. See Monell v. Dep of Soc. Servs., 436 U.S. 658,
17 690 (1978).
18 75. The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment secures every person within

19 its jurisdiction against intentional and arbitrary discrimination from state actors, whether occasioned
20| by express terms of a statute or ordinance or by its improper execution through duly constituted
21 agents.
22 76. Generally, equal protection is based upon protected classes of person who are similarly
23 situated; however, individuals who suffer irrational and intentional discrimination or animus can bring
24 claims of equal protection where the government is subjecting only the plaintiff to differing and
25 unique treatment compared to others who are similarly situated, Engquist v. Ore. Dept. of Agric., 553
26 U.S. 591 (2008), even if not based on group characteristics, Village of Willowbrook v. Olech, 528 U.S.

1 77. The City discriminated against Plaintiff in a manner that is intentional, arbitrary, and
2 capricious by enacting Ordinances 3317, 3321, and 3326 and extending rent control solely to the
3 floating homes and liveaboards berthed at Barnhill Marina. It did so without any rational basis for
4 believing that the Ordinances would advance a legitimate public purpose, and its actions reveal plainly
5 that the City was motivated by "bare desire to harm a politically unpopular group." U.S. Dep't of
6 Agric v. Moreno, 413 U.S. 528, 534 (1973).

7 78. As a direct and proximate result of the City's conduct, Plaintiff has suffered irreparable
8 harm, including the violation of its constitutional right to equal protection under the law, entitling
9 Plaintiff to declaratory and injunctive relief.
10 79. Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, Plaintiff seeks temporary, preliminary, and permanent
11 injunctive relief enjoining the City from enforcing Ordinances 3317, 3321, and/or 3326; and a judicial
12 declaration that the Ordinances violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to
13 the U.S. Constitution.

14 80. Plaintiff found it necessary to engage the services of private counsel to vindicate its
15 rights under the law. Plaintiff is therefore entitled to an award of attorneys' fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C.
16 § 1988.

17 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

18 Violation of Due Process, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1 (42 U.S.C. § 1983)
19 By Plaintiff Against All Defendants

20 81. Plaintiff incorporates by reference all the above allegations as if fully set forth herein.

24 83. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution
25 guarantees property owners due process of law when the government interferes with property owners'
26 property interests. Due process includes providing reasonable notice and meaningful opportunity to

27 be heard to present a defense. Government regulation, including rent control measures, that deprives a

3 see also Crown Point Dev., Inc. V. City of Sun Valley, 506 F.3d 851, 856 (2007).

4 84. The City intentionally, willfully, capriciously, arbitrarily, and in conscious disregard to
5 Plaintiff's due process rights provided Plaintiff with no reasonable notice or meaningful opportunity to
6 be heard prior to its extending rent control to Barnhill Marina.

7 85. The City arbitrarily and unreasonably passed and adopted Ordinances 3317, 3321, and

8 3326 with no substantial relation to the public health, safety, or general welfare.
9 86. Ordinances 3317, 3321, and 3326 deprive Plaintiff of the ability to obtain a fair rate of
10 |return on its property interest.
11 87. Plaintiff is informed and believes that the acts of the City, its employees and agents,
12 were intentional in failing to protect and preserve Plaintiff's property interests and that, at minimum,
13 the City was deliberately indifferent to the likelihood that Plaintiff would lose their ability to obtain a
14 fair return without due process based on the past occurrences of these same constitutional and statutory
15 violations of the law.

16 88. The City effectively seized and destroyed Plaintiff's property without due process,
17  lawful justification, or just compensation.

18 89. As a direct and proximate consequence of the acts of the City, Plaintiff has suffered and
19 continues to suffer loss to its property interests and due process rights.

21 injunctive relief enjoining the City from enforcing Ordinances 3317, 3321, and/or 3326; and a judicial
22 declaration that the Ordinances violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the

Hd FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

2 Petition for Writ of Mandate

3 92. By Plaintiff Against All Defendants

4 93. Plaintiff incorporates by reference all the above allegations as if fully set forth herein.

5 CEQA requires public agencies to conduct environmental review prior to the time the

6 agency approves any project that may have a significant impact on the environment unless the project
is exempt from CEQA. Pub. Res. Code §§ 21002.1, 21061, 21100, 21151. If a reasonable argument is
7 made to suggest a possibility that a project will cause a significant environmental impact, the agency
8 must refute that claim to a certainty before finding the exemption applies. Berkeley Hillside
9 Preservation v. City of Berkeley, 60 Cal. 4th 1086, 1127 (2015).
10 94.

11 Under CEQA, the term "project" has a broad definition and means "an activity which
may cause either a direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect
12 physical change in the environment, and which is . [a]n activity directly undertaken by any public
13 agency. Cal. Pub. Resources Code § 21065. "[P]roject" means the "whole of an action, which has a
14| potential for resulting in either a direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably
15 foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment." Cal. Code Regs. Tit. 14 § 15378.
16 95. "Approval" of a project, for purposes of CEQA, means a decision by the agency "which
17 commits the agency to a definite course of action in regard to a project intended to be carried out by
18 any person." Id. § 15352(a). Public agencies may not approve projects as proposed if there are feasible
19 mitigation measures or alternatives that would substantially lessen the significant environmental
20

21 effects of those projects. Pub. Resources Code § 21002. Public agencies are thus required to mitigate

22 or avoid the significant environmental effects of projects they approve whenever it is feasible to do so.
Cal. Pub. Resources Code § 21002.1(b).
23 96. The City prejudicially abused its discretion by finding and determining that the
24 adoption of Ordinances 3317, 3321, and 3326 was

25 by substantial evidence. exempt from CEQA, which finding is unsupported

26 97.

27 Ordinances 3317, 3321, and 3326 are "projects" in that extending rent control to
Barnhill Marina is an activity with the potential for resulting in either direct or reasonably foreseeable
28 indirect physical change in the environment.

] 98. Ordinances 3317, 3321, and 3326 have a reasonable possibility of a significant
2 environmental effect and there cannot be any certainty that such ordinances have no possibility of
3 having a significant environmental impact.

4 99. As a result, the City failed to disclose or evaluate the potentially significant
5 environmental effects of their actions and further failed to consider mitigation measures and
6 alternatives that could lessen or avoid those impacts prior to approving the ordinances.

7 100. Plaintiff seeks a declaration that the City's action in passing and adopting Ordinances
8 3317, 3321, and 3326 is CEQA and an injunction setting aside Ordinances 3317, 3321, and 3326 until

Re: Notification of CEQA Lawsuit re: Ordinances 3317, 3321, 3326 Valley Investments Redwood LLC dba Barnhill Marina & Boatyard v.
City of Alameda, et al.

To Whom it May Concern:
Please be on notice that Valley Investments - Redwood LLC dba Barnhill Marina & Boatyard (hereafter, "Petitioner"), will file suit against the City of Alameda (the "City") for violating California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code Section 21000 et seq., the CEQA Guidelines, and California Code of Regulations Section 15000 et seq. by erroneously determining that the City's Ordinances 3317, 3321, and 3326 are not "projects" and have no possibility for causing a significant effect on the environment, approving the ordinances, and adopting the same. The suit will be filed in the United States District Court, Northern District of California. This notice is given pursuant to Public Resources Code Section 21167.5.

Petitioner will also seek an award of attorneys' fees under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5. This letter is to provide notice of the same pursuant to Graham v.
DaimlerChrysler Corp. (2004) 34 Cal.4th 553, 577.

Petitioner recognizes the public interest would be best served if the City of Alameda were to voluntarily comply with its statutory duties, but as of October 19, 2022, the City of Alameda communicated to this office its refusal to do so. If the City of Alameda has changed its position and is interested in resolving this matter short of litigation, please contact the undersigned immediately.
