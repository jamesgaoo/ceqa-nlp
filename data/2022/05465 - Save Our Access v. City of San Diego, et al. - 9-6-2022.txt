Save Our Access v. City of San Diego
Writ Petition Page

INTRODUCTION

2 1. This action challenges the approvals by Respondent City of San Diego ("City" or
3 "Respondent") of a ballot measure to amend People's Ordinance 0-10960 and Municipal Code Section
4 132.0505 to exclude the Midway-Pacific Highway Community Plan Area from Coastal Zone Height
5 Limits ("Project" or "Ordinance"), and the related failure to comply with the California Environmental
6 Quality Act ("CEQA"), Pub. Res. Code ยง 21000, et seq.

7 2. Among other things, the City failed to consider the environmental impacts associated with

8 the Project, failed to prepare and circulate required environmental analysis, failed to consider feasible
9 alternatives and mitigation, and illegally segmented project review.
10 3. Among other things, Petitioner seeks alternative and peremptory writs of mandate declaring
11 the City's approvals invalid, and enjoining the City from taking steps to implement the approvals.
12 PARTIES

13 4. Petitioner Save Our Access is non-profit corporation that seeks to support the quality of
14 life in Southern California by advocating for public access to beaches, parks, water, and public land
15 and for creating more parkland. Petitioner and its members have been injured as a result of Respondent's
16 actions. Petitioner and Petitioner's members use, enjoy and benefit from the resources affected by
17 Respondent's actions. Respondent's actions adversely affect the recreational, aesthetic, environmental
18 and economic interests of Petitioner. The interests of Petitioner have been and will continue to be

19 adversely affected by Respondent's unlawful actions in violation of CEQA. The relief sought in this
20 Petition would redress Petitioner's injuries.

21 5. Respondent City of San Diego is a political subdivision of the State of California and a body
22 corporate and politic exercising local government powers, as specified by the Constitution and the laws of

23 the State of California.

24 6. Petitioner does not know the true names or capacities of the persons Or entities sued herein as

25 Does through 5, and therefore sue these respondents by such fictitious names. Petitioner will amend the

26 Petition to set forth the names and capacities of said respondents along with appropriate charging
27 allegations when the same have been ascertained.

1 7. Real Party in Interest City of San Diego Council District 6 is the Project applicant and
2 recipient of Project approval.

3 8. Petitioner does not know the true names or capacities of the persons or entities sued herein as
4 Does 6 through 10, and therefore sue these real parties in interest by such fictitious names. Petitioner will
amend the Petition to set forth the names and capacities of said real parties in interest along with
6 appropriate charging allegations when the same have been ascertained.

7 PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND HISTORY
9. In 1972 City of San Diego voters passed Proposition D, a citizens' initiative that amended
9 the San Diego Municipal Code to impose a 30-foot limit on the height of buildings in the City's
10 Coastal Zone, as defined by Proposition D. Among other things, this Coastal Zone Height Limit
11 applies to the approximately 1,324 acres of land surrounding Midway Drive and Sports Arena
12 Boulevard in the City of San Diego, known as the Midway-Pacific Highway Community Plan area.
13 10. In 2020, the City promoted the consideration of Ordinance No. 0-21220, which was to be
14 submitted to the voters of the City of San Diego to ask them to amend the Coastal Zone Height Limit

15 to remove the height limit for the entirety of the Midway-Pacific Highway Community Plan area. The
16 City claimed it need not prepare environmental review, reasoning "the proposed amendments are

17 consistent with the Midway-Pacific Highway Community Plan Update Final Program Environmental

18 Impact Report (PEIR) ... and would not result in new significant impacts." Petitioner and others

19 objected, noting that the PEIR did not consider or address the removal of the Coastal Zone Height

20 Limit or any of its potential impacts.

21 11. On July 24, 2020, the San Diego City Council approved Ordinance No. 0-21220.

22 12. A Notice of Determination was filed by the City on July 31, 2020.

23 13. On August 28, 2020, Petitioner timely filed a lawsuit challenging the City's approval, San

24 Diego Superior Court Case No. 37-2020-00030308.

25 14. On December 10, 2021, the Honorable Judge Katherine Bacal of the San Diego Superior

26 Court issued a ruling, determining that "a tiered EIR should have been prepared to consider the impact of

27 the Ordinance on the environment."

28

Save Our Access v. City of San Diego Page 3
Writ Petition

1 15. On or about April 22, 2022, the City issued notice of the availability of a draft

2 Supplemental EIR regarding a second attempt to amend the Coastal Zone Height Limit and remove its
application from the Midway-Pacific Highway Community Plan area. Petitioner and several others
submitted comments on the draft SEIR, noting that with the exception of visual effects and impacts to

5 neighborhood character, the City was still violating CEQA in claiming the PEIR had adequately

6 considered and addressed the Project.

7 16. In a July 25, 2022, letter to the City Council, Petitioner noted that this was directly in
violation of CEQA requirements and the Court's order, which specifically provided: "Petitioner also

9 asserts additional significant environmental impacts may occur. MPA at 8 (citing potential other
10 significant environmental impacts to traffic/transportation, air quality, water quality, housing, greenhouse
11 gas emissions). Because an environmental review of the impacts of removing the height limit is directed
12 for the reasons noted above, it is anticipated such environmental review will analyze the potential other
13 impacts associated with the Ordinance." Petitioner noted that the entire point of the Court's order and
14 Petitioner's many prior comments was that the PEIR did not address the proposed removal of the Coastal
15 Height Limit.

16 17. On July 26, 2022, the City Council met to consider placing a second measure on the ballot
17 to remove the Coastal Zone Height Limit from the Midway-Pacific Highway Community Plan area.
18 Petitioner and others spoke in opposition. The City Council voted to approve placing the Measure on
19 the November 2022 ballot, and the approval of Supplemental Environmental Impact Report ("SEIR"),
20 including approval of R-314246, O-21508, and R-314247.

21 18. A Notice of Determination was filed on August 1, 2022.
22 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

23 AND INADEQUATE REMEDIES AT LAW

24 19. Petitioner has exhausted all available administrative remedies, and objections to the Project
25 have been presented orally and in writing to the City, as required by Public Resources Code Section
26 21177. These include, but are not limited to, letters and oral comments presented during public
27 hearings.

28

Save Our Access v. City of San Diego Page 4 Writ Petition

1 20. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code Section 21167.5
2 by mailing a written notice of commencement of this action to the City. A true and correct copy of
3 that notice is attached hereto as Exhibit

4 21. Petitioner has advised the City that Petitioner has elected to prepare the record of
5 proceedings relevant to the approval of the Project, pursuant to Public Resources Code Section
6 21167.6. A true and correct copy of that notice is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.
7 22. Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code Section 21 167.7 by filing a copy of
8 the original petition with the California Attorney General. A true and correct copy of the notification
9 is attached hereto as Exhibit 3,

10 23. Petitioner has no adequate remedy at law unless the Court grants the requested writ of
11 mandate requiring the City to set aside its approval of the Project. In the absence of such remedy, the
12 City's approvals will remain in effect in violation of State law, and Petitioner will suffer irreparable
13 harm because of the significant adverse environmental impacts generated by the Project.
