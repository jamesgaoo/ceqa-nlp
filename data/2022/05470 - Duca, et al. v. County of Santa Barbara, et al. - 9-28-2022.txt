FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

INTRODUCTION 1
Live Oak Trail ("Trail") is located on the north side of Lake Cachuma. From the 2 1.

3 Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors' formal adoption of the Trail in 1988 until early

4 2021, the Trail was the only publicly accessible trail in Santa Barbara County ("the County") that

5 was limited to equestrian trail riding only. Hikers/trail runners and bikers were prohibited.

6 Petitioners Suzanne Duca, Amalia Coffey, and Dale Obern Hoeffliger (collectively "Petitioners"

7 or "Plaintiffs") are equestrians who have used the Live Oak Trail ("Trail") for horseback riding

8 and wish to continue to use the trail for that purpose without their safety being compromised by

9 the addition of new non-equestrian uses.

for Trail usage that required that the Trail access gates be kept locked at all times, that users County adopted the

16

17 register with the Lake Cachuma main gate and pay a permit fee before entering the Trail. The

18 County also made the decision not to advertise the Trail in order to limit its use to local

19 equestrians. The Trail Study stated that bald eagles generally are less disturbed by horseback

The Trail is located on land owned and operated by the U.S. Department of the riders than by people on foot.

South Santa Barbara County and much of the Santa Ynez Valley.

4. Commencing in or about January 2012, the Bureau leased the portion of the
Bureau land through which the Trail passes to private livestock grazing operators who have run 24

25

26

27 cattle and horses on the land ever since. The grazing operators were largely responsible for

28 maintaining roads and fencing on this land.

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 5. In January 1953, the Bureau leased to the County all of the land around Lake

2 Cachuma, including the area through which the Trail passes, so that the County would operate

3 and manage activities and resources on the land. subject to the grazing operations. The County's

4 lease expired, and the parties entered into a similar lease in January 2012.

5 6. In May 2010, the Federal Bureau of Reclamation adopted a programmatic

6 Environmental Impact Statement ("EIS") for the Cachuma Resource Management Plan

7 (*CRMP") applicable to all of the Bureau's land surrounding Lake Cachuma, including the Trail.

8 The EIS required that the Bureau and the County acting as the Bureau's Management Partner: (a)

l ensure that all actions in the plan area be consistent with the CRMP; and, (b) restrict access to
dTI'NOHXHOS NHGMVA LIVAI 10 areas with endangered or sensitive species; and, (c) adopt a Trail System Management Plan as the

11 primary mitigation measure for all Trail usage; and, (d) require site-specific environmental

IE SÃOuIONV arbara, EHIES 13 actions that would result in environmental impacts beyond the programmatic analysis in the EIS.
14 7. The CRMP includes the following:
82.4.2.2 -- It should be noted that the local managing partner (Parks) will be BROWNSTEIN 15

16 required to conduct an appropriate site-specific environmental review for most of

17 the new or expanded recreational activities identified in the RMP such as new day
use.....at Live Oak. 18

19
82.5.3 -- Off highway motor vehicles & downhill biking will continue to be 20
prohibited under all alternatives.

83.9.2.3 - No horseback riding allowed on 5 acknowledged trails because "One 22
23 trail is open on the north shore to equestrian use only."

5 trails. P

2 8. In May 2011, the Bureau published a Record of Decision, announcing the

3 Bureau's decision to adopt and implement Alternative 2 (from the EIS) as the CRMP. The

4 Record of Decision includes the following Bureau response to a comment in the EIS that

5 expressed concern about the impacts of all recreational activities in and around Lake Cachuma on

6 bald eagle nesting, breeding, feeding and roosting: "The FEIS [Final Environmental Impact

7 Statement] analysis of impacts from potential management actions is programmatic ... and

8 therefore any future actions that would result in new facilities, ground disturbances or

9 environmental impacts beyond the programmatic analysis would be subject to subsequent

10 environmental review and special-status species consultation as appropriate. ... This ROD

11 makes clear the intention to prepare site-specific analysis for actions required to implement

3 1001d pUz '199J15 deouy 1701 MBT12 sXouJoy LLP MOIAHOS HNHAVI LLVAE BROWNSTELL 10156 1 In January 2012, the Bureau and the County entered into a long-term lease, entitled *gIBQAT 13 9.

Santa 14 "Administration, Operation, Maintenance, and Development of Recreation at Lake Cachuma,"

15 and referred to as the Management Plan, allowing the County to manage the land, subject to

16 limitations, including the following: "If, however, the Managing Partner [County] seeks to

17 enhance recreational opportunities at Cachuma Lake or develop any Recreational Facilities, or

18 implement recreational uses, these shall only occur: 31) in accordance with the Plan [CRMP],

19 and 2) after the completion of any necessary environmental review required by NEPA and

staff denies that records of 20 CEQA." The Management Agreement also requires that the County provide an annual report

21 regarding recreation related uses and/or resource s uses, yet County

22 Trail usage are unavailable, except for the limited period of July 2020 through December 2020.

23 Exhibit B to the Management Agreement prohibits modification of the environment without the

24 Bureau's prior written approval. Exhibit B also requires that the County comply with all laws,

25 State and Federal, regarding pollution of streams, reservoirs, ground water, and water courses and

26 that the Epdangered Species Act "will be given full consideration in all activities." A true and

27 correct copy of the Management Plan is attached hereto as Exhibit 1 and incorporated hereby.

28 10. At an unknown date, the County created an undated document, prepared without

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

- public notice, hearing, or input, entitled "Live Oak Trails, Trail Management Shared-Use Access

2 Plan" ("Shared-Use Plan"), a true and correct copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 2 and

3 incorporated hereby. The Shared-Use Plan fails to comply with the CRMP and the EIS. The

4 stated goals of the Shared-Use Plan include the primary goal of considering and pursuing all

5 allowable activities specified in the CRMP, a balancing of natural resource protection and

6 recreational opportunities, ensuring a safer trail network, receiving input from the equestrian

7 community that have utilized this public land for over 30 years, improving County Parks

8 communication with the public and revisiting the registration process. The public had no

9 opportunity to review and provide input regarding the development of the Shared-Use Plan

11

Mel I7 SÃouiony dIT'NOAHHOS MMHXVA LIVAH NIISNMONH 10 because the County prepared and began implementation of the Shared-Use Plan without prior
public notice, or consultation opportunity with the equestrian community, or public hearing. The 021 Anacapa 10aJ1S 1001: puz 101E6 VO  mEqHE vuvS 12 Shared-Use Plan's sole reference to environmental review for the change of Trail use is to the

13 Bureau's 11-year old EIS, which clearly states that the Bureau and its managing partner, the

14 County, must ensure that all actions in the Plan Area are consistent with the CRMP, must conduct

15 site-specific environmental review for most new or expanded recreational activities identified in

16 the CRMP, and must meet CEQA and NEPA requirements, including Section 2.5.2 of the EIS.

17 which states that existing levels of trail use on south and north shores of Lake Cachuma will be

18 maintained and access to areas with endangered or sensitive species will be restricted.

19 11. The Shared-Use Plan violates the County General Plan Conservation Element,

20 which states that: (a) activities should not be permitted [near facilities like Lake Cachuma that

21 provide significant surface water supplies] if they would significantly degrade water quality.
22 Light recreation is permissible if sanitary pollution is permitted and erosion is not increased from
23 the increased number of people using the area; and, (b) to preserve bald eagle population, portions

24 of the lake must be left undisturbed on the North shore and the East side of Lake Cachuma: and.

25 (c) horseback riding results in less disturbance than people on foot.

26 12. The County and Bureau prohibit swimming and other direct bodily contact in Lake
27 Cachuma and in the waterways that feed the lake. The Management Plan fails to address the

28 potential threat to the public water supply resulting from trail runners/hikers having direct and

5
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 unsupervised access to the Santa Ynez River and Lake Cachuma via the Live Oak Trail. For

2 example, there is a Santa Ynez River crossing with a large, deep, and inviting pool of water close

3 to the Trail entrance - just the kind of pool that would attract pedestrians and picnickers who

4 won't have to walk very far to reach it. Anyone who has seen the evolution of another such Santa

5 Y nez River crossing, called Red Rock, from a remote, quiet, and clean a pool of refreshing water

6 into a virtual cesspool with beer bottles, soiled disposable baby diapers, trash, and similar

7 conditions will find it easy to envision a similar fate for the pool near the Trail unsanitary

8 entrance as a result of the County's decision to open and advertise the Trail to all comers. The

9 supervision of Live Oak Trail has changed significantly. In lieu of a locked gate and the in-

10 person registration system historically required of equestrians to gain access to Live Oak Trail,

11 the County now leaves the gate open from 8:00 a.m. to one hour before sunset every day and has

open to 100ld put 1021 Anacapa Street, ATT'MOTHHOS NUHAVI LIVAH BROWNSTEIN 12 implemented an honor system that allows a user to take a parking permit without even paying the METI8 SÁauIONY J 101£6 VD '212qJV8 13 $10.00 permit fee. Access to the lake and river water supplies from the Trail is now wide

14 anyone who comes through the open gate -with or without paying the modest daily fee. This

15 alone is a significant environmental impact on health and safety, as well as sensitive species and

16 habitat.

17 13. In November 1990, the County Board of Supervisors adopted Resolution No. 90-

18 757, establishing the County Riding and Hiking Trails Advisory Committee ("CRAHTAC"). The
Resolution provides, inter alia, that, when County department considers activities that may 19

20 affect County trails, equestrian facilities, and bikeways, etc., the Department first shall inform

21 CRAHTAC and CRAHTAC shall deliberate on such matters and decide on a recommendation to
the appropriate County official. A true and correct copy of Resolution No. 90-757 is attached as 22

23 Exhibit 4 and incorporated hereby. The CRAHTAC is subject to the noticing and public

24 participation imposed by the Brown Act, also known as the Public Meeting Act.

25 14. On January 12, 2021, the Santa Barbara Community Services Department

26 "Community Services") executed a Notice of Exemption ("NOE"). A true and correct copy of

27 the NOE is attached hereto as Exhibit 3 and incorporated hereby. The NOE was not posted on the

28 County website, on the Clerk of the Board's website, on the Community Services website, or on

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 the State Clearinghouse website. On January 12, 2021 and for several months following, due to

2 policies enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Santa Barbara County administrative

3 building was locked and not open for general public access. A guard at the building entrance

4 allowed for limited access to the administrative building for limited purposes, such as payment of

5 property taxes. The County website failed to provide to the general public notice that CEQA

6 notices, ordinarily accessible at the Office of the Clerk of the Board, were available for inspection

7 anywhere other than the Clerk of the Board's office. Instead, the Clerk of the Board's website

8 merely stated that the office was closed to the public. Community Services made no effort to

9 reach out to inform the equestrian community about an intended change in use of the Live Oak
dTI'HOTAHOS HASaVA HYATT NIJISNMONS 10 Trail and the creation and posting of the NOE.

11 15. The County also failed to comply with the requirements for alternative notice of

12 the NOE, included in the California Governor's Executive Order N-54-20, which provides that,
: sKauJouy 021 Anacapa Street, 1001d puz Santa Barbara, C 13 in lieu of the usual public posting and filing of materials concerning the project, the lead agency

14 shall do ALL of the following:

15 a) Post such materials on the relevant agency's or applicant's public-facing website

16 for the same period of time that physical posting would otherwise be required.

17 b) Submit all materials electronically to the State Clearinghouse CEQAnet Web

18 Portal; and

19 c) Engage in outreach to any individuals or entities known by the lead agency,
20 responsible agency, or project applicant to be parties interested in the project in the

21 manner contemplated by the Public Resources Code section 21100 et seq. and California
22 Code of Regulations, Title 14, sections 15000 et seq.

23 16. The NOE states that the purpose of the Live Oak Trails Multi-Use Program,

24 identified in the PROJECT TITLE portion of the NOE. was to "allow hikers and mountain bikers

25 on these roads and trails, in addition to equestrians (multi-use)," and concludes, without any

26 additional environmental review, that "the proposed Live Oak Trails Multi-Use Program does not
27 involve an expansion of use under the reasonably same parameters that currently exist, therefore,

28 change in signage indicating this usage is exempt from CEQA." But the identified project is not

7
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

- installation of signage; it is a significant change in the historical use of the Trail from equestrian

2 only to a multi-use trail open to trail runners/hikers and, mountain bikers - all of which will

3 greatly increase the number of Trail users.

4 17. This change in use from low-key equestrian use by the local horse community,

5 closely regulated by Parks staff. to freely allowing trail runners/hikers and mountain bikers to use

6 the Trail without close supervision, not only is directly contrary to the adopted CRMP, but will

7 result in potentially significant impacts on the safety of equestrians and their horses - and of

8 members of the public who will be interacting with range cattle significant impacts upon

9 grazing livestock, and impacts on sensitive species; habitat, and cultural resources, all of which
environmental issues require CEQA review and far exceed the scope of the NOE. LLP NOIHHOS ANIEVA LIVAH BROWNSTEIN 10

11 18. The NOE is invalid because it was not properly noticed, and it falsely claims that
I01E6 12 the changes in historical use of the Trail from solely equestrian to mixed trail running/hiking and
le sÁQuJOnY 8 100fd puz '13amS edeoeuy 1701 13 mountain biking are exempt from CEQA review. Procedurally, the NOE appears to be invalid 'BIEQ]

2 and 21168.5

3 26. Venue is appropriate in Santa Barbara County pursuant to Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §§

4 393, 394 and 395 because Respondents are located within the County of Santa Barbara.

STANDING 5

Respondents full 6 27. Petitioners have a direct and substantial beneficial interest in

7 and complete compliance with CEQA, and all other applicable laws.

legal 8 28. Respondents owed a mandatory duty to act within the boundaries of their

change 9 authorities under CEQA and all other applicable laws before exercising its discretion to
dTT'MOTHHOS MASMVA JIVAH NINISNMONS 10 the use of Live Oak Trail and file the NOE.

11 29. Petitioners also have the right to enforce the public's right and duties that CEQA 021 Anacapa Street. 1001: put 12 and all other applicable laws impose on Respondents.
IE $ÁOuIOI 101E6 VO eqIA eIueS 13 30. Petitioners have no other plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course

14 of law. and will suffer irreparable injury unless this court issues the relief requested herein.

15 Petitioners have used Live Oak Trail for trail riding. Respondents' approval of the change in use

16 of Live Oak Trail harms Petitioners by threatening impairment of their reasonable and beneficial

17 use of Live Oak Trail. Mixed use of the Trail will result in both safety issues and environmental
18 issues that will impair equestrian use of the Trail, could result in Lake contamination, and allows

19 for trail runners/hikers and mountain bikers to enter into and damage sensitive natural and
20 cultural resources.

21 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

22 31. There was no publicly noticed hearing that preceded the NOE that Petitioners are

23 aware of for the change in use from solely equestrian to added hiking and mountain biking.

24 32. If any grounds for noncompliance with CEQA and other applicable laws alleged in
25 this Petition were, for some reason, not raised prior to Respondents' approval of the Project, it

26 was because there was no meaningful opportunity for members of the public to raise those

27 objections prior to the approval of the Project. Respondents failed to give notice required by law

28 before launching the change of use, and/or because any attempt to exhaust administrative

9

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 remedies would be futile.

2 33. Petitioners have therefore exhausted their administrative remedies.
FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

4 34. The Trail, located to the north of Lake Cachuma, has been for decades an
prohibited. Until 2021, the Trail was the only 5 equestrian only trail. Hiking and biking were

6 publicly accessible equestrian-only trail in Santa Barbara County. Now there are no equestrian-

7 only trails in the County. In contrast, horseback riding is prohibited on many trails throughout the

8 County, including all of the other trails in the Lake Cachuma recreation area, and many public

9 trails in the County are expressly designated as being solely for mountain bikes or solely for trail

10 runners/hikers.

11 35. Respondents manage the trail pursuant to an agreement with the United States 100ld puz 1aoS edeosuy I7Ol 12 Bureau of Reclamation. Respondents are required to comply with the Cachuma Resource MB-T2% sÁadiony dTT'NOHaHOS aaaav, LIVAH NIMISNMONI 101E6 VO 'uequeg eues 13 Management Plan ("CRMP").

14 36. On January 12, 2021, the Santa Barbara Community Services Department created
from equestrian-only use of the Trail to mixed hiking 15

16 and mountain biking was exempt from CEQA review (this change of use is also referred to from an NOE contending that the change in use

time to time herein as "the Project").

18 37. Under CEQA (Guidelines Section 15062 (c)(2 & 3) when a local agency files an 17

19 it NOE, it shall be filed with the County Clerk. Copies will be available for public inspection and

20 posted in the County Clerk's office for 30 days. The Clerk then is required to return the NOE to

21 the local agency with a notation of the time it period it was posted. The local agency must retain

22 the NOE for at least 12 months. Public agencies are encouraged to make NOE "postings

23 available in electronic format on the Internet."

24 38. Governor's Executive Order N-54-20 was signed 4/22/2020 and addresses CEQA

25 compliance. It suspends public filing requirements for 60 days, but provides that if a public

26 agency would otherwise be required to publicly post or file materials available to the public, the

27 lead agency shall do "all of the following: (a) post the materials on the agency's public-facing

28 website for the same time period that physical posting would be required; (b) submit all materials

any 1 electronically to the State Clearinghouse CEQAnet web portal; and (c) engage in outreach to

2 individual and entities known by the lead agency to be parties interested in the project. In

3 addition to the foregoing, lead agencies are also encouraged to pursue additional methods of

4 public notice and outreach as appropriate for particular projects and communities."

5 39. Although Respondents contend that they posted the NOE in the lobby of the Santa

general 6 Barbara County Administration Offices at 105 E. Anapamu Street, Santa Barbara, California,

7 entry to the building was locked as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. There was no

8 public access to the building or the lobby. Access was allowed for certain specific purposes, but

9 there was no general notice that there was access to review CEQA notices in the lobby.
dTT'MOTAHOS MAGMVA LIVAH NIMISNMONg 10 Respondents could have posted the NOE on the County website or sent it to the State

11 Clearinghouse, but they chose not to do so. Nor did Respondents make any effort to reach out to
10186 1001: put 1anS edeaeay 1701 12 the equestrian community or organizations promoting equestrian use of Live Oak Trail to give
Le S KawIOnV 13 them advance notice of the NOE. If the NOE was in fact posted in the lobby, Petitioners had no

14 knowledge of the NOE or meaningful opportunity to review the NOE and object to its use for this
15 Project.

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION 16

17 [Writ of Mandate for Pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1085, 1094.5 for

18 Violation of California Environmental Quality Act, PRC §S 21168, 21168.5 l
(By All Petitioners Against All Respondents) 19

20 40. Petitioners incorporates by this reference paragraphs 1 through 39 as though they
21 were set forth in full herein.

22 41. The NOE and the change in use of the Trail are invalid because, among other
23 things, the CRMP provides that with any change to the level of use from livestock grazing with

24 only very carefully regulated equestrian use, which required people to personally sign in at the
25 Lake Cachuma office before using the Trail, additional environmental review would be

26 necessary. The CRMP also calls for a site-specific trail management plan, which was not
27 implemented. County staff recently prepared a document that purports to be a trail management

28

11
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

_A plan for this Trail, but the document is undated, had no public vetting, and fails to constitute a

2 meaningful or valid trail management plan.

3 42. In addition, County staff has failed to disclose when Respondents made the

4 decision to open the Trail to trail runners/hikers and, ultimately, to mountain bikers. There was

5 no noticed public hearing and no opportunity for the public and the equestrian community to

6 participate in the process of changing the use of the Trail. If the NOE was issued prior to the

7 County making a decision to make the change in use, it is invalid, in that Section 15062(b) of the

8 CEQA Guidelines states that "The notice [of exemption] shall not be filed with the county clerk

9 or OPR until the project has been approved." The County staff's refusal to identify an approval
J'TTMOHAHOS HAGHVA LIVAH NIZISNMONH 10 date suggests that the NOE is either ineffective or untimely, in addition to being misleading.

11 43. The NOE used by the County for this project falsely states that adding new Trail
I01E6 100ld puz 43anS B 12 user categories is not a significant expansion of use and there are no special circumstances in this
'grequeg EqueS 13 situation (which ignores the nesting bald eagles that the CRMP indicates need special protection).

14 The NOE states that there's no expansion of use "under the reasonably same parameters that
I701 15 currently exist." That is entirely false a for a long list of reasons, including those referenced herein,

16 but they include the potential hazards created by people on foot swimming in the Santa Ynez

17 River immediately upstream from Lake Cachuma or in the Lake itself. Neither use is allowed

18 because of the potential threat to the drinking water supply for South Coast and Santa Ynez

19
The exemptions relied upon in the NOE do not apply to the County's closed-door Valley residents.

20 44.

21 decision to significantly change the use of Live Oak Trail. Neither the statutory nor categorical

22 exemption was proper to rely on in these circumstances.

23 45. Pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15300.2, subdivision (c), "A categorical

24 exemption shall not be used for an activity where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity

25 will have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances."

26 46. There are "unusual circumstances" concerning change in use from solely

27 equestrian trail riding to mixed pedestrian and mountain biking use of the Trail. The unusual

28 circumstances give rise to potentially significant environmental impacts including: (1) bald

12
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 eagles nesting and roosting sites; (2) water quality; (3) interaction between pedestrians and range

2 cattle and range horses; (4) health and safety issues with combining horseback riding with

3 pedestrians and mountain bikers; and, (5) impacts to sensitive species and their habitats and upon

4 cultural resources.

5 47. The significant impacts and unusual circumstances described above make it

6 impossible for Respondents to rely on categorical exemption to approve this change in use,

7 which not only opens the door to a significant increase in parking demand and human traffic, but

8 allows for easy access to a major source of potable water for local residents. There is more than a

( reasonable possibility under these circumstances that the Project will have a significant effect on
d'TI'NONAHOS MAmV HYATT BROWNSTEIN 10 the environment. Accordingly, Respondents improperly determined that the Project is

11 categorically exempt from CEQA.
10186 2nd Floot aaus edeaeuy 1201 12 48. Respondents* improper determination that the Project is exempt from the

14 mandate, requiring that Respondents cease implementation of the Project unless and until they
15 comply with the requirements of CEQA, NEPA, and all other applicable laws.

[Declaratory Relief - CCP § 1060] 17

(By All Plaintiffs Against All Defendants) 18

19 49. Petitioner incorporates by this reference paragraphs 1 through 48 as though they
20 were set forth in full herein.

21 50. A dispute has arisen between Plaintiffs and Defendants in that Plaintiffs contend

22 that the NOE and change in use are invalid.

23 51. Plaintiffs have no plain, speedy or adequate remedy at law for the harm resulting

24 from the change in use of the Trail. Plaintiffs thus desire declaratory judgment from the Court
25 that the change in use of the Trail is invalid and unenforceable. This declaration is necessary and
26 appropriate at this time in order to set at rest the continuing rights, duties, and obligations of the
27 parties with respect to each other.

EXHIBIT H: RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PLAN GUIDELINES

The Resource Management Plan (Plan) is to be developed with the following goals:
Planning, through Resource Management Plans (RMPs), provides specific direction for Reclamation to accomplish its mission at water resource development projects for lands directly managed by Reclamation and for lands cooperatively managed with another Federal or non-Federal entity. The guidance provided herein is discretionary, and are to be considered only as reference materials; however, the guidance provided will result in an RMP document that can effectively assist Reclamation in planning, decision-making. and implementing actions and activities affecting the resources under its jurisdiction. Because resource situations/issues differ greatly among the different Reclamation regions and from State to State, creativity and flexibility are allowed in preparing RMP documents so that they can address specific issues that meet local public expectations and address specific resource conditions. This Resource Management Plan Guidebook is intended 10 be a dynamic document which will be updated, as necessary. The RMP is to chart the desired future condition for the area in question--the resultant biological, physical, and social condition that Reclamation desires to sec once all the RMP management actions have been implemented. The RMP document should be sufficiently detailed to direct future development, but it should be flexible enough to allow resolution of day-to-day problems.

Gouls
The demand for Reclamation lands and water is increasing at a phenomenal rate. Recreation use is currently expanding by an estimated 1.2 million visitors per year at Reclamation
reservoirs. Because there is increasing competition for the use of Federal lands by a varicty of users (e.g., recrcationists, power companies, oil and gas companies, and special interest groups), RMPs are a valuable tool that will help Reclamation make informed decisions affecting competing uses of its lands. In addition, the overall objectives for completing an RMP should be consistent with the objectives identified in Reclamation's 2000 - 2005 Strategic Plan, which include the following: P Manage, develop, and protect water and related resources to meet the needs of current and future
generations
P Operate, maintain, and rehabilitate facilities safely, reliably, and efficiently to provide
Reclamation Project (Project) benefits P Advance Reclamation's organizational effectiveness

61

Agreement Number 11-LC-20-0223

An RMP provides management direction consistent with authorized Project purposes while, at the same time, recognizing the rights and interests of existing contracts, legislation, and other entities concerning an identified land area that is under the jurisdiction of Reclamation. An RMP identifies measures necessary to achieve: desired future condition of the resources within a management areaz covered by the RMP. Management direction is set forth in the form of goals, objectives, standards, and guidelines. These, in turn. set the stage for management actions, activities. and uses that affect management frameworks and partnerships, land management, and water, recreation, visual, natural, and cultural resources. The management direction could be general in nature to the management area (area-wide) or unique to a portion of the management area (site specific). Monitoring and evaluation of an RMP are intended to ensure conformance and good stewardship.

Live Oak Trails Santa Carbara

Trail Management Shared-Use Access Plan FRINS

Background The Live Oak Trails are on the north eastern portion of Cachuma Lake. The Live Oak trails include 15 miles of trails on 3,000 acres of leased grazing land with existing trails consisting of mostly ranch service roads (90% ranch roads / 10% non-vehicular trail). Public access is currently restricted to equestrians on horseback only. Hiking is not currently permitted.
A 25-year lease with the Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) was adopted in by the Board of Supervisors in 2012 and authorizes County Parks to manage recreation within the Cachuma Recreation Area. Guidance s through the BOR Resource Management Plan, 2010 (RMP) which, among other recreational opportunities, allows for hiking and biking under a similar system currently used by the equestrians. Providing hikers access to Live Oak Trails s specifically identified as the preferred alternative presented in the BOR's Cachuma Lake Resource Management Plan (as is biking).
In 2019, Santa Barbara County Parks (Parks) received a request by the County Riding and Hiking Trail Advisory Committee (CRAHTAC) to explore hiking and biking on Cachuma's north shore. CRAHTAC has stated that many conversations had occurred over the years with no action taken by Parks.
The shared use access program for Live Oak will allow hiking only at Live Oak. At this time, biking, camping, swimming and other BOR approved north shore opportunities are not being considered and
will not be allowed.

Live Oak Trails Goals The primary goal of the land manager, Parks, is to consider and pursue all allowable activities as
specified by the RMP.
Balance natural resource protection and recreational opportunities within the Cachuma
Recreation Area.
Ensure a safer trail network. Rangers to routinely monitor trails / parking area to address and
document violations and incidents. Spearhead area familiarization with EMS Responders,
Search and Rescue and County Parks Rangers.
Receive input from the equestrian community that have utilized this public land for over 30
years.
Maintain excellent communication with grazing leaseholder. The ranching and grazing operation consist of nearly 20 competition rodeo horses occupying the property year-round and around 300 head of cattle grazing from Fall to Spring. Improve Parks communication with the public. Revisit the intensive and confusing registration
process. Update the website and improve / replace outdated signage.

• Consider future infrastructure and facility improvements including equestrian amenities.

Public Involvement and Feedback
The Bureau of Reclamation has considered comments on the Draft EIS which included hiking and biking on the Live Oak Trails during the public review period that concluded on October 31, 2008, and included public hearing on August 26, and October 8, 2008. The final EIS includes editorial and technical changes, factual corrections, and clarifications made in response to public comments.
Additional comments from the public can be provided regarding Live Oak Trail at trails@sbparks.org. Emails may be used to buiid a user database of interested parties for further outreach. The registration process and signage will direct trail users to the Parks email to encourage continued public feedback.
The County Riding and Hiking Trail Advisory Committee (CRAHTAC) includes Live Oak trails as a standing agenda item for discussion.

Trail Access
Currently, equestrians must be holding a County Parks day-use or annual permit and make a reservation with Rangers each day they visit. Although no limits are specified by Parks on the number of equestrians that can visit Live Oak, visitation is extremely low. County Parks has been tracking data on equestrian registration which averaged around 2.4 registered riders per day (from July 2020 to December 2020)
and increased to six registered riders per day with some promotion of the trail in late Winter 2020 and
early Spring 2021. According to equestrian groups, organized group trail rides have been attended by nearly 100 equestrians at one time at Live Oak.
Once hiking is introduced, new users will need to be educated on the registration process as the current process is confusing. Live Oak access will be managed similar to Forest Service trail access. Users will
simply park at the trailhead, register their vehicle in the parking lot, pay a $10 fee or display their valid pass and access the trails for the day.
Users must have one of three Cachuma Lake passes or pay a $10 fee on site. Acceptable passes include:

1. A valid County Parks annual pass,
2. A valid Cachuma day use permit,
3. A valid Cachuma overnight camping permit, or
4. Onsite registration withi $10 day-use fee paid at the "fee tube/iron ranger" at the trail head
gate.

The Cachuma Lake front gate will no lnnger register users for live Oak Trail. Rangers will open the Live Oak gate before 8:00 am and close the gate before sunset seven days per week and patrol the parking
lot and trails as needed.

Trail access ongoing tasks to be reviewed periodically:
Improve sign clarity.
Consider installing cameras to monitor the parking area and front gate.
Consider developing a parking lot plan.
Work with grazing leaseholder on gates, fences and any issues.
Work with the equestrian community on equestrian and hiker etiquette.
Perform supervised site visits with all user groups and interested parties.

Page 2 of 16

This registration system should lmit confusion and allow for better public compliance. This will allow Parks to assess demand and continue to improve the process. Parks should revisit this process often to ensure it is the appropdate public access strategy.
Restrictions and Violations All Parks Chapter 26 Ordinances (Appandix C) apply to Liva Oak trails.
Noteworthy rules Dogs are prohibited due te cattle and horses on the property. Camping is not allowed at Live Oak trails, no overnight parking at the trailhead parking lot.
No bicycles, ebikes or motorized vehicles.
No swimming In Cachuma Lake or the Santa Ynez River.
Parking Area Modifications Parking is restricted to the lower Live Oak tot from 8:00 am to one hour before sunset, year-round. Warnings (with trall access rules) will be placed on any cars found in the lot after that time and their Information will be loaged. Repeat violators can be ticketed. A gate at the far end of the parking lot before Live Oak Camp has been Installed to prevemt trespassing Into the camp area lacilities.
Portable restroom added to LIve Oak trall head parking area.
Pack it in/Pack It out; trash services ovailable. Monitor for Issues.
Consider a designated equestrian staging area with horse tie ups/water trough. Replace existing front entry signs and "Please Close the Gate" signs. Sigas should address Hours of Operations, Registration Procedures, No Hunting, Close Gates, Stay on the Designated Tralls, No Feeding of Horses/Cattle, No Swimming, Horse/Hiker Etquette Including General Trail Etiquette (https://www.fs.usda.gov/internet/FSE_DOCUMENIS/fseprd553395.pdf.

Trell Maintenance Trail maintonance is the process of keeping a trail at its Intended standards while ansuring that the tralf is safe for public use. The maintenance of a trall Includes numerous efforts ranging from mowing, brush removal, the replacement of damaged signs, even to reconstruct the trail. Trail maintenance includes
keeping the trail free from obstructions as well as ensuring proper drainage and tread maintenance, and addressing social trails, A well-maintained and constructed trait will provide visttors with a safe, pleasant, and memorable nature experience.
The grazing leaseholder is currently responsible for trails and assoclated trall maintenance, fencing, and gates throughout the Lease 1 area which Includes Live Oak. Parks, along with approval from the grazing leaseholder, will perform, or suparvise, routine maintenance and trall projects on public access trail corridors and is responsible for all trail maintenance activities.
Parks has general Ranger and maintenance staff that can be utilized for limited trail related projects and ts interested in becoming more involved at Live Oak. For over fifty years, Parks has partnered with 501(c)(3) not-for-profit trail organizations to Improve and maintain the County's extensive trall system. Experienced trail crews supplemented by volunteers organized by non-proft organizations will perform most. routine maintenance with permission from Parks.

Clearing Height (feet): 17'clearance (ideally, no less than 10') Short Pitch Maximum (%): 20% (up to 200' lengths)
Reference: USFS Trail Standards, Gaviota Coast Plan-Trail Construction Specifications

Social Trails
Social trails are trails that are made Dy Lo users to shortcut visit a desirable area where an actual trail does not go. These trails are not on the official map and are not part of the trail network. These social trails will be addressed to avoid erosion issues and to prevent damage to resources.

Live Oak has an extensive network of social/cattie trails. Parks will monitor and address these social
trails while considering sustainability and impacts to the environment. Parks will consider closure of these social trails to allow the trail to heal. Some social trails may be adopted in the future with
environmental review.

Trail Conditions and Access
Historically, the trails and roads are either graded by the grazing leaseholder or they are only there because of equestrian use. Additional trail maintenance standards should be employed to meet modern day trail maintenance best practices. Trail maintenance is commonly accomplished by volunteer trail work days led by a certified trail maintenance lead. Poorly designed and maintained trails can erode
more from water than welt-designed trail that receives heavy (RMP, Sec 3.10.2.2).

Protocol to Close Off Trails During Wet Conditions
When precipitation reaches around 0.25 inch/hour in any 24-hour period trails will be closed for :
minimum of one day. When the water level is high on the river crossing at the parking lot, the trail systemn will be closed.

Livestock Considerations
Live Oak is as an active cattle and horse grazing area. Trails through or near grazing lands exist throughout Santa Barbara County. Ranching, grazing and agriculture are generally considered
compatible with trails and public access.

Trail users can expect to encounter horses throughout the year and cattle from approximately November to June. The grazing leaseholder has indicated that livestock should not bother people. Good communication with the leaseholder must be maintained.

Some considerations are necessary to keep the public safe and the livestock secure. Gates can be modified to spring loaded and self-latching with proper signage telling visitors to keep gates closed. Any modifications to gates or trails should be equestrian friendly. Visitors will be notified with proper signage to stay away from animals during their visit. Current signs say "This trail is also used for grazing,

Page 4 of 16

you may encounter horses or cattle. Proceed at your own risk." Additional signage is in Appendix A and will remind visitors to close the gates or not to feed livestock,

Appendix D - Emergency Response Plan

Emergency Response
Currently, there are few incidents on the Live Oak Trails. County Parks is aware of the possibility of an increase in accidents or medical emergencies when hiking is introduced. Heatstroke, injuries from the loose terrain and even animal encounters all have potential to require emergency response.
Nearly all of the trails are accessible with 4X4 County Parks or Fire Pickup Truck. Additionally, Cachuma Lake Rangers have two patrol boats which could provide quickest access to some trails. Cell reception throughout the trails is generally good but should not be relied upon when in the backcountry, particularly in low lying valleys.

Response Agencies
Santa Barbara County Parks Rangers - Monitor times / day, response, purposeful trail patrols 2 times /
week
Santa Barbara County Fire Department - Response, site inspections
Santa Barbara County Sheriff - Response
Santa Barbara County Search and Rescue - Response
California Highway Patrol - Response

CalStar 7 - Response

Cachuma Lake County Park is a staffed campground six miles away from the Live Oak trailhead. County Parks will provide periodic patrols of the Live Oak trails. Additionally, Santa Barbara County Fire
Department Station 32 is 12 miles away.

The Cachuma Lake Recreation Area is i mandatory helicopter medical evacuation area for serious emergencies. This means that CalStar 7 is 'automatically dispatched for any serious emergency and will respond without being specifically requested. There many areas on the property where a helicopter can land throughout the trail system. CalStar 7 air ambulance (helicopter) is located in Santa Maria.
