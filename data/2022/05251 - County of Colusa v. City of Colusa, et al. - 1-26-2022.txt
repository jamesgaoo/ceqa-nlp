24 TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA:

25 PLEASE TAKE NOTICE, under Public Resources Code §21167.7 and Code of Civil

26 Procedure §388, that on January 20, 2022, Petitioner County of Colusa filed a Petition for Writ of
27 Mandate against the City of Colusa, and Colusa Industrial Properties, Inc., Real Party in Interest. The
28

1 petition alleges that defendant City of Colusa has violated California Environmental Quality Act by
approving amendments to the above-referenced development project that substantially exceed the
original approval and final EIR of the project by Plaintiff, and which have not been adequately studied
pursuant the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act, and which are inconsistent
with the County's Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan for land development within the project area,
thereby resulting in unmitigated health and safety impacts to the public. Further, Plaintiff alleges that

8 defendant City of Colusa committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion in its November 2, 2021, override
of the County's Airport Land Use Commission's findings of the amended project's inconsistency with
10

11 the County's Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan.

12 The petition for writ of mandate seeks alternative and peremptory writs of mandate

13 commanding defendant City of Colusa and Real Party in Interest Colusa Industrial Properties to

14 comply with CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines; and declaratory relief that defendant City of Colusa
15 committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion in its November 2, 2021, override of the Airport Lan Use
16

17 Commission's findings of the amended project's inconsistency with the Airport Land Use

18 Compatibility Plan, which Plaintiff also seeks to be vacated. Petitioner is also seeking a stay,

19 temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction and permanent injunction prohibiting further

20 development of the CIP residential project until City/Respondents has fully complied with all CEQA
21 requirements and all other applicable state and local laws, policies, ordinances and regulations,
22

23 including compliance with all applicable land use and development standards set forth in the ALUCP.

24 A copy of the Petition is attached.

To assist you in completing the sheet, examples of the cases that belong under each case type in item are provided below. A cover sheet must be filed only with your initial paper.

STANDING CASE MANAGEMENT ORDER FOR CASES ASSIGNED TO THE HON. JEFFREY A. THOMPSON

INSTRUCTIONS TO PLAINTIFF(S)/CROSS-COMPLAINANT(S):
YOU must serve a copy of this Standing Cäse Management Order on all Defendants/Cross-Defendants at the same time the complaint/cross-complaint is served.

I. GENERAL MATTERS

A. It is the Court's policy to provide a dignified forum in which to resolve disputes in a peaceful, professional, legally correct and expeditious manner. All of the following rules are designed to achieve these goals. It is not the Court's intention to prohibit a party from raising any issue by any means allowed by Rule of Court, Code or statute. If any of the rules or procedures discussed herein creates a problem, counsel should raise the matter with the Court at the earliest opportunity after the parties have appeared.

B. Unless otherwise ordered, telephonic or electronic communication with the courtroom clerk is permissible for routine communications having to do with scheduling, stipulated continuances, and/or joint requests. Substantive arguments are not permitted unless approved in advance by the Court. In any correspondence with the clerk, opposing counsel should be copied in order to avoid ex-parte communications. The clerk's email address is: clerk@colusa.courts.ca.gov
C. Counsel should silence all audible telephones and pagers and instruct their clients and witnesses to do sO. Communication devices worn on the head are not permitted in the courtroom.

I. CASE MANAGEMENT CONFERENCES ("CMC")

A. Unless otherwise specifically ordered, CMC Statements are required five court days in advance. The Court expects that counsel will be prepated to discuss the current status of the case, discovery, amenability to mediation, and any unusual factual, legal or evidentiary issues that may need resolution. Counsel who fail to appear will typically be set for an OSC hearing why sanctions should not be issued. The initial amount is ordinarily $150.00.

B. Early mediation is strongly encouraged.

C. It is the Court's policy to resolve discovery disputes informally and efficiently. Accordingly, the Court has instituted special procedures for the resolution of discovery disputes through Pretrial Discovery Conferences, which can be scheduled on forms that are available from the clerk's office. Filing a request for a Pretrial Discovery Conference tolls the time for filing a motion to compel discovery on the disputed issues.

IUI. MEDIATION

A. The parties are strongly encouraged to engage in early, meaningful private mediation with a mediator of their choosing. Mediation will ordinarily take place within 90-120 days of all parties* appearance, but a longer time may be allowed.

B. Parties who select private mediation should comply with the mediator's instructions regarding briefing and payment of fees, which ordinarily should be divided equally.

COURTROOM POLICIES FOR DI
Page of 5

-.--.

C. A worthwhile mediation process means that parties, attorneys and any other person whose consent or authority is required to achieve a finäl disposition of the dispute should be present, as well as a representative of any insurer who has authority to settle the case for any amount up to the limits of the policy.
D. Plaintiff should file a one-page Notice of Mediation with the clerk's office notifying the Court of the date of the mediation and name of the mediator.

IV. LAW AND MOTION MATTERS
A. When parties agree to have a matter taken off calendar, counsel should promptly notify both the courtroom clerk by phone and email. This is important in order to avoid unnecessary commitment of judicial resources to moot matters.
B. The parties must "preview" complicated law and motions matters with the Court at CMCs. This procedure will obviate or narrow the scope of summary judgment motions and other matters that depend heavily on controverted facts, and it will save time and effort of all involved.

b. One special verdict form, in Word format, using the correct caption and organizational format per CACI (Disagreements as to wording or other matters can be highlighted by color coding or using different fonts); and,

C. Time estimates for each witness, in Word format, showing the expected time for direct examination and cross examination.
B. The readiness conference is typically scheduled several weeks prior to trial. Trial counsel must be personally present at the readiness conference and be prepared to discuss the following topics:
1. The length of trial may be récalculated from the time estimate given at the CMC using time estimates for the expected witnesses, jury selection, disputed jury instructions, opening statements, and closing arguments. Time limits for all phases of the case are typically established and enforced.

2 Number, timing and availability of witnesses. Judge Thompson expects that counsel will provide accurate time estimates for the direct examination of each witness, as well as cross-examination time for each opposing witness. A jury trial will usually be in session from Tuesday at 10:30 a.m. through 4:30 p.m. and then continuing Wednesday through Friday from 9:00 to 4:30 p.m.

a. Counsel have responsibility for arranging the appearance of all witnesses during their presentation of the case so as to eliminate delays. Counsel should confer among themselves as to when witnesses will be needed at least 24-48 hours in advance of a witness' testimony.

b. Counsel are to inquire of their clients and witnesses to determine whether they are in need of any type of accommodation with an interpreter, under the Americans with Disabilities Act, or any other type of assistance.

3. Numbering and exchange of exhibits. The parties are encouraged to agree upon a reasonable exhibit numbering system using the format P001 forward (for plaintiff) and D001 forward (fór defendant). The specific arrangements for numbering, marking, exchanging and copying exhibits will be discussed in detail.

4. Voir dire procedures, including mini-opening statements and pre-instructions, and hardship and jury questionnaires. Counsel should attempt to agree upon a brief neutral statement of the case to be read
to the prospective jury panel.

5. Stipulations to reduce the length of trial. Counsel should consult with each other regarding all possible stipulations and reduce them to writing. In particular, counsel should consider waiving the necessity for authentication/foundational evidence regarding all trial exhibits, unless authentication is an important issue.

6. Motions in limine. Prior to filing motions in limine, counsel should confer with the objective of reaching agreement on as many such motions as possible. Counsel should review Kelly v. New West Federal Savings (1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 659, 669-677, and its progeny. Counsel should advise their
clients and witnesses about rulings on motions in limine that pertain to evidentiary issues. Counsel
will be held responsible for any violations of rulings on motions in limine.

cause.

2. A stipulation should be drafted for the retention of exhibits by counsel during the pendency of any appeal. The stipulation should release the exhibits to the party that propounded the exhibit and the exhibits should be retained and maintained by counsel's respective offices pending final determination of the action, including time for post-trial motions and appeal. Once the final determination is reached, the stipulation should allow for the disposal of be exhibits by the parties as they see fit, unless otherwise ordered.

STATEMENT OF FACTS

9: In or around 2005, Colusa Industrial Properties("CIP") submitted an application to
the County to allow the development of 151 acres of property just south of the City of Colusa in

unincorporated Colusa County. More specifically, CIP proposed the development of a mixed-use
community, including approximately 286 residential units 140 of which were designated as single-
family residences, improvements to the existing golf course, various commercial and office space

11 of approximately 116,580 square feet along State Route 20, and wastewater treatment facilities to

12 serve the mixed-use community and other uses.

13 10. The proposed development of the mixed-use community necessitated amendments to
14 the Colusa County General Plan and Zoning Ordinance, including (1) changes in land use
15

16 designation for 138 acres from Industrial (1) to Urban Residential (UR), Parks and Recreation (P-

17 R), and Commercial (C); (2) change in land use designation for 13 acres from Parks and Recreation

18 (P-R) to Urban Residential (UR); (3) change in zoning for 138 acres from Industrial (M) and
19 Industrial Planed Development (M-PD) to Single Family Residential (R-1-8), High Density
20 Residential (R-4), General Recreation (G-R), Neighborhood Commercial (C-1), Community 21

22 Commercial (C-2), and Highway Commercial (CH); and (4) change in zoning for 13 acres from

23 General Recreation (G-R) to High Density Residential (R-4).

:H 8A 11. The County was designated as the lead agency for purposes of reviewing and
approving the proposed project, including environmental review and final Environmental Impact
Report (EIR) approval pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA").
28
3

Petition for Writ of Mandate

12. In or around November 2007, a Draft Environmental Impact Report ("DEIR") on the
above-referenced project was prepared and submitted to the County (SCH No. 2006052113).

13. The DEIR noted, inter alia, that the project was located adjacent to the Colusa

5 County Airport and fell within the influence arca of the County's Airport Land Use Compatibility

6 Plan (ALUCP").

7 14. With regard to the CIP project's proposed single-family residences build-out, the

8 DEIR analyzed the environmental impacts associated with the construction of a MAXIMUM of

10 140 single-family residential units.

11 15. Pursuant to Public Utilities Code section 21675, subdivision (b), local agencies must

12 refer proposed projects that include land use changes requiring amendments to a general or specific

13 plan, or the adoption or approval of a zoning ordinance or building regulation that fall within the
14 influence area of the ALUCP, which included the CIP project, to the Airport Land Use Commission
15

16 ("ALUC") for review of the proposed project's consistency with the ALUCP.

17 16. The legislative purpose behind the formation of ALUC is set forth in Public Utilities

18 Code section 21670, which identifies, in relevant part, the protection of public health, safety, and
19 welfare by ensuring the orderly expansion of airports and the adoption of land use measures that
20 minimize the public's exposure to excessive noise and safety hazards within areas around public 21

22 airports to the extent that these areas are not already devoted to incompatible uses.

23 17. Each ALUC is charged with formulating an ALUCP that will provide for the orderly

24 growth of each public airport and the area surrounding the airport within the jurisdiction of the
25
26 commission, and will safeguard the general welfare of the inhabitants within the vicinity of the

27 airport and the public in general.

28

Petition for Writ of Mandate

18. In formulating an ALUCP, the ALUC may develop height restrictions on buildings,
specify use of land, and determine building standards, including soundproofing adjacent to airports,
within the airport influence area.

19. In 2007, pursuant the requirements of Public Utilities Code section 21676,
subdivision (b), the County referred the proposed CIP project and DEIR to the ALUC for review of
the proposed project's consistency with the ALUCP.

20. On or about December 18, 2007, the ALUC, in accordance with Public Utilities
Code Section 21676(b), notified the County of its findings related the proposed CIP's project's
inconsistency with the ALUCP.
12 21. More specifically, the ALUC's findings of project inconsistency with the ALUCP
13 included: (1) the proposed concentration of residential units and people exceeding the limits of the
14 ALUCP, with the associated risks not being adequately mitigated; (2) a determination that the
15

16 proposed business inside the Safety Area may create a concentration of people that exceed the

17 limits established in the ALUCP, with the associated risks not mitigated; and (3) the impact of

18 existing airport noise on the proposed residential units and businesses exceeded the limits

19 established by the ALUCP, with the risks not fully mitigated.
20 22.
21 Public Utilities Code Section 21676(b) authorizes a local agency to override ALUC

22 findings of a proposed project's inconsistency with an ALUCP following a public heating on a

23 proposal to overrule the ALUC by a two-thirds vote of its governing body upon specific findings

24 that the proposed action is consistent with the purposes stated in Public Utilities Code section
25 21670.
26
23.
27 On or about May 27, 2008, the Colusa County Board of Supervisors held a public

28 hearing on the ALUC's determination that the proposed project was inconsistent with the ALUCP.
5

Petition for Writ of Mandate

**
y*

Following the public hearing, the Board of Supervisors made findings in accordance with Public
Utilities Code section 21676.5(a) that the proposed project was consistent with the purposes set

forth in Public Utilities Code section 21670. In doing so, the Board of Supervisors overruled the

ALUC's determination that the proposed project was inconsistent with the ALUCP.

24. In overruling the ALUC's determination that the proposed CIP project was

inconsistent with the ALUCP, the Board of Supervisors noted that additional mitigation measures

had been drafted to address, to the extent feasible, issues identified by the ALUC that were deemed

inconsistent with the ALUCP. These included: (1) modifying DEIR mitigation measure LU-4b to

11 require the applicant to enter into an avigation casement agreement with the County; (2) requiring
12 the applicant to notify all prospective purchasers and users of property in the project area of the
13 inconveniences or discomforts that may accompany the airport operations; (3) adopting new
14 mitigation measure N4-h to reduce the number of low density residential units in the southwest
15

16 portion of the project area from the maximum 140 analyzed in the DEIR to 84 units, thereby

17 resulting in a wider aircraft corridor adjacent to the project area described in the DEIR.

18 25. In 2014, the County adopted a new ALUCP to govern land uses within its defined
19 Airport Influence Area. The CIP residential development project was specifically mentioned in the
20 2014 public draft of the amended ALUCP, including references to ALUC's 2007 finding of
21

22 inconsistency with the ALCUP, the County's subsequent overruling of the ALUC's determination

23 and approval of the project in 2008. Further, the draft ALUCP mentioned that CIP project location

24 was being proposed for annexation into the City. However, for reasons not currently known, this
25 language referencing the CIP project was omitted from the final draft of the 2014 ALUCP.
26 26. On or about April 18, 2014, some seven years after the City's adoption of its 2007
27

28 Master Environmental Report ("MEIR") pertaining to its General Plan, and prior to the annexation

Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 of the CIP project location into the City, the City prepared an Initial Study on the CIP project with

2 the stated purpose of "...evaluating] the project for any potential, adverse environmental impacts
3 ABOVE AND BEYOND those already identified and mitigated within the above-referenced

5 MEIR, and for some of which the City Council duly adopted a statement of overriding

6 considerations. None of the project components would cause any additional significant effect on
n the environment which was not previously examined in the MEIR." Furthermore, the 2014 Initial
Study referenced the CIP EIR certified by the County of Colusa in 2008 and stated that mitigation
measures within the CIP EIR apply to the Project. Petitioner has been unable to locate the purported

11 statement of overriding considerations mentioned in the Initial Study.

12 27. The City's Initial Study did not analyze any changes to the number of single-family
13 residences previously approved by the County in 2008, and concluded that no new additional
14 mitigation measures or alternatives specific to the proposed project may be required. The Initial
15
16 Study futther concluded that the CIP project is within the scope of the City's MEIR, and concluded
17 that no additional environmental documments were required in accordance with Section 15177(a) and
18 (b) of the CEQA Guidelines.
19 28. On or about September 30, 2015; the Executive Director of the Colusa County Local
20 Agency Formation Commission recorded a Certificate of Completion with regard to the annexation
21

22 of portions of the CIP, including the CIP residential development, into the City.

23 29. In or around April of 2016, the Colusa City Council adopted Ordinance No. 513,

24 approving a development agreement between the property owner of the CIP residential project and
25 the City, which reflected amendments the project that included, inter alia, the expansion of single-
26

27 family residential units from the original 84 approved by the County in 2008 to 180. As set forth in

the language of Ordinance No. 513, findings in support of approving the development agreement

included:

à. The project was addressed in the City's 2007 Master Environmental Report (MEIR);

b. A subsequent Initial Study ("IS") environmental document had been prepared in

6 accordance with CEQA, which determined that the proposed amended CIP project would have NO
ADDITONAL SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE ENVIORONMENT; THAT NO NEW

8 MITIGATION MEASURES OR ALTERNATIVES MAY BE REQUIRED, and that the project is
within the scope of the City' s 2007 MEIR;

C. In accordance with CEQA Guidelines, section 15177(a) and (b), no additional

12 environmental documents were required for the project;

13 d. The development agreement is consistent with the objectives, policies, general land
14 uses and programs specified in the City's General Plan, as well as the land-use area in which the
15

16 project site is located;

17 .. The development agreement will not be detrimental to the health, safety, and general

18 welfare;

19 f. The impacts of the development have been evaluated through the CEQA process,
20 except for those impacts found to be significant and unavoidable for which the City Council 21

22 previously adopted a Statement of Overriding Considerations and the adoption of mitigation

23 measures in support of the CIP residential project - referencing the City's adoption of its MEIR on

24 October 30, 2007, pursuant to Resolution 07-29.
25 30. On or about May 17, 2016, the Colusa City Council then passed Resolution No. 16-
26

27 14, thereby approving Tentative Map 01-16, which amended the County's 2008 residential project

28 approval and approved the subdivision of approximately 57.42 acres of land into approximately 180
8

Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 residential low-density single-family lots, up from the 84 residential units approved by the County
in 2008, with the remainder parcels for open space, landscaping and related uses.

31. The City's approval of the CIP project's Tentative Map by way of passage of

5 Resolution No. 16-14 referenced same or similar CEQA findings set forth in Ordinance 513,

6 including a finding that the proposed CIP project was part of the City's MEIR, of which the

7 project's Tentative Map approved by Resolution 16-14 was reported to be part of.

8 32. Subsequent to the City's adoption of Ordinance No. 513, and passage of Resolution
9

10 No. 16-14, on or about April 18, 2017, the City adopted Ordinance 516 to amend the development

11 agreement to include language omitted from Ordinance 513 pertaining to water and sewer

12 availability, which was followed by passage of Resolution No. 18-21 on April 3, 2018, thereby

13 approving Tentative Map 01-18, which amended and replaced Tentative Map 01-16. Neither
14 Ordinance 516, nor Resolution 18-21, modified the previously approved 180 single-family
15

16 residential lots authorized via Ordinance 513 and Resolution 16-14.

17 33. The City's approval of the Tentative Map by way of Resolutions 16-14 and 18-21

18 relied on several incorrect findings as to the project's environmental review process, including (1)
19 the project being part of the City's 2007 Master Environmental Impact Report (MEIR); (2) the City
20 Council's consideration and reliance on a 2014 Initial Study on the proposed project in determining 21

22 that that no additional significant effects on the environment existed with regard to the amended

23 project; (3) that no new/additional mitigation measures or alternatives related to environmental

24 impacts resulting from the project may be required; (4) that the project is within the scope of the
25 MEIR; and (5) that the proposed subdivision and improvements are not likely to cause public health,
26
27 problems.

The City's MEIR

34. The City's MEIR, adopted in or around July 2007, some eight months prior to the
County's approval of the EIR specific to the proposed CIP project, was created for the purpose of

addressing potential environmental impacts of the City's General Plan.

35. The City's 2007 MEIR was not the EIR. document considered and approved by the
County in 2008 with regard to the CIP project.
8 36. While the City's MEIR references the CIP project (page 3.0-13) as falling within
one of several identified "Special Planning Areas," and indicates "It]he City's intent for this 10

11 planning area is that it be annexed to the City with a mix of land uses including low-density

12 residential on the western portion of the site; commercial professional along the SR. 20/45 coridor;
13 and Parks, Recreation and Open Space within the airport overflight zoue," this MEIR was not relied
14 on by the County, as the Lead Agency, for purposes of determining the CIP project's compliance
15

16 with CEQA, as the MEIR was specific to the City's General Plan, not the specific CIP proposed

17 project or the County's Gencral Plan.

18 37. The City's MEIR did not analyze the CIP project. As stated on page 4.0-7 of the
19 MEIR, only three projects within the Special Planning Areas were analyzed through the MEIR.
20 The CIP project was not one of these three projects, which included (i) Colusa Riverbend; (ii)

22 Colusa Crossings; and (iii) Brookins Ranch.

23 38. As the CIP project was not one of the three projects analyzed in the MEIR, it was

24 subject to separate environmental review. Page 4.0-2 of the MHIR noted "environmental review in
25 process" for the CIP project relating to a "General Plan Amendment and rezone, resulting in 26
27 potential construction of approximately 200 residences and commercial properties, adjacent to

28 Colusa County Airport."

39. With regard to planning activities that involve project proposals within the ALUCP's
Airport Overflight Zone, the City's July 2007 MEIR notes that some of the project site is situated
within the "Airport Overflight Zone, and that the City would review the CIP project, as with all
projects falling within the CLUP Airport Overflight Zone do determine consistency with the
ALUCP. More specifically, page 3.0-14 of the City's MEIR states:

Airport Overflight Zone -- Large areas of land within the City's Sphere of Influence lie within the boundaries of the Colusa County Airport Comprehensive Land Use Plan (CLUP). A portion of this land,
9FS9SARR4R including some of the Colusa Industrial Park site, is situated
within the Airport Overflight Zone, as designated in the CLUP. This zone generally coincides with the area overflown by aircraft during normal traffic patterns procedures. Most of the proposed Planning Area within the airport overflight zone is designated on the proposed Land Use Diagram as
Parks/Recreation/Open Space, but some is designated Low-Density Residential. Whether proposed for annexation or not, the City
would review all project proposals within the CLUP Airport Overflight Zone to ensure compliance with the CLUP.

40. The City's May 17, 2016 passage of Resolutions Nos. 16-14 and 18-21, which

approved Tentative Maps 01-16 and 01-18, respectively, thereby amending the County's 2008 CIP

residential project approval by, inter alia, increasing the number of single-family residences from

the total of 84 approved by the County to 180, did not include any reference to the City's, or
20 ALUC's, review of the amended CIP project for consistency with the ALUCP. The same is the

22 case with regard to the City's adoption of Ondinances 513 and 516, pertaining to the respective
NYN adoption of, and amendment to, the development agreements for the CIP project.

41. Nor did Resolution Nos. 16-14 or 18-21 reference or expressly consider the

26 County's final project EIR. Rather, these Resolutions reference and rely upon a 2014 "Colusa

27 Industrial Park Initial Study," along with the City's 2007 MEIR, as the environmental documents

28 supporting the CIP project's compliance under CEQA, including the City's finding that the project

11

Petition for Writ of Mandate

*

would have no additional impacts on the environment, that no new additional mitigation measures

or alternatives may be required, and that the project is "within the scope" of the MEIR. T

42. The same is true, save erroneous references to the "project" having been addressed

and certified in the County's DEIR and 2008 final project EIR, with regard to the City's findings
and conclusions set forth in Ordinance Nos. 513 and 516, pertaining to the City's respective
adoption of, and amendment to, the development agreements for the CIP project, which included

the increased number of single-family residences from the 84 approved by the County in 2008 to

the 180 approved by the City.

11 43. By not first referring the proposed amendments to the CIP project back to the ALUC

12 for a determination as to the amended project's consistency with the ALUCP, the City's passage of
13 Ordinances 513 and 527, pertaining to the approval of the development agreements for the CIP
14 project, and Resolutions 16-14 and 18-21, pertaining to the approval of the Tentative Map for the
15

2809 CIP project, along with findings that the proposed subdivision, as conditioned, was compatible with
adjacent land uses, were done so in error and without proper authority.

44. Public Utilities Code section 21676(b) requires that prior to the amendment of a
general or specific plan, or the adoption or approval of zoning ordinances or building regulations
20 with the planning boundary established by the ALUC pursuant to section 21675, the local agency 21

22 shall first refer the proposed action to the ALUC for ALUCP consistency review.

23 45. Further, ALUC review of amendments to a project within its boundaries is also

24 mandated under the ALUCP itself, including Sections 1.4.3(c) pertaining to subsequent revisions to
25 a project; Section 2.2.2(e) pertaining to the ALUC's review of the consistency of development 26 27 agreements with the ALUCP; Section 2.6.4(b) pertaining to additional review of projects where the

28 design subsequently changes in a manner that affects previously considered compatibility issues for
12

Petition for Writ of Mandate

-t

subsequent review and determination as to whether the amendments to the nature and scope of the
project that were not part of the ALUC's review in 2007 were consistent with the ALUCP.

46. As the ALUC determined in 2007 that the then proposed concentration of residential
units and people exceeded the limits of the ALUCP, which the County then considered and
mitigated through significant reduction in the number of approved single-family residential units,
the City's subsequent approval of approximately 180 single family residences, which represents an
additional 40 single family residences beyond the maximum 140 considered in the 2007 DEIR, and
approximately 96 more than approved by the County in 2008, the City's approved amendments to
284840899 the project were neither in conformity with the CIP project's final EIR prepared by the County, the
2007 ALUC findings, nor the mandatory pre-project ALUC review requirements of the proposed

amendments to determine consistency with the ALUCP.

47. Subsequent to the City's aforementioned approvals of the development agreement
and Tentative Map for the CIP project, construction of the first phase of the project, known as

"Sunrise Landing," commenced.

48. In early 2020, following the submittal of building permits pertaining the project, the
Colusa County Airport Manager became aware that the project under construction was different
20 from the project approved by the Colusa County Board of Supervisors in 2008. 21 22 49. In response to multiple formal and informal inquiries by the County to the City in

23 2020 regarding the City's approved amendments to the proposed project, including the status of any
SARR noise mitigation measures pertaining to the planned increased number of residences, the County

was advised that an acoustical study bad not been completed to address noise impacts resulting
from the proximity of the project to the County airport, and that the City had determined the nature
28
13

Petition for Writ of Mandate

of the insulation and wall framing of the residences being constructed would be adequate to

mitigate aircraft noise. (See Declaration of Gregory Plucker.)
m1 50. In response to findings in the DEIR that the entire proposed CIP development area
would be exposed to aircraft noise levels of 55 dB CNEL or greater, resulting in a significance level
before any mitigation measures being "significant," the project applicant was required to obtain an
acoustical professional to conduct an acoustical investigation for purposes of evaluating with
requisite certainty that the impacts of aircraft activities on the noise levels within the residences

under development will meet acceptable interior noise level standards consistent with the ALUCP
10 :8s and County standards, which cannot be higher than 45 dB CNEL. The City's MEIR, section 4.4,
also includes the same noise standards related to airport caused noise.

51. Based on information and belief, the specific acoustical investigation required in the 14 final EIR has not been conducted.
15 ? t 52. On or about July 21, 2021, the City completed a "Residential Building Façade Noise
Reduction Assessment" related to the CIP project for the purpose of".quantif[ying] the aitcraft
18 noise reduction provided by the residences being constructed within the development."
19 53. According to the July 21, 2021 Residential Building Façade Noise Reduction
20 Assessment, noise measurements were taken from the location of the CIP project's model homes, 21

22 as depicted in figure 2 of the Assessment, thereby not including the remaining areas of the

23 undeveloped planned residential areas as part of the site locations for noise measurements.

24 54. According to the Residential Building Façade Noise Reduction Assessment, Ldn
25 values ranged from 53-58 dB Ldn. The Assessment did not indicate that samples had been taken
26
27 from areas where noise exposure in excess of 70 dB would be present, but indicated, as precursor to
specific recommended construction upgrades required to meet noise standards, that such noise

14 28

Petition for Writ of Mandate

exposure in excess of 70 dB would leave "little margin for error in construction or materials to

ensure satisfaction with the 45 Db Ldn interior requirement." Further, the Assessment indicated

that while the Ldn values were below those predicted for aircraft utilizing the Western departure
flight path, it was possible that the aircraft flight conditions were atypical during the survey, and, as
a result, the ambient noise measurement results were being provided for acoustical context and

were not purported to be representative of typical aircraft noise generation at the CIP project site.
City's Referral of the CIP Project Amendments to the ALUC
02:902481 55. On or about February 21, 2021, nearly five years after the City Council passed and
adopted Resolution 16-14, approving the Tentative Map for the CIP residential project that
authorized the expanded number of single-family residences by at least 96 from the County's 2008

CIP project approval, the City ultimately determined that it had approved the amendments to the
CIP project without first referring the proposed amendments to the ALUC for a consistency review
with the ALUCP, as required.

56. On or about March 1, 2021, and March 11, 2021, the ALUC reviewed the amended

project for consistency with the ALUCP.

57. ALCU Resolution 21-003, dated March 11, 2021, set forth the Commission's 20 findings as to the amended project's consistency with the ALUCP, preliminarily noting that the
City was required to refer the entitlement actions associated with the amendments to the CIP project VANARR prior to taking any action on the entitlements, which the City did not do.

58. Further, ALUC's Resolution 21-003 specifies that the ALUCP requires the ALUC to
review the various CIP residential City entitlement approvals for consistency with the ALUCP prior
to the City taking action on these entitlements, which the City did not do prior it entering into the

28 2016 development agreement and Tentative Map on the CIP project via Ordinance No. 513 and
15

Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 Resolution 16-14, respectively, and again in 2018 when it amended the development agreement and

issuing a new Tentative Map, which served to amend the Tentative Map approved in 2016, via

Ordinance No. 516 and Resolution 18-21, respectively.

59. According to the March 11, 2021, findings of the ALUC, the City's 2018 approval
of Tentative Map 01-18 for the project qualified as a new version of the prior approval document,
Tentative Map 16-14, and represented the filing of an amended subdivision map that was
significantly different in terms of the number of residential units and types of residential units from
the County's 2008 CIP project approval.

60. Further, the ALUC concluded that no prior development agreements had been 11
12 submitted to the ALUC for consistency review with the ALUCP, as required pursuant to section

13 2.2.2(e) of the ALUCP.
299899 61. Further, the ALUC made specific findings pertaining to the inconsistency of the
amended CIP project with the ALUCP, including:
With regard to the location of the project's residential development in Compatibility Zones
B-1, C-1, and C-2, the ALUC concluded that the average and maximum densities set forth

in Tentative Map 01-18 exceed the average and maximum densities detailed in Table 3A of
20 the ALUCP, thereby making Tentative Map 01-18 inconsistent with the ALUCP.
5883 With regard to noise levels, the ALUC concluded that a number of the homes included in
Tentative Map 01-18 will have an interior noise level exceeding the ALUCP interim 45 dB
Ldn noise standards, thereby making Tentative Map 01-18 inconsistent with the ALUCP. 25 Additionally, the ALUC noted that the portions of the residential project are located above 26 27 the 70 dB Ldn noise contour projected in the project's adopted 2008 EIR, which specified

28 that an acoustical professional must conduct an acoustical investigation to identify the
16

Petition for Writ of Mandate

construction measures necessary in order to meet the interior noise standards of the ALUCP

and the County, which are also set at the same maximum by the City at 45 dB Ldn. Such an

acoustical study in accordance with the final 2008 project EIR was not completed or
required by the City. Further, the ALUC noted that without the acoustical study required by
the 2008 final EIR, it is not possible to confirm with a reasonable high-degree of certainty

that the internal noise levels of all the homes will meet the 45 dB Ldn standard.

With regard to the development agreement with the City, the ALUC found that: "The
Development Agreement between the residential developer and the City of Colusa obligates
59934 the City to allow the construction of the residential project as long as the developer meets
their contractual obligations. Based on the findings of inconsistency with the ALUCP given
the density and noise levels, said Development Agreement which allows for the construction
of the residential project would also be inconsistent with the ALUCP."

16 62. On or about November 2, 2021, the City held an override hearing on the ALUC's

17 findings of project inconsistency with the ALUCP. This hearing was the culmination of three prior

18 hearings, of which at least two included the receipt of testimony. At the conclusion of the
19 November 2, 2021 hearing, the City Council passed and adopted Resolution 21-57, issuing findings
20 to "overrule the ALUC's decision associated with Colusa Industrial Properties Tentative Map 01-16
21

22 and related entitlements."

23 63. In overruling the ALUC's determination that the CIP project was inconsistent with

24 the ALUCP, the City's made findings, in relevant part, that:
25 A. The project will not adversely impact the ability to provide for the orderly development
26
27 of the public use airport, emphasizing that the project is located 2,000 Northwest of the airport in a

28
17

Petition for Writ of Mandate

*

"sparsely developed area that is not within property that could be acquired for purposes of
extending the airport.
B. The project will not adversely impact the ability to provide for the orderly development
of the area surrounding the airport so as to promote the overall goals and objectives of the City and
County noise standards, and will not cause the creation of new noise and safety problems for
individuals. The City further found that mitigation measures have been imposed to ensure that the
existing exposure to noise levels are consistent with noise standards for residential uses, including
review of building plans by an acoustical engineer specific to lots that are located in the noise

11 contour above 70 dBn Ldn shown in the EIR's noise study who shall detail what additional

12 mitigation measures shall be required in the construct of the home. The City also referenced a July

13 2021 acoustical study that found the "construction of the homes" to be consistent with the indoor
14 noise level of less than 45 dB Ldn.
15

16 C. The project will not adversely impact the ability to protect the public health, safety, and

17 welfare by continuing to ensure the orderly expansion of the airport and will not adversely afféct
18 the utility Or capacity of the airport. In furtherance of this finding, the City stated that the project
19 was not "immediately adjacent" to any land owned by the airport, and that mitigation measures are
20 in place to "require future improvement plans to be submitted to the Federal Aviation
21

22 Administration to ensure the proposed heights are not a hazard to air navigation, thus the project

23 will not pose any safety concerns,' and inferring that because there are no hazards to air navigation,
24 any hazards to individuals on the ground would be "less than significant."
25 D. The project will not adversely impact the ability to protect the public health, safety, and
26
27 welfare and incorporates land and safety hazards within the areas around the public airport to the

28 extent that these areas are not already devoted to incompatible uses. In support of this finding, the
18

Petition for Writ of Mandate

City referenced "the project not proposing any significant land use changes but rather a modest
increase in single-family homes and elimination or (sic) high density residential, which will reduce

the overall population for the project." The City also referenced the removal of high-density

housing while constructing 180 single family houses, which the City contended was "well below
the minimum housing density originally contemplated," and resulting reduced density and intensity
(number of persons per acre), which the City cited as being compatible with ALUCP policies for
land development. Further the City found that the project incorporates conditions of approval to
ensure the public will not be exposed to excessive noise or safety hazards, including noticing 10

11 project residents of aircraft noise and avigation easements, in combination with Federal Aviation

12 Administration height restrictions so as not to create hazards to air navigation.

13 64. County personnel have completed informal CIP project site monitoring and have
14 confirmed that the construction is continuing. (See Declaration of Gregory Plucker).
e FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

17 Violation of California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA):

18 Error in not Requiring a Subsequent or Supplemental EIR

19 65. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference each and every allegation contained in
20 Paragraphs 1 through 64, as set forth above.
21
66. CEQA is designed to ensure that government agencies incorporate the goal of long- 22

23 term protection of the environment into their decisions that may affect the environment. CEQA

24 applies to any situation where a governmental agency can use its judgment in deciding whether and
25 how to carry out or approve a project (i.e. a "discretionary project").
26
67. The EIR serves not only to protect the environment but also to demonstrate to the 27

28 public that it is being protected. As the cornerstone of the CEQA process, the EIR must disclose and
19

Petition for Writ of Mandato

analyze a project's potentially significaut envirommental impacts. In addition, the EIR. also must
inform decision-makers and the public of feasible mitigation measures and alternate project designs
or elements that would lessen or avoid the project's significant adverse environmental impacts.

68. If an agency approves a project requiring environmental review, CEQA mandates that
the agency adopt all feasible mitigation measures that would reduce or avoid any of the project's
significant environmental impacts. If any of the project's significaut projects cannot be feasibly
mitigated to a less-than-significant level, the project can be approved only if there are no feasible,
environmentally superior alternatives available and the agency finds that the project's benefits would 10

11 outweigh its uavoidable impacts. Futther, when an EIR identifies a significant effect, the

12 government agency approving the project must make findings on whether the adverse environmental

13 effects have been substantially reduced or if not, why not.
14 69. When an EIR shows that: project would cause substantial adverse changes in the
15

16 environment, the goverumental agency must respond to the information by methods that include, but

17 are not limited to: (1) changing a proposed project; (2) imposing conditions on the approval of the

18 project; (3) choosing an alternative way of meeting the same need; (4) disapproving the project; (5)
19 finding that changing or altering the project is not feasible; (6) find that the unavoidable significant
20 environmental damage is acceptable as provided in Section 15093 of the CEQA guidelines. 21

22 70. Under CEQA, all findings required for the public agency's approval of a project must

23 be legally adequate and supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record. CEQA

24 further requires that an agency provide an explanation of how the evidenced in the record supports
25 the conclusions that the agency has reached.
26
27 71. The City is the lead agency responsible under CEQA for evaluating the environmental
28 impacts of any amendments to the CIP Project, including the preparation of a Subsequent or

20

Petition for Writ of Mandate

ri +tp

Supplemental EIR pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21166 where substantial changes are
proposed in the project which will require major review of the EIR; where substantial changes occur
with respect to the circumstances under which the project is being undertaken which will require

major revisions to the EIR; and/or where new information, which was not known and could not have

been known at the time the EIR. was certified as complete, became available.

72. CEQA does not allow an agency to conduct subsequent environmental review of a
change to a project by relying on an EIR for a different project. (Märtis Camp Community

10 Association v. County of Placer (2020) 53 Cal.App.5th 569, 607.)

73. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that the City violated CEQA,

12 and continues to violate CEQA in relation to the CIP project, including:
13 a Approving substantial revisions to the CIP project following the County's 2008
14 project approval and adoption of the final EIR, including more than doubling the 84 single-family
15

16 residences approved by the County to 180, an increase of 96 single-family residences, which is

17 substantially more than the maximum number of 140 single family residences subject to review in

18 the project EIR.
19 b. These substantial amendments to the size and scope of the project were not
20

21 contemplated by the project EIR and, therefore, warranted the completion of a Subsequent or

22 Supplemental EIR to evaluate these additional environmental impacts pursuant to Public Resources

23 Code section 21166, subdivisions (a), (b), and (c) prior to approval, which the City failed to do.

24 Accordingly, the City has authorized amendments to the CIP project that were not subject to adequate
25 environmental review under. CEQA, and which has resulted in the City approving amendments to the
26
27 CIP project which ate not in compliance with the final project EIR.

28
21

Petition for Writ of Mandate

The City's reliance on the 2014 Initial Study as a substitute to a Subsequent or
Supplemental EIR with regard to the project amendments is both contrary to CEQA and entirely
inconsistent with impacts identified in the final project EIR, including:

i. The Initial Study failed to mention or address the substantial increase in the
number of single-family residences from the 84 approved by the County to the 180 ultimately
approved by the City, or the ALUC's findings of inconsistency with the original project proposal,
resulting in the County mitigating the identified impacts by substantially reducing the number of
single-family residences, or the specific findings of significance set forth in the final project EIR,

11 related to impacts of the proposed single-family residences. Further, the County's approved plan had

12 no single-family units slated within the B-1 zone, nor Was there an appropriate or adequate
13 environmental analysis conducted to review the impacts of placing single-family homes in the B-1
14 Zone, which the ALUCP defines as being a high noise impact and high-risk level zone. (See
15

16 Declaration of Gregory Plucker.)

17 ü The Initial Study refers to, and relies nearly entirely on, the City's 2007 MEIR,
18 with regard to purported impacts and mitigation measures specific the CIP project. However, the
19 2007 MEIR did not include the CIP project as one of the three projects subject to enviroumental
20 review under the MEIR, which specifically referenced the CIP project as pending annexation into the 21

22 City and being subject to separate enviroumental review. Further, the Initial Study's purported

23 purpose of evaluating the CIP project "for any potential adverse environmental impacts ABOVE

24 AND BEYOND those already identified and mitigated within the above-referenced MHIR, and for
25 some of which the City Council duly adopted a statement of overriding consideration none of the
26
27 project components would cause additional significant effect on the environment which was not

28 previous examined" was entirely inadequate for this purpose.
22

Petition for Writ of Mandate

A

P d. The City's reliance on the Initial Study in lieu of a Subsequent or Supplemental
EIR to assess the additional environmental impacts resulting from the City's substantial amendments
to the size and scope of the CIP project from that approved by the County, and as studied and
mitigated via the final project EIR, was not authorized under law, as follows:

i. The City's reliance on Section 15177, subdivisions (a) and (b), was improper,
as the use of an Initial Study pursuant to Section 15177 is specific to "subsequent projects" that were
cO within the scope of a MEIR. As the CIP project was subject to a project-specific EIR completed by
the County, and which the City's 2007 MEIR, approved the year before the County's approval of the

11 CIP project and final project EIR, did not include the CIP project as one of three identified projects
12 subject to full environmental review, the CIP project was merely a proposal referenced in the MEIR
13 that would be subject to separate enviroumental review pursuant to Public Resource Code section
14 21166.
15 ii. The final project EIR identified numerous significant and unavoidable impacts
17 related to the proposed development of the residential units including but not limited to (1) the project 16

18 being in conflict with the adjacent airport and exposing residents to excessive noise; (2) project 19 inconsistency with the ALUCP regarding noise standards, safety concerns, and incompatible land
20 uses within the overflight zone; (3) ongoing aircraft flights that would expose project residences and 21

22 business to excessive noise levels; and (4) air operations that would expose project residents, visitors,

23 and workers to health and safety risks associated with routine crop dusting. Accordingly, it is

24 incredulous for the City to conclude no additional environmental impacts by way of an Initial Study
25 that failed to consider the substantial increase in the number of single-family residences in relation to
26

27 the above-referenced significant and unavoidable project impacts, which would undoubtedly apply

28 to, and likely be exacerbated by, the additional 40 single-family residences that were not considered

23

Petition for Writ of Mandate

A

1 in the final project EIR, yet approved by the City. Accordingly, the City's reliance on its 2007 MEIR
and 2014 Initial Study for purposes of approving the CIP project's development agreement and
Tentative Map in 2016, and as amended in 2018, was inadequate and contrary to the law, thereby

resulting in the improper and ongoing reliance on an insufficient environmental document, instead of

the final project EIR, in violation of CEQA.

iii. The City's reliance on its July 2021, purported acoustical study in furtherance
of its determination that no additional environmental impacts would result from the project
amendments was inconsistent with mitigation measure LU-1 contained the final project EIR, which 10

11 requires CIP to conduct an acoustical investigation and to recommend measures to achieve

12 acceptable interior noise levels prior to the issuance of building permits to ensure compliance with

13 noise standards. Furtber the City's acoustical study is entirely inadequate for purposes of evaluating
14 the noise impacts resulting from the project's proximity to the Colusa County Airport, which were
15

16 already determined through the final project EIR to be significant and unavoidable, as this 2021 study

17 relied on noise samples taken from the project's model homes in one section of the overall

18 development. Futher, the study itself cautions that the results were not necessarily representative of

19 typical aircraft noise generation at the CIP project site.
20 74.
21 The City's reliance on an improper and entirely inadequate Initial Study for purposes

22 of evaluating the environmental impacts associated with the substantial changes to the scope and size

23 of the project approved by the County in 2008, and in its disregard of the final project EIR, which

24 warranted a Subsequent or Supplemental EIR to fully and adequately evaluate the additional
25 environmental impacts resulting from the project amendments, as well as the identification of any
26

27 additional mitigation measures to reduce such impacts, was not supported by substantial evidence,

28 was made in error, and which prevented informed decision-making and informed public participation

on the Project amendments, thereby constituting a prejudicial abuse of discretion subject to this

Cout's review.

75. Petitioner/County has no plain, speedy, or adequate remnedy in the course of ordinary
law unless this Court grants a writ to require respondents to comply with the requirements of CEQA.

In the absence of such remedies, respondents' actions will continue to violate state law and petitioner
will be irreparably harmed. No money damages or legal remedy could adequately compensate
petitioner for that harm.

SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

CCP Section 1094.5

E2 Preiudicial Abuse of Discretion in City/Respondent's November 2.2021 Findingg in Support of
its Override of ALUC's March 11,2021 Findingy of Project Inconsistency with ALUCP

49 76. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference each and every allegation contained in
Paragraphs 1 through 75, as set forth above.

77. In order for relief to be granted pursuant to CCP Section 1094.5, the petitioner must

6 demonstrate that the respondent has either proceeded without, or in excess of, jurisdiction, whether
there was a fair trial, and/or whether there was a prejudicial abuse of discretion. A prejudicial
20 abuse of discretion is established if the respondent has not proceeded in a manner required by law,

MSHHNNN the order or decision is not supported by the findings, or the fidings are not supported by the
evidence and/or not supported by substantial evidence in light of the whole record.

78. The City's November 2, 2021, hearing to override the ALUC's findings of project
inconsistency with the ALUCP was held purusant to Public Utilities Code section 21676, which, in
order to override the ALUC'S findings of the project's inconsistency with ALUCP, requiried the
City to make specific findings that the propsoed action is consistent with the purposes stated in
25

Petition for Writ of Mandate

1. 1

1 section 21670. Subdivision (a)(1) of section 21670 states in relevant part: "Tt is the purpose of this

2 anticle to protect public health, safety, and welfare by ensuring the orderly expansion of airports and
3 the adoption of land use measures that minimize the public's exposure to excessive noise and safety
hazards within areas around public airports to the extent that these atsas are not already devoted to

incompatible uses."

7 79. The City committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion in making its findings that the
8 CIP project, as amended, was consistent with the purposes stated in Public Utilities Code section
21670, and in its findings that the CIP project, as amended, was consistent with the ALUCP, in that

its decision to override the ALUC decision was not supported by the findings, and further that the
12 findings were not supported by the evidence, as follows in relevant part:
13 City Finding:
14
15 The project will not adversely impact the ability to provide for the orderly development of

16 the area surrounding the airport so as to promote the overall goals and objectives of the City and

17 County noise standards, and will not cause the creation of new noise and safety problems for

18 individuals. The City further found that mitigation measures have been imposed to ensure that the

19 existing exposure to noise levels are consistent with noise standards for residential uses, including
20

21 review of building plans by an, acoustical engineer specific to lots that are located in the noise

22 contour above 70 dBn Ldn shown. in the EIR's noise study who shall detail what additional

23 mitigation measures shall be required in the construct of the home. The City also referenced a July

24 2021 acoustical study that found the "construction of the homes" to be consistent with the indoor
25 noise level of less than 45 dB Ldn.

mN1 Discussion

The City's finding that the project will promote the overall goals and objectives of the City
and County noise standards, and will not cause the creation of new noise and safety problems for
individuals is entirely speculative, inconsistent with the findings of the project EIR, and the ALUC,
and appears to be based largely on an inadequate acoustical study in which the noise samples relied

upon were collected from a small section of the development where model homes were located.
The study itself brought into question the reliability of the results in which it noted that it was
9
possible the aircraft flight conditions were atypical during the survey, and, as a result, the ambient
10

11 noise measurement results were being provided for acoustical context and were not purported to be

12 representative of typical aircraft noise generation at the CIP project site.

13 The City's findings, and the evidence relied on in support thereof, were entirely inadequate
14 and unreliable for purposes of overruling the findings of the ALUC with regard to the identified
15

16 noise impacts that exceeded the standards set forth in the ALUCP, as well as the noise standards set

17 by both the City and County. More specifically, the evidence relied on by the City, and the

18 corresponding findings in support of its override, ignored the County's 2008 approval of the final

19 EIR and adopted mitigation measures, which the City is not implementing, as required by condition
20 3 of the Tentative Map, including those related to the noise impacts and concentration of residential
21

22 units following the ALUC's 2007 findings of inconsistency with the original version of the

23 proposed project, which were contrary to the City's approval of the 2016 and 2018 amendments to

24 the Tentative Map and development agreement and believed to be ignored or disregarded by the
25
8& City on that basis. Rather, in addition to the aforementioned July 2021 noise study, the City
focused its findings on a 2007 MEIR that did not include the CIP project as one of three projects

28 covered by the MEIR for full environmental review, and a 2014 Initial Study that failed to analyze
27

Potition for Writ of Mandate•

or mention the increase in number of single-family residences from the 84 approved by the County
in 2008 to the 180 subsequently approved by the City in 2016, and which constituted 40 more
residence than contemplated and studied in the final project EIR. Nor did the City mention or
analyze the placement of single-family residences in the ALUCP's B-1 high noise and increased
safety risk zone. Further, the City failed to address the fact that its own MEIR references the five-

year time limits of Public Resources Code Section 21157.6 for the use of a MEIR or the associated

exceptions that County contends do not apply.
Such evidence was entirely inadequate for purposes of enabling the City to ovemide the
specific finding by the ALUC that a number of the proposed homes to be constructed pursuant to
Teutative Map 01-18 will have an interior noise level exceeding the ALUCP interim 45 dB Ldn noise standards, thereby making Tentative Map 01-18 inconsistent with the ALUCP. Further, the 14
15
16 ALUC noted that without the acoustical study required by the 2008 final EIR, it is not possible to

63 confirmn with a reasonable high-degree of certainty that the internal noise levels of all the homes
will meet the 45 dB Ldn standard. Without question, the City's July 2021, acoustical study was

19 entirely incomplete and unreliable for this purpose.

20 Accordingly, the City's decision in support of its override of the ALUC findings of project

22 inconsistency with the ALUCP was not supported by the findings, and further the findings were not

23 supported by the evidence. As such, the City's findings were inconsistent with the purposes set

forth in Public Utilities Code section 21670.

24 City Finding:
25

26
27 The project will not adversely impact the ability to protect the public health, safety, and

28 welfare by continuing to ensure the orderly expansion of the airport and will not adversely affect
the utility or capacity of the airport.
28

Petition for Writ of Mandate

Discussion

The City relies on an entirely speculative conclusion that unspecified "future improvement
plans" will be submitted to the Federal Aviation Administration" that will ensure unidentified
"heights" will not be hazard to air navigation. Such a vague and ambiguous finding in support of
the ALUC override fails to effectively address the purpose the ALUC and ALUCP to safeguard the
general welfare of the inhabitants within the vicinity of the airport and the public in general, which

8 is furthered by way of its density standards for residential units within the jurisdiction of the ALUC.
Further, the City's findings fail to address or consider the identified threats to public health, 10

11 safety, and welfare described in the final project EIR, including a significant and unavoidable

12 impact with regard to airport operations involving routine crop dusting, and whether the more than

13 doubling of the single-family residences from that approved by the County in 2008, including the
14 planned location of single-family residences in the B-1 high risk and high noise compatibility zone.
15

16 These changes were not contemplated in the final project EIR, and would certainly result in*

17 increased impacts not studied or contemplated therein.

18 For these reasons, the City's decision supporting its override of this ALUC decision was not
19 supported by the findings, and further the findings were not supported by the evidence. As such,
20 the City's findings were inconsistent with the purposes set forth in Public Utilities Code section
21

22 21670.

23 City Finding:

24 The project will not adversely impact the ability to protect the public health, safety, and
25 welfare and incorporates land and safety hazards within the areas around the public airport to the
26

27 extent that these areas are not already devoted to incompatible uses. In support of this finding, the

28 City contended that the project was not proposing any significant land use changes but rather a

29

Petition for Writ of Mandate

"modest increase in single-family homes and elimination or (sic) high density residential, which
will reduce the overall population for the project."

Discussion

In support of this finding, the City makes several inaccurate, at best, misleading, at worst,
contentions regarding the project's housing density prior to the City's 2016 approval that more than
doubled the number of single-family residences approved by the County in 2008, which the ALUC
concluded "...significantly affected the Board's previously considered compatibility findings and
raised significant questions as to the validity of the Board's earlier finding of consistency." 10

11 Whether a certain number of residential units were "contemplated" by the applicant, or even

12 considered by the County prior to final project approval is entirely irrelevant to the ALUC's
13 determination tbat the City's approval of the increase in the number of residential units, as set forth
14 in Tentative Map 01-18, exceeded the average and maximum density standards set forth in the
15

16 ALUCP with regard to the proposed residential development in Zones B-1, C-1, and C-2.

17 Further, the City's contention in support of its override of this finding by the ALUC that the

18 project incorporates conditions of approval to ensure the public will not be exposed to excessive
19 noise or safety hazards, including noticing project residents of aircraft noise and avigation
20 easements, in combination with Federal Aviation Administration height restrictions so as not to
21

22 create hazards to air navigation, is entirely inadequate in light of the clear airport operation noise

23 impacts that have not been subject to a reliable and adequate acoustical study, as discussed more

24 fully above, and which remains a requirement condition the final project EIR. The City has not
25 provided any reliable or compelling evidence that would overcome the ALUC's finding of
26
27 residential density inconsistency with the ALUCP. Futther, in the absence of subsequent

28 environmental review, including a reliable acoustical study, of the noise and other public health,
30

Petition for Writ of Mandate

*

F safety, and welfare impacts resulting from the increased residential density, the extent to which

such impacts are exacerbated by the City's project amendments, and the extent to which they can be
effectively mitigated remains unknown. The City's more than doubling of the single-family

5 residences originally approved by the County in 2008, including the placement of single-family
homes in the B-1 high risk compatibility zone, the sizeable increase of which exceeds the scope of

7 the final project EIR, remain unstudied within the requirements of CEQA, unmitigated, and

8 inconsistent with the ALUCP. Accordingly, the City's decision to override the ALUC's findings of
9

10 project inconsistency with the ALUCP is not supported by the findings, nor are the findings

11 supported by the evidence. As such, the City's findings were inconsistent with the purposes set

12 forth in Public Utilities Code section 21670.

23 I, Gregory Plucker, declare as follows:
24 1. I am the Community Development Director for the County of Colusa. I have personal 25

26 knowledge of the following, and if called upon to testify thereto, I could and would do so competently

27 2. By way of my position as Community Development Director for the County of Colusa,
28 I am familiar with the current development project at issue in this writ petition, in which Colusa

of certain parcels of land 1 Industrial Properties, Inc., is the Applicant, landowner, and master-developer
2 subject to residential development pursuant to a development agreement with the City of Colusa,|
executed on or about April 18, 2017, pursuant to City Ordinance No. 516, and Tentative Map 01-18, as

about April 3, 2018. approved by the City pursuant to Resolution No. 18-21 on or
4 3. In or around March of 2020, I became aware of Colusa Industrial Properties'
submittal of building permits to the County of Colusa pertaining to the above-mentioned project for
8 purposes of permit sign-off by the County Airport Manager. Based on my review of these building
permits, as well as review by otber County staff, in relation to the County of Colusa's 2008 project 10

11 approval prior to the project site being annexed into the City of Colusa, it was determined that the

12 current CIP project was substantially different from the project approved by the County of Colusa,

13 including the City's approval to allow more single family residences than allowed by the County's
14 2008 project approval and single family residences located in areas of the project site that fall within
15 the County's Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan's B-1 Compatibility Zone. The B-1 Zone is 16

17 identified as a high noise impact and high-risk level zone, which is a Zone not approved by the

18 County of Colusa for the construction of single-family residences, nor considered or analyzed as part

19 of the County of Colusa's Draft Environmental Impact Report or the project's Final Environmental
20 Impact Report. As a result, building permits pertaining to this project that were submitted by the
21 City of Colusa that were determined by the County to be more than the number of lots and/or not 22
County's 2008 CIP project 23 located within the boundary of the 84 residential lots made part of the

24 approval were not to be signed-off by the County of Colusa.

25 4. As a result of the City's subsequent amendments to the aforementioned project, I
26 assisted Greg Hinton, then former Colusa County Airport Manager, in making several formal and
27 informal inquires to the City regarding the project amendments which exceeded the County's 2008 28
2

Deciaration of Gregory Plucker

1 approval of 84 single family homes by 96, and constituted 40 more single family residences than the
2 maximum of 140 single-family homes analyzed under the County's 2007 draft Environmental
3 Impact Report, and which I determined was not within the scope or conformity of project's County 4

5 Final EIR. Subsequent to Mr. Hinton's departure from employment with the County of Colusa, I

6 was assigned additional job responsibilities involving the Colusa County Airport's Land Use

7 Compatibility Plan. In this role I continued to review of the City's project amendments to the CIP
8 residential project, including the status of any noise mitigation measures required by the County's
9 2008 EIR.
10
5.
11 am familiar with the County's draft Environmental Impact Report on this project,

12 and Final Environmental Impact Report, approved in 2008, which requires Colusa Industrial

13 Properties or their successors, to obtain an acoustical investigation, and to recommend measures
14 necessary to achieve acceptable interior noise levels consistent with the County's Airport Land Use
15 Compatibility Plan prior to the issuance of building permits for affected homes. I have since learned 16

17 that the City of Colusa completed an acoustical study in or around July 2021, with the noise samples

18 being recorded from existing homes within the project site.

19 6. I have made several informal inspections of the project site, the most recent occurring
20 on January 12, 2022, during which I confimed ongoing construction activities, including the
21 presence of numerous single-family homes having been constructed and which are under
22

23 construction within the project site.

24 7. Upon review of the aforementioned Tentative Map 01-18, approved by the City of

25 Colusa, I determined that the City of Colusa has authorized Colusa Industrial Properties and
26 successors to construct a portion of the 180 single-family residences within the B-1 Compatibility
27 Zone, which is identified by the County's Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan as a high noise 28

Deciaration of Gregory Plucker

1 impact and high-risk level zone, and was not a zone approved by the County for the construction of
single-family residences, nor considered or analyzed as part of the County of Colusa's Draft
Environmental Impact Report or project's Final Environmental Impact Report. In or around April or

5 May of 2021, building permits for single family residences in the B-1 Compatibility Zone were

Ve submitted to the County for approval. Given that these single family homes were located in the B-1
Compatibility Zone; County staff did not approve these homes for construction. Based on my
8 personal knowledge and observations, the City of Colusa has allowed these homes to be constructed
9 without the approval of the building permits by the County Airport Manager, or a finding of 10

11 consistency of project changes by the County's Airport Land Use Commission, with actual

12 construction of these residences commencing in or around April or May of 2021 subsequent to the

13 County's refusal to approve the building permits.

14 I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of California that the foregoing is
15 true and correct. Executed this _19_ day of January, 2022 in Colusa, California. 16

17 inclusive,

18 Respondents.
19 COLUSA INDUSTRIAL PROPERTIES,
20 INC.,

21 Real Party in Interest.
22

23 I, Gregory Plucker, declare as follows:
24 1. I am the Community Development Director for the County of Colusa. I have personal 25

26 knowledge of the following, and if called upon to testify thereto, I could and would do so competently.

27 2. By way of my position as Community Development Director for the County of Colusa,

28 I am familiar with and have personal knowledge of the County of Colusa's role as the lead agency over

1 this Project prior to it being annexed into the City of Colusa in 2015, including all familiarity with all

2 applications, approvals, and environmental documents related to the Project.
3 3. In 2005, Colusa Industrial Properties submitted an application to the County of 4

5 Colusa to allow the ultimate development of 151 acres of property just south of the City of Colusa

6 in unincorporated Colusa County. Colusa Industrial Properties' proposed development ultimately

7 consisted of a mixed-use community, including approximately 286 residential units, 140 of which

8 were designated as single-family residences, improvements to the existing golf course, various
commercial and office space of approximately 116,580 square feet along State Route 20, and 10

11 wastewater treatment facilities to serve the mixed-use community and other uses. The proposed

12 development of the mixed-use community necessitated amendments to the Colusa County General

13 Plan and Zoning Ordinance, including (1) changes in land use designation for 138 acres from
14 Industrial (T) to Urban Residential (UR), Parks and Recreation (P-R), and Commercial (C); (2)
15

16 change in land use designation for 13 acres from Parks and Recreation (P-R) to Urban Residential

17 (UR); (3) change in zoning for 138 acres from Industrial (M) and Industrial Planned Development

18 (M-PD) to Single Family Residential (R-1-8), High Density Residential (R-4), General Recreation

19 (G-R), Neighborhood Commercial (C-1), Community Commercial (C-2), and Highway
20 Commercial (CH): and (4) change in zoning for 13 acres from General Recreation (G-R) to High 21

22 Density Residential (R-4).

323 4. In or around November 2007, a Draft Environmental Impact Report on the above-

24 referenced project was completed and submitted to the County.
25 5. The Draft Environmental Report noted that the Project was located within the
26 influence of the Colusa County Airport Comprehensive Land Use Plan, thereby necessitating 27

28 review of the Project by the Colusa County Airport Land Use Commission for review and

2

Declaration of Gregory Plucker

1 determination of the Project's consistency with the County's Airport Comprehensive Land Use
2 Plan. The County of Colusa then forwarded the Project to the Airport Land Use Commission for
3 this consistency review.
4
6.
5 On December 18, 2007, the County received the Airport Land Use Commission's
notification of its findings regarding the Project's inconsistency with the Airport Comprehensive

7 Land Use Plan. More specifically, the Airport Land Use Commission's December 17, 2007,
8 findings of Project inconsistency were based, in relevant part, on (1) the proposed concentration
of residential units and people exceeding the limits of the Airport Comprehensive Land Use Plan, 10

11 with the associated risks not being adequately mitigated; (2) a determination that the proposed

12 businesses inside the Safety Area may create a concentration of people that exceed the limits

13 established in the Airport Comprehensive Land Use Plan, with the associated risks not mitigated;
14 and (3) the impact of existing airport noise on the proposed residential units and businesses
15 exceeded the limits established by the Airport Comprehensive Land Use Plan, with the risks not 16

17 fully mitigated.

18 7. On May 27, 2008, the Colusa County Board of Supervisors held a public heating

19 on the Airport Land Use Commission's determination that the proposed project was inconsistent
20 with the Airport Comprehensive Land Use Plan. Following the public hearing, the Board of
21 Supervisors overruled the Airport Land Use Commission's determination that the proposed 22

23 project was inconsistent with the Airport Comprehensive Land Use Plan, finding in accordance

24 with Public Utilities Code section 21676.5(a) that the proposed project was consistent with the
25 purposes set forth in Public Utilities Code section 21670.
26 8. In overruling the Airport Land Use Commission's determination that the proposed 27 project was inconsistent with the Airport Comprehensive Land Use Plan, additional mitigation 28
3

Declaration of Gregory Plucker

1 measures had been drafted to address, to the extent feasible, the issues identified by the Airport

2 Land Use Commission that were deemed inconsistent with the Airport Comprehensive Land Use
3 Plan. Included was new mitigation measure N-4h that reduced the number of low-density
4

5 residential units in the southwest portion of the project area from the maximum of 140 single-

6 family units analyzed in the Draft Environmental Impact Report to 84 single-family units, which

7 resulted in a wider aircraft corridor adjacent to the project area described in the Draft

8 Environmental Impact Report.

9. By way of my position as Community Development Director for the County of
10

11 Colusa, am familiar with the current development project at issue in this writ petition, in which

12 Colusa Industrial Properties, Inc., is the Applicant, landowner, and master-developer of certain

13 parcels of land subject to residential development pursuant to a development agreement with the City

14 of Colusa, executed on or about April 18, 2017, pursuant to City Ordinance No. 516, and Tentative
15 Map 01-18, as approved by the City pursuant to Resolution No. 18-21 on or about April 3, 2018.
16
10.
17 In October 2007, the City of Colusa approved its Master Environmental Impact

18 Report (MEIR) pertaining to its General Plan. This Report noted that the Project site was pending

19 annexation into the City of Colusa and that it was a Colusa County project and that the

20 environmental document was in process.
21 11. On April 18, 2014, the City of Colusa completed an Initial Study on the Project for
22

23 the purpose of evaluating any potential environmental impacts above and beyond those already

24 purported to be listed and mitigated within City of Colusa's MEIR, ultimately concluding that none

25 of the components of the project would cause any additional significant effect on the environment

26 not previously examined in the MEIR. Furthermore, the 2014 Initial Study referenced the CIP EIR
27

28

Declaration of Gregory Plucker

1 certified by the County of Colusa in 2008 and stated that mitigation measures within the CIP EIR

2 apply to the Project,
3 12. In or around March of 2020, I became aware of Colusa Industrial Properties*
4

5 submittal of building permits to the County of Colusa pertaining to the above-mentioned project for

6 purposes of permit sign-off by the County Airport Manager. Based on my review of these building

7 permits, as well as review by other County staff, in relation to the County of Colusa's 2008 project

8 approval prior to the project site being annexed into the City of Colusa, it was determined that the
cutrent CIP project was substantially different from the project approved by the County of Colusa.
10

11 Changes in the City's approval included allowing significantly more single-family homes and

12 allowing residences to be constructed within sections of the project site that fall within the County's

13 Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan's B-1 Compatibility Zone. The B-1 Zone is identified as a

14 high noise impact and bigh-risk level zone, which is a Zone that was not approved by the County of
15 Colusa for the construction of single-family residences, nor considered or analyzed as part of the
16

17 County of Colusa's Draft Environmental Impact Report or final project Environmental Impact

18 Report. As a result, building permits pertaining to this project that were routed by the City of Colusa

19 and determined by the County of Colusa to not be located within the boundary of the 84 residential
20 lots made part of the County's 2008 CIP project approval were not signed-off by the County of
21 Colusa.
22
13.
23 The City of Colusa's discretionary amendments to the Project are not in compliance

24 with the Project's Final Environmental Impact Report approved by the County of Colusa, nor have

25 they been adequately studied pursuant to CEQA. The City of Colusa's approval of an additional 96

26 single-family homes för a. total of 180 single-family homes fall substantially outside the maximum
27 number of 140 single-family homes considered in the Draft Environmental Impact Repoxt. The
28
5

Declaration of Gregory Plucker

1 County of Colusa subsequently reduced the number of single-family residences to 84 following the
2 Airport Land Use Commission's determination that the 140 single-family residences was
m inconsistent with the Airport Land Use Plan and resulted in significant environmental impacts.
14. The City of Colusa's discretionary amendments to the Project resulted in
inadequately studied impacts that cannot be effectively considered and mitigated without a

7 Supplemental or Subsequent Environmental Impact Report to specifically analyze the substantial

8 changes to the Project, including the additional impacts and available mitigation measures
9 associated with the increased single-family units, as the health, safety impacts based on the much 10

11 smaller 84 single-family residential units were already deemed to still be significant.

12 15. Without the appropriate environmental review of the discretionary changes to the

13 Project, the already identified significant and unavoidable impacts identified in the Environmental
14 Impact Report, based on a substantially smaller number of single-family residences, will be further
15 exacerbated. Such significant and unavoidable impacts cannot be minimized by increasing the 16

17 Project's residential footprint by 96 additional single-family homes. Specifically, until fully studied

18 under appropriate environmental review, the substantial increase in the number of single-family

19 residences can only be viewed as an amplification of the significant impacts that were identified in
20 the Draft Environmental Impact Report and subsequent Project's Final Environmental Impact Report
21 as risks to the health and safety of residents and others within the Project area. 22
16. On May 27, 2008, the Colusa County Board of Supervisors approved the General 23

24 Plan Amendment and Zoning Amendment application which allowed the construction of the

25 proposed Project and in doing so also approved a Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program
26 (MMRP) pursuant to the provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act. This MMRP
27 contained dozens of mitigation measures that were developed and adopted in order to avoid or 28

6

Declaration of Gregory Plucker

mitigate potentially significant effects on the environment. In reviewing the City's amended
development approvals and the project under construction, I have been unable to identify how
3 numerous of these adopted mitigation measures have been implemented by the City and a number of 4

5 them now appear to be infeasible due to the project that the City has permitted to be constructed.

6 17. The County of Colusa's Draft Environmental Impact Report and Final

7 Environmental Impact Report, approved in 2008, requires Colusa Industrial Properties or their
8 successors, to obtain an acoustical investigation, and to recommend measures necessary to achieve
acceptable interior noise levels consistent with the County's Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan 10

11 prior to the issuance of building permits for affected homes. I have since learned that the City of

12 Colusa completed an acoustical study in or around July 2021 on several homes, post-construction, in

13 one section of the project site.

14 18. I have made several informal inspections of the project site, the most recent occurring
15 on January 12, 2022, during which I confirmed ongoing construction activities, including the 16

17 presence of numerous single-family homes having been constructed and others under construction

18 within the project site, including within the County's Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan's high
19 noise impact and high-risk level B-1 Compatibility Zone. The construction of the single-family
20 residences in this B-1 area that County staff refused to sign the building permits for was not
21 considered or analyzed as part of the County of Colusa's Draft Environmental Impact Report or the 22

23 Project's Final Enviroumental Impact Report. Despite this lack of County approval and City

24 environmental review, City staff has permitted the construction of these homes in this location.

25 I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of California that the foregoing is
26 true and correct. Executed this 19 day of January, 2022 in Colusa, California.

General Plan and Zoning Amendment Executive Summary Colusa Industrial Properties

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

1.1 PROJECT OVERVIEW
The County of Colusa is the lead agency responsible for preparation of this Draft Environmental Impact Report (EIR). The Draft EIR discusses the environmental effects of implementation of a Colusa County General Plan Amendment and a Zoning Amendment for approximately 138 acres in the northern portion of the Colusa Industrial Park (Park) and 13 acres within the Colusa Golf and Country Club, and it evaluates the environmental effects of wastewater treatment facilities in the Park. The project area is located just south of the City of Colusa in unincorporated Colusa County (maps are provided in Chapter 3). Colusa Industrial Properties, owner of the Park, has submitted an application to the County to allow residential, commercial, and recreational uses on 151 acres and to construct the associated utilities and service systems, including on-site wastewater treatment facilities.
The project would consist of a mixed-use community with approximately 286 residential units, improvements to the existing golf course, various commercial and office uses along State Route (SR) 20 (approximately 116,580 square feet), and wastewater treatment facilities to serve the mixed-use community and other uses in the Park. Development of the mixed-use community would require the following amendments to the Colusa County General Plan and Zoning Ordinance:
Change in land use designation for 138 acres from Industrial (I) to Urban Residential (UR), Parks and Recreation (P-R), and Commercial (C).
Change in land use designation for 13 acres from Parks and Recreation (P-R) to Urban Residential (UR).
Change in zoning for 138 acres from Industrial (M) and Industrial Planned Development (M-PD) to Single Family Residential (R-1-8), High Density Residential (R-4), General Recreation (G-R), Neighborhood Commercial (C-1), Community Commercial (C-2), and Highway Commercial (CH).
Change in zoning for 13 acres from General Recreation (G-R) to High Density Residential (R-4).
Construction of the wastewater treatment facilities would not require a General Plan Amendment or Zoning Amendment; the proposed site is currently zoned for Industrial (M) with a land use designation of a Industrial (I). A conditional use permit would be required.
The residential community would include approximately 140 single-family homes and 30 condominiums or townhomes in the northwestern portion of the Park and approximately 116 apartments along SR 20, north of the existing office buildings. The office and commercial uses would include office buildings, a hotel or motel, family restaurant, gas station, and other small retail services. The Colusa Golf and Country Club would be expanded to include a new clubhouse, driving range, parking area, and cart sheds, with two holes being redesigned and located south of the existing golf course.
The water supply for the project would be provided by two existing, permitted groundwater wells in the northern end of the Park. Wastewater treatment service would be provided by a proposed wastewater treatment plant in the southern end of the Park. Sewers, water supply pipelines, and storm drains would be constructed throughout the mixed-use community as part of the development.

General Plan and Zoning Amendment Executive Summary Colusa Industrial Properties
Other project features include the realignment and extension of Farinon Road through the mixed-use community to Wescott Road, walking and biking trails along Farinon Road and near the golf course, and a potential overflight corridor with hangar access. Farinon Road would be shifted north, outside of the Colusa County Airport property, and would travel along the east side of the single family homes and exit the project area to the northwest, connecting to Wescott Road. Sunrise Boulevard, which currently provides access to the office buildings in the northern end of the Park, would terminate on the east side of the proposed golf course expansion. A 150-foot wide overflight corridor may be designated along the southern side of the single family homes. The single family homes would also be setback from the adjacent agricultural uses to the west by a 100-foot a open space buffer.
The applicant's project objectives are as follows:
1. Create a mixed-use community that can serve as the gateway to the City of Colusa and provides superior quality development with an aesthetically pleasing landscape. 2. Provide a mix of uses and facilities that create a positive financial impact on the County over the long term.
3. Provide a recreational area that benefits the community and increases tourism revenue in the County and City of Colusa.
4. Accommodate a percentage of future job creation and population growth by providing office and commercial space and residential units in a mix of residential unit types and densities.

1.2 SCOPE AND CONTENT OF EIR
The purpose of this EIR is to provide decision-makers, public agencies, and the general public® with information on the significant environmental effects of the project and to identify feasible alternatives and mitigation measures to avoid or reduce those effects.
The EIR will also be used as a reference document a for subsequent review of tentative subdivision maps. Although the tentative subdivision maps will be a separate, future discretionary approval requiring CEQA compliance, the project analyzed in this EIR includes preliminary subdivision plans, and the EIR addresses reasonably foreseeable impacts of these preliminary plans.

1.3 SUMMARY OF IMPACTS AND MITIGATION MEASURES
The following environmental impact and mitigation summary table (Table 1-1 Summary of Impacts and Mitigation Measures) provides an overview of the environmental effects of the project and the mitigation measures recommended to eliminate or reduce the impacts. The residual impact after mitigation is also identified. Detailed discussions of each of the identified impacts and mitigation measures, including pertinent support data, can be found in the specific topic sections in Chapter 4 of this Draft EIR.
This Draft EIR has identified impacts associated with the following resources as significant:

Land Use
Population, Housing, and Employment
Public Services
Transportation and Traffic
Noise
Air Quality

1.4 SCOPING PROCESS
Colusa County distributed a Notice of Preparation in May 2006 to federal, state, and local agencies and other interested parties to solicit comments on the project and scope of the EIR (see Appendix A). A public scoping meeting was held on June 14, 2006 to present the project to the public and solicit additional feedback. Concerns raised during the meeting and comment period relate primarily to the project's close proximity to the Colusa County Airport, its consistency with applicable land use plans, and were raised regarding the provision of its compatibility with surrounding land uses. Additional concerns public services and the effects of the project's demand on County and City of Colusa service providers. Colusa County also identified specific concerns with the project in an Initial Study prepared in 2005 for the initial project application (see Appendix B). Concerns raised by Colusa County in response to the project application and by the public and other agencies during the scoping period were considered during preparation of the Draft EIR and are summarized below (refer to Chapter 2 Introduction for a more detailed summary). Comment letters are provided in Appendix A, and a copy of the County's Initial Study is provided in Appendix B.
The following environmental effects were identified as concerns by the County, public, and other agencies:

Land Use: Compatibility with adjacent land uses; consistency with land use plans. Population and Housing: Potential growth-inducing effects. Public Services: Ability of City and County service providers and facilities to serve project. Transportation and Traffic: Effects of increased traffic on City streets and intersections. Noise: Effects of aircraft noise during take-offs to the north over the project area; effects of noise from nearby industrial operations.
Air Quality: Effects of dust generated by nearby industrial operations; increased pollutants from construction and traffic emissions.
Utilities and Service Systems: Ability of proposed or existing systems to meet project's demand; increased wastewater and impacts on water quality.
Hydrology and Water Quality: Effects of increased runoff from City and project; effects of construction and urban runoff on water quality.
Geology and Soils: Effects of expansive soils on project development; effects of construction on soils.
Hazards and Hazardous Materials: Effects of project on public safety and emergency access; effects of airport operations on project.
Biological Resources: Potential adverse effects on sensitive wetlands and special-status species. biological resources, including
Cultural Resources: Potential adverse effects on historic resources.
Agricultural Resources: Effects of project on adjacent farmland; loss of prime farmland. Aesthetics: Effects of project development on visual resources.

1.5 AREAS OF KNOWN CONTROVERSY
Of the issues identified above, impacts related to public services, transportation and traffic, noise, hazards and hazardous materials, and utilities and service systems as well as the project's proximity to the Colusa County Airport are likely to continue to be of concern to Draft EIR reviewers.

Executive Summary General Plan and Zoning Amendment Colusa Industrial Properties

1.6 ALTERNATIVES TO THE PROJECT
Two land use alternatives, a wastewater facility alternative, and the No Project Alternative were evaluated in this EIR. The land use alternatives include a reduced residential density alternative, which reduces all residential densities to five units per acre to be consistent with residential uses allowed within the Colusa County Airport overflight zone, and a reduced commercial zone alternative, which designates the commercial zone along SR 20 as Industrial (M) instead of Highway Commercial (C-2/CH). The wastewater facility alternative discusses the potential for the project to connect into the City of Colusa's wastewater treatment facility. The No Project Alternative assumes no change in land uses in the Park and development of land uses allowed under its current zoning (Industrial) and Declaration of Protective Covenants. Table 1-1 provides a summary comparison of the environmental effects of the project and each alternative. The feasibility of each alternative is discussed in Chapter 8 Alternatives.

General Plan and Zoning Amendment Introduction Colusa Industrial Properties

2. INTRODUCTION

The County of Colusa is the lead agency responsible for preparation of this Draft Environmental Impact Report (EIR). The Draft EIR discusses the environmental effects of implementation of a Colusa County General Plan Amendment and a Zoning Amendment for approximately 138 acres in the northern portion of the Colusa Industrial Park (Park) and 13 acres within the Colusa Golf and Country Club, and it evaluates the environmental effects of wastewater treatment facilities in the Park. The project area is located just south of the City of Colusa in unincorporated Colusa County (maps are provided in Chapter 3). Colusa Industrial Properties (CIP), owner of the Park, has submitted an application to the County to allow residential, commercial, and recreational uses on 151 acres and to construct the associated utilities and service systems, including on-site wastewater treatment facilities.
This chapter provides an overview of the BIR and the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) review process.

2.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE OF EIR
The purpose of this EIR is to provide decision-makers, public agencies, and the general public with information on the significant environmental effects of the project and identify feasible alternatives and mitigation measures to avoid or reduce those effects. The EIR describes the anticipated effects of the project on the following resources:

Land Use
Population, Housing, and Employment
Public Services
Transportation and Traffic
Noise
Air Quality
Utilities and Service Systems
Hydrology and Water Quality
Geology and Soils
Hazards and Hazardous Materials
Biological Resources
Agricultural Resources
Cultural Resources
Aesthetics

The EIR will also be used as a reference document for subsequent review of tentative subdivision maps. Although the tentative subdivision maps will be a separate, future discretionary approval requiring CEQA compliance, the project analyzed in this EIR includes preliminary subdivision plans and the EIR addresses reasonably foreseeable impacts of these preliminary plans.

General Plan and Zoning Amendment Introduction Colusa Industrial Properties

2.2 CEQA REQUIREMENTS AND SCOPING PROCESS
The Draft BIR has been prepared in accordance with CEQA (Public Resources Code Secs. 21000 et seq.) and the CEQA Guidelines (14 Cal. Code Regs Secs. 15000 et seq). The EIR has also been prepared pursuant to Colusa County CEQA requirements.

2.2.1 Notice of Preparation
In compliance with Section 15082 of the CEQA Guidelines, the County circulated a Notice of Preparation (NOP) on May 16, 2006 to interested agencies, groups, and individuals, including the State Clearinghouse. The State Clearinghouse assigned a state identification number (SCH #2006052113) to this EIR. The NOP was intended to encourage interagency communication and provide sufficient background information about the project to enable agencies, organizations, and individuals to respond with specific comments on the scope and content of the EIR.
A public scoping meeting was held at the Colusa Industrial Park on June 14, 2006. All comments received during the NOP public notice period and scoping meeting were considered during the preparation of this Draft EIR. The NOP and comment letters are included in Appendix A.

2.2.2 Public and Agency Scoping
Comment letters received in response to the NOP expressed concern with the project's effects on public services in the City of Colusa and fire protection services, economic feasibility, proximity to industrial uses (air and noise concerns), and land use compatibility (Appendix A). The public scoping meeting also identified a variety of issues relating to land use compatibility, services, and project details. Colusa County identified specific concerns with the project in an Initial Study prepared in 2005 for the initial project application (see Appendix B). County concerns focused on the proximity of the project to the adjacent Colusa County Airport, industrial uses, and agricultural uses and the potential effects of the project on the adjacent land uses.
The County has also contacted local Native American tribes to solicit input on potential concerns and cultural resources that may be affected by the project and to comply with Senate Bill 18 (SB 18), which requires lead agencies to contact the tribes when projects require a General Plan or Specific Plan amendment or adoption. Letters were mailed to four tribes in May 2006; one tribe requested consultation, and follow-up letters were sent by the County to the four tribes as well as seven other Native American groups and individuals. Additional information on the consultation process is provided in the cultural resources report in Appendix H.
Table 2-1 summarizes concerns raised during the scoping period and identifies where they are addressed in this document.

3. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This chapter provides a description of the project, including the proposed land use and zoning changes, project objectives, utilities and service systems to serve the project's land uses, and the phasing of the development. Anticipated approvals and permits are provided at the end of this chapter.

3.1 PROJECT LOCATION AND BACKGROUND
Colusa Industrial Properties (CIP) is proposing a Colusa County General Plan Amendment and Zoning Amendment to change land use designations and zoning classifications on 151 acres within the Colusa Industrial Park (Park) and the adjacent Colusa Golf and Country Club. The Park and Golf and Country Club are located entirely within unincorporated Colusa County, just south of the City of Colusa and west of State Route (SR) 20 (Figure 3-1). The project area encompasses approximately 138 acres within the northernmost portion of the 950-acre Park, 13 acres within the Colusa Golf and Country Club, and 34 acres in the southern portion of the Park. The proposed development area includes the 138 acres in the north and the 13 acres on the golf course, and proposed wastewater treatment facilities would be located on a 34-acre site about one mile south of the development area. The Colusa County Airport is located south of the development area, and the Colusa Golf and Country Club is adjacent to the northern boundary of the Park. Surrounding land uses include agriculture fields, industrial facilities, and residential development.

The Park was established in 1981 when Colusa County approved development of approximately 253 acres for industrial and commercial uses (Colusa County 1981). The land was divided into 5- and 10-acre parcels with smaller parcels along SR 20. The larger parcels in the southern portion are used for industrial uses, including agricultural processing facilities and fertilizer suppliers. Professional offices were constructed on the smaller parcels in the northern portion; Colusa County, Natural Resources Conservation Service, CIP, and various service and other companies currently use these offices. This portion of the Park is currently zoned Industrial (M) and Industrial-Planned Development (M-PD) and has
a land use designation of Industrial (T). The Colusa County General Plan (1989) acknowledged the 253- acre Park as an industrial area with vacant parcels capable of accommodating the City of Colusa's projected industrial growth.
In the early 1990s, another 195 acres were added to the Park following Colusa County certification of a Supplemental EIR (Colusa County 1992). The Park's expansion required an amendment to the Colusa County General Plan to designate the land for industrial uses. The 195 acres are located south of the original 253-acre Park, just south of an old Southern Pacific Railroad right-of-way (ROW). The land was designated Agriculture-General (A-G) and zoned for Exclusive Agriculture (E-A) in the 1989 General Plan and was changed to Industrial in 1992. Current uses on this land include industrial processing facilities, industrial process wastewater disposal (land application), and domestic wastewater evaporation ponds. The proposed wastewater treatment facilities would be located within the existing 34-acre land application site used for industrial process wastewater disposal.
In 2004 another 502 acres of land were added to the Park (ECO-ANALYSTS 2005). This land is referred to as the Davis property and is used for rice production. The property has a land use designation of Agriculture-General and is zoned for Exclusive Agriculture. The easternmost 150 acres are equipped to receive industrial process wastewater. Groundwater monitoring wells have been installed in the four corners of the 150-acre site to monitor water quality in accordance with a Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) permit. Ditches surround the rice fields and are used to convey flows to the land for flood irrigation and detain and recycle surface flows to prevent it from exiting the site.

3.2 PROJECT DESCRIPTION

3.2.1 Project Objectives
The applicant's project objectives are as follows:

1. Create a mixed-use community that can serve as the gateway to the City of Colusa and provides superior quality development with an aesthetically pleasing landscape.
2. Provide a mix of uses and facilities that create a positive financial impact on the County over the long term.
3. Provide recreational area that benefits the community and increases tourism revenue in the County and City of Colusa.
4. Accommodate a percentage of future job creation and population growth by providing office and commercial space and residential units in a mix of residential unit types and densities.

3.2.2 Land Use and Zoning Changes
As part of the General Plan Amendment, the land use designation for the development area within the Park (138 acres) would change from Industrial (I) to Urban Residential (UR), Parks and Recreation (P-R), and Commercial (C) (Figure 3-2 and Table 3-1). The land use designation for the 13 acres within the Golf and Country Club would change from Parks and Recreation (P-R) to Urban Residential (UR). No land use changes are proposed for the wastewater treatment facilities.
Under the Zoning Amendment, zoning classifications for the development area within the Park would change from Industrial (M) and Industrial Planned Development (M-PD) to Single Family Residential (R- 1-8), High Density Residential (R-4), General Recreation (G-R), Neighborhood Commercial (C-1), Community Commercial (C-2), and Highway Commercial (CH). Zoning classification for the 13 acres within the Golf and Country Club would change from General Recreation (G-R) to High Density Residential (R-4). No zoning changes are proposed for the wastewater treatment facilities.

Project Description General Plan and Zoning Amendment Colusa Industrial Properties
A maximum of 140 single-family residential units would be constructed in the western portion of the development area. The total number of single-family units would be identified on the tentative subdivision map, which would be submitted to the County for review after the requested amendments are processed. The total number of single-family units could range from approximately 119 units to a maximum of 140 units. The number of units is dependent on the location of an overflight corridor; if the corridor is outside the project area, the maximum number of units could be constructed (see below). A 100-foot wide open space buffer would be designated along the western boundary of the single-family homes to provide a buffer between the adjacent agricultural lands and the development.
Approximately 30 condominiums or townhomes would be located on a 3.4-acre parcel between the single-family homes and the golf course expansion. Approximately 116 high-density residential units would be located on a 13.2-acre parcel along SR 20, where three holes of the golf course currently occur. The high-density units would be constructed as part of a second or later phase of the project, as described in Section 3.2.4, Phases.
As part of the project, the Golf and Country Club, a public 9-hole golf course, would be slightly modified to relocate two holes away from SR 20. The locations of these holes currently pose problems as golf balls are often hit onto the highway and into traffic. CIP proposes to relocate the two holes onto the 56 acres of land within the Park that would be zoned for general recreation. In addition to relocating two of the holes, CIP would construct a new clubhouse, new driving range, cart sheds, and parking area, which would be part of the second phase of construction (see Section 3.2.4, Phases). The golf course would continue to be open to the public. The general recreation-zoned area would also include walking trails and a bike path to provide recreational opportunities for residents.
Proposed commercial facilities along SR 20 include a hotel or motel, family restaurant, retail services, and a gas station. These facilities would be located adjacent to the highway and would be easily accessible from Sunrise Boulevard and Davison Drive. In addition to the commercial facilities, the project would involve construction of new office buildings and commercial services between Sunrise Boulevard and Farinon Road, to the west of the commercial facilities. The total square footage of commercial and office space in the project area would be approximately 116,580 square feet, including 36,580 square feet of existing office buildings (Table 3-2).

The layout for the hotel/motel and restaurant along SR 20 would allow for an approximately 20-foot wide landscaped buffer zone between the buildings and the highway according to early conceptual diagrams provided by CIP. The restaurant would include an approximate 50-foot by 100-foot building with the capacity to serve 300 to 500 meals per day. Parking would be provided for approximately 58 cars plus two handicap spaces. The hotel/motel would provide for a maximum of 75 units with spaces. Specific plans for the commercial uses would zoning amendments, as part adequate parking be identified following approval of the land use and of the tentative subdivision map approval process.
An overflight corridor may be designated along the southern boundary of the low density residential area to provide a corridor for crop-dusting planes to fly over the area and reduce safety concerns for residents. This corridor would be approximately 150 feet wide and may include hangar access from the homes adjacent to the corridor. As an alternative to the corridor within the project area, the corridor may be designated along the southern boundary of the development area to maximize the number of low density residential lots (see Figure 3-2, alternative overflight corridor). For purposes of the environmental analysis, the maximum number of single-family homes (140) that could be developed with the overflight corridor adjacent to the southern boundary (outside of the development area) is evaluated in this EIR.
The wastewater treatment facilities would include a 1,526-square foot building, 532-square foot filtration yard, and land disposal area (approximately 34 acres). The building would be setback from other land uses by 150 feet on all sides. Details on these facilities are provided in the following section.

3.2.3 Utilities and Services
To accommodate the project, existing infrastructure would need to be expanded or improved, and new facilities would be constructed.
Roadway improvements would include expanding Farinon Road along the southern boundary of the mixed-use community to a four-lane road that feeds the center of the Park and the development (Figure 3-2). Farinon Road, just west of SR 20, would be relocated about 100 feet to the north to move it out of the airport property and place it approximately 560 feet from the end of the airport runway. The road would also be extended from the northwest corner of the low-density residential area to Wescott Road to provide alternate access west of the project area. The extension would be located within a 60-foot corridor owned by CIP and would follow the southern boundary of the City of Colusa, adjacent to a residential development. It would be designed with two lanes initially, but could be expanded to provide four lanes to accommodate traffic demands. Sunrise Boulevard would terminate in a cul-de-sac at the eastern side of the golf course. Davison Drive would be expanded south of Sunrise Boulevard as a two-

lane road to a serve as a frontage road for the commercial and office uses along SR 20. It may also connect to Farinon Road, pending final road designs.
Recreation within the mixed-use community would include a bike path along the extension of Farinon
Road and walking trails near the golf course. The golf course would also provide recreation opportunities for future residents in the project area and vicinity as well as visitors to the area.
Water supply for the project would be provided by CIP's existing state-licensed water system (Permit #01-21-03P06001). The CIP water system serves current uses within the Park and the adjacent golf course
by providing chlorinated water from two groundwater wells on the property. The two wells are located within the development area, just east of the ditch and north of Farinon Road (Figure 3-3). The wells include a submersible well with a capacity of supplying approximately 650 gallons per minute (gpm) and a turbine well with capacity to supply approximately 1,100 gpm. Additionally, the well system includes a back-up system with a 50,000-gallon fire water storage tank. CIP may also construct a new well in the Park in the future (Figure 3-3), but details of the well are not known at this time and will not be evaluated
in this EIR. The estimated water supply demand for new development in the project area is approximately 290 gallons per minute or 417,600 gallons per day (average day demand) (see Appendix F).
Residential lots would connect into 8-inch water supply pipelines under the proposed roads within the subdivision (California Engineering Company 2006). These pipelines would connect into a new 10-inch a wide pipeline under Farinon Road. The pipeline under Farinon Road would connect into an existing 10- inch wide pipeline that currently distributes water from the groundwater wells to the industrial buildings and offices in the Park. An 8-inch pipeline would also be constructed along the existing road on the west side of the ditch to provide potable water for the wastewater facility. This pipeline would connect into an existing pipeline at Niagara Avenue.
These pipelines have been sized to meet standards established by the City of Colusa (the County does not have standards), which require a minimum water pipe diameter of 8 inches (California Engineering Company 2006). The 10-inch line under the expansion of Farinon Road was selected so that it would
match with the existing 10-inch line. The maximum capacity for an 8-inch water line is approximately 1.2
million gallons per day (mgd). The maximum capacity for a 10-inch water line is approximately 2.3 mgd.
Wastewater treatment service for the project would be provided by the proposed CIP Water Reclamation Facility (wastewater facility) in the southern end of the Park, 1.2 miles south of the mixed-
use community (Figure 3-3). The wastewater facility has been designed to serve the mixed use
community as well as industrial and office tenants within the Park (domestic wastewater only). The wastewater facility would either be operated by the City of Colusa or a new county service area, which would ultimately be managed by the residents. Operation by the City of Colusa would require annexation of the project into the City, which would require Colusa County Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) approval and subsequent environmental reviews. Alternatively, creation of a new county
service area would also require LAFCO approval and possibly subsequent environmental reviews, but the project may need to be removed from the City's sphere of influence in order to allow the creation of a county service area (Benoit 2007). This document assumes that a service provider will be identified and approved by LAFCO prior to project implementation.
The existing treatment and disposal system for domestic wastewater consists of septic tanks within each industrial and commercial parcel, leach fields in some parcels, and pipelines to convey "grey" water from parcels without leach fields to a domestic wastewater pond (Pond 1 on Figure 3-3). Pond 1 is lined and
serves as an evaporation pond without discharging to nearby surface waters. The second and larger pond (Pond 2) serves as an emergency overflow pond for industrial process wastewater only. Water in Pond 2 can be pumped into nearby fields to irrigate crops when it is used. Industrial process wastewater

generated by CIP tenants is used for land application within the Park in accordance with Waste Discharge
Requirements (WDRs, Order No. 5-01-250) issued by the Central Valley RWQCB. The WDRs are in the
process of being revised to allow land application of treated domestic wastewater within the Park.
The new wastewater facility would have capacity to treat 100,000 gallons per day (gpd), maximum month day flow. The residential and commercial uses would generate an estimated 90,000 gpd, average dry weather flow (California Engineering Company 2006). The facility would have an activated sludge process system that utilizes hybrid sequencing batch reactor technology (Pacific Environmental Resources Corporation 2006). The system would produce tertiary effluent complying with California Title 22 standards. The facility would include the following equipment: an influent lift station and screen, anoxic reactor, sequencing batch reactor, decant surge tank, tertiary filtration units, ultraviolet channel, sludge storage tanks, and passive and active odor control systems. Power would be supplied to the facility
using an automatic transfer switch to provide a primary power source and generator for alternate power. Loss of the primary source power would trigger the generator to automatically start; the generator would be capable of running for up to 12 hours if needed.
Treated effluent would be used for land application and may be used for irrigation of the golf course in the future. Land application would include discharging the effluent to the existing cropland surrounding the treatment facility (approximately 34 acres of cropland available). The 34-acre site would be sufficient for disposing the effluent according to Pacific Environmental Resources Corporation, the engineering firm designing the wastewater facility. Disposal of the effluent would be rotated periodically between the existing crops to minimize salt build-up. The 34 acres at the proposed facility site are currently used for disposal of industrial process wastewater, and the entire site has been permitted for land application of industrial process wastewater under the RWQCB permit. The industrial process wastewater would be redirected to land south of the facility site (approximately 150 acres), which is also currently permitted for land application under the RWQCB permit. Distribution pipelines are currently in place to dispose of the industrial wastewater on the 150 acres of land because groundwater is currently piped to the fields for irrigation. The existing evaporation ponds would be used for overflow and emergency storage purposes,
as needed. No improvements or expansions to these ponds are proposed at this time.

Sewer service would be provided for residential, commercial, and industrial customers via 8- to 10-inch
sewers throughout the Park (California Engineering Company 2006). The sewers would be constructed under existing and proposed roads (Figure 3-3). The 8-inch sewers would collect wastewater within the developed areas and convey it along Niagara Avenue to a 10-inch sewer where Niagara Avenue crosses the ditch. The 10-inch sewer would also collect domestic wastewater from the industrial facilities along Niagara Avenue and Otterson Drive. It would follow an existing graded road, which follows the ditch
between industrial buildings and the eastern side of the wastewater ponds, to the wastewater facility.

The minimum pipe size for main sewer lines for development projects is typically 6 inches (California Engineering Company 2006). The project would have a minimum pipe size of 8 inches, which would allow gravity to transport the wastewater and minimize the number of required lift stations (five are proposed throughout the Park). The maximum capacity for an 8-inch sewer line is approximately 0.6 mgd. a The maximum capacity for a 10-inch sewer line is approximately 0.9 mgd.

The existing storm drain system within the Park would be expanded to include several storm drains
under the residential areas. Pipelines would be constructed under proposed roads to drain stormwater from the low density and high density areas in the western portion of the project area. The storm drains would include 15-inch, 18-inch, 24-inch, and 30-inch pipelines under the roads within the low density residential area and 15-inch, 24-inch, 48-inch, and 54-inch pipelines under Farinon Road, with increasing diameters from north to south (California Engineering Company 2006). A 42-inch storm drain would connect the low density residential area to the storm drain under Farinon Road. The storm drains would
discharge into the unnamed ditch, or conveyance lateral, running through the Park. No improvements or
modifications to the unnamed ditch are proposed as part of the project. Existing storm drains would also be expanded in the eastern portion of the project area (where commercial and office uses are proposed) to drain into an existing unlined detention pond. The detention pond was constructed in summer 2006 to detain run-off from the highway and a portion of the commercial/office area. The detention pond has capacity to detain flows from a 100-year storm event and discharges the flows into the ditch.
The drainage system pipelines have been sized to meet the City of Colusa standards of a minimum pipe size of 15 inches because the County does not currently have standards. The maximum capacity for the various pipe sizes as shown on the storm drain master plan (California Engineering Company 2006) are as
follows:

15-inch - 1.6 mgd
18-inch - 2.3 mgd
24-inch - 4.1 mgd
30-inch - 6.5 mgd
42-inch - 14.5 mgd
48-inch - 20.8 mgd
54-inch - 28.4 mgd
Solid waste pick-up service would be provided by NorCal Waste Systems, which currently serves the Park. NorCal Waste Systems provides trash and recycling services and operates transfer stations and landfills in the County, including the Maxwell Transfer Station. Solid waste from the Park is currently taken to the Maxwell Transfer Station about 15 miles northwest of the project area, where it is sorted, and non-recyclable materials are transported to the Ostrom Road Landfill in Yuba County.

3.2.4 Phases
Prior to development of the mixed-use community, the wastewater treatment facilities would be constructed and in operation. These facilities are expected to begin construction in 2008, once all permits and approvals have been received.
The first phase of the development would involve construction of single-family homes, two holes to expand the golf course, commercial facilities along SR 20, and some office buildings. This phase is tied to
completion of the wastewater treatment facility, which would need to be operating before the homes and other buildings can be completed. As part of the first phase, a hotel or motel, family-style restaurant, and gas station would be constructed along SR 20. Construction of the first phase is expected to begin by the end of 2008.

The second phase of the development would involve construction of the high-density homes on 13.2-acre and 3.4-acre parcels (see Figure 3-2), completion of the golf course (a clubhouse and other upgrades), and construction of additional office buildings. The second phase of construction is tied to the relocation of

Environmental Impact Report 3-14

General Plan and Zoning Amendment
Project Description Colusa Industrial Properties

the two holes for the golf course. Construction of the high-density units on the 13.2-acre parcel along SR 20 would require the transfer of the land from the golf course owner to CIP. The golf course expansion area would be traded for the 13.2 acres. Buildout of the project area is expected to be complete within two to three years after the start of construction or by the end of 2010.

3.3 POTENTIAL APPROVALS AND PERMITS
Construction of the project may require several local, state and federal permits and approvals. The following table (Table 3-3) provides a list of potential permits or discretionary actions and the agencies responsible for issuing the permits or approving the action. These agencies may use the EIR for their review or approval process. Colusa County LAFCO may a be a responsible agency in terms of identifying
an operator for the proposed wastewater facilities.
Colusa County will require a development agreement with the applicant to identify specific mitigation
requirements, including those identified in this Draft EIR, and additional measures, such as additional
funding, that the County deems appropriate and necessary to offset the project's physical and economic impacts. To the extent feasible, the County will identify specific funding requirements in the agreement to enforce the applicant's payment of fair share mitigation measures, as identified in this Draft EIR.
Specifically, to the extent feasible, the costs of the project's fair share of road improvements and some public services will be identified in the agreement. The payments will be held in escrow pending full funding by other developer fees or other sources. The specific costs for facilities and improvements in the City will be identified through coordination with the City. Road improvement costs may be identified
through the City's Streets and Roadways Master Plan, to be developed following completion of the City's General Plan Update. The development agreement will enforce payment of all necessary fees prior to issuance of building permits.

4. IMPACT ANALYSIS

This chapter describes applicable laws and regulations and the environmental setting of the project area and evaluates the environmental effects that would occur with implementation of the project. Each resource section includes a summary of applicable laws, regulations, and policies; a description of the existing conditions in the project area; the methodology used to evaluate impacts; the thresholds for
determining impact significance; an impact analysis; and a list of mitigation measures to reduce
significant impacts, where possible. Cumulative impacts of the project with other foreseeable projects in
the area are evaluated in Chapter 5; the project's contribution to global climate change is discussed in
Chapter 6; and growth-inducing effects of the project are discussed in Chapter 7.
Colusa County completed an Initial Study in October 2005 to identify resources that may be affected by
project activities (Appendix B). Most of the resources were determined to have potentially significant
adverse effects as a result of the project; therefore, they are evaluated in this chapter of the Draft Environmental Impact Report (EIR). Mineral resources would not be affected by the project and are not further considered in this document.

4.1 LAND USE
This section describes land uses in the project area and immediate vicinity and addresses issues related to
potential inconsistency of the project with land use plans and policies. This section also summarizes the project's physical and operational compatibility with the surrounding existing and planned environment. Detailed analyses of land use compatibility issues, such as visual impact (aesthetics), noise, and traffic, are fully evaluated in other sections of the EIR. Those issues are summarized in this section in the context
of overall land use compatibility.

4.1.1 Setting

Regulatory Setting
Land use in the project area is guided by the Colusa County General Plan (General Plan). The General Plan was adopted in 1989, and the Housing Element was revised and readopted in 2003 and 2004. The
General Plan is a comprehensive, long-range plan for the physical development of unincorporated land
within the County. The General Plan governs the intensity and location of land use throughout the County and designates land use categories for land within the County. The General Plan's land use designations for the project area and surrounding properties are described in the Environmental Setting.
The General Plan includes the County's stated policies for the use of public and private land. These policies cover range of land use planning issues and are intended to guide County decision-making for land use in the County. Many of the General Plan policies relate to environmental issues and are intended to avoid or mitigate environmental effects. The land use policies that are relevant to the project and the project area are presented in Table 4.1-1, along with an analysis of the consistency of the project with those policies.

In the 1960s the California legislature created a system of county commissions to regulate land planning in the vicinity of airports (Public Utilities Code Sections 21670 - 21679.5). Under this law, Airport Land Use Commissions (ALUCs) have been established for public use airports.
ALUCs are required to adopt compatibility plans for their airports. Safety and noise are the two fundamental compatibility concerns. Safety is addressed by building height restricts that protect airport airspace from obstructions and other hazards and by airport safety zones that limit land uses to protect people and property on the ground near airports. Noise concerns are addressed by drawing noise contours and establishing noise criteria for different land uses. Compatibility determinations are guided by the "California Airport Land Use Planning Handbook" (Caltrans 2002).
Local governments must refer proposed land use changes that require general plan and zoning ordinance amendments, such as the CIP project, to the ALUC for review of project consistency with CLUP standards. The ALUC determines whether the project is compatible, compatible subject to specific conditions, or incompatible, and transmits t formal consistency review to the local government. If the ALUC determines the project is inconsistent with the compatibility plan, the local government must either disapprove the project or make specific findings that the project is consistent with the purpose of the Public Utilities Code (i.e., protecting public health, safety, and welfare).
The Colusa County Airport CLUP was adopted in 1995. The CLUP includes policies that establish land use compatibility standards for height restrictions, noise compatibility, and safety of persons on the ground. These standards are applied primarily to proposed new land use in the airport vicinity and not to existing development that may be inconsistent with the standards. Proposed land uses must be compatible with each of the CLUP's height, noise, and safety standards to be considered consistent with the CLUP.
On overview of the CLUP's height, noise, and safety standards is provided below.

Height Restrictions
The height restrictions are needed to ensure that objects will not impair flight safety or decrease the operational capability of the airport. The CLUP defines seven imaginary horizontal and sloping surfaces in airspace near the airport. Any new construction that would penetrate the imaginary surfaces is deemed to be an incompatible land use, unless either (1) the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has determined that the proposed structure does not constitute a hazard to air navigation or (2) the State Aeronautics Program has issued a permit allowing construction of the proposed structure (CLUP Policy A2n). Figure 4.1-1 shows the building height restrictions at 500-foot intervals within the project area based on the imaginary surfaces defined in the CLUP. The height restrictions range from less than 25 feet
tall at the southern end of the development area to 200 feet tall at the northern end.

Noise
The CLUP adopts land use compatibility guidelines for different noise levels. Compatibility guidelines applicable to the project are as follows:
Residential: Exterior noise levels of 55 dB CNEL (community noise equivalent level) or less;
interior noise levels of 45 dB CNEL with windows closed (except for single-family detached homes; no interior level is identified).
Hotels and motels: exterior noise levels of 80 dB CNEL or less, but measures to achieve an interior noise level of 50 dB CNEL must be incorporated into design of public areas.
Most commercial uses: exterior noise levels of 80 dB CNEL or less, but measures to achieve an interior noise level of 50 dB CNEL must be incorporated into design of public areas.

Golf course: exterior noise levels of 80 dB or less, but measures to achieve an interior noise level
of 50 dB CNEL must be incorporated into design of public areas.
Noise contours for the airport are depicted in Figure 4.5-1 and are based on a noise study conducted by Bollard Acoustical Consultants (2005). These contours show that the project area generally falls within aircraft noise contours of 60 dB or greater (day-night average sound levels). Section 4.5 (Noise) provides
a more detailed discussion of noise levels in the project area.

Safety Restriction Area
The CLUP designates three safety areas (Figure 4.1-2). The clear zone is near the end of the runway and is the most restrictive. The approach-departure zone is located under the takeoff and landing slopes and is
less restrictive. The overflight zone is the area under the air traffic pattern and is even less restrictive. The entire project area falls within the overflight zone, and the central portion of the development area falls within the clear and approach-departure zones.
The CLUP adopts land use compatibility guidelines for each zone in order to minimize safety concerns associated with potential airplane crashes, noise, and other inconveniences of airport operation. Compatibility guidelines applicable to the project are as follows:
Single family residential detached: permitted only in overflight zone if density is five acres or more per residence.
Other residential: not permitted in any zone.
Hotels and motels: permitted in approach zone and overflight zone; in approach zone, uses are compatible only if they do not result in a large concentration of people (as defined in CLUP) and uses in buildings must be compatible with airport operations.
Commercial uses: some permitted in approach zone and overflight zone, others in overflight zone only; in approach zone, special conditions apply to specific uses.
Golf course: permitted in approach zone and overflight zone; in approach zone, uses are compatible only if they do not result in a large concentration of people (as defined in CLUP). No clubhouses, bars, restaurants, or banquet facilities are allowed in approach zone; ancillary uses such as pro shops, snack bars, and specialty food and beverage services are allowed. Sewer treatment plants: permitted only in overflight zone if they do not result in a possibility that a water area may cause ground fog or result in a bird hazard. in
The CLUP (Colusa County ALUC 1995) defines large concentration of people:
As a gathering of individuals in an area that would result in an average density of greater than 25 persons per acre per hour during any 24 hour period ending at midnight, not to
exceed 50 persons per acre at any time.

The CLUP (Colusa County ALUC 1995) clarifies that in cases where a safety zone line splits a parcel:
The parcel may be developed to split uses and densities, as long as the individual portions
of the parcel are consistent with the land use policies for the safety zone in which they lie.

Although current uses in the project area appear consistent with the CLUP's land use guidelines for the
safety areas, the project would introduce new residences and commercial uses to the overflight zone and

Environmental Setting
The project area was historically used for rice production. The project area is currently comprised of fallow agricultural land and developed parcels of the Park that include the CIP business office and other commercial and professional buildings. The northernmost portion of the project area lies within the Colusa Golf and Country Club where two golf holes, the driving range, the clubhouse, and the parking lot are now located. The proposed land application area for the treated effluent is in agricultural production (rice and sudan grass). A ditch conveys flow through the center of the Park from north to south. The Colusa County Airport is located south of the development area. Other surrounding land uses include agricultural, industrial, recreational (golf course), and residential.

General Plan Land Use Designations
The current General Plan land use designation for the portion of the development area in the Park is
Industrial (I); the land use designation for the Colusa Golf and Country Club is Parks and Recreation (P- R); and the land use designation for the wastewater facility site is Industrial (T). Figure 4.1-3 shows the land use designations for the project area and vicinity. The Industrial (I) land use designation includes two categories of land: existing industrial areas and vacant land designated for master-planned, subdivided industrial uses such as the current uses within the Park. The Parks and Recreation (P-R) land use designation includes golf courses, parks, fairgrounds, and other recreational areas.
County land use designations immediately surrounding the project area include Parks and Recreation (P- R) to the north, Agricultural-Transition Area (A-T) to the east and west, Agriculture-General (A-G) to the east, Public and Semi-Public Services (P-S) to the south, Industrial (1) to the south, and Urban Residential (UR) to the northwest. The Colusa city limits abut the northwestern boundary of the project area for approximately 900 feet. The City land use designation for this adjacent land is Low Density Residential
(LDR). The project area is not located within an established community, although it is adjacent to residential development within the City of Colusa. Therefore, physical division of an established community is not further discussed in this EIR.

Zoning Districts
The current zoning for the portion of the development area in the Park and for the wastewater facility site is Industrial (M) and Industrial Planned Development (M-PD) (Figure 4.1-4). The Industrial (M) zone is intended for land devoted to light manufacturing, heavy commercial uses, large administrative facilities, sewage plants, and normal operations of industries. A wide range of industrial, manufacturing, business, and professional uses are permitted in the M zone. The Industrial Planned Development (M-PD) zone is a combined zone, intended to provide for greater flexibility in the design of developments than is otherwise possible through the strict application of zoning district regulations. Allowable uses in a combined zone
are governed by the principal zoning district; in this case Industrial (M).
The current zoning for the golf course is General Recreation (G-R). The G-R zone is intended for land best suited for recreational use and development because of natural features related or contributing to recreational use. Golf courses are a principle permitted use within the G-R zone.
County zoning districts immediately surrounding the project area include Commercial/Industrial Planned Development (C, M-PD), Industrial (M), Exclusive Agriculture (E-A), Airport (A-V), and Residential Single-Family (R-1-8). The City zoning district for the adjacent land is Single Family Residence (R-1).

4.1.2 Impact Analysis

Methodology
The project was compared to the County General Plan's land use policies and land use designations, the County zoning code, and the CLUP to analyze consistency with the applicable land use plans, policies, and zoning regulations. The results of the aesthetics, noise, safety, and traffic analyses in other sections of the EIR were used to evaluate overall land use compatibility.

Criteria for Determining Significance
Adverse impacts to land use and planning would be considered significant if the project would:
Conflict with any applicable land use plan, policy, or regulation of an agency with jurisdiction over the project (including, but not limited to the general plan, specific plan, or zoning ordinance) adopted for the purpose of avoiding or mitigating an environmental effect.
Create physical conflicts with existing or planned land uses in neighboring areas caused by factors such as traffic congestion, noise, safety, and lighting.

Impacts and Mitigation Measures
Impact LU-1: The project would be inconsistent with Colusa County General Plan land use policies
LU-12 and LU-35 because the project would conflict with the adjacent airport and expose residents
to excessive noise.

As shown in Table 4.1-1, the project would be consistent with most General Plan land use policies adopted for the purpose of avoiding or mitigating an environmental effect, except policies LU-12 (conflicts with airports) and LU-35 (excessive noise in residential areas). These inconsistencies are discussed in more detail in the noise and hazards sections of this chapter, and an overview of the issues is provided below.
Policy LU-12: Although most of the project's land uses would be compatible with the uses identified in the airport CLUP for the approach/departure zone and overflight zone, the proposed residential uses would not be compatible. The project would expose residents to unacceptable noise levels due to aircraft
overflights, and the locations of the proposed homes would pose safety concerns associated with airport operations (i.e., potential crashes, crop-dusting hazards). The project would conflict with airport operations and be inconsistent with Policy LU-12.
Policy LU-35: As discussed under Policy LU-12, the project would introduce residences to an area of excessive aircraft noise. Standard home designs would reduce interior noise levels, but residents would
still be exposed to aircraft noise in excess of acceptable County and CLUP standards. Because of the project's close proximity to the airport, feasible noise-reducing measures cannot be identified to reduce noise to acceptable levels for the project's uses. For this reason, the project would be inconsistent with Policy LU-35.
The project would be inconsistent with policies LU-12 and LU-35 because of the issues discussed above; therefore, the project's inconsistency with the General Plan would result in a significant impact.
Significance Level Before Mitigation: Significant.

Mitigation Measure LU-la: Design homes and businesses to reduce interior aircraft-related noise levels
by up to 30 d.B.

Implement Mitigation Measure N-4a.
Mitigation Measure LU-1b: Encourage aerial application operators to takeoff to the south and land to
the north when weather conditions permit.

See Mitigation Measure N-4c. Note that this mitigation measure is not feasible.
Mitigation Measure LU-Ic: Encourage aerial application operators to make early turns (left or right) during Runway 31 departures (northbound take-offs).

See Mitigation Measure N-4d. Note that this mitigation measure is not feasible.
Mitigation Measure LU-ld: Encourage straight-out departures for Runway 31 operations (northbound

See Mitigation Measure N-4e. Note that this mitigation measure is not feasible.

Mitigation Measure LU-le: Encourage power reduction during departures for Runway 31 operations
(northbound take-offs).

See Mitigation Measure N-4f. Note that this mitigation measure is not feasible.

Mitigation Measure LU-If: Require aerial application operators to comply with Federal Aviation Administration regulations for operations over congested areas, prohibiting loaded aircraft from overflying the development area at low altitudes.
See Mitigation Measure N-4g. Note that this mitigation measure is not feasible.
Significance Level After Mitigation: Significant and unavoidable because implementation of the mitigation measures would reduce, but not eliminate, conflicts with land use policies LU-12 and LU-35, and some of the measures are infeasible.

Impact LU-2: With adoption of the proposed General Plan amendment, the project would be consistent with the project area's General Plan land use designations.

The current land use designation (I) within the portion of the project area in the Park does not allow for the proposed residential, highway commercial (e.g., gas stations, hotels, restaurants), or golf course
development. Similarly, the current land use designation (P-R) for the portion of the project area within the Colusa Golf and Country Club does not allow for high-density residential development. The land use designation (I) for the proposed wastewater facility would allow the proposed facility, and no changes are
proposed.
Project approval would include a General Plan amendment to accommodate the proposed land uses (see Figure 3-2 and Table 3-1 in Chapter 3). This amendment would change the Industrial land use designation in the development area to Urban Residential (UR), Parks and Recreation (P-R), and Commercial (C), and the P-R land use designation in the existing golf course to UR. The UR designation allows a range of
residential zoning classifications, including the Residential (R-1-8) and High Density Residential (R-4)

Environmental Impact Report 4-19

Impact Analysis General Plan and Zoning Amendment Colusa Industrial Properties

land uses proposed by the applicant. The P-R land use designation allows golf courses. The C designation allows highway commercial areas, hotels, offices, and restaurants,

With the proposed General Plan amendment, the project would be consistent with its General Plan land
use designations and would result in less than significant impact.
Significance Level: Less tham significant because the project would be consistent with proposed General Plan land use designations.
Impact LU-3: With adoption of the proposed zoning amendment, the proposed land uses would be
consistent with the Colusa County Zoning Ordinance.

The current zoning districts (M and M-PD) within the portion of the development area in the Park do not
allow for the proposed residential, highway commercial (e.g., gas station, hotel, restaurant), or golf course development. Similarly, the current zoning district (G-R) within the Colusa Golf and Country Club does not allow for high-density residential development.
Project approval would include a zoning amendment to accommodate the proposed land uses. The zoning amendment would change the Industrial (M) and Industrial Planned Development (M-PD) zones to Single Family Residential (R-1-8), High Density Residential (R-4), General Recreation (G-R), Neighborhood Commercial (C-1), Community Commercial (C-2), and Highway Commercial (CH). The zoning amendment would also change the G-R. zone within the Golf and Country Club to R-4 (see Figure 3-2).
The R-1-8 zone allows single family dwellings and accessory structures as principle use. The R-4 zone allows higher density residential uses, including single-family, two-family and multiple dwelling and dwelling groups. The R-4 zone, therefore, would allow the condominiums or townhomes and the high- density residential units proposed for the R-4 zones. The G-R zone allows golf courses. The C-1 zone is intended to provide for neighborhood shopping centers and allows for the professional and business offices currently located in the proposed C-1 zone. The C-2 zone is intended to apply to areas where more
complete commercial facilities are necessary for community convenience and allows for a variety of neighborhood and community commercial uses such as restaurants, automobile service stations, food
markets, retail stores, and professional and business offices. The CH zone is intended to provide
necessary services and conveniences for the traveling public along main roads and highway frontages and allows for restaurants, hotels and motels, and gas stations. Sewage plants are an allowed use within the
existing Industrial (M) zone, with a use permit.
With the proposed zoning amendment and a use permit for the wastewater facility, the project would be consistent with County zoning districts and would result in less than significant impact.
Significance Level: Less than significant because the project would be consistent with the proposed zoning amendment.

Impact LU-4: The project would not be consistent with the Colusa County Airport Comprehensive Land Use Plan with regard to noise standards, safety concerns, and incompatible land uses within
the overflight zone.
The project proposes a mixed-use community adjacent to the Colusa County Airport. The project area is subject to conditions of the CLUP, as discussed in the Regulatory Setting, and the project must comply with the height restrictions, noise standards, and safety standards described in the CLUP in order to be approved by the ALUC. Based on the proposed uses, the project would not be fully consistent with the

Environmental Impact Report 4-20

General Plan and Zoning Amendment
Impact Analysis Colusa Industrial Properties

CLUP. The analysis of CLUP consistency is provided below, with more specific discussions of noise and
safety in Sections 4.5 (Noise) and 4.10 (Hazards), respectively.

Height Restrictions
The CLUP identifies height restrictions that increase with increased distance from the runway. These restrictions are in place to ensure aircraft have sufficient room to take-off and land without being obstructed by tall buildings and to protect navigable airspace for aircraft safety. The proposed zoning districts for the project include building height limits for each zone. The height limit for the R-1 zone is 30 feet, and the height limit for all of the other zones is 40 feet. The CLUP airport height restrictions over the project area are greater than 40 feet in most locations (Figure 4.1-1). Zoning requirements, therefore, would ensure building height compatibility with CLUP standards for most of the development. The CLUP height standards over the southernmost portion of the development area (nearest the airport and within the proposed golf course expansion), however, are less than 40 feet tall (Figure 4.1-1). No buildings are proposed for this area of the golf course; therefore, CLUP height restrictions would be adhered to in the project area.

Noise
The CLUP identifies noise standards for various land uses based on current and anticipated future flight patterns. The noise contours generated for the airport provide general guidance for acceptable land uses in
order to minimize the number of people exposed to noise from aircraft operations. As discussed in Section 4.5 (Noise), project residences and businesses would be affected by noise levels ranging from 55 dB to more than 70 dB CNEL based on aircraft noise contours (see Figure 4.5-1). These aircraft-related noise levels exceed exterior CLUP noise standards for residential uses, hotels, golf facilities, and most other commercial uses. Standard building designs would include sound dampening measures that can reduce interior noise levels by about 25 dB (Bollard and Brennan 2005), but CLUP noise standards would still be exceeded in the development area. The project's land uses would not be compatible with allowable uses based on the noise contours for the airport; therefore, the project would be inconsistent with the CLUP, which would be a significant impact.

Safety Restriction Areas
The CLUP designates three safety restriction areas around the airport that identify areas that could be exposed to aircraft accidents: the clear zone has the highest potential for accidents; the approach- departure zone has a moderate potential; and the overflight zone has a lower potential. Land uses within these safety restriction areas are regulated by the CLUP in order to minimize the number of people exposed to aircraft hazards. The project proposes realignment of Farinon Road within the clear zone, but no buildings or other uses are proposed. The approach-departure zone encompasses a portion of the proposed G-R zone (golf course) and overlaps small portions of the proposed C-1/C-2 (existing office building) and R-4 (southwest corner of high density residential) zoning districts (Figure 4.1-2). All other uses would be located within the overflight zone.
Golf courses are permitted in the overflight zone and are permitted in the approach-departure zone only if they do not result in a large concentration of people (as defined in CLUP). Golf is a low-density activity that typically does not generate large concentrations of people. Starters regulate tee times to promote a smooth pace of play throughout the course, thereby discouraging a concentration of golfers in any particular area. This results in a low concentration of people per acre. The golf course itself, therefore, would not result in an average density of greater than 25 persons per acre per hour, nor would it exceed

Environmental Impact Report 4-21

General Plan and Zoning Amendment
Impact Analysis Colusa Industrial Properties

50 persons per acre at any time. The golf course amenities with the highest concentrations of people include clubhouses, bars, restaurants, or banquet facilities. These uses are not allowed within the
approach-departure zone, but are allowed in the overflight zone. Preliminary designs show the new
clubhouse outside of the approach-departure zone, which would be compatible with the CLUP; however, a small pond associated with one of the holes would be located within this zone. The pond could attract birds, especially if it becomes a permanent water source in the area, which could result in safety concerns for pilots taking off toward and landing from the north.
A narrow section of the proposed C-1 and C-2/CH zones falls within the approach-departure zone (Figure 4.1-2). These parcels are already developed with existing commercial and office buildings, which are setback from the boundaries of the parcel, placing them outside of the approach-departure zone.
All of the proposed residential land uses are located within the overflight zone, and the extreme southwest corner of the proposed R-4 zone is located within the approach-departure zone. Only single-family detached residences with a density of at least five acres per residence are allowed within the overflight zone in order to minimize the number of people exposed to potential hazards with aircraft accidents. None of the project's residential land uses would meet this density requirement, resulting in a large number of people being exposed to potential accidents. Because of the safety concerns with the close proximity of the residential uses and the airport, this would be a significant impact.
The wastewater treatment facility is proposed within the overflight zone. Sewer treatment plants are allowed uses if they do not result in a possibility that a water area may cause ground fog or result in a bird hazard. The treated effluent would be applied to nearby fields currently used for disposal of industrial process wastewater and may be used for irrigation of the golf course in the future, and two existing
wastewater disposal ponds would be utilized for temporary and emergency effluent disposal. These areas do not currently generate fog or attract large numbers of birds, according to personal communications with Park staff. Because the fields and ponds are currently being used for similar purposes, the proposed wastewater facility would not increase water areas and, therefore, would not be expected to increase ground fog or alter bird activity in a manner that would pose a hazard for air traffic.

Conclusion
In summary, certain components of the project would be inconsistent with the CLUP. Inconsistencies include compliance with land use restrictions associated with noise contours and safety restriction areas. The project's proposed residential densities would not be compatible with the CLUP's airport noise contours or safety zone restrictions, which would be significant impact.

Significance Level Before Mitigation: Significant.

Mitigation Measure LU-4a: Design homes and businesses to reduce interior aircraft-related noise levels
by up 1o 30 dB.

Implement Mitigation Measure N-4a.

Mitigation Measure LU-4b: Notify all prospective purchasers and users of property in the project area of

Mitigation Measure LU-4c: Locate permanent water features associated with the golf course outside of the approach-departure zone.
The applicant will submit specific plans for the golf course to Colusa County for review and approval prior to issuance of grading permits. The plans will ensure that incompatible features are not located
within the approach-departure zone. Incompatible uses would include lights, ponds, or other structures
that could generate sources of light and glare, smoke, fog, or attract birds.

Mitigation Measure LU-4h: Require aerial application operators to comply with Federal Aviation
Administration regulations for operations over congested areas, prohibiting loaded aircraft from overflying the development area at low altitudes.
See Mitigation Measure N-4g. Note that this mitigation measure is not feasible.
Significance Level After Mitigation: Significant and unavoidable because the mitigation measures would reduce, but not eliminate, conflicts with the Comprehensive Land Use Plan, and some measures are infeasible.

Impact LU-5: The project would create physical conflicts with existing agricultural uses as well as
uses within the City of Colusa.

The project would result in off-site impacts relating to increased traffic and traffic noise, increased
agricultural-urban conflicts, and increased light and glare, which would affect adjacent agricultural uses and residential and commercial uses in the City of Colusa. These impacts are fully evaluated in Sections 4.4 (Traffic and Circulation), 4.5 (Noise), 4.12 (Agricultural Resources), and 4.14 (Aesthetics). The project is not expected to conflict with industrial uses within the Park because undeveloped land, the airport, and other uses would separate residential uses in the project area from the industrial facilities. Other than possible odor and noise complaints associated with the industrial uses (see Sections 4.5 and 4.6), the project's uses would not create physical conflicts with industrial operations. Physical conflicts with the adjacent airport are discussed in Impact LU-4.

Environmental Impact Report 4-23

General Plan and Zoning Amendment
Impact Analysis Colusa Industrial Properties
The project would increase traffic on City and County roads and result in increased traffic congestion on several roadways (Section 4.4). Increased traffic would also expose existing residents in the City to
increased noise levels, particularly along SR 20 (Section 4.5). The single-family homes in the western end of the development area and extension of Farinon Road to Wescott Road would cause indirect effects on the adjacent agricultural fields (Section 4.12), and the project would introduce a source of light and glare to a currently undeveloped area (Section 4.14). Additionally, the commercial and residential uses along SR 20 would include nighttime lighting, which could affect vehicles on the highway (Section 4.14).
Based on the analyses presented in other resource sections, these impacts would be considered significant. Mitigation measures have been proposed for each impact; however, traffic-related impacts would not be
reduced to less than significant. Other impacts associated with agricultural-urban conflicts and light and glare could be reduced to a less than significant level with mitigation. The physical conflicts with adjacent land uses created by the project would cause a significant impact on nearby uses.
Significance Level Before Mitigation: Significant.
Mitigation Measure LU-5a: Provide funding to install a signal at Bridge Street and Fremont Street intersection when Caltrans approves.

Implement Mitigation Measure TT-1.
Mitigation Measure LU-5b: Construct a wall along western project boundary to provide a barrier between residences and agricultural uses.

Implement Mitigation Measure AR-3a.
Mitigation Measure LU-5c: Implement landscaping and lighting plans for uses along State Route 20.

Implement Mitigation Measures A-3 and A-4.

Significance Level After Mitigation: Significant and unavoidable because the mitigation measures
would not sufficiently reduce project impacts associated with traffic noise in the City of Colusa.

Significant and Unavoidable Impacts
Impact LU-1: The project would be inconsistent with Colusa County General Plan land use policies LU- 12 and LU-35 because the project would conflict with the adjacent airport and expose residents to excessive noise.

Impact LU-4: The project would not be consistent with the Colusa County Airport Comprehensive Land
Use Plan with regard to noise standards, safety concerns, and incompatible land uses within the overflight
zone.

Impact LU-5: The project would create physical conflicts with existing agricultural uses as well as uses within the City of Colusa.

4.2 POPULATION, HOUSING, AND EMPLOYMENT
This section describes the existing population, housing, and employment setting of the project area and vicinity, The impact analysis discusses the project's impact on population and housing. Mitigation measures are identified for significant impacts, followed by determinations of the residual impact significance after mitigation measures are implemented.

4.2.1 Setting

Regulatory Setting
The Colusa County General Plan (General Plan) was adopted in 1989 with horizon year of 2010. The General Plan provides the basis for decisions regarding growth and land development; it is the County's official statement of public policy for the use of private and public land. It provides a framework to encourage economic growth while managing growth, conserving agricultural lands, protecting the environment, and preserving the qualities and culture that make Colusa County unique (Colusa County 1989). The General Plan's overall guidance, goals, and policies applicable to social and economic
conditions are set forth in the Land Use Element and Housing Element, which are discussed below.
The Land Use Element of the General Plan examines current and proposed future land use patterns in the County and sets forth policies to facilitate urban, agricultural, and open space uses planned from 1989 to
2010.

The element presents policies that are intended to maintain the efficient and harmonious use of land in the County, promote a well organized and orderly development pattern, and accommodate the orderly growth of population and employment. Applicable policies are identified below:
LU-1: Colusa County should ensure a supply of developable land sufficient to meet projected growth over the planning period.

LU-31: Sufficient vacant areas should be designated for residential development to meet the housing demand with future development located proportionally to areas of future job
growth.

The Housing Element of the General Plan was revised and adopted by the Board of Supervisors on December 16, 2003, and was later revised and readopted in November 2004. The Housing Element is intended to provide citizens and public officials with an understanding of the housing needs in the County and to set forth an integrated set of policies and programs aimed at attaining defined goals (Colusa County 2004).
The Housing Element presents goals and policies that encourage an adequate supply of safe, sanitary, and attractive housing in all communities in Colusa County, affordable to a wide range of income groups. Table 6-1 of the Housing Element identifies the County's fair share of housing by income group through June 2008. Housing Element goals and policies applicable to the project are identified below:

Goal 1: Development of sufficient new housing to ensure the availability of safe,
affordable housing for all households in the Colusa County unincorporated area.

Environmental Setting
Colusa County is a rural county that relies on agricultural production as its primary source of revenue. The City of Colusa, which is adjacent to the northwest boundary of the project area, and the City of Williams are the largest population centers in the County.

Population
The population of Colusa County increased from 14,800 persons in 1987 (Colusa County 1989) to 18,804 persons in 2000 (U.S. Census 2000) and 20,880 persons in 2005 (Center for Economic Development [CED] 2006), with an annual increase of 1.2 percent from 1997 to 2002 (Department of Transportation 2004). In Colusa County, the City of Colusa is the largest city, with a population of 5,582, but Williams is the fastest growing city in the County with a population of 4,794 and an average annual increase of four percent growth from 1995 to 2005 (CED 2006).
The 1989 General Plan projected the countywide population would increase to 23,500 persons by 2010 (Table 4.2-1). More recent projections from the Department of Finance (DOF 2000) estimated the countywide population would reach 22,697 persons by 2010 and 23,273 persons by 2015, which are lower than the General Plan's 2010 projection. For the unincorporated portion of the County, the General Plan's Final Housing Element (2004) projected the population would increase from 9,732 to 10,471
persons from 2000 to 2005 and to 11,267 persons by 2010. This population increase would be caused primarily by migration from the Sacramento region and the proximity of development in Colusa County
to I-5.

The project area is located in the unincorporated area of Colusa County and does not have a current residential population.

Housing
In 2002, the CED (2006) estimated Colusa County had approximately 6,852 housing units, and the unincorporated area had approximately 3,819 housing units (Table 4.2-2). Estimates from 2005 indicated an increase to 7,342 total housing units countywide, of which 5,657 were single-family units, 875 were multiple family units, and 810 were mobile homes (CED 2006). Total housing units in the unincorporated portion of the county increased to 4,032 units in 2005, experiencing a five percent housing increase from 2002 to 2005. The County (2004) projected the estimated housing construction need from 2002 to 2008 would be 1,262 units countywide and 631 units in the unincorporated area.
The project area is designated for industrial uses and does not have existing housing units. The closest designated urban residential area is located within Colusa city is limits, northwest of the project area.

Employment
According to the CED (2006), labor force is defined as the total number of employed workers and unemployed county residents actively seeking work. In Colusa County, the total labor force was approximately 9,900 in 2005, of which approximately 81 percent was employed and 14 percent was unemployed (CED 2006). Since agriculture is the dominant industry in Colusa County, employing around one-third of its population, employment figures tend to fluctuate during the harvest season (May to October). Historically, the periods of May through October experience the lowest unemployment, while November through April experience the highest (Employment Development Department [EDD] 2006). The 1989 General Plan, however, forecasted that future growth in jobs would tend to shift from direct
farming to more stable year-round jobs such as retail and service industry positions. Most of these jobs
would, nevertheless, be in agricultural processing and distribution.

Table 4.2-3 shows 2005 employment averages by industry for Colusa County. The agricultural industry employs over 30 percent of the County's total labor force. Government positions provide the second largest industry, employing almost 25 percent of the County.
The project area is zoned for industrial uses. Approximately 36,580 square feet of commercial space and office uses presently occupy the project area. Existing tenants (16 commercial tenants) within Colusa

4.2.2 Impact Analysis

Methodology
The impact analysis provided in this section is based on the latest population and economic information obtained from Colusa County (2004), Center for Economic Development (2006), U.S. Census Bureau (2000), Department of Finance (2000), and Employment Development Department (2005). The project's added population, housing, and employment were compared with Colusa County's General Plan policies and other projections to determine whether the project would induce unplanned growth.

Criteria for Determining Significance
Adverse impacts related to population, housing, and employment would be considered significant if the project would:
Induce substantial unplanned population growth in an area, either directly (for example, by proposing new homes and businesses) or indirectly (for example, through extension of roads or
other infrastructure).
Induce substantial unplanned housing growth in an area, either directly (for example, by proposing new homes and businesses) or indirectly (for example, through extension of roads or other infrastructure).
Fail to contribute to the County's fair share requirements for very low, low, and moderate income
housing.

Environmental Impact Report 4-29

General Plan and Zoning Amendment
Impact Analysis Colusa Industrial Properties

Impacts and Mitigation Measures
Impact PHE-1: The project would add 860 persons to the unincorporated Colusa County
population, but population projections would not be exceeded.
The project would develop total of approximately 286 single-family residential and high-density
residential housing units. Based on the project's estimated number of housing units and the DOF's (2000) person per household rate of 3.01, the project would result in a permanent population of approximately 860 persons in the development area. This increase falls within the unincorporated Colusa County population projections for 2010 and 2015 (Colusa County 2004), as well as the projections for all of Colusa County (Colusa County 1989, CED 2006). The project's added population is, however, a substantial percentage of the projections for the unincorporated areas, but it is less than 50 percent of the
overall County projections.
Because the project's added population would fall within the range of Colusa County's planned growth, direct impacts on population would be less than significant.

Significance Level: Less than significant because the project's popalation would not exceed future projections and the project would not induce unplanned growth.
Impact PHE-2: The project would add up to 286 dwelling units in unincorporated Colusa County, but housing projections would not be exceeded.
County projections indicate that the countywide total housing need for 2002 to 2008 would be approximately 1,262 units, of which 631 units would be needed for the unincorporated area (Colusa County 2004). Based on the housing estimates for 2005 and projections through 2008, the County is still expected to require another 772 total housing units countywide, with 418 housing units in the
unincorporated areas.

The project's addition of up to 286 housing units to the unincorporated area would account for approximately 37 percent of the County's overall projection by 2008 and about 67 percent of the unincorporated County's projection for that same year. Projections for 2010 housing needs are expected to be higher than 2008 projections by at least five percent; therefore, the project's relative contribution to projected year 2010 housing units would be smaller. Because the project's added housing would fall within the range of Colusa County's projected growth, direct impacts on housing would be less than
significant.

Significance Level: Less than significant because the project's housing would not exceed future
projections and the project would not induce unplanned growth.

Impact PHE-3: The project would not provide affordable housing and would be inconsistent with affordable housing policies and programs in the County General Plan Housing Element.
The project provides up to 286 new housing units in unincorporated Colusa County; none of these units is
planned as affordable housing. To be consistent with Housing Element affordable housing policies and
programs encouraging affordable housing, the project would need to designate a reasonable percentage (e.g., 10%) of the units as affordable housing. The lack of proposed affordable housing units in the project area make the project inconsistent with the Housing Element and could result in adverse effects on low-
income populations, resulting in a significant impact.
Significance Level Before Mitigation: Significant.

Environmental Impact Report 4-30

General Plan and Zoning Amendment Impact Analysis Colusa Industrial Properties

Mitigation PHE-3: Identify on subdivision map at least 29 affordable housing units in the high density residential zone in the project area.
The County will require the applicant to designate a reasonable percentage (e.g., 10 percent) of the units as affordable housing. These units will be identified on the tentative subdivision map and will be approved by the County prior to approval of the final subdivision map. The County will specify the appropriate number of affordable units to be designated for different income groups (very low, low, and moderate). Provision of at least 29 affordable housing units would make the project consistent with Housing Element policies and programs.

Significance Level After Mitigation: Less than significant because provision of at least 29 affordable
housing units in the project area would avoid adverse effects on low-income populations.

Significant and Unavoidable Impacts
None.

4.3 PUBLIC SERVICES
This section describes existing public services in the project vicinity and the impacts on public service facilities that may occur with implementation of the project. Mitigation measures are identified for significant impacts, followed by determinations of the residual impact significance after mitigation measures are implemented. The public services evaluated in this section include police and fire services, schools, parks and public recreational facilities, libraries, public health and medical services, and court
services.

4.3.1 Setting

Regulatory Setting
The Colusa County General Plan (1989) identifies goals and policies that promote effective and efficient provision of public services throughout the County. The Community Services Element recommends policies intended to "channel development into areas where community services can either accommodate growth or be expanded most efficiently." General Plan policies address public services
provided in the County, including law enforcement, fire protection, emergency medical services,
education, libraries, and health care.

Environmental Setting

Police Protection Services

Colusa County Sheriff
The Colusa County Sheriff's Department provides law enforcement services to the unincorporated areas of Colusa County. The Sheriff's Department serves the project area (and the entire County) from its

Impact Analysis Colusa Industrial Properties

26,000 square-foot station at 929 Bridge Street in the City of Colusa, approximately one mile north of the project area (Colusa County Sheriff Department 2006).
Average response times to the project area are about 5 minutes. The department does not have a target response time. Rather, the department has a preferred officer-to-population ratio of 1.25 deputies per 1,000 persons, and a support staff ratio of 0.75 staff for every 1,000 residents. This equals an overall staff- to-population ratio of 2 per 1,000. Three Sheriff's deputies are on duty at all times to serve the County (Marshall 2006).
The Sheriff's Department receives relatively few calls from the Park. The department receives more calls from the golf course, most of which include minor crimes such as malicious mischief and theft (Marshall
2006).

The Colusa County Sheriff's Department has a mutual aid agreement with the City of Colusa Police Department. The Sheriff's Department, however, handles most calls on its own. In 2005, about 10 percent of the calls to the Sheriff's Department from the project vicinity required mutual assistance from Colusa Police (Marshall 2006).
The Sheriff's station also includes the County's only jail, constructed in 1962. Inmates in the facility may be awaiting trial or serving a sentence. Jail staff total 13 including one jail commander, one sergeant, three corporals, and eight correctional officers. The jail has 92 beds (Colusa County Sheriff Department 2006). The jail's average daily population for the 18-month period from March 2005 through August 2006 was 45 inmates. The maximum number of inmates during that period was 59 (Austin 2006).

City of Colusa Police Department
The City of Colusa Police Department provides law enforcement services within the city limits from its
police station at 260 6th Street, in the Carnegie Library Building, approximately two miles north of the project area. The 3,600 square-foot library building was built in 1906 and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The police station is currently operating at capacity. The City is currently investigating potential locations for a new police station, although no plans have been developed (City of Colusa 2007b).
The Police Department is staffed with nine fulltime officers and one non-sworn secretary position. The Police Department is adding a tenth position for a full-time detective. The City's current general plan recommends an officer-to-population ratio of one officer per 1,000 persons (Colusa 1994). The department is two officers short of this standard (City of Colusa 2007b). The Police Department receives occasional requests from the Sheriff's Department for backup assistance on calls from the Park when the Sheriff is unable to respond (Montgomery 2007).

Fire Protection Services

Sacramento River Fire District
The Sacramento River Fire District (SRFD) provides fire protection, emergency medical services, rescue, and hazardous materials response services to the eastern portion of unincorporated Colusa County, SRFD's 207 square-mile service area runs along the Sacramento River from two miles south of Princeton
to the Colusa/Yolo County line. The SRFD serves the project area from its fire station at 235 Market Street in the City of Colusa, approximately two miles north of the project area.

Environmental Impact Report 4-32

General Plan and Zoning Amendment
Impact Analysis Colusa Industrial Properties
The SRFD is staffed by one full time fire chief and 44 volunteers. One firefighter is usually on duty
during daytime hours Monday through Friday, with support of volunteer firefighters. Nighttime and weekend staffing is provided by a duty officer and the volunteers. According to the SRFD, the Fire District's equipment is adequate for current demand. The SRFD maintains a mutual aid agreement with all fire agencies within Colusa County, Meridian Fire Department in Sutter County, Sutter County Fire Department, Glenn-Colusa Fire District in Glenn County, and Dunnigan and Knights Landing fire districts in Yolo County.
Average response times to the project area are typically about 7 to 9 minutes during most of the year. Response times are slightly longer during the autumn harvest season (8 to 10 minutes) when many of the volunteer firefighters are tending farming operations. The response times currently exceed SRFD's target response time of 3 to 4 minutes. Response times can vary depending on traffic conditions and weather. SR 20 is currently the only access road to the Park.

During the period between July 1, 2005 and June 30, 2006, SRFD responded to 75 fires, 184 medical emergencies, 42 fire investigations, 31 mutual aid and automatic aid responses, 17 false alarms, one hazardous materials call, and three rescues. During this period SRFD requested mutual aid 23 times mostly from Meridian Fire District and Colusa City Fire Department.
The SRFD receives occasional calls from the Park and the golf course. Most calls from the Park involve medical emergencies, with a few structure fires on the developed parcels and vegetation fires on the undeveloped parcels. The golf course generates fewer calls than the industrial park, and the calls typically involve medical emergencies and dumpster fires. Calls from nearby residences mainly involve medical emergencies (Winters 2007).

City of Colusa Fire Department
The City of Colusa Fire Department provides fire protection and emergency services within the city limits from its fire station located at 750 Market Street, approximately two miles north of the project area. The station currently needs repairs and is renovation and is operating at capacity. The fire department maintains a staff of 5 paid and 26 volunteer firefighters. The department maintains a mutual aid agreement with six
other fire agencies within Colusa County (City of Colusa 2007b). The department also maintains a mutual aid agreement with the Colusa Casino for fire protection services. The City fire department receives very few calls for mutual aid assistance at the Park (Dunn 2007).

Schools
The Colusa Unified School District (CUSD) serves the northeastern portion of Colusa County with five schools. Burchfield Elementary School, Egling Middle School, Colusa High School, and Colusa Alternative High School are all located in the City of Colusa. The Colusa Alternative Home School is an
independent study school where students are taught at home rather than at a CUSD facility.
Table 4.3-1 shows the 2006-2007 school year enrollment for the CUSD. On a district level, CUSD is currently operating at 75 percent capacity. CUSD has experienced a slow, steady decline in enrollment over the past 10 years. The CUSD expects student enrollment to increase substantially over the next 10 years, primarily from a forecasted increase in residential development (School Works, Inc. 2006).

Parks and Recreation
Public parks and recreational facilities in the project vicinity include City of Colusa parks, the Colusa- Sacramento River State Recreation Area (SRA), Colusa County Fairgrounds, and the Colusa and Delevan National Wildlife Refuges (NWRs).
The City of Colusa maintains 15.5 acres of parks, open space, and recreational facilities that include picnic areas, ball fields, swimming pools, playgrounds, tot lots, tennis courts, and a levee park along the Sacramento River. The City's parks receive heavy use by its 5,582 residents, plus nearby County residents. According to the City, some of the City's facilities are no longer adequate for their current demand, and some facilities need expansion or renovation. The City is planning on preparing a Parks Master Plan after the City General Plan Update is completed in 2007 (McNulty 2006).
The Colusa-Sacramento SRA is located just outside the City of Colusa along the Sacramento River. SRA facilities include a boat launch, picnic areas, hiking trails, and a campground. The park's service area extends well beyond Colusa County. The SRA receives an average of 67,500 visits per year, and park
usage is currently at capacity. Street parking outside the SRA serves as overflow parking. The SRA is planning to expand and redesign the park to accommodate more parking and campsites (Fehling 2006).
The Colusa County Fairgrounds is owned and managed by the California Department of Food and
Agriculture. The fairgrounds include a fee-based recreational vehicle park and a fee-based events center featuring several exhibition halls and an outdoor pavilion. The fairgrounds are gated, but the gates are usually kept open to allow public use of the outdoor lawn areas for recreational activities such as dog walking and kite flying. On average, one or two people per day use the fairgrounds for this purpose (Meek 2007).

The Colusa and Delevan NWRs are located 3 miles and 8 miles, respectively, from the project area. These NWRs are managed by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service (FWS) and provide hunting and wildlife viewing opportunities. Annual visitation is 21,000 at Colusa NWR and 7,000 at Delevan NWR. The FWS has no
user thresholds for these NWRs (Forester 2006).

Library
The Colusa County Library is located at 738 Market Street in Colusa. The library employs six full time staff and up to three part-time staff. The library is open four days a week. The Colusa County Library participates in a consortium with five other libraries, including the Sacramento Public Library. According to library staff, the library has adequate capacity to serve its current users (Rawlins 2006).

Public Health
Colusa County is designated a Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA) by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The HPSA designation refers to shortages of primary medical care, dental, or mental health providers. Colusa County's only hospital is the Colusa Regional Medical Center located at 199 East Webster Street in Colusa. The medical center has 48 licensed beds, 160 employees, and a current physician-to-population ratio of 1:2,500. According to medical center staff, the medical center is operating at capacity for physicians, but not for administrative staff or licensed beds. Also, the medical
center is operating at capacity for office space, and the emergency room is inadequately sized to handle the current population. The medical center is preparing a strategic plan, scheduled for release in 2007. (Parker 2006).

The Colusa County Behavioral Health Center is located at 162 East Carson Street in Colusa. The center provides outpatient substance abuse and mental health services for Colusa County residents on a fee basis. The center operates from County-owned building and has five County cars with three cars on order. The center maintains 29 staff and has a preferred staff-to-client service ratio of 1:50 for most programs and 2:1 ratio for their intensive program. According to agency staff, the mental health program is currently operating below capacity, but the substance abuse program is at capacity (Joiner 2006).
The Colusa County Department of Health and Human Services consists of three divisions (health
services, human services, and public authority) and is located at 251 East Webster Street in Colusa. The Division of Health Services seeks to prevent disease and injury, promote health, evaluates the health of the community, and measures the health outcomes for all residents. The Division of Human Services
provides temporary cash assistance for needy families. Programs include Cash Assistance and Welfare to Work Programs (CalWORKs) and non-Cash Assistance Eligibility Programs (i.e. Food Stamps, Medi- Cal, CMSP, General Assistance). The public authority is mandated by state law to work in conjunction with Colusa County's In-Home Supportive Program to help the elderly or disabled adults and disabled children remain in their own homes with support of In-Home care from care providers. The department has multiple staff assigned to the various divisions that are available for emergency and non-emergency situations.

Court Services
The Superior Court of California, Colusa County serves the County from two facilities in the City of Colusa. The main courthouse (547 Market Street) processes criminal, juvenile, family law, and civil cases, as well as probate and adoptions. The courthouse annex (532 Oak Street) processes criminal, traffic, civil, limited jurisdiction, and small claims cases. The Superior Court has 2 judges and 14 staff. The Court does not have a target staff-to-population service ratio, but Court staff has stated that current staffing levels and facilities are at capacity (Pearson 2007).
The Colusa County Probation Department has 11 probation officers, support staff, and 3 community service supervisors. The department does not have a target staff-to-population service ratio, but the department has stated that current staffing levels are not adequate to meet the needs of the county's adult

population. Colusa County does not currently have a juvenile hall, so Colusa County contracts with other counties for juvenile hall services. The Probation Department is currently in the research phase for a juvenile hall, but no plans have been developed (Bordin 2007).

4.3.2 Impact Analysis

Methodology
Information of the public service providers, their facilities, and their capacities was developed through personal communications with representatives of the service providers. The Sheriff's Department website, an enrollment projection report prepared for the Colusa Unified School District, and the City of Colusa Draft General Plan Update were also used to describe the existing services. Project-related effects on public service providers' ability to provide services were evaluated in terms of the potential for environmental impacts, such as those associated with the need to construct new facilities. The following paragraphs explain the methodologies used to analyze impacts on specific types of public service
facilities.

Police and Fire Protection Service Providers
Existing levels of staff and facilities, target response times and staffing ratios, existing response times and ratios, and existing demand generated by the project area (as described above) were used as the baseline conditions for these analyses. The proposed changes in land use were then evaluated, in consultation with the service providers, to determine whether the project would generate sufficient new demand to warrant construction of additional or expanded services and facilities.

Schools
CUSD enrollment numbers were compared against the existing capacities of CUSD school facilities to determine how much excess capacity (if any) each facility now has to serve the project. CUSD's student generation rates were used to calculate the expected student increase generated by the project, and whether each CUSD school facility has sufficient capacity to serve the new students.
The CUSD expects student enrollment to increase substantially over the next 10 years, primarily from a forecasted increase in residential development in addition to the CIP project rather than an increase in
birth rates. Because environmental changes caused by future projects other than the CIP project are not part of the current environmental setting, they are not included in this analysis. Chapter 5 (Cumulative Impacts) includes an analysis of the combined impacts on CUSD facilities that could result from the
project and other reasonably foreseeable future projects.

Parks and Recreation
Current usage levels for the public parks and recreation facilities in the project vicinity were used as the baseline conditions for the following analyses. The expected increase in park usage generated by the proposed residences was used to determine whether the project would cause or accelerate substantial physical deterioration of the facilities.

Environmental Impact Report 4-36

General Plan and Zoning Amendment
Impact Analysis Colusa Industrial Properties

Library, Public Health Services, and Court Services
The Colusa County Library, the Colusa Regional Medical Center, the Colusa County Behavioral Health Center, the Colusa County Department of Health Services, the Superior Court, and the Colusa County Probation Department were evaluated to determine if their facilities could adequately serve new residents generated by the project.

Criteria for Determining Significance
Adverse impacts related to City, County, or special district public services would be considered significant if the project would:
Result in substantial adverse physical impacts associated with the provision of new or physically altered governmental facilities, need for new or physically altered governmental facilities, the construction of which could cause significant environmental impacts, in order to maintain
acceptable service ratios, response times or other performance objectives for any of the public
services:
Fire protection.

0 Police protection.
Schools.

o Parks.
Other public facilities.
Substantially increase public service agency staffing requirements.
Cause substantial displacement of public recreation opportunities.
Increase the use of existing neighborhood and regional parks or other recreational facilities such that substantial physical deterioration of the facility would occur or be accelerated.
Require construction of recreational facilities, which might have an adverse physical effect on the environment.

Impacts and Mitigation Measures
Impact PS-1: The project would increase the demand on the Sheriff's Department, requiring the
need for two new staff members and possibly new or expanded facilities.
The Sheriff's Department expects the project to increase the number of calls to the department. The expected increase would mostly include noise and barking dog complaints generated by the residential land uses and minor crimes such as malicious mischief and theft. Response times are expected to remain at approximately 5 minutes (Marshall 2006).
The project would result in an increase of approximately 860 residents in the Colusa County Sheriff's service area. Using the Sheriff's Department's preferred staff-to-population ratio of 2:1,000 persons, the project would generate the demand for two new staff members, including one officer and one support staff. The addition of two new staff could require construction of new or expanded facilities and would require additional funding. Because of the increase in demand on the Colusa County Sheriff's Department and need for new staff, impacts would be significant.
The Colusa Police Department expects the project to increase the number of mutual aid calls from the
Sheriff's Department and expects project-generated traffic through the City to increase demand for police

services related to traffic enforcement. The Police Department, however, does not expect the project to substantially increase demand for police services or require expansion of the police force or its facilities (Montgomery 2007). Therefore, impacts on City Police facilities would be less than significant.

Significance Level Before Mitigation: Significant.

Mitigation Measure PS-1: Provide funding for two new Sheriff's Department staff and temporary rent- free office space, if needed.
The County will require the applicant to provide funding for two new Sheriff's Department staff prior to approval of subdivision maps. The amount of funding will be specified in the development agreement between the applicant and County. Additionally, if the Sheriff's Department requires additional facilities to accommodate the increase in staffing, the applicant will provide rent-free office space in the project area until such new facilities can be provided elsewhere. At the discretion of the County, the applicant may also be required to provide fair share funding to construct new facilities for the new staff; details on the additional funding will be specified in the development agreement.
Significance Level After Mitigation: Less than significant because the provision of adequate
funding would ensure impacts on the Sheriff's Department are minimal.

Impact PS-2: The project would increase demand for jail services by 4 percent, but existing jail
facilities would have adequate capacity to serve the project.
The Sheriff's Department expects the project to increase the need for jail services in proportion to the increase in the County's population generated by the project (Marshall 2006). The project would increase the County's population by approximately 4 percent, thereby increasing the demand for jail services by 4 percent. The jail's average daily population is 45. Because the jail has a capacity of 92 inmates and is currently at less than 50 percent capacity, the expected 4 percent increase would not cause the jail to exceed its capacity and, therefore, would not require construction of new or expanded facilities. Additionally, tax revenue from the project would provide funding through the County General Fund for minor improvements that may be needed for the existing facilities. Distribution of these funds to the
appropriate entity is at the discretion of the County. Therefore, impacts on County jail facilities would be
less than significant.
Significance Level: Less than significant because the existing jail facilities would have adequate capacity to serve the project.

Impact PS-3: The project would increase the demand for the Sacramento River Fire District by
about 10 percent annually, resulting in the need for one new firefighter and improvements to existing facilities.

SRFD expects the project to increase the number of calls by about 10 percent annually. The expected increase would mostly involve emergency medical service calls, false alarms, and some structure fire incidents. To accommodate this increase in calls, the SRFD would hire one new permanent firefighter, thus allowing the fire district to staff their fire station 24 hours a day and reduce response times to to 4 minutes. The project would require SRFD to renovate the interior of the fire station to accommodate full- time paid staff on a 24-hour basis. Renovations would include converting a portion of the bunkroom into an office, and installation of a new dishwasher and sink in the kitchen. These renovations would be
confined to the interior of the existing fire station and would not require expansion of the existing fire station or construction of a new station (Winters 2006). The interior renovations are not expected to result in significant environmental impacts. The addition of one new staff and renovations would require

Environmental Impact Report 4-38

General Plan and Zoning Amendment
Impact Analysis Colusa Industrial Properties

additional funding. Because of the increase in demand on the Sacramento River Fire District and need for
new staff, impacts would be significant.
During the EIR public scoping process, SRFD issued a letter listing its concerns about the project (see Appendix A). The letter addressed ingress/egress for the project area, water supply, fire hydrant distribution, staffing, the present fire station location, apparatus, increases in population, fire protective systems, and spacing of the residences [SRFD to County of Colusa, letter, June 16, 2006]. The applicant is actively working with the SRFD and Colusa County to address the SRFD's concerns and to incorporate prudent fire safety measures into the project. These issues are important with respect to project planning and fire safety. They would not, however, require the SRFD to construct new or physically altered facilities.

The City of Colusa Fire Department does not expect the project to generate a substantial number of new calls to the department because the project area is located outside the city limits (Dunn 2007).
Significance Level Before Mitigation: Significant,
Mitigation Measure PS-3: Provide funding for one new firefighter and temporary rent-free office space, if needed.

The County will require the applicant to provide funding for one new Sacramento River Fire District firefighter prior to approval of subdivision maps. The amount of funding will be specified in the development agreement between the applicant and County. Additionally, if the Fire District requires temporary office space for the new staff member prior to completion of renovations, the applicant will provide rent-free office space in the project area until the renovations are complete. At the discretion of the County, the applicant may also be required to provide fair share funding for the renovations; details on
the additional funding will be specified in the development agreement.
Significanee Level After Mitigation: Less than significant because the provision of adequate funding would ensure impacts on the Sacramento River Fire District are minimal.
Impact PS-4: New students generated by the project would exceed the capacity of Burchfield Elementary School, resulting in the need for a new school in the Colusa Unified School District.

The project would add 286 new residential units to the CUSD service area. The CUSD's student
generation rates are 0.323 students per household for the grade range from Kindergarten through 6, 0.084 students per household for the grade range from grades 7 and 8, and 0.208 students per household for the
grade range from through 12 for a combined total rate of 0.615 students per household (SchoolWorks,
Inc. 2006).

Based on these rates, the project would generate 175 new students by 2010, the estimated year of project completion. Ninety-two (92) new students would attend Burchfield Elementary School, 24 would attend Egling Middle School, and 59 would attend Colusa High School or Colusa Alternative High School. This increase would exceed the capacity of the elementary school, which is near capacity. The middle and high schools would have adequate capacity for the new students generated by the project (refer to Table 4.3-1). Because the existing elementary school would not have sufficient capacity to serve the project, a new a elementary school would be required, which could result in adverse environmental impacts. The increased demand on the CUSD would be a significant impact.

Significance Level Before Mitigation: Significant.

Environmental Impact Report 4-39

General Plan and Zoning Amendment
Impact Analysis Colusa Industrial Properties

Mitigation Measure PS-4: Provide fair share funding for a new elementary school and other facilities deemed necessary by the Colusa Unified School District.
The CUSD can assess developer fees for the project to help pay for additional facilities (i.e., a new
elementary school) needed to serve new students generated by the project. The CUSD can assess these fees at a maximum rate of $2.63 per square foot of assessable space for residential development and $0.42 for commercial or industrial development as specified in Govt. Code Sec. 65995. These fees constitute the exclusive means of both "considering" and "mitigating" school facilities impacts of projects and are "deemed to provide full and complete school facilities mitigation" [Govt. Code Sec. 65996(a) and (h)]. At the discretion of Colusa County, the County may identify additional fair share funding in the development agreement to help fund new school facilities.
Significance Level After Mitigation: Less than significant because the developer fees would mitigate school facility impacts.
Impact PS-5: The project would increase City park usage by 15 percent and accelerate physical deterioration of the City's park facilities, resulting in the need for increased maintenance and possibly new facilities.
The project would add 860 residents to the region, increasing usage of the City of Colusa's parks by approximately 15 percent (860 new residents / 5,582 City residents = 15%). The increased usage would further inhibit the ability of the City's park system to adequately serve the community and accelerate physical deterioration of the park facilities. The City would be required to increase maintenance of its parks, and new park facilities may be required to accommodate the increase in usage. The increased demand on City parks would result in a significant impact.
Significance Level Before Mitigation: Signiticant
Mitigation Measure PS-5: Provide fair share funding for park development and City park maintenance, operation, and renovations based on the increased demand of 15 percent.
The County will require the applicant to provide fair share funding to the City for park development, maintenance, operation, and renovations to mitigate the impacts of the project's new residents. The County will identify specific funding requirements in coordination with the City and will require the payment of the fees prior to approval of subdivision maps. The specific amount of funding will be identified in the development agreement between the applicant and the County.
Significance Level After Mitigation: Less than significant because the provision of fair share funding for park development, maintenance, operation, and renovations would mitigate park impacts.

Impact PS-6: The project would increase visitation at the Colusa-Sacramento River State
Recreation Area, Colusa County Fairgrounds, and Colusa or Delevan National Wildlife Refuges, but would not be expected to accelerate substantial physical deterioration of these recreation facilities.

The service area for the Colusa-Sacramento River SRA extends well beyond Colusa County. Project generated usage at the SRA, therefore, would not constitute as large of a percentage of overall users as it would for City parks. Assuming half of the project's 860 residents would visit the SRA three times a year, the project would increase annual visitation by around 2 percent. This is not considered a substantial

Environmental Impact Report 4-40

General Pian and Zoning Amendment
Impact Analysis Colusa Industrial Properties
increase and would not be expected to accelerate substantial physical deterioration of the facility. The project, therefore, would result in a less-than-significant impact on the Colusa-Sacramento River SRA.
Public use of the lawns within the Colusa County Fairgrounds is currently low (i.e., one or two users per day). A 15 percent increase generated by the project's residents would not be expected to cause substantial physical deterioration of the facility. The project, therefore, would result in a less-than- significant impact on the Colusa County Fairgrounds facilities.
The FWS does not have user thresholds for the Colusa or Delevan NWRs and has indicated that increased
park visitation generated by the project would not adversely affect the NWRs (Forester 2006). The project, therefore, would result in a less-than-significant impact related to increased visitation to the NWRs.

Significance Level: Less than significant because the project would result in minimal impacts to
regional parks.

Impact PS-7: The project would result a in a minor increase in demand for library services.
According to library staff, the project would increase demand for library services and would require additional staff, but would not generate the need to construct new or expanded facilities (Rawlins 2006). Tax revenue from the project would provide funding through the County General Fund for staff increases. Distribution of these funds to the appropriate entity is at the discretion of the County. The project would result in a minor increase in demand on library services and require new staff, which would be funded through the General Fund; therefore, impacts on library services would be less than significant.
Significance Level: Less than significant because the project would not substantially increase the
demand for library services.

Impact PS-8: The project would result in a minor increase in demand on medical and public health
services and facilities.

It is reasonable to expect the project to increase the need for public health services in proportion to the increase in the County's population generated by the project. The project would add 860 residents to the County, resulting in an increase of approximately 4 percent based on the 2005 population of 20,880.
The additional population would increase demand on services provided by the Colusa County Behavioral Health Center and Department of Health Services. According to Colusa County Behavioral Health Center
staff, the project would increase demand for behavioral health services in the County, but would not generate the need to construct new or expanded facilities (Joiner 2006). Tax revenue from the project would provide funding through the County General Fund for staff increases and minor improvements that may be needed for the existing facilities. Distribution of these funds to the appropriate entity is at the discretion of the County.
The additional population would also increase demand on medical services, thereby increasing demand on the Colusa Regional Medical Center's physicians (already at capacity), administrative staff, and facilities. According to Colusa Regional Medical Center staff, the project would demand about 10 hours a week of
additional physician time to serve the new residents. A new physician and a small number of complementary staff would be needed because the medical center is operating at capacity for physicians. These medical professionals would need supplemental office space because the medical center offices are operating at capacity. Also, the medical center's emergency room is inadequately sized to handle the existing population and currently needs expansion without the project. The project would increase

Environmental Impact Report 4-41

General Plan and Zoning Amendment
Impact Analysis Colusa Industrial Properties
demand on emergency services, contributing to the need for additional emergency room space (Parker 2006). The medical center is preparing a strategic plan, scheduled for release in 2007, but the nature and extent of future plans for medical center expansion are not yet known
Because the project would result in a minimal increase in demand on public health services (4 percent increase), impacts on the public health service providers would be less than significant.
Significance Level: Less than significant because the project would not substantially increase the demand for public health services.
Impact PS-9: The project would result in a minor increase in demand on Superior Court and County Probation Department services.
The project would increase the County's population, thereby increasing Superior Court caseloads. The Superior Court is currently operating at capacity for staffing and facilities, and the increased caseloads would require the Court to hire additional staff and increase the size of their facilities. It is uncertain whether the Superior Court would construct a new facility or renovate existing Court buildings (Pearson
2007).

The project would also increase caseloads for the Colusa County Probation Department, whose staffing levels are not currently adequate to meet the needs of the County's existing adult population. The project would also increase juvenile caseloads, exacerbating the need for a juvenile hall. The Probation Department does not have specific plans for constructing a juvenile hall, although the need for a juvenile hall has been relayed to the County (Bordin 2007).
Funding for improvements to court and probation facilities would likely be provided by tax revenue in the County and would be distributed via the General Fund. The project would contribute taxes to the General Fund, which provides funding for facilities improvements and new staff.
Because the project would result in a minimal increase in demand on court and probation services (4
percent increase), impacts on the court system and Probation Department would be less than significant.

Significance Level: Less than significant because the project would not substantially increase the demand for court and probation services.

Significant and Unavoidable Impacts

4.4 TRANSPORTATION AND TRAFFIC
This section provides a summary of the more detailed traffic study prepared by KD Anderson and Associates (Appendix C). The section identifies applicable regulations and describes current and projected traffic volume levels and accompanying traffic operations on the roadways and intersections within the project vicinity. The impact analysis discusses three scenarios presented in the traffic study:
Existing Conditions Plus Project
Existing Plus Approved/Pending Projects Plus Project (Year 2010)
Cumulative Impacts of Buildout of the City of Colusa Draft General Plan Update (Colusa GPU;
Year 2025)

The analysis discusses the effects of the project on roadways and intersections within the Park as well as
select roadways and intersections in the project vicinity, including within the City of Colusa. Mitigation
measures are identified for significant impacts to reduce significant traffic impacts.

4.4.1 Setting

Regulatory Setting
California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) Guide for the Preparation of Traffic Impact Studies identifies methodologies to use when evaluating traffic impacts (Caltrans 2002). According to this guide, the Level of Service (LOS) for state highways should be at LOS "C." For facilities operating at a lower existing LOS, the current LOS should be maintained.

The Colusa County Geueral Plan Circulation Element describes transportation and traffic conditions
in Colusa County with projections through the year 2010 (Colusa County 1989). The goals and policies of the Circulation Element discuss improvements to the circulation system in the County, including roadways, intersections, public transit, railroads, air traffic, pedestrians and bicycles, pipeline and transmission lines, waterways, and scenic highway designations. Policy CIRC-2 identifies the LOS "C3 as the point where major new capitol improvements should be made. Colusa County's minimum standard is LOS "C" on County roads.
The project area is currently within the sphere of influence of the City of Colusa, and the project's proposed residential and commercial uses are discussed in the City's Draft GPU (City of Colusa 2007b). Although the project is within the County, the goals and policies of the Colusa GPU are applied to the circulation system because many of the affected roadways and intersections occur within the City. The Colusa GPU identifies a LOS of "C" as the accepted roadway standard for streets and intersections. Where a LOS of "D" or worse is already present, the Colusa GPU identifies appropriate mitigation measures to minimize additional impacts from new development.

Environmental Setting

Existing Street System
Regional access to the project area is from SR 20 to the east and west of Colusa. Access from the project vicinity to the developed areas of Colusa is via existing roads, such as Wescott Road, Bridge Street, Sioc
Street, and Fremont Street (Figure 4.4-1). Access to the Park is via Sunrise Boulevard and Farinon Road.
SR 20 is the primary regional access to the Colusa area. SR 20 originates at an intersection on SR 1 in Mendocino County and continues easterly across northern California to its junction with Interstate 80 in Nevada County. In Colusa County SR 20 provides access to Interstate 80 at Williams and links the County with the Yuba City-Marysville area to the east. Locally, SR 20 is the main route through the City of Colusa as it enters it the east end of the community as 10th Street, continues easterly as Market Street,
then turns south as Bridge Street before passing the east boundary of the project area.
In the vicinity of the project area, SR 20 is two-lane rural highway with auxiliary turn lanes at major intersections. Caltrans reported in 2005 that SR 20 carries an Average Daily Traffic (ADT) volume of 9,700 vehicles per day in the area south of Moonbend Road, with the volume reported by Caltrans to be 25,000 vehicles per day on SR 20/Market Street. Trucks comprise seven percent of the daily traffic on SR 20 through Colusa. While the reported volume south of Moonbend Road is consistent with spot traffic counts conducted for the Colusa GPU, daily volumes north of Moonbend Road in 2006 were lower.
Wescott Road is a collector road that links southern Colusa with SR 20 at the southern edge of the downtown area. Wescott Road also extends southerly into rural Colusa County. This two lane road varies in width, with limited shoulders available on the south end of the road, but more urban features (i.e., wider shoulder and sidewalks) available near the intersection with SR 20. Traffic counts conducted in 2006 by KD Anderson and Associates revealed that Wescott Road carried approximately 1,750 vehicles per day (ADT) in the area south of Cynthia Drive, with the volume rising to 4,550 vehicles (ADT) between SR 20 and Florimond Drive. per day

Cynthia Drive, Country Club Drive, and Butte Vista Way. Several local streets link SR 20 with Wescott Road in the area north of the project area. Three local streets intersect SR 20 in this area: Cynthia
Drive, Country Club Drive, and Butte Vista Drive. These streets are connected to Wescott Road via other
local streets such as Tara Drive and Florimond Drive. The 2006 volume of traffic on these local
connections is in the range of 1,000 vehicles per day (ADT).

Fremont Street and Sioc Street. Fremont Street and Sioc Street are east-west collectors that link 10th Street (SR 20) and Bridge Street (SR 20) in the area north of the project area. Both are wide two-lane roads that accommodate on-street parking and have direct residential frontage. Both streets carry approximately 5,000 vehicles per day (ADT) in the area west of Bridge Street, based on 2006 estimates.
Sunrise Boulevard is a collector street that provides access to the existing office-commercial
development in the Park via Davison Court. The existing portion of Sunrise Boulevard is a four lane road that extends westerly from SR 20 for one block. Traffic estimates for Sunrise Boulevard in 2006 identified a volume of approximately 750 vehicles per day (ADT).
Farinon Road is a collector street that extends west from an intersection on SR 20 to serve Colusa
County Airport as well as the existing industrial development along the west side of the airport via Niagra Avenue. This two lane road is relatively wide near SR 20, but narrows to two travel lanes and limited

Key intersections in the vicinity of the project area include the following five existing intersections and one future intersection:

1. SR 20 (Bridge Street) / Fremont Street (EB/WB Stop)
2. SR 20 (Bridge Street) / Sioc Street (Signal)
3. SR 20 (Bridge Street) / Wescott Road (EB Stop) 4. SR 20 / Sunrise Boulevard (EB Stop)
5. SR 20 / Farinon Road (EB Stop)
6. Wescott Road / Farinon Road Extension (future)

Existing Traffic
Peak hour LOS for a.m. and p.m. traffic were calculated along the roadways and at the key intersections using 2005 and 2006 data (Table 4,4-1 and Table 4.4-2). Current LOS were compared to adopted standards to determine whether existing conditions are satisfactory. As shown in Table 4.4-1, recent traffic counts for roadways conducted for the Colusa GPU are indicative of LOS D or better conditions at
all locations, with all city streets operating at LOS C or better. However, the Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) reported by Caltrans in 2005 is much higher in some locations and indicates LOS F.
As shown in Table 4.4-2, one intersection experiences LOS in excess of the adopted standards. Motorists waiting to turn onto northbound SR 20 at the Wescott Road intersection experience delays that are indicative of LOS E. While this individual LOS exceeds the LOS D minimum, current traffic volumes do not reach the level that satisfy peak hour volume warrants for signalization.

Other Forms of Transportation
Colusa County Transit provides dial-a-ride service for residents in Colusa (City of Colusa 2007a). The transit system includes four routes originating in Colusa that travel to William, Arbuckle, and Grimes, with occasional service to Maxwell, Princeton, and Stonyford. Medical escort transit is provided as needed to Yuba City, Chico, Woodland, and Sacramento.
The City of Colusa does not currently have any designated bike paths or lanes, although most city streets can accommodate bicycle travel (City of Colusa 2007a). A shared bike route is designated along a portion

Environmental Impact Report 4.49

General Plan and Zoning Amendment

of Wescott Road, and a path along a levee near downtown Colusa is used by bicyclists, as well as pedestrians. Most city streets have sidewalks and offer greater connectivity for pedestrian access.
The Colusa County Airport, located immediately south of the development area, provides limited general aviation services, with no scheduled commercial flights. The airport has approximately 28,000 flights annually, of which 40 percent of the operations result from general aviation (Krug 2007). Much of the air traffic is associated with agricultural operations and consists of crop-dusting planes or other small aircraft.

Existing Plus Approved/Pending Projects Traffic Conditions
Three projects within the City of Colusa have either been approved or are pending approval and are anticipated to be constructed by the time the project is built out (by 2010) (see Figure 4.4-1). These projects include:

Riverbend Estates: A residential subdivision on 442 acres north of Moonbend Road, east of Bridge Street and SR 20/45, approximately 1.5 miles north of the project area. This project includes 2,235 low-density residential units and 295 medium-density residential and is pending approval by the is City. It is being included in the Master EIR for the Colusa GPU (City of Colusa
2007a).
Tennant Estates: A residential subdivision consisting of 101 units on 40 acres between 3rd Street and Wescott Road, north of Walnut Tree Drive in south Colusa. This project has been approved by the City.
Hoblit Subdivision: A residential subdivision consisting of 12 single-family units just west of the Colusa Golf and Country Club off of Country Club is Drive. This project is under construction, and homes are being sold.

Based on the proposed number of dwelling units for each project, trip generation is estimated at 25,373 vehicles per day (ADT) with approximately 1,900 a.m. and 2,600 p.m. peak hour trips total. These trips were added to existing traffic conditions along the roadways and at the key intersections in the project vicinity (Table 4.4-3 and Table 4.4-4). Existing plus approved/pending projects LOS were compared to adopted standards to determine whether existing conditions plus the three City projects are satisfactory. As shown in Table 4.4-3, traffic conditions on most roadways would be LOS D or better conditions, with most city streets operating at LOS C or better. Bridge Street between Carson Street and Fremont Street and Fremont Street between 1$ and 2nd Streets would operate at unacceptable LOS F. Additionally, four other roadway segments would operate at unacceptable LOS F based on the AADT reported by Caltrans in 2005.

As shown in Table 4.4-4, three intersections would experience LOS in excess of the adopted standards. Motorists waiting to turn onto Bridge Street from Fremont Street and Wescott Road and waiting to turn onto SR 20 from Sunrise Boulevard would experience delays that are indicative of LOS D (a.m. peak hour at Bridge Street/Wescott Road) and LOS F (a.m. and p.m. peak hours Bridge Street/Fremont Street; p.m. peak hour Bridge Street/Wescott Road; and p.m. peak hour SR 20/Sunrise Boulevard). Projected traffic volumes at these three intersections would reach the level that satisfies peak hour volume warrants for signalization.

Cumulative Traffic Conditions
The City of Colusa is in the process of updating its General Plan. According to the Draft General Plan Update (City of Colusa 2007b), the 3,751-acre proposed sphere of influence would be built out within the 20-year life of the GPU (by 2025). The amount of new development anticipated at buildout includes development in "reserve" areas under current Colusa County designations, including the project area. As noted in Table 4.4-5, under "mid-range" assumptions for density, implementing the Colusa GPU could result in more than 7,000 new dwelling units in Colusa. Another 5.9 million square feet of non-residential development is also anticipated.
Trip generation under the Colusa GPU land uses is estimated at 145,115 vehicles per day (ADT) with more than 10,000 a.m. and p.m. peak hour trips each. The project's land uses are included in these trip estimates because the project area is within the City's sphere of influence.

In addition to the projected land uses and trip generation, various roadway improvements are identified in the Colusa GPU. The Colusa GPU's implementation measures include the creation of a Streets and Roadways Master Plan that would identify improvements needed to accommodate growth and be the basis for an updated traffic mitigation fee program. The Colusa GPU circulation diagram identifies several new streets to carry traffic through the community and provide access to new growth areas. Brief descriptions of the new streets are provided below, based on the Colusa GPU (City of Colusa 2007b).
Farinon-Railroad Collector. New development in southern Colusa would create the need for a collector street that provides access to SR 20. The Colusa GPU circulation diagram indicates that the Farinon Road - Railroad Collector would generally follow the alignment of the abandoned railroad right-of-way (ROW) from an intersection on SR 20 west of Will S Green Street to Wescott Road. The eastern portion of the route would follow the existing Farinon Road from SR 20, directly west to Wescott Road in eastern Colusa. Note that this alignment is identified along the southern project boundary in the Colusa GPU and
is not the same as the project's proposed Farinon Road extension, which would be located north of the proposed single-family residential area. The intent of the Colusa GPU is to provide access to new development while avoiding creation of a "bypass" that would divert through traffic away from downtown Colusa.

East Side Collector. New development east of SR 20 would be served by a new collector that extends north from the SR 20 / Sunrise Boulevard intersection to the extension of Market Street.

Will S Green Street extension. Development in the western portion of the City would be served by creating a collector that links Wilson Avenue with SR 20 at the Will S Green intersection.
3rd Street, 5th Street, and 8th Street Extensions. The existing downtown grid street system would be extended south into new growth areas.
Colusa Avenue Extension. Colusa Avenue would be extended easterly from Will S Green Street to 3rd
Street.

Tenant Drive. Tenant Drive would be extended westerly from Wescott Road to Will S Green Street to serve new south Colusa development.

4.4.2 Impact Analysis

Methodology
KD Anderson and Associates conducted traffic counts in the project vicinity in 2005 and 2006 and calculated the project's expected trip generation based on proposed land uses (see Appendix C for the traffic study). To quantitatively evaluate traffic conditions and to provide a basis for comparison of

Environmental Impact Report 4-53

General Plan and Zoning Amendment
Impact Analysis Colusa Industrial Properties

operating conditions with and without project generated traffic, Levels of Service were determined at study area intersections and on individual roadway segments. LOS is a quantitative measure of traffic operating conditions whereby a letter grade "A" through "F" is assigned to an intersection. LOS "A" through "F" represents progressively worsening traffic conditions and increased traffic congestion and delays at intersections. For each unsignalized intersection, KD Anderson and Associates also evaluated
the need for a traffic signal to reduce impacts. Traffic signals are warranted under specific conditions based on traffic delays and operating conditions as described in the California Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices (Caltrans 2006), and the need for a traffic signal indicates unacceptable operating conditions. Cumulative impacts are based on the Colusa GPU land uses, which include the project. Additional methodology for calculating LOS and evaluating impacts is described in the traffic study (Appendix C).

Criteria for Determining Significance
Adverse impacts to transportation and traffic would be considered significant if the project would:
Exceed, either individually or cumulatively, LOS of "C" on County roads based on the County
service level thresholds.
Exceed, either individually or cumulatively, LOS of "C" along City roads and LOS of "D" for state highways based on the Colusa GPU service level thresholds.
Cumulatively exceed LOS of "D" for roads with an existing LOS of "D" or worse and contribute
to five percent or more of the roadway volumes based on the Colusa GPU service level
thresholds.
Exceed, either individually or cumulatively, LOS of "C" at intersections based on Caltrans and the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual service level thresholds.
Require construction of transportation facilities, which could have an adverse physical effect on
the environment.
Result in a change in air traffic patterns, including either an increase in traffic levels or a change in location that results in substantial safety risks.
Substantially increase hazards due to a design feature (e.g., sharp curves or dangerous intersections) or incompatible uses (e.g., farm equipment).
Conflict with adopted policies, plans, or programs supporting alternative transportation (e.g., bus turnouts, bicycle racks).
Result in unsafe conditions for bicyclists or pedestrians, including unsafe bicycle/pedestrian,
bicycle/motor vehicle, or pedestrian/motor vehicle conflict.

Impacts and Mitigation Measures
Impact TT-1 (Project): The project would generate 10,497 daily trips, which would increase traffic congestion on State Route 20 (Bridge Street) in the area between Sioc Street and Fremont Street, resulting in a reduction in level of service from D to F.
The project is expected to generate a gross total of 10,497 daily trip ends. Of this total, 3,480 daily trips would be "pass-by" trips drawn to retail uses from passing traffic along SR. 20. A total of 7,017 new daily trips are forecast, with 506 trips expected during the a.m. peak hour and 531 trips expected to occur during the p.m. peak hour.

Environmental Impact Report 4-54

Impact Analysis General Plan and Zoning Amendment Colusa Industrial Properties
The relative impact of the project on study area roads can be understood from comparison of daily traffic volumes with and without the project. As shown in Table 4.4-6, the addition of project trips alone would reduce the LOS on SR 20 (Bridge Street) in the area between Sioc Street and Fremont Street from LOS D
(acceptable) to LOS F (unacceptable). The amount of traffic added by the project on this roadway segment represents a 23 percent increase over existing volumes. This exceeds the
significance identified in the Colusa GPU and would be a significant impact. percent threshold of

Traffic conditions on other roadways would be within the acceptable limits, and the roads would operate at acceptable LOS. SR 20 segments within the City of Colusa and between the project area and City limits would be reduced to LOS D with the addition of project trips (based on KD Anderson traffic counts). The LOS on 3rd Street and Wescott Road would be comparable to existing conditions, with minimal increases in traffic. The LOS for Sioc Street and Fremont Street would be reduced to LOS C, which is acceptable to the City and County, Increased trips on most of the roadways in the project vicinity would be within acceptable LOS and would result in less than significant impacts.

Significance Level Before Mitigation: Significant.

Mitigation Measure TT-1: Provide funding to install a signal at Bridge Street and Fremont Street
intersection when Caltrans approves.

Environmental Impact Report 4-55

General Plan and Zoning Amendment
Impact Analysis Colusa Industrial Properties

The County should require the applicant to provide sufficient funding to cover the costs of installing a traffic signal at the Bridge Street (SR. 20) Fremont Street intersection, which would allow the intersection to operate at acceptable LOS standards (LOS D), but the roadway segment would continue to operate at unacceptable LOS F. Payment of the costs should be included in the project development
agreement. In order for this to happen, the costs of this roadway improvement would need to be determined, and the project's fair share calculated for reimbursement purposes, prior to executing the development agreement. The payments would be held in escrow until the signal is approved by Caltrans. The development agreement would enforce payment of the applicant's fair share costs (full funding for this improvement, with reimbursement by other sources) prior to issuance of building permits.
However, this mitigation measure is not considered feasible for the following reasons. First, this improvement is not currently planned or programmed and is not warranted based on traffic conditions (existing or existing plus project); there is no current program for estimating the costs of this improvement; and the timing of these cost estimates is uncertain. Second, a funding mechanism (e.g.., city and county traffic impact fee) is not in place to collect fair share costs from other future projects, SO there is no assurance this improvement would be implemented. Third, Caltrans would need to approve the improvement, which is unlikely because a signal warrant has not been met. Finally, the City would be responsible for implementing the improvement, and the County has no control over whether or when it would be constructed.

Significance Level After Mitigation: Significant and unavoidable; although the traffic signal would sufficiently mitigate the project's traffic impacts at the intersection, no feasible mitigation is available to mitigate roadway impacts (see Appendix C), and the signal is not currently approved and may not be implemented.
Impact TT-2 (Project): The addition of 10,497 daily project trips would have an incremental impact on traffic operations at key intersections in the project vicinity.
The length of minor street approach delays would increase at Bridge Street / Fremont Street intersection, and the LOS for motorists waiting to turn onto SR 20 would exceed the LOS D threshold (Table 4.4-7). Similarly, very long delays would be expected at the Bridge Street / Wescott Road intersection, and the LOS for motorists waiting to turn north onto Bridge Street would exceed the LOS D minimum. Motorists waiting to turn left onto SR 20 at the SR 20 / Sunrise Boulevard intersection would experience delays that are indicative of LOS E. LOS at all other intersections would remain at LOS D or better conditions.

An increase in traffic at the Bridge Street / Fremont Street intersection, the Bridge Street / Wescott Road intersection, and the SR 20 / Sunrise Boulevard intersection would exceed the LOS D threshold and would result in significant impacts. Development of the project would result in LOS in excess of the LOS D minimum at some key intersections; however, traffic signal warrants are not projected to be met at any intersection based on the anticipated trip generation.

Impact TT-3: Construction of project roads would have a minor physical effect on the environment.

The project would involve construction of Farinon Road through the development area to Wescott Road, approximately 1,500 feet to the west. Internal project roads would be constructed within the residential
developments and commercial area. These roads would result in a minor loss of agricultural fields and disturbed habitat, as discussed in Sections 4.11 Biological Resources and 4.12 Agricultural Resources. The roads would improve circulation within and to the project area, including emergency access from police, fire, and ambulance services (see Section 4.10 Hazards and Hazardous Materials). Road construction is not expected to affect cultural resources (see Section 4.13). Adverse physical effects
associated with road construction would be minimal and less than significant.

Significance Level: Less than significant because road construction would have minimal impacts on
the environment.

Impact TT-4: Project implementation may result in minor increases in airport traffic and could adversely affect air traffic patterns, resulting in increased safety concerns for aircraft operators.
The project is adjacent to the Colusa County Airport, and airplanes would fly over the project area during take off and landing. Some crop-dusting planes take off to the north, over the project area, and turn either west or east to access agricultural fields in those directions. These planes carry heavy loads and are not capable of making quick or sharp turns or maneuver excessively during departure (Appendix I); therefore, any turning or maneuver occurs when the planes have reached an acceptable altitude, and the operator is capable of making the turn. Generally, aircraft currently turn about midway into the development area (roughly the middle of the proposed golf course expansion area) and would fly over the proposed location for low density residential uses to the west and commercial/business uses to the east.
The project proposes an overflight corridor at the southern end of the single-family homes in the western portion of the project area (two locations contemplated, as shown in Figure 3-2) to reduce safety concerns with overflights (see Section 4.10 for a further discussion of safety concerns associated with the airport). As designed, the project would result in a modification to current air traffic patterns for crop-dusting
planes turning west over the development area. These planes would be encouraged to make an carlier turn and fly along the southern boundary of the low density residential area. However, crop-dusting planes would not likely be capable of making such a quick turn a from departure without compromising flight safety (see Appendix I). Use of the overflight corridor, either as proposed or the alternative option, could compromise flight safety and result in a significant impact.

The project is not expected to substantially increase airport traffic, although some project residents may utilize the airport for business or commercial uses. Hangar access may be provided via the overflight corridor, SO residents along the corridor may utilize the airport.

Because the project could compromise flight safety through modifications to air traffic patterns, impacts
would be significant.

Significance Level Before Mitigation: Significant.
Mitigation Measure: None feasible, Although several alternative measures were considered to ensure flight safety is not compromised, none of these measures is considered feasible because of a lack of an enforcement mechanism and other issues, as discussed in Sections 4.5 and 4.10 and Appendix I.

Environmental Impact Report 4-58

General Plan and Zoning Amendment
Impact Analysis Colusa Industrial Properties

Significance Level After Mitigation: Significant and unavoidable because no feasible mitigation exists to reduce concerns with flight safety over : congested area in close proximity to the airport.
Impact TT-5: Agricultural vehicle traffic and road designs may cause minor hazards to drivers in
the project vicinity, but the project would not substantially increase driver hazards.
The project area is located adjacent to agricultural land and a primary access route to the City of Colusa (SR 20). Farm equipment or slow vehicles on access roads could pose hazards to drivers in agricultural areas. Current road improvements on SR 20 and the proposed extension of Farinon Road would improve project access and minimize these adverse effects.
As depicted in Figure 3-2, roadway improvements would consist of expanding Farinon Road through the project area to Wescott Road, realigning Farinon Road out of the airport property, extending Davison Drive from the existing office buildings to the proposed highway commercial uses, and terminating Sunrise Boulevard at a cul-de-sac west of the commercial/office space. Farinon Road through the development area would have slight curves and intersect other project roads at right angles. Sunrise Boulevard would end in a cul-de-sac and would have sufficient room for turning around. Roads within the residential areas would be designed when tentative subdivision maps are submitted to the County; however, a preliminary lotting study identifies roads with subtle curves and wider roads where curves are steeper to facilitate turning.
The extension of Farinon Road to Wescott Road would provide alternate access to and from Colusa. This road extension would also serve City traffic by providing an alternate means to accessing southbound SR 20 east of the project area. This extension could increase safety concerns for project traffic due to the volume of traffic that would use the road. Road design, however, with slight curves and adequate visibility at intersections in the project area, would ensure minimal hazards for project traffic.
The realignment of Farinon Road to be further north of the end of the airport runway would reduce safety concerns with traffic being affected by airplanes. The current alignment of Farinon Road poses a safety concern for Park traffic when airplanes take off from or land to the north. Occasionally, traffic is required to wait out of the path of the airplane to avoid creating an accident. With project traffic, this could pose a concern for congestion on SR 20 and an increased potential for airplane-automobile accidents. The
realignment would locate Farinon Road 560 feet north of the end of the runway (a 100-foot difference from existing), which would reduce the concern for traffic backing up on the highway and the potential for accidents.

Davison Drive would provide primary access for highway commercial and office uses in the project area, which would avoid potential traffic delays and hazards that would otherwise be a result of providing direct access from SR 20. With interior access to these uses, project traffic would utilize established turn
lanes on SR 20 and be able to easily access the uses at lower speeds, reducing the potential for accidents.
Project roads would create minimal hazards for residents and visitors to the project area; therefore, this impact is less than significant.

Significance Level: Less than significant because the project's road network would not create substantial hazards for drivers.

Impact TT-6: The project would incrementally increase demand for the area's bicycle and
pedestrian facilities.

Environmental Impact Report 4-59

General Plan and Zoning Amendment Impact Analysis Colusa Industrial Properties
Pedestrian / Bicycle Activity. Project implementation would result in new pedestrian and bicycle activity between the project area and schools, shopping, recreation, and work in Colusa. Non-automotive travel would be expected along SR 20 and along Wescott Road in locations where sidewalks or improved shoulders are not uniformly available. The mix of automobiles, pedestrians, and cyclists sharing the travel corridors could create safety conflicts. Therefore, impacts from increased pedestrian and bicycle activities
would be significant.

Transit Services. The project would incrementally create additional demand for the Colusa County Transit "dial-a-ride" services and other transit services in the Colusa area. However, it is unlikely that development of the project would, by itself, create the need to modify existing routes or expand current services. Impacts to transit services would be less than significant.
Significance Level Before Mitigation: Significant.
Mitigation Measure TT-6: Provide sidewalks and bike routes on all project roads and establish opportunities for transit.
The applicant will encourage alternative forms of transportation for residents in the project area. The tentative subdivision map will identify safe pedestrian walkway and bicycle path between the project's land uses and Wescott Road (i.e., along Farinon Road extension), along Wescott Road to the limits of
existing sidewalks, and the provision of sidewalks and bike routes on all internal project roads. These facilities will be approved by Colusa County prior to approval of the final subdivision map. The applicant will coordinate with Colusa County Transit to identify opportunities for residents to utilize their service and provide a local pick-up/drop-off spot in the project area, if necessary.
Significance Level After Mitigation: Less than significant because the provision of opportunities for alternative transportation would reduce safety conflicts on roadways.
Impact TT-7 (Approved/Pending Projects): The project would exacerbate traffic congestion on State Route 20 between Wescott Road and Sunrise Boulevard at project buildout in 2010.
The project's addition of 10,497 daily trips on roads in the project vicinity would exacerbate traffic congestion on SR 20 in combination with the three approved/pending projects in the City of Colusa. Traffic conditions would become worse on SR 20 between Wescott Road and Sunrise Boulevard, resulting in a reduction in LOS.

The relative impact of the project on roads in the vicinity can be understood from comparison of near- term (2010) daily traffic volumes with and without the project. As shown in Table 4.4-8, without the project, SR 20 and Fremont Street would operate at unacceptable LOS. The addition of project trips alone would reduce the LOS on SR. 20 in the area between Wescott Road and Sunrise Boulevard from LOS B-E to LOS E-F. The amount of traffic added by the project on this roadway segment represents about a 30 percent increase over volumes without the project. This exceeds the 5 percent threshold of significance identified in the City of Colusa GPU and would be a significant impact.
The project would increase traffic on Fremont Street, as well, and would contribute about 12 percent of the total traffic volumes, which would be significant increase in traffic. Although LOS on Bridge Street would be reduced in the near-term, the project would not contribute substantial traffic to these roadway segments. The LOS for other roadways
acceptable limits. (3rd Street, Wescott Road, and Sioc Street) would be within the

Mitigation Measure TT-7a: Contribute fair share costs for widening State Roule 20/Bridge Street from Market Street to Farinon Road to a four-lane road (31-43% depending on the roadway segment).
The County should require the applicant to contribute its fair share to the cost of widening SR 20/Bridge Street from Market Street to Farinon Road to a four-lane road to meet LOS D standards. The project's contribution should be equal to 31 to 43 percent of the improvement to correspond with the project's contribution to new traffic along SR 20 (Appendix C). Payment of the project's fair share costs should be included in the project development agreement. In order for this to happen, the costs of this roadway
improvement would need to be determined, and the project's fair share calculated, prior to executing the development agreement. The payments would be held in escrow pending full funding by other developer fees or other sources. The development agreement would enforce payment of the applicant's fair share
costs prior to issuance of building permits.

The applicant would also identify the ROW needed to accommodate future traffic conditions along SR 20 and make an irrevocable offer of dedication for that ROW adjacent to the project area.
However, this mitigation measure is not considered feasible for the following reasons. First, this improvement is not currently planned or programmed; there is no current program for estimating the costs of this improvement; and the timing of these cost estimates is uncertain. Second, a funding mechanism (e.g.., city and county traffic impact fee) is not in place to collect fair share costs from other future projects, so there is no assurance this improvement would be implemented. Third, Caltrans would need to approve the improvement, so implementation and timing are uncertain. Fourth, the County would have no control over implementation of the improvement within City limits. Lastly, this roadway improvement may not be feasible to construct due to existing development in the City and lack of available ROW.

Mitigation Measure TT-7b: Contribule fair share costs (16%) for modifying Fremont Street.
The County should require the applicant to contribute its fair share to the cost of either widening Fremont Street to a four-lane road (re-striping) or converting Fremont Street and Sioc Street to one-way roads to meet acceptable LOS standards. The project's contribution should be equal to 16 percent of the improvement to correspond with the project's contribution to new traffic along Fremont Street (Appendix C). Payment of the project's fair share costs should be included in the project development agreement. In order for this to happen, the costs of this roadway improvement would need to be determined, and the project's fair share calculated, prior to executing the development agreement. The payments would be held in escrow pending full funding by other developer fees or other sources. The development agreement would enforce payment of the applicant's fair share costs prior to issuance of building permits.
However, this mitigation measure is not considered feasible for the following reasons.

Second, a funding mechanism (e.g.., city and county traffic impact fee) is not in place to collect fair share costs from other future projects, so there is no assurance this improvement
would be implemented. Lastly, the County would have no control over implementation of the improvement because it is within City limits.

Significance Level After Mitigation: Significant and unavoidable; although these improvements would improve the project's traffic impacts to acceptable levels, the improvements are not
currently funded or approved and may not be implemented.
Impact TT-8 (Approved/Pending Projects): The project would exacerbate degraded traffic operations at key intersections in the project vicinity at project buildout in 2010.
The project would add 10,497 daily trips to traffic conditions in the project vicinity in addition to the trips
generated by the three approved/pending projects. The length of minor street approach delays would increase at each of the key intersections (Table 4.4-9). Although conditions without the project would be adverse at Bridge Street / Fremont Street; Bridge Street , Wescott Road; and SR 20 / Sunrise Boulevard, the project would further exacerbate long delays and poor conditions. Traffic conditions at these three intersections would warrant traffic signals (with and without the project).
Traffic delays at Bridge Street / Sioc Street and SR 20 / Farinon Road (eastbound traffic turning onto SR 20) would be reduced to unacceptable conditions with the addition of project traffic. An increase in traffic at this intersection would exceed the LOS D threshold and would result in significant impacts. However, a traffic signal warrant is not projected to be met at this intersection based on the anticipated traffic
conditions.

Mitigation Measure TT-8a: Contribute fair share costs for road improvements on State Route 20 between Fremont Street and Wescott Road (14-59% depending on the improvement).
The County should require the applicant to contribute its fair share to the cost of the following road improvements on SR 20/Bridge Street from Fremont Street to Wescott Road to meet acceptable LOS
standards:

Widen the SR 20/Fremont Street intersection to provide left turn lanes and right turn lanes on each leg of the intersection (fair share costs are 14%).
Improve the SR 20/Sioc Street intersection by adding an overlapping eastbound right-turn lane and adjusting the grade differential to accommodate the improvement (fair share costs are 50%). This improvement may require acquisition of additional right-of-way.
Improve the SR 20 Wescott Road intersection by installing a traffic signal and widening the intersection to provide a northbound left turn lane (fair share costs are 59%).
Payment of the project's fair share costs should be included in the project development agreement, In order for this to happen, the costs of these roadway improvements would need to be determined, and the project's fair share calculated, prior to executing the development agreement. The payments would be held in escrow pending full funding by other developer fees or other sources. The development agreement would enforce payment of the applicant's fair share costs prior to issuance of building permits.
However, this mitigation measure is not considered feasible for the following reasons. First, these improvements are not currently planned or programmed; there is no current program for estimating the costs of these improvements; and the timing of these cost estimates is uncertain. Second, a funding mechanism (e.g.., city and county traffic impact fee) is not in place to collect fair share costs from other future projects, so there is no assurance these improvements would be implemented. Third, Caltrans would need to approve the improvements, so implementation and timing are uncertain. Lastly, the County
would have 1o control over implementation of the improvements because they are within City limits.
Mitigation Measure TT-8b: Contribute fair share costs for installing traffic signals on State Route 20 al Sunrise Boulevard and Farinon Road (30-36% depending on the improvement).

The County should require the applicant to contribute its fair share to the cost of installing traffic signals on SR 20 at Sunrise Boulevard and Farinon Road to meet acceptable LOS standards. The project contributes 36 percent of new traffic at the SR 20 / Sunrise Boulevard intersection and 30 percent of new traffic at the SR 20 / Farinon Boulevard intersection, thus the project's fair share would be 36 percent for the Sunrise signal and 30 percent for the Farinon signal. Payment of the project's fair share costs should be included in the project development agreement. In order for this to happen, the costs of these roadway improvements would need to be determined, and the project's fair share calculated, prior to executing the development agreement. The payments would be held in escrow pending full funding by other developer fees or other sources.

Significance Level After Mitigation: Significant and unavoidable because the traffic signals and road improvements are not currently funded or approved and may not be implemented.

Impact TT-9 (Cumulative): Cumulative development would result in a substantial increase in traffic volumes along roads in the project vicinity in 2025, exceeding acceptable Level of Service in
several locations.

Cumulative impacts based on the land uses identified in the Colusa GPU would result in a substantial increase in traffic within the City as well as on roads leading into the City, causing increased congestion, traffic delays, and safety concerns. As depicted in Table 4.4-10, several road segments would result in unsatisfactory LOS of "D" and "F". Several segments would continue to operate at acceptable LOS and are not further discussed.

The volume of traffic forecast for SR 20 through Colusa would exceed the LOS D threshold for a two-
lane arterial. The amount of project traffic added to SR 20 represents more than five percent of the current volume at locations on Bridge Street and along the project's frontage, which is a significant impact. In addition, the volume of traffic forecast on eastern SR 20 north of the project area would approach or exceed the LOS D threshold for a four-lane facility. Traffic volumes on SR 20 east and west of the City of Colusa sphere of influence are indicative of LOS F conditions. Regionally, development in and near to
Colusa would contribute to substantial increases in traffic along the highway.
The volume of traffic expected on Fremont Street, Sioc Street, Wescott Road, and the proposed Farinon Road expansion would exceed the LOS C threshold for collector streets. Traffic volumes on Sioc Street
would create LOS F conditions. Traffic volumes on Wescott Road between the SR 20 intersection and
Cynthia Avenue would create LOS F conditions, and traffic volumes on Wescott Road between Cynthia Avenue and the Railroad Collector would create LOS D conditions. Traffic volumes on the proposed Farinon Road extension between SR 20 and Wescott Road would create LOS D conditions and would be a result of project traffic, existing City traffic, and new traffic from other cumulative projects. The project's traffic would contribute to approximately 7.5 percent of daily traffic on the extension of Farinon Road (Appendix C). The amount of traffic added by the project would exceed five percent of the current volume on Fremont Street, Sioc Street, and Wescott Road; therefore, these impacts are significant.

approved/pending projects impacts.
Mitigation Measure TT-9a: Contribute fair share costs for road improvements on Sioc Street and Wescott Road within the City of Colusa (1.4-2.3% depending on the improvement).
The County should require the applicant to contribute its fair share to the cost of the following road
improvements on Sioc Street and Wescott Road to meet acceptable LOS standards:
Modify Sioc Street to provide either four-lane striping (eliminate on-street parking) or a Sioc/Fremont one-way couplet (fair share costs are 1.6%).
Widen Wescott Road to four lanes from Cynthia Drive to SR 20, including acquiring additional ROW (fair share costs are 2.3%). This level of improvement does not appear to be feasible in this area due to limited ROW and the location of existing development.
Improve Wescott Road to arterial standards from Cynthia Drive to the City limits, including acquiring additional ROW (fair share costs are 1.4%).
Payment of the project's fair share costs should be included in the project development agreement. In order for this to happen, the costs of these roadway improvements would need to be determined, and the project's fair share calculated, prior to executing the development agreement. The payments would be held in escrow pending full funding by other developer fees or other sources.

The County should require the applicant to contribute its fair share to the cost of the following road improvements on Wescott Road and Farinon Road to meet acceptable LOS standards:

Construct Farinon Road extension a as a four-lane road and dedicate the ROW to accommodate
four lanes (fair share costs are 3.2%).

Mitigation Measure TT-9c: Contribute fair share costs for widening State Route 20 to four lanes from SR 99 to Interstate 5 (2.0-2.1% depending on the improvement).
The County should require the applicant to contribute its fair share to the cost of widening SR 20 to four lanes from SR 99 to Interstate 5 to meet acceptable LOS standards. The project contributes 2.0 percent of
new traffic on SR 20 west of Colusa and 2.1 percent of new traffic on SR 20 east of Colusa, thus the project's fair share would be 2.0 percent for the western segment and 2.1 percent for the eastern segment. Payment of the project's fair share costs should be included in the project development agreement. In order for this to happen, the costs of these roadway improvements would need to be determined, and the
project's fair share calculated, prior to executing the development agreement. The payments would be held in escrow pending full funding by other developer fees or other sources. The development agreement would enforce payment of the applicant's fair share costs prior to issuance of building permits.

4.5 NOISE
This section provides a summary of a noise analysis prepared for the project by Brown-Buntin Associates (Appendix D). It describes the regulatory and environmental settings for noise in the project area. The impact analysis evaluates the effects of traffic and airport noise on project uses as well as the effects of
the project on noise in the area. Mitigation measures are identified to reduce significant impacts.

4.5.1 Setting

Regulatory Setting
The Safety Element of the Colusa Connty General Plan contains noise standards to be applied to new projects. Specifically, Policy SAFE-14 states that:
New projects should be conditioned, improved, or denied according to the standards of
Table SAFE-3. When necessary, environmental impact reports should be used to gauge the existing and projected noise environments for proposed projects. All projects in areas above the "conditionally acceptable" noise level shall provide the county with proof from a professional acoustical consultant that occupants of the project will be protected from excessive noise.

Table 4.5-1 provides a summary of the noise standards from Table SAFE-3.

Source: Colusa County 1989

The Noise Element of the Colusa County Airport CLUP adopts Compatibility Guidelines for Noise (Colusa County ALUC 1995). These guidelines indicate that single-family detached and multi-family dwellings are compatible with aircraft noise exposures of 55 dB or less at the community noise equivalent level (CNEL), which is a daily measurement of noise exposure for a community. Hotels, motels, inns, and bed and breakfasts are considered compatible up to 80 dB CNEL, provided that: "Measures to achieve an
interior noise level of 50 dB CNEL must be incorporated in the design and construction of portions of buildings where the public is received, office areas, and other areas where people work or congregate."

Furthermore, the CLUP guidelines require that measures to achieve an interior noise level of 45 dB CNEL must be incorporated into the design and construction of all noise sensitive areas, including sleeping rooms. It is assumed that this standard would apply to residential units and hotels/motels.
The CLUP guidelines included CNEL contours for the Colusa County Airport for the year 1981. Those CNEL contours were subsequently updated in March 2004 by Aries Consultants LTD. The Aries study identified projected CNEL contours for the year 2015 (Appendix D). Bollard Acoustical Consultants evaluated the noise contours in 2005 for purposes of evaluating noise impacts in the project area (Appendix D). The noise contours produced for the June 2005 Bollard Acoustical Consultants report (shown in Figure 4.5-1) appear to validate the general location and shape of the CNEL contours projected
by Aries Consultants LTD for the year 2015.

Environmental Setting
With the exception of aircraft noise due to Colusa County Airport operations, the noise environment within the Park is that of a quiet rural area. Traffic noise from SR 20 and aircraft noise and overflights from Colusa County Airport are the dominant noise sources.

Existing Ambient Noise
The existing noise environment in the project area primarily results from vehicular traffic on SR 20 and airplane operations associated with the nearby Colusa County Airport. Occasional noise from industrial operations within the Park can be heard at various locations within the project area, but airport and vehicular noise generally dominate the noise setting, especially during periods of high airport activity and
peak hour traffic. Existing average ambient noise level measurements in the project area in 2006 varied from 57.5 dB in the northwest corner of the project area to 62.9 dB at the northwest boundary of the Colusa County Airport (Table 4.5-2; Appendix D). Average noise levels along SR 20 at the golf course
were 74.1 dB (Appendix D). The highest measured noise average was adjacent to SR 20 with considerably lower noise measurements in the northwest corner of the project area.

Note: dB=decibel; Ldn=day-night sound levels; Leq=average sound level during 1 hour period.

Noise measurements were conducted in terms of the equivalent sound level (Leq) and other statistical descriptors, which describe trends in ambient noise levels throughout the day and nighttime periods (see
Appendix D for a description of common noise terms). During the one-week measurement period, a total of 266 presumed aircraft noise events (noise events exceeding 65 dB for more than 5 seconds) were recorded at Site 1. The average measured sound level that people would be exposed to (also called the sound exposure level or SEL) for these events was 84.4 dB, and the average of the maximum noise levels was 73.7 dB. At Site 2, 495 presumed aircraft noise events were recorded during the one-week period. The average measured SEL for these events was 93.9 dB, and the average of the maximum noise levels for aircraft-caused events was 74.4 dB. Several of these measurements exceed the acceptable exterior noise levels for various land uses in Colusa County (see Table 4.5-1).

Existing Traffic Noise
Based on short-term traffic noise level measurements in the project area, existing noise levels at the northeast corner of the existing offices (at SR 20) are approximately 69.3 dB and 71.2 dB, from two microphone heights, which generally correspond to first and a second stories in a building (Table 4.5-3;
Appendix D).

Colusa County Airport Noise
Approximately 28,000 flights take off annually from the Colusa County Airport. Based on a continuous 24-hour noise measurement at a site located to the north-northwest of the departure end of Runway 31

Environmental Impact Report 4-73

General Plan and Zoning Amendment
Impact Analysis Colusa Industrial Properties
(approximately mid-distance to the southeast corner of the existing single-family residences in the City of Colusa), the cumulative aircraft noise level was approximately 69 dB CNEL in 2005. This measurement was consistent with the CY2015 noise exposure contour map for the Colusa County Airport, which indicates the measurement site was near the 70 dB CNEL noise contour. The northern portion of the Park and portions of the Colusa Golf and Country Club are currently exposed to aircraft noise levels greater than 55 dB CNEL, according to the CY2015 noise contours (Figure 4.5-1).
The majority of the aircraft noise exposure at the project area is generated by crop duster aircraft departing Runway 31 (to the north) and turning left (west) over the project area. Crop duster activity is typically concentrated in spring and summer months, during the morning hours of the day, beginning at first light. This means that, during the crop-dusting season, aircraft fly over the project area beginning as early as 5:30 a.m.

4.5.2 Impact Analysis

Methodology
The impact analysis is based on a noise analysis prepared by Brown and Buntin (Appendix D) and an analysis of aerial application operations at the Colusa County Airport prepared by Mead and Hunt (Appendix I). The environmental setting is based on noise measurements in the project area in 2006 and previous noise measurements conducted by Bollard Acoustical Consultants in 2005 (Appendix D). Noise impacts were analyzed in terms of the potential effects of construction, traffic, and aircraft noise on project residents and commercial tenants and nearby sensitive uses.

Criteria for Determining Significance
Adverse impacts related to noise would be considered significant if the project would:
Result in a substantial temporary or periodic increase in ambient noise levels in the project vicinity above levels existing without the project.
Expose persons to or generate excessive groundborne vibration (>100 velocity level in decibels (VdB), according to Federal Transit Administration 1995) or excessive groundborne noise levels.
Expose persons to or generate noise levels in excess of standards established in the Colusa County General Plan (1989) as depicted in Table 4.5-1.
Result in a substantial increase in off-site traffic noise levels in the project vicinity above levels existing without the project (for existing levels >65 dB Ldn, a median increase in 1.5 dB is
considered substantial).
Expose people residing or working in the project area to excessive aircraft noise levels due to the project's close proximity to a public use airport:
<55 dB CNEL exterior noise level for residential uses, <80 dB CNEL exterior noise level for
motels, and <45 dB CNEL interior noise level for noise sensitive areas, based on the CLUP
(Colusa County 1995);

Impacts and Mitigation Measures
Impact N-1: Short-term construction would increase noise levels and create perceptible
groundborne vibrations, affecting nearby residents.
During construction activities, construction-related noise would dominate the noise environment in the
immediate area. Maximum noise levels from different types of equipment could range from 70 dB to 90 dB and generate a substantial amount of groundborne vibrations at a distance of 50 feet, which would correspond to the locations of the nearest existing houses. Depending on the construction equipment used during project construction, groundborne vibrations could range from approximately 52 VdB to 81 VdB. Vibration levels associated with construction of the project would at times be perceptible at neighboring residences when construction activities occur near the northwestern corner of the project area, but they would not be high enough to result in cosmetic or structural damage to buildings. Impacts from groundborne vibrations would be less than significant.

The total time of exposure to heavy construction noise and vibration would be limited to the construction
phases of the project. Noise due to framing and construction of houses would typically be spread over a longer period, depending on market demands and the schedule for building each home. In addition, nighttime operations may occur and result in annoyance or sleep disruption for nearby residents. Because
short-term construction activities would produce noise levels substantially above ambient noise levels on a temporary basis and could affect nearby residents, construction-related noise impacts would be
significant.

Significance Level Before Mitigation: Significant.

Mitigation Measure N-la: Limit construction activities to daytime hours and no more than 8 hours in a
24-hour period.

The applicant will identify on all grading plans and construction contracts that construction activities shall occur only during daytime hours (approximately 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.), and mass grading activities and equipment operation shall be limited to no more than 8 hours during any 24-hour period. These measures will be conditions of project approval and grading permits.
Mitigation Measure N-1b: a Provide a minimum six-foot high temporary noise barrier along the northwest corner of the project area during grading activities.
The applicant will identify on all grading plans and construction contracts the provision of a temporary noise barrier along the northwest corner to reduce noise exposure from grading activities at the adjacent homes. The barrier will be at least six feet tall and will be installed by the construction contractor prior to initial grading. The temporary barrier could be constructed of minimum 3/4-inch thick plywood and should have no gaps between the panels or ground. Alternatively, temporary portable barriers made from a variety of materials can be used. Upon completion of major grading operations (including rough grading), the temporary walls would be removed by the contractor. This measure will be condition of project approval and grading permits.

Mitigation Measure N-Ic: Minimize noisy construction activities in the northwest corner of the project
area.

The applicant will identify applicable measures on grading plans and construction contracts to reduce construction-related noise, especially in the northwest corner. General measures to reduce noise would include, but are not limited to. maintaining all manufacturer-installed engine mufflers and enclosures on powered construction equipment; fitting impact tools with adequate mufflers and shrouding; and providing shielding or enclosures for fixed equipment to reduce noise exposures to sensitive receivers. To minimize construction noise exposure at adjacent residences, the construction contractor will be
responsible for locating construction staging areas and repairing construction equipment as far as possible from the northeast corner of the project area. These measures will be conditions of project approval and
grading permits.

Significance Level After Mitigation: Less than significant because mitigation measures would
reduce construction noise levels to acceptable levels at adjacent residences.
Impact N-2: Existing and project-related traffic noise levels along State Route 20 would expose certain project residents and commercial tenants to significant noise levels.
Traffic noise along SR 20 currently ranges from 66 dB to 71 dB Ldn at 50 feet from the center line, with highest noise levels between Sioc Street and Farinon Road (Appendix D). Existing traffic noise levels along SR 20 would currently exceed the County's normally accepted exterior noise levels for residential uses (60 dB Ldn), hotel (60 dB Ldn), office (65 dB Ldn), and restaurant or retail (70 dB Ldn) if these uses are located 50 feet from the center line. The project design calls for further setbacks from SR 20, which would ensure some facilities are not significantly affected by exterior traffic-related noise levels. Interior noise levels would be reduced by about 25 dB through standard building designs (Bollard and Brennan 2005); therefore, interior noise levels from traffic noise would be acceptable for uses within the 60-70 dB
traffic noise contours. Residences in the extreme castern portion of the project area may be exposed to substantial interior noise levels, depending on building locations and setbacks from SR 20.

Environmental Impact Report 4-78

General Plan and Zoning Amendment
Impact Analysis Colusa Industrial Properties

Traffic volumes along SR 20 would increase as a result of project implementation (see Section 4.4 Transportation and Traffic), increasing noise levels up to 1.7 dB adjacent to the project area (Appendix D). Traffic noise contours based on existing plus project conditions are depicted in Figure
4.5-2. Residences, the motel/hotel, and other highway commercial uses in the extreme eastern portion of the project area (within about 400 feet of the centerline of SR 20) would be exposed to traffic noise levels greater than 60 dB. Traffic noise levels would exceed accepted County exterior noise levels, resulting in a significant noise impact on residents, workers, and visitors.

Significance Level Before Mitigation: Significant.
Mitigation Measure N-2: Provide appropriate barriers, setbacks, and insulation for homes and
businesses along State Route 20 in the project area to reduce traffic noise levels by S-10 dB.

For structures significantly affected by traffic noise, the County will require the applicant to obtain an acoustical professional to conduct an acoustical investigation of traffic noise and to recommend measures necessary to achieve acceptable interior and exterior noise levels for the motel/hotel and multi-family residences along SR 20 based on the Colusa County General Plan Safety Element's normally acceptable noise levels (see Table 4.5-1). Measures to be employed may include, but are not limited to, a sound wall along SR 20, appropriate setbacks for buildings along SR 20, construction of stucco walls for the exterior,
attic vents that are acoustically baffled, buildings with adequate and appropriately designed mechanical ventilation systems, roof insulation, and acoustically-rated windows and doors. Specific designs for buildings, a sound wall, and setbacks along SR 20 will be identified on the tentative subdivision map and approved by Colusa County prior to approval of the final subdivision map to ensure a reduction in noise levels by at least 5 to 10 dB in order to comply with noise standards.

Significance Level After Mitigation: Less than significant because mitigation measures would
reduce traffic noise to acceptable levels at residences and businesses along State Route 20 in the
project area.

Impact N-3: Project-related traffic would significantly increase off-site noise levels along State Route 20 between Sioc Street and Sunrise Boulevard.

Traffic noise levels at receivers along SR 20 currently range from 66 dB to 71 dB Ldn, with highest noise levels between Sioc Street and Farinon Road (Appendix D). Traffic noise on other major streets (Fremont, Sioc, Will S. Green, and Wescott) ranges from 55 to 64 dB Ldn. Existing traffic noise levels 50
feet from the center line of several roadways currently exceed the County's and City's (City of Colusa 2007b) accepted exterior noise levels of 60 dB Ldn for residential uses.
Traffic volumes along City and County streets would increase as a result a of project implementation (see
Section 4.4 Transportation and Traffic), increasing noise levels up to 2.2 dB (Appendix D). Project- related traffic would result in an increase in noise that would be noticeable along SR 20 between Sioc Street and Sunrise Boulevard (a 1.7 dB increase is considered noticeable because existing noise levels are greater than 65 dB). The increase in noise along other roadways would not be noticeable because existing noise levels are lower and the increase would not be substantial in comparison (Appendix D).
Because the increase in traffic noise levels along SR 20 between Sioc Street and Sunrise Boulevard would
be noticeable, the effects of additional traffic-related noise from the project would be significant. The number of structures affected by is the increased noise levels is unknown, but homes within approximately 400 feet of the highway would be exposed to unacceptable exterior noise levels greater than 60 dB
(Figure 4.5-2).

Mitigation Measure N-3: None available.

Significance Level After Mitigation: Significant and unavoidable because it is infeasible to retrofit existing homes that would be affected by increased traffic noise and because no financing mechanism exists for construction of a sound wall to address existing traffic noise impacts on existing residences.

Impact N-4: Ongoing aircraft overflights would expose project residences and businesses to
excessive noise levels.

The project would introduce sensitive land uses to a generally undeveloped area north of the Colusa County Airport. Project residences and businesses would be affected by aircraft noise levels ranging from 84 dB SEL to 94 dB SEL during single event aircraft overflights and noise levels from 55 dB to 70 dB CNEL based on aircraft noise contours prepared by Bollard Acoustical Consultants (Figure 4.5-1). Although the project may result in a slight increase in air traffic, noise levels are not expected to substantially increase as a result of the project. Based on the existing noise levels and predicted CY2015 noise contours, the entire development area would be exposed to aircraft noise levels of 55 dB CNEL or greater. Existing aircraft-related noise levels in the entire development area exceed the County (1989) and ALUC (Colusa County 1995) accepted exterior noise levels for residential uses (55-60 dB), hotels (60 dB), and other uses (restaurants, offices, and open space per Colusa County General Plan (65-70 dB). Interior noise levels would be reduced by about 25 dB through standard building designs (Bollard and Brennan 2005); however, project residences and businesses in the 70 dB or greater CNEL noise contour would still be exposed to unacceptable interior noise levels (above 45 dB).
Heavy air traffic during the spring and summer months would create the most disturbances on project residents, especially during the early morning hours when crop-dusting planes take off to the north. Specific concerns relate to the departing aircraft's noise levels as it lifts off from the runway and engine power settings are modified to make the departure (Appendix I). Also, crop-dusting planes typically depart and land at the airport from virtually any direction and fly at lower altitudes than general aviation aircraft, which would result in louder noise levels and greater noise exposure for residents and other sensitive receptors in the development area. Based on the range of 84-94 dB SEL for single event noise levels, six to nine percent of residents in the project area would be expected to behaviorally awaken as a result of aircraft noise (Federal Interagency Committee on Aviation Noise 1997; see Appendix D). Higher noise levels would increase the percentage of residents being affected by aircraft noise. Because aircraft noise would adversely affect project residents, workers, and visitors and would exceed County standards and ALUC guidelines for the proposed land uses, the effects of aircraft-related noise would be significant.
Siguificance Level Before Mitigation: Significant.
Mitigation Measure N-4a: Design homes and businesses to reduce interior aircraft-related noise levels by up to 30 dB.
For structures significantly affected by aircraft noise, the County will require the applicant to obtain an acoustical professional to conduct an acoustical investigation and to recommend measures necessary to
achieve acceptable interior noise levels consistent with CLUP and County standards. Measures to be employed may include, but are not limited to, construction of stucco walls for the exterior, attic vents that
are acoustically baffled, buildings with adequate and appropriately designed mechanical ventilation systems, roof insulation, and acoustically-rated windows and doors. Specific designs for buildings will be submitted to Colusa County for approval prior to issuance of building permits to ensure compliance with
noise standards.

Environmental Impact Report 4-82

General Plan and Zoning Amendment
Impact Analysis Colusa Industrial Properties

Mitigation Measure N-4b: Notify all prospective purchasers and users of property in the project area of inconveniences or discomforts that may accompany airport operations.
Prior to the selling, purchasing, transferring, or leasing of real property, full disclosure of inconveniences or discomforts arising from airport operations would be made by the seller in accordance with AB 2776 because of the project's location within an airport influence area. Inconveniences or annoyances may include, but are not limited to, noise, health and safety concerns, and vibration, Full disclosure would be made to the buyer and in County documents (building permits, etc.). Seller and County Clerk would obtain and keep copies of the buyer-signed disclosure statement. Although this would not reduce impacts, the measure would inform prospective buyers or renters of the inconveniences and allow them to use the knowledge in their decision of buying or renting a home.

Mitigation Measure N-4c: Encourage aerial application operators to takeoff to the south and land to the
north when weather conditions permit.

As a "Good Neighbor" effort, the County and airport manager could encourage aircraft to takeoff to the south (depart on Runway 13) and land to the north (on Runway 31), whenever winds, weather, air traffic, and safety considerations permit, to avoid flying over the project area and reduce aircraft noise levels in
sensitive areas (see Appendix I).
However, this mitigation measure is not considered feasible for the following reasons. First, the procedure is currently being implemented by some crop-dusting planes when weather conditions permit; however, it
is not a desirable operational scenario because aircraft seek to takeoff and land into the wind as much as possible, and weather conditions would not permit the procedure all the time. Second, the procedure creates a flight safety issue because it introduces counter-flow traffic patterns, which could result in aircraft operating head-to-head and having to maneuver to avoid crashes while approaching or departing. Third, the procedure is inefficient in terms of aircraft operating time and fuel consumption. Finally, the County would have no means to enforce the measure, and FAA would be unlikely to approve it.
Mitigation Measure N-4d: Encourage aerial application operators to make early turns (left Or right) during Runway 31 departures (northbound take-offs).
As a "Good Neighbor" effort, the County and airport manager could encourage aircraft to make early turns (left or right) during northbound departures (using Runway 31), to avoid flying over sensitive areas within the project area (see Appendix I).
However, this mitigation measure is not considered feasible or effective for the following reasons. First, the procedure is not a desirable operational scenario because aircraft cannot make sharp turns during departure without compromise flight safety. Second, the procedure would result in planes flying over residential and commercial/office areas at low altitudes and high engine power, increasing safety and noise concerns. Finally, the County would have no means to enforce the measure, and FAA would be
unlikely to approve it.
Mitigation Measure N-4e: Encourage straight-out departures for Runway 31 operations (northbound take-offs).
As a "Good Neighbor" effort, the County and airport manager could encourage straight-out departures for aircraft departing to the north (on Runway 31) over the project area (see Appendix I). This would reduce departure noise levels and safety concerns of aircraft turning at low altitudes near the end of the runway and avoid direct overflight of the residential and commercial areas in the project area.

Environmental Impact Report 4-83

General Plan and Zoning Amendment
Impact Analysis Colusa Industrial Properties

However, this mitigation measure is not considered effective for the following reasons. First, the flight path modification would still result in substantial noise levels from departing aircraft. Second, the
extended straight-out departure would likely result in exposing existing residential areas in the City of Colusa to increased aircraft noise. Finally, the County would have no means to enforce the measure, and FAA would be unlikely to approve it.
Mitigation Measure N-4f: Encourage power reduction during departures for Runway 31 operations (northbound take-offs).

As a "Good Neighbor" effort, the County and airport manager could encourage northbound departing aircraft (on Runway 31) to reduce power by altering propeller and engine activity (see Appendix I). This would reduce departure noise levels, but would also decrease the climb rate, altitude, and speed of
departing aircraft, resulting in increased time of overflights of the project area.

However, this mitigation measure is not considered feasible or effective for the following reasons. First, the reduction in power would compromise flight safety because it would reduce the aircraft manufacturer's specified takeoff power, which specifies the use of full engine power for the initial take- off roll and climb-out. Second, the reduction in engine power could exacerbate noise and safety concerns over sensitive uses in the project area. Finally, the County would have no means to enforce the measure, and FAA would be unlikely to approve it.
Mitigation Measure N-4g: Require aerial application operators to comply with Federal Aviation
Administration regulations for operations over congested areas, prohibiting loaded aircraft from overflying the development area at low altitudes.
The County and airport manager could require aerial application operators to comply with FAA regulations for operations over congested areas (CFR 137.5); however, this could prohibit loaded aircraft from overflying the development area at low altitudes. The FAA regulations would require the County, airport manager, and aerial application operators to develop operational procedures and submit the procedures to FAA for approval. The procedures would likely prohibit crop-dusting planes, or aerial application operators, from flying over the development area at low altitudes when heavily loaded with agricultural chemicals. To implement such procedures, aerial application operators would likely be required to depart on Runway 13 (southbound) when loaded with chemicals, regardless of wind conditions or air traffic patterns.

However, this mitigation measure is not considered feasible for the following reasons. First, the prohibition on northbound take offs for crop-dusting planes would degrade airport operations and compromise flight safety, Second, the procedures would create a nonstandard operational procedures that could result in counter-flow aircraft traffic and increased flight safety concerns. Finally, the County would have no means to enforce the measure, and FAA would be unlikely to approve it.
Significance Level After Mitigation: Significant and unavoidable because aircraft noise would still expose residences and businesses to unacceptable exterior (and possibly interior) noise levels. Although implementation of the mitigation measures would reduce interior noise levels and notify
prospective buyers, these measures are not enough to reduce the impact to less than significant.
Additionally, not all of the measures are feasible.

Impact N-5: Nearby industrial operations may generate periodic loud noises, but project residents would not be exposed to unacceptable noise levels from these operations.
The project's residential uses would be located more than 700 feet from the nearest industrial building in the Park. Other uses, such as office buildings, agricultural facilities, and the airport, as well as roads and the proposed overflight corridor, would separate the project's residential uses from industrial operations in the Park. Although the industrial operations periodically generate noise that may be noticeable by some residents, the industrial noise levels would not likely exceed acceptable standards for residential uses because of the distance to the residences. Additionally, airport-related noise would be more noticeable than the industrial noise, especially during periods of the year with high air traffic. Therefore, noise
impacts on project residents from industrial operations would be less than significant.
Significance Level: Less than significant because noise from industrial operations would not expose residents to unacceptable noise levels.

Impact N-6: The wastewater treatment facility would generate some operational noise, but the facility's design and location would minimize the effects of noise on project residents.
The wastewater treatment facility would be surrounded by industrial and agricultural land uses, about 1.2 miles south of the nearest proposed residential unit. The wastewater facility would be housed in a block building with pumps, blowers, and emergency generator and would be fitted with equipment silencers. Additionally, airport noise would be more noticeable to residents in the project area than occasional loud
noises from the wastewater treatment facility. Because the wastewater facility design and location would
minimize the effects of noise on project residents and commercial tenants, the facility's noise impact would be less than significant.
Significance Level: Less than significant because noise from the wastewater treatment facility would not expose residents to unacceptable noise levels.

Significant and Unavoidable Impacts
Impact N-3: Project-related traffic would significantly increase off-site noise levels along State Route 20
between Sioc Street and Sunrise Boulevard.

Impact N-4: Ongoing aircraft overflights would expose project residences and businesses to excessive noise levels.

4.6 AIR QUALITY
This section describes current air quality conditions in the project vicinity and identifies sensitive land uses that could be affected by air pollution. The impact analysis discusses the expected emissions associated with the project and evaluates potential effects on project residents, tenants, and sensitive receptors in the vicinity. Mitigation measures are identified for significant effects, followed by the residual impact significance after mitigation measures are implemented.

4.6.1 Setting

Regulatory Setting

Federal
The Federal Clean Air Act (FCAA, 42 USC 7401 et seq.) requires the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to set National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) to protect public health and welfare. NAAQS have been established for ozone, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, respirable particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), and lead. Two types of NAAQS have been established: primary standards, which protect public health, and secondary standards, which protect the public welfare from non-health-related adverse effects such as visibility reduction. These pollutants are called "criteria" air pollutants because standards have been established for each of them to meet specific public health and welfare criteria set forth in the FCAA. The primary NAAQS are intended to protect, with an adequate margin of safety, those persons most susceptible to respiratory distress, such as people suffering from asthma or other illness, the elderly, very young children, or others engaged in strenuous work or exercise.
Pursuant to the 1990 Federal Clean Air Act Amendments (FCAAA), the EPA classifies air basins (or portions thereof) as "attainment" or "non-attainment" for each criteria air pollutant, based on whether or not the NAAQS are achieved. The FCAA required each state to prepare an air quality control plan referred to as the State Implementation Plan (SIP). The FCAAA added requirements for states containing areas that violate the NAAQS to revise their SIPs to incorporate additional control measures to reduce air pollution. The SIP is a living document that is periodically modified to reflect the latest emissions inventories, planning documents, and rules and regulations of air basins as reported by the agencies with jurisdiction over them. The EPA has responsibility to review all state SIPs to determine if they conform to the mandates of the FCAAA and will achieve air quality goals when implemented. If the EPA determines a SIP to be inadequate, it may prepare a Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) for the non-attainment area and may impose additional control measures. Failure to submit an approvable SIP or to implement the plan within mandated timeframes can result in sanctions being applied to transportation funding and stationary air pollution sources in the air basin.

State
Under the California Clean Air Act (CCAA; Chapter 1568 of the Statutes of 1988), patterned after the FCAA, areas have been designated as attainment or non-attainment with respect to the California Ambient Air Quality Standards (CAAQS). The CAAQS are more stringent than the national standards and include air quality standards for some pollutants for which there is no corresponding national standard. The California Air Resources Board (CARB) manages air quality, regulates mobile emissions sources, and oversees the activities of county and regional Air Pollution Control Districts (APCDs) and Air Quality Management Districts (AQMDs). CARB regulates local air quality indirectly by establishing

Environmental Impact Report 4-86

Impact Analysis General Plan and Zoning Amendment
Colusa Industrial Properties

state ambient air quality standards and vehicle emissions and fuel standards, and by conducting research, planning, and coordinating activities.
In April 2005, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) published Air Quality and Land Use Handbook: A Community Health Perspective. This handbook is intended to give guidance to local governments in the siting of sensitive land uses, such as residences, schools, daycare centers, playgrounds, or medical facilities, near sources of air pollution. Recent studies have shown that public exposure to air pollution can be substantially elevated near freeways and certain other facilities. Recommendations from the Handbook include:

Avoid siting new sensitive land uses within 500 feet of a freeway, urban roads with 100,000
vehicles/day, or rural roads with 50,000 vehicles/day.
Avoid siting new sensitive land uses within 300 feet of a large gas station (defined as a facility with a throughput of 3.6 million gallons per year or greater). A 50 foot separation is recommended for typical gas dispensing facilities.
The current attainment status for the project area is shown in Table 4.6-1.

The Northern Sacramento Valley Air Basin 2003 Air Quality Attainment Plan (NSVAB 2003) identifies strategies to achieve and maintain healthful air quality in the northern Sacramento Valley and attain the CAAQS. The attainment plan focuses on the adoption and implementation of control measures for stationary sources, areawide sources, indirect sources, and addresses public education and information

Environmental Impact Report 4-87

programs (NSVAB 2003). This is plan is a joint effort between the air districts in the northern Sacramento Valley. As one of these districts, the Colusa County Air Pollution Control District (CCAPCD) is charged with regulating sources of air pollution in Colusa County to maintain clean air and protect the health of
the public and the environment. The County does not currently have a PM10 plan, and one is not
currently required under state air quality planning law.
The CCAPCD Rule 2.26 regarding architectural coatings establishes a limit of the quantity of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) in architectural coatings supplied, sold, offered for sale, applied, solicited
for application, or manufactured for use within the CCAPCD.

The CCAPCD Rule 2.27 identifies benzene airborne toxic control measures associated with retail service
stations. It states that no owner or operator shall transfer, permit the transfer, or provide equipment for the transfer of gasoline, and no other person shall transfer gasoline from a delivery tank equipped with a vapor recovery system a into a stationary storage tank at a retail service station unless a CARB-certified Phase I vapor recovery system is installed on the stationary storage tank and used during the transfer and from a stationary storage tank at a retail service station into a motor vehicle fuel tank unless a CARB-certified Phase II vapor recovery system is installed and used during the transfer.
The Colusa County General Plan encourages a compact development pattern to reduce auto trips and promote alternate means of transportation (Colusa County 1989).

Environmental Setting
Air pollution is directly related to a region's topography, climate, and meteorology. These attributes for the project area are described below.

Topography
The NSVAB is defined by the Coastal Mountain Range to the north and west and the southern portion of
the Cascade Mountain Range and the northern portion of the Sierra Nevada Mountains to the east. These
mountain ranges reach heights in excess of 6,000 feet, providing a substantial physical barrier to locally created pollution and pollution transported from the Sacramento Metropolitan area during northward a prevailing winds. The valley has a high potential for air pollution problems due to the geographic and meteorological conditions (NSVAB 2003).

Climate and Meteorology
In general, the climate in the project area includes hot, dry summers and cool, rainy winters. During the year the temperature may range from 15 to 113 degrees Fahrenheit with average summer highs usually in the 90s and average winter lows in the 40s. Average annual rainfall is about 12 inches with snowfall being very rare. The prevailing winds are moderate in strength and generally originate from the south.

Local Air Quality
Colusa County is designated as non-attainment/transitional with state ozone standards and unclassified/attainment with federal ozone standards (Table 4.6-1). An area designated non- attainment/transitional signifies that the area is close to attaining the standard for that pollutant, and an unclassified designation means that available data are insufficient to support designation as attainment or

Environmental Impact Report 4-88

Impact Analysis General Plan and Zoning Amendment
Colusa Industrial Properties
nonattainment. Ozone violations within the NSVAB are generally due to the use of internal combustion engine and occasionally due to smoke from nearby wildfires and transport of pollutants from the Sacramento Metropolitan area. Colusa County is also in non-attainment for the state 24-hour and annual
average PM10 standards, unclassified for the federal PM10 standards and state annual PM2.5 standard,
and unclassified/attainment with federal PM2.5 standards.

Air quality in the project area is representative of data recorded at the Colusa-Sunrise Boulevard station, located about 0.1-mile southwest of the project area. Table 4.6-2 summarizes the highest average ozone and particulate concentrations from 2004 through 2006 and compares them with the federal and state standards. No ozone standards were exceeded. The state standard for highest 24-hour PM10 average was exceeded at least twice during 2004 and 2005 but was not exceeded in 2006. The state standard for annual average PM10 for 2005 was also exceeded. Lastly, the state standard for annual average PM2.5 was not
exceeded for the years data were available, and the national daily PM2.5 standard was not exceeded during the three years. Descriptions of the various pollutants and their effects on the environment are provided in Appendix E.

Odors
Odors rarely cause any physical harm, but can be very unpleasant, leading to considerable distress among the public and often generating citizen complaints to local governments and the CCAPCD. The CCAPCD has no rules or standards specifically related to odor emissions, other than its nuisance rules, Rules 2.10 and 2.11 (CCAPCD 1998). In such cases, it is appropriate that a qualitative assessment should be used to determine if odor impacts may reasonably be expected to be generated by the project.
Facilities that often result in odor complaints include wastewater treatment plants, chemical
manufacturing plants, painting and coating businesses, feed lots and dairies, composting facilities, solid
waste landfills and solid waste transfer stations.

There have been recent odor complaints in the area due to operations of a mushroom facility located one mile southeast of the project area. The facility has been shut down due to the odor problem and has been
transferred to a new owner. The new owner will operate the mushroom facility using appropriate air pollution control devices (CCAPCD 2007). Industrial odors are not expected to a be a major concern for project residents because of the programs in place to address complaints.

Sensitive Receptors
Some land uses are considered more sensitive to air pollution than others. Sensitive receptors are facilities
that house or attract children, the elderly, people with illnesses, or others who are especially sensitive to
the effects of air pollutants. Examples of sensitive receptors include hospitals, schools, convalescent facilities, and residential areas. The closest existing residential areas are located 50 feet to the north and
west of the project's northwestern boundary.

4.6.2 Impact Analysis

Methodology
The impact analysis for this section was prepared using CCAPCD requirements and air quality issues identified in Appendix G of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) Guidelines. The impact analysis involves a qualitative discussion of emissions likely to be generated during construction and a
quantitative discussion of the types of emission sources associated with the project, including emissions related to motor vehicle traffic. Daily increases in emissions associated with the project were estimated
using the CARB-approved URBEMIS 2002 (version 8.7) computer program based on default
assumptions contained in the model (Appendix E).

Criteria for Determining Significance
Adverse impacts to air quality would be considered significant if the project would:
Conflict with or obstruct implementation of the Northern Sacramento Valley Air Basin's 2003 Air Quality Attainment Plan.
Violate CAAQS or contribute substantially to an existing to or projected violation of CAAQS. A project is considered to contribute substantially to an existing or projected violation of CAAQS if it emits pollutants at a level equal to or greater than five 5 percent of the CAAQS.
Exceed ROG, NOX, and PM10 thresholds of significance established by neighboring air districts.
Exceed the CAAQS CO standards:
CAAQS 1-hour standard of 20 ppm

0 CAAQS 8-hour standard of 9 ppm
Expose sensitive receptors to substantial pollutant concentrations.
Create objectionable odors that would affect a substantial number of people.
Result in a cumulatively considerable net increase of any criteria pollutant for which the project region is non-attainment under an applicable federal or state ambient air quality standard (including releasing emissions, which exceed quantitative thresholds for ozone precursors).

Impacts and Mitigation Measures
Impact AQ-1: Construction activities would generate dust and produce vehicle emissions that
would exceed established emissions thresholds for ROG, NOx, and PM10.
Short-term air quality impacts would occur during grading and other construction operations. Temporary impacts include:
Clearing, grading, excavating, and using heavy equipment or trucks that create large quantities of
fugitive dust, and thus PM10 and PM2.5;
Heavy-duty construction equipment that generates diesel particulate matter (DPM);
Emissions from commute vehicles for construction workers and trucks hauling equipment and
materials; and
Emissions from stationary construction equipment used on-site.
Short-term fugitive dust may be a nuisance to those working in the project area or living in the vicinity. Fugitive dust emissions are associated with land clearing, ground excavation, cut-and-fill operations, and truck travel on unpaved roadways. Dust emissions also vary substantially from day to day, depending on the level of activity, the specific operations, and weather. Fugitive dust from grading and construction is expected to be short-term and would cease following project completion. Dust (larger than 10 microns) generated by construction activities usually becomes more of a local nuisance than a serious health
problem. Of particular health concern is the amount of PM10 generated as a part of fugitive dust
emissions.

Construction activities include emissions associated with the transport of machinery, supplies, materials, and workers to and from the project area and emissions produced on-site as the equipment is used. Emitted pollutants would include CO, VOCs, NOX, and PM10.

The emissions presented in Table 4.6-3 are the anticipated highest daily emissions modeled by URBEMIS 2002 for the construction phase of this project based on the amount of land that would be developed. As indicated in Table 4.6-3, construction emissions associated with the project would exceed the construction emission thresholds; therefore, air quality impacts from construction emissions would be significant.

air districts to determine the significance of the emission levels. Since CCAQMD has no emission
thresholds, this analysis uses the thresholds from the neighboring Feather River Air Quality Management
District. Air districts to the north of the project area (Butte County and Shasta County) have higher emission thresholds with limits of 137 pounds per day for ROGs and NOx, but the construction emissions
of the project would still be significant using those higher thresholds.

Mitigation Measure AQ-1: Reduce construction emissions through water application, covering loads, periodic cleaning of paved areas, and establishing speed limits.

The applicant will identify appropriate pollutant control measures on grading plans and construction contracts and ensure implementation of the measures by the construction contractor during all construction activities. These measures would be a condition of grading permits and would include, but not be limited to, the following:
Water all active construction areas at least twice daily.
Cover all trucks hauling soil, sand, and other loose materials or require all trucks to maintain at
lease two feet of freeboard.
Pave, apply water three times daily, or apply (non-toxic) soil stabilizers on all unpaved access roads, parking areas and staging areas at construction sites.
Sweep daily (with water sweepers) all paved access roads, parking areas and staging areas at
construction sites.
Sweep streets daily (with water sweepers) if visible soil material is carried onto adjacent public
streets.

Install sandbags or other erosion control measures to prevent silt runoff to public roadways.
Replant vegetation in disturbed areas as quickly as possible.
Significance Level After Mitigation: Significant and unavoidable because with implementation of
these measures, project construction emissions would be reduced but no feasible mitigation measures have been identified that would reduce the construction emissions on all days to levels that would not substantially contribute to potential air quality violations of PM10 or ozone standards in the project vicinity.
Impact AQ-2: Project traffic and residential and commercial operations would result in long-term stationary and mobile emissions that would exceed air quality thresholds for ROG, NOx, and PM10.

Long-term air quality impacts would consist of mobile source emissions generated by project-related traffic and stationary source emissions generated directly and indirectly by the natural gas consumed. Long-term emissions would be generated from vehicle trips to and from the project area, fuel combustion related to natural gas, wood stoves, fireplaces and landscape maintenance, and a to a lesser extent, use of consumer products such as hair sprays and deodorants.
Project operational emissions (stationary and mobile) have been estimated using the URBEMIS 2002
computer model (Appendix E). This model predicts ROG, NOx, PM10 and CO emissions based on the project land uses and an estimate that the project could be completed by 2010. Operational emissions
would be expected to decrease over time as new technology and emission-reducing practices are developed and implemented. Project trip generation rates used URBEMIS 2002 default setting, as modified in some cases by the proposed acreage for this project. As shown in Table 4.6-4, project operations emissions would exceed the significance thresholds used for ROG, NOx, and PM10, resulting in significant air quality impacts.

The emissions due to the operations of the project would contribute to the amount of ROG and NOx (precursors to ozone) and PM10 in the area and could lead to additional violations of ozone and PM10 standards. Given the dense urban nature of the proposed residential units in this development and occasional existing air quality violations of PM10 in the area, PM10 in wood smoke from fireplaces and wood stoves could be a health concern to existing and project residents. Studies have indicated that wood smoke can account for 30-80 percent of the PM10 in a residential area depending on use and meteorological conditions. In addition, wood burning generates carbon monoxide and toxic air pollutants such as benzene and dioxin (Bay Area Air Quality Management District 2007). PM10 in wood smoke from fireplaces would be a significant impact.

Significance Level Before Mitigation: Significant.

Mitigation Measure AQ-2a: Design homes to include certified woodstoves and outdoor electrical outlets.

The applicant will ensure only EPA Phase II certified stoves are installed in each home. All woodstoves manufactured since 1988 must be EPA certified, which means they use one-third less wood to produce the same heat and emit 50 to 60 percent less air pollution than older stoves.

All residential structures will also be equipped with electric outlets in the front and rear of the structure to
facilitate use of electrical lawn and garden equipment.
These measures will be a condition of approval of the final subdivision map by the County.
Mitigation Measure AQ-2b: Provide sidewalks and bike routes on all project roads and establish opportunities for transit.

Implement Mitigation Measure TT-6.

Significance Level After Mitigation: Significant and unavoidable because no feasible mitigation measures have been identified that would reduce the operational emissions on all days to levels that would not substantially contribute to potential air quality violations of PM10 or ozone in the project vicinity. Although implementation of the mitigation measures would reduce localized operational emissions, the emissions would not be reduced to acceptable levels.

Impact AQ-3: Project traffic would increase CO concentrations at intersections, but would not
expose sensitive receptors to substantial CO concentrations.
Traffic volumes along SR 20 are currently less than 30,000 vehicles/day. The project would add approximately 10,497 daily trips to roads in the project vicinity, including SR 20.
Local CO concentrations were estimated using Caltrans' CALINE4 air dispersion model and the results of
the traffic study (Appendix C). Although the area is designated as unclassified with state CO standards, and CO levels are declining due to improvements in vehicle engines, CO concentrations were modeled to identify any localized hot spot areas with high CO concentrations. CO concentrations were modeled at a total of five sensitive receptors along the most congested roadway (SR 20) identified in the traffic study.
The sensitive receptors included in the model range from 14 to 35 meters from the centerline of SR 20
between Carson and Jay Streets. Worst-case meteorological assumptions and EMFAC2002 vehicle emission factors were used to analyze isting, existing with project, and cumulative conditions.

As can be seen in Table 4.6-5, the emissions from the project would not exceed the CO standards and thus would be considered less than significant. The project would not expose sensitive receptors to substantial pollutant concentrations and does not include siting of sensitive receptors that would be considered inconsistent with the Air Quality and Land Use Handbook (CARB 2005); therefore, this impact would be
less than significant.

à The one-hour and eight-hour CO analysis focuses on peak-hour traffic, calculated of as 10% of the average daily traffic, because the project's effects on traffic congestion and related CO concentrations are greatest during that period. CO estimates shown above include background concentrations for 1-hour and 8-hour as calculated according to the Guide to Air Quality Assessment in Sacramento County, the nearest county with the available
information; ppm=parts per million.
D Other receptors farther from the project vicinity would experience lower CO concentrations, and the impact
would also be less than significant.

Significance Level: Less than significant because the project would not expose sensitive receptors to
substantial CO concentrations.

Impact AQ-4: The proposed wastewater treatment facilities could create objectionable odors and
create a nuisance for project residents.

As a general matter, the types of land use development that pose potential odor problems include refineries, chemical plants, wastewater treatment plants, landfills, composting facilities, and transfer stations. As proposed, wastewater treatment facilities would occupy a 34-acre site south of the development area that is currently used for industrial process wastewater disposal (land application). The treatment plant would maintain a 150-foot buffer on all sides and would be one mile southeast of the

Environmental Impact Report 4-96

General Plan and Zoning Amendment

nearest proposed residential unit. Existing residential units are further north and northwest. The facility would include passive and active odor control systems.
The wastewater treatment facilities could create objectionable odors and result in complaints from project residents, Although the facilities would be located more than one mile south of the nearest residential units, residents may notice odors when the wind blows to the north. Although odors do not generally create safety concerns, they could pose a nuisance to project residents. Also, if operations are not efficient of upset conditions occur, odors could have an adverse impact on non-residential and residential land uses in the project area, which would be a significant impact.
Significance Level Before Mitigation: Significant.
Mitigation Measure AQ-4: Implement an Odor Management Plan to identify procedures for reducing
odors.

The County will require the applicant to prepare an Odor Management Plan prior to issuance of building permits for the wastewater facility. The plan should be submitted to CCAQMD for review and comment in addition to being approved by the County. This plan will provide an adaptive approach for the operator to respond to odor complaints and revise operations as necessary. The operator will coordinate with the CCAQMD to ensure that the operator is notified of all odor complaints received regarding the facility. The plan will discuss this complaint response protocol and include progressive measures to be made in the event of repeated, verified complaints. The plan will describe the location of odor-sensitive receptors within two miles of the site, meteorological conditions affecting migration of odors from the site, and
preventive procedures being implemented to minimize odors. When the operator or CCAQMD staff verifies strong odors at off-site receptors, the operator will make changes in site operations to reduce the potential for odors. Odors may be reduced by installing additional odor control equipment, removal and disposal of odiferous compounds, making process/treatment modifications, or other activities.
Significance Level After Mitigation: Less than significant because implementation of an Odor
Mauagement Plan would ensure minimal odor impacts on nearby residents.

Significant and Unavoidable Impacts
Impact AQ-1: Construction activities would generate dust and produce vehicle emissions that would
exceed established emissions thresholds for ROG, NOx, and PM10.

Impact AQ-2: Project traffic and residential and commercial operations would result in long-term stationary and mobile emissions that would exceed air quality thresholds for ROG, NOx, and PM10.

4.7.1 Setting

Regulatory Setting

Federal
The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA, 43 USC 300) protects public health by regulating the nation's public drinking water supply. It requires many actions to protect drinking water and its sources: rivers, lakes, reservoirs, springs, and groundwater wells. The EPA sets national health-based standards for drinking water to protect against both naturally-occurring and man-made contaminants that may be found
in drinking water. EPA has delegated its authority for enforcement of the SDWA to the Department of Health Service (DHS) in California.

DHS adopts and enforces primary and secondary drinking water standards consistent with drinking water standards established by the EPA under the SDWA and the DHS Drinking Water Program. This program regulates public drinking water systems, oversees water recycling projects, permits water treatment devices, and certifies drinking water treatment and distribution operators.

State
Senate Bill (SB) 610 (Chapter 643, Statutes of 2001) requires urban water suppliers that obtain water from a public water system to prepare a water supply assessment (WSA) for large projects, including residential subdivisions of 500 or more dwelling units and commercial office buildings having more than 250,000 square feet. The bill requires that additional information be provided in the area's urban water management plan if groundwater is identified as a source available to the supplier. This information includes a copy of any groundwater management plan adopted by the supplier, a copy of the adjudication order or decree for adjudicated basins, and if non-adjudicated, whether the basin has been identified as being overdrafted or projected to be overdrafted in the most current DWR publication on that basin. If the basin is in overdraft, that plan must include current efforts to eliminate any long-term overdraft. Although the proposed project is too small to be subject to SB 610's requirements, a water sufficiency study similar to a WSA was prepared for the project to analyze the ability of the existing groundwater wells to serve the project and the project's effects on ground water (Appendix F).

In compliance with the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act (California Water Code Sec. 13000
et seq.; see Section 4.8 Hydrology and Water Quality), RWQCBs issue a Waste Discharge Requirements
(WDR) permit for pollutant discharges to waters of the state. Pollutant discharges to high quality waters are subject to the SWRCB non-degradation policy (Resolution 68-16) for high quality waters.
The California Integrated Waste Management Act (AB 939) provides that every county must divert (reduce, reuse, or recycle) at least 50 percent of solid waste generated each year (California AB 939). AB 939 was designed to increase landfill life by diverting solid waste from landfills within the state and conserving other resources through increasing recycling programs and incentives. AB 939 requires that counties prepare Integrated Waste Management Plans to implement landfill diversion goals and requires that cities and counties prepare and adopt Source Reduction and Recycling Elements (SRRE). The Colusa Countywide Siting Element (CSE) describes current disposal options for County residents. The CSE identifies the existing solid waste disposal facilities, their location, the owner/operator, maximum permitted daily and yearly disposal rates quantified in both tons and cubic yards, estimated remaining life, permitted waste types, and average daily waste received.

Environmental Impact Report 4-98

Local
The Community Services Element of the Colusa County General Plan (Colusa County 1989) provides policies for water supply, wastewater, drainage, and solid waste. It identifies policies to protect and obtain information on groundwater in the County because it is used as a source for water supply. Policies regarding service districts encourage existing districts to expand or merge to provide service for new development areas. It also provides policies that encourage use of sewer systems as opposed to septic tanks in urban areas and that ensure economically feasible and environmentally sound wastewater treatment service. The Community Services Element provides policies for flood control and drainage improvement projects that encourage County-wide planning and minimizing adverse effects on natural creeks and riparian vegetation. Development is also discouraged in the 100-year floodplain to minimize the need for new flood control structures and drainage improvements. It provides policies to evaluate the need for new or modified solid waste facilities and encourage recycling and proper disposal of solid
waste.

Environmental Setting

Water Supply Service
Most communities in Colusa County utilize groundwater wells for their water supply. The nearby City of Colusa provides water supply for its residents via five groundwater wells, which produce approximately 3.17 million gallons of water per day (City of Colusa 2007b). A sixth well provides emergency water supply, as needed. The wells are located throughout the City; the closest well to the project area is
approximately 1.5 miles to the northwest. Groundwater is pumped to two storage tanks in the northern portion of the City, near the Sacramento River, using a single diesel generator, and the chlorine-treated water is distributed via pipelines to residents within the city limits. The wells provide sufficient capacity for the City's current population.
CIP operates a non-community water system, the Colusa Industrial Properties Water System, under a Domestic Water Supply Permit, issued by the California Department of Health Services on September 19, 2003 (Permit No. 01-21-03(P)06001). The system provides domestic water supply to the existing commercial and industrial tenants in the Park and the adjacent golf course. The system includes two permitted groundwater wells and provides chlorination treatment. The system also includes a 50,000- gallon fire-water storage tank. In compliance with the permit, CIP monitors the two wells on a quarterly basis and submits water quality reports to the DHS.
The well site containing the two groundwater wells is located in the southern portion of the development area, just west of the drainage ditch (see 1 Figure 3-3). Well 1 is the current active source and is equipped to produce 650 gallons per minute (gpm). Well 2 is a stand-by source that is equipped to produce 1,100 gpm. The wells work in conjunction with a 5,000-gallon pressure tank to provide adequate pressure in the system for the existing users. Both wells have capacity to produce a total of 1,750 gpm or 2.5 mgd. The current estimated use of the wells by the existing customers is approximately 132,150 gpd (average day demand) for office and industrial users (California Engineering Company 2006).
Pipelines connect the well site to the offices in the northeast corner of the Park via Sunrise Boulevard and to the industrial facilities from the western sides of the buildings. The pipes range in diameter from 8 to 8 14 inches within the Park. A 2-inch pipeline connects the clubhouse within the Colusa Golf and Country Club to an 8-inch pipeline under Davison Court.

Wastewater and Sewer Service
Colusa County does not provide wastewater collection or treatment services to the unincorporated areas. Most communities utilize septic tanks. Maxwell, Princeton, and Arbuckle have Public Utilities Departments that provide sewer and water services to their respective communities.
Industrial tenants within the Park generate wastewater as a result of industrial processing activities. This wastewater is disposed of on land in the southern portion of the Park and used to grow rice straw and other crops. The total available acreage for land application is 627 acres. Domestic wastewater generated by the existing tenants (offices and industrial buildings) is discharged to septic tanks or septic tank/leachfield systems, which are permitted by the County. Grey water from the septic tanks is disposed of in a lined evaporation/percolation pond in the southern portion of the Park (Pond 1 on Figure 3-3), southwest of the airport. Wastewater treatment service is not currently provided within the Park.
Portions of the project area are within the City of Colusa's Sphere of Influence (City of Colusa 1994). The City operates a wastewater treatment facility to provide sewer collection and treatment service for the City residents. The plant is located southwest of the City (approximately 1.5 miles west of the project area). The plant currently has capacity to treat 0.9 mgd, of which the current flow is 0.5 mgd (City of Colusa 2007b). The City is planning improvements to the facility to upgrade the facility to a tertiary treatment level, but reduce its capacity to 0.7 mgd by the end of 2008 (City of Colusa 2007a). The upgrades would bring the facility into compliance with the Clean Water Act, effluent discharge requirements, and Central Valley RWQCB requirements.

Drainage Service
The unnamed ditch in the Park conveys flows from the northeast portion of the City of Colusa as well as flows from the Park. The ditch, also referred to as a conveyance lateral, originates in the City and runs through the Colusa Golf and Country Club, the Park, and adjacent private property (California Engineering Company 2006). At the west end of the Park, flows in the ditch are conveyed through a 36- inch pipe under a levee at Wescott Road (during low flows) or pumped through the levee (during high flows) to a borrow ditch that empties into the Colusa Trough (2047 drain), which conveys flows south and east to the Sacramento River. CIP operates the pump station at the levee. During periods of high flow,
they close the 36-inch pipe with a slide-gate. When the pipe is closed off, the land immediately upstream serves as a detention basin to store water. The pump is typically operated when the water level in the basin reaches an elevation of approximately 42 feet (California Engineering Company 2006).
The portion of the ditch north of Farinon Road (within the proposed development area) has an estimated
capacity to drain approximately 105 cubic feet per second (cfs) (California Engineering Company 2006).
Flows from the City are reduced to 7 cfs where the ditch crosses under SR 20 upstream of the Park because of twin 24-inch culvert pipes. The golf course and Country Club Estates (a residential community between SR 20 and Wescott Road, north of the Park) contribute flows of approximately 33 cfs. Runoff from the existing office and commercial buildings in the north end of the Park is estimated at 8 cfs. The existing offices drain into 8- to 24-inch storm drains, which discharge into the ditch.
In 2006, CIP constructed a small detention basin to collect runoff from SR 20 and a from a future 36-inch
pipe designed to redirect some flows from the City (California Engineering Company 2006). The detention basin was designed in conjunction with Caltrans and has a capacity of approximately 1.1 million cubic feet, or about 25 acre-feet, and a design flow of about 150 cfs. The basin has an outlet pipe that regulates the quantity of flows being discharged into the ditch upstream of Farinon Road.

Solid Waste Service
Colusa County does not provide solid waste collection services to the unincorporated areas. NorCal Waste Systems currently provides collection services for the Park. The City of Colusa provides these services for its residents within the city limits.
The County has one operating landfill and one transfer station. The Stonyford Disposal Site landfill is located south of Stonyford in northwestern Colusa County and serves communities west of the Tehama- Colusa Canal. Communities east of the canal are served by the Ostrom Road Landfill in Yuba County. The Maxwell Transfer Station is located about 15 to 20 miles northwest of the project area, south of the community of Maxwell. Solid waste collection services transport waste to the transfer station from communities in eastern Colusa County, where the waste is processed and transported for final disposal at the appropriate landfill. The transfer station is operated by NorCal Waste Systems and is located on 3 acres a of land and has a permitted capacity to receive up to 150 tons of waste per day (Colusa County 2006). The Ostrom Road Landfill encompasses 261 acres, with 225 acres permitted as a Class II Landfill. The permitted capacity of the landfill is more than 41 million cubic yards, and approximately 40 million cubic yards were estimated as remaining in 2004 (CIWMB 2006). The landfill can receive up to 3,000 tons of solid waste per day and has an expected closure date of 2066 (Norcal Waste Systems 2006).
The CIWMB provides solid waste generation rates which estimate the approximate range of waste created by residences or businesses over a certain amount of time. Waste generation includes all materials discarded, whether or not they are later recycled or disposed in a landfill (CIWMB 2007). There are about 36,580 square feet of existing office buildings in the project area, which produce approximately 1.0 ton/day of solid waste.

4.7.2 Impact Analysis

Methodology
The environmental setting characterizes the existing water supply, wastewater, drainage, and solid waste services in the area and identifies providers for the project. The impact analysis evaluates potential adverse environmental effects of new facilities needed to serve the project. The ability of each utility system to service the project's residential, commercial, and office uses was assessed based on the system's available or planned capacity. A water sufficiency analysis was prepared for the project to assess the ability of the existing groundwater wells to serve the project's proposed uses (Appendix F).

Criteria for Determining Significance
Adverse impacts related to utilities and service systems would be considered significant if the project
would:

Create a substantial demand for water supplies that cannot be met by existing or planned water supply entitlements or facilities.
Create a substantial demand for wastewater collection and treatment services that cannot be met
by existing or planned wastewater facilities.
Result in the construction of new water or wastewater treatment facilities or expansion of existing facilities, the construction of which could cause significant environmental effects.
Exceed wastewater treatment requirements of the Central Valley RWQCB.

Impact U-1: The project would increase water supply demand by 290 gallons per minute, but capacity of existing groundwater wells in the Park (1,750 gallons per minute) would not be
exceeded.

Current uses in the project area utilize a water supply of approximately 90 gpm. The addition of residential homes, commercial uses, and new offices would require an additional water supply of 290 gpm. The project's water supply would be provided by the Park's existing, permitted groundwater wells. The two wells have capacity to supply up to approximately 1,750 gpm. Available capacity of the wells is more than sufficient to supply the estimated demands associated with the project (Appendix F); therefore, impacts would be less than significant.
Significanee Level: Less than significant because existing groundwater wells would be capable of serving the project.

Impact U-2: The project would increase wastewater volumes by 90,000 gallons per day, but the planned wastewater facilities will accommodate this demand, and the facilities would not cause significant environmental effects.

The existing wastewater system in the Park is not permitted to serve residential uses. Septic tanks are also not a viable option for the project because they would be difficult to maintain and would not treat wastewater to regulatory standards.
Wastewater treatment for the project would be provided by the proposed wastewater treatment facility. The facility would be operated by either newly formed county service area or the City of Colusa; either alternative would require LAFCO approval. This facility has been designed to provide domestic wastewater treatment services for the existing industrial and office customers within the Park in addition
to the project's proposed residential and commercial uses. The facility would have a permitted capacity to treat a maximum peak day flow of 200,000 gpd and maximum month day flow of 100,000 gpd. Based on the proposed land uses, the project would generate about 90,000 gpd of wastewater (average dry weather flow).

The new wastewater facility would be located on one acre of land in an area currently used for agricultural fields and disposal of industrial process wastewater. The facility would include a 1,526- square foot building, 532-square foot filtration yard, and land disposal area (approximately 34 acres). Wastewater would be treated to tertiary standards, and the treated effluent would be discharged to agricultural fields adjacent to the building for land disposal. Specific details of the facility's impacts on the environment are discussed in other sections of the EIR. RWQCB permits would be needed to ensure compliance with waste discharge requirements and water quality objectives for the region. Based on conclusions from other sections, the facility would result in less than significant impacts on the environment.

Environmental Impact Report 4-102

General Plan and Zoning Amendment
Impact Analysis Colusa Industrial Properties
Significance Level: Less than significant because the proposed wastewater facilities would be capable of serving the project and would not result in substantial adverse effects on the
environment.

Impact U-3: Project drainage facilities would accommodate additional stormwater runoff, but the downstream drainage ditch may exceed capacity during major storm events and result in significant environmental effects.

The project proposes to construct new facilities and expand existing facilities to drain stormwater and runoff from the development area. Surface flows from the development would be directed into underground storm drains designed to accommodate the 100-year storm event. Each drain has been individually sized to convey the 100-year storm event from the drainage area (California Engineering Company 2006), Pipelines would range from 15 to 54 inches in diameter with capacity to convey up to 28.4 mgd in the largest drains.
Ground disturbance from the drainage facilities would affect approximately 10,771 linear feet of soils, which could affect biological and cultural resources and could facilitate erosion in the disturbed areas. The amount of ground disturbance associated with the drainage facilities would be minimal and would be followed by development of the project area, which would result in greater impacts. Based on the analyses in other sections of this EIR, environmental effects from drainage facilities would be less than significant.

During periods of the year when storms cause downstream drainages to reach or exceed capacity, the project's runoff may exceed capacity of the unnamed drainage ditch, resulting in flooding along the ditch
and on adjacent land (see Sections 4.8 Hydrology and Water Quality and 4.10 Hazards and Hazardous
Materials). Although project drainage facilities would be able to accommodate project runoff during storm events, the capacity of downstream drainages could be exceeded and cause flooding and increased erosion, which would result in significant impact.
Significance Level Before Mitigation: Significant.
Mitigation Measure U-3a: Maintain, and widen as necessary, the unnamed ditch from the southern end of the development to the Park boundary.

Implement Mitigation Measure HWQ-2a.

Mitigation Measure U-3b: Implement a Master Drainage Plan to assure downstream drainages will accommodate project runoff.
The County will require a the applicant to submit a Master Drainage Plan to the Department of Public Works for review and approval prior to approval of subdivision maps. The Master Drainage Plan may be an update to the existing Draft Storm Drain Master Plan Report, within the Wet Utility Master Plan for the project (California Engineering Company 2006). The Plan should identify downstream improvements such as channel widening needed to accommodate project runoff. It should include details on funding, maintenance, and operation of the improvements and measures to assure their construction would not cause significant environmental effects.
Significanee Level After Mitigation: Less than significant because improvements to the unnamed ditch and the Master Drainage Plan would reduce the potential for flooding while avoiding significant environmental effects.

Impact U-4: The project would generate 5.2 tons/day of solid waste, but transfer station and landfill capacity is sufficient to accommodate this increase.
Based on rates from the CIWMB, the proposed residential, commercial, and office uses in the project area would generate approximately 5.2 tons/day of solid waste. Although the project would increase the demand for solid waste services, the project's solid waste would not exceed the Ostrom Road Landfill or Maxwell Transfer Station's maximum daily capacities. Because existing solid waste services and facilities would be adequate to serve the development area, impacts would be less than significant.

Significance Level: Less than significant because existing solid waste facilities would be capable of
serving the project.

Significant and Unavoidable Impacts
None.

4.8 HYDROLOGY AND WATER QUALITY
This section describes surface and groundwater resources in the project vicinity. The discussion of ground water is based on a water sufficiency study prepared for the project (Appendix F). The impact analysis discusses the potential for the project to affect surface and ground water quantity and quality. Mitigation measures are identified for significant impacts, followed by determinations of the residual impact
significance after mitigation measures are implemented.

4.8.1 Setting

Regulatory Setting

Federal
The Clean Water Act (CWA) (33 USC 1251-1376), as amended by the Water Quality Act of 1987, is the major federal legislation governing water quality. The objective of the CWA is "to restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the nation's waters." Important sections of the
CWA are as follows:

Sections 303 and 304 provide for water quality standards, criteria, and guidelines.
Section 401 (Water Quality Certification) requires an applicant for any federal permit that proposes an activity that may result in a discharge to waters of the United States to obtain certification from the state that the discharge will comply with other provisions of the Act.
Section 402 establishes the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES), a permitting system for the discharge of any pollutant (except for dredged or fill material) into waters of the United States.
Section 404 establishes a permit program for the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States. This permit program is jointly administered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and the EPA.

Environmental Impact Report 4-104

Impact Analysis General Plan and Zoning Amendment Colusa Industrial Properties

In California the NPDES program is administered by the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB). The SWRCB or Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) issues permits on behalf of
the EPA for activities that could cause impacts to surface and ground water sources, including construction activities. The SWRCB also administers water rights, water pollution control programs, and
water quality functions throughout the state. Regional authority for planning, permitting, and enforcement is delegated to nine RWQCBs. The RWQCBs are required to formulate and adopt water quality control plans for all areas within their respective regions and establish water quality objectives in the water quality control plans, issue WDRs, take enforcement action against violators, and monitor water quality. The project area lies within the jurisdiction of the Central Valley RWQCB.
As mandated by the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA, Public Law 93-523) passed in 1974, the EPA regulates contaminants of concern to domestic water supply. Contaminants of concern relevant to domestic water supply are defined as those that pose a public health threat or that alter the aesthetic acceptability of the water. EPA regulates these types of contaminants through the development of national primary and secondary maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) for finished water. In California, the DHS administers the SDWA.

State
The Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act (Act) is California's statutory authority for the protection of water quality (California Water Code Sec. 13000 et seq.). Under the Act, the state must adopt water quality policies, plans, and objectives that will provide protection to the state's waters for the use and enjoyment of the people of California. The Act sets forth the obligations of the RWQCBs pertaining to the adoption of water quality control plans (Basin Plans) and establishment of water quality objectives, and authorizes the SWRCB and RWQCBs to issue and enforce permits containing WDRs. Basin Plans are the regional water quality control plans required by both the Clean Water Act and the Porter-Cologne Act in which beneficial uses, water quality objectives, and implementation programs are established for each of the nine regions in California. The Act requires a "Report of Waste Discharge" for any discharge of waste (liquid, solid, or otherwise) to land or surface waters that may impair a beneficial use of surface or ground water of the state.
The SWRCB and RWQCB enforce the NPDES program under the Clean Water Act. As part of this program, projects that would disturb more than one acre of land are required to obtain coverage under the General Permit for Discharges of Storm Water Associated with Construction Activity (Construction
General Permit, 99-08-DWQ). Construction activity subject to this permit includes clearing, grading, and disturbances to the ground such as stockpiling or excavation. For the project area, this permit would be issued by the Central Valley RWQCB.
As part of project implementation, a Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) must be developed and implemented to comply with conditions of the General Permit. The SWPPP must include site-specific information on erosion and sediment controls and must list best management practices (BMPs) that will be installed to reduce pollutants and meet water quality standards. As part of the SWPPP, the applicant must implement Best Available Technology Economically Achievable (BAT) and Best Conventional Pollutant Control Technology (BCT) to reduce or eliminate stormwater pollution. Dischargers must also comply with water quality objectives as defined in the Basin Plan (RWQCB 1998).

In 1994, the Water Quality Control Plan - Central Valley Region Sacramento and San Joaquin River Basins (the Basin Plan) was adopted by the Central Valley RWQCB (amended in 1998). The Basin Plan lists general beneficial uses for water bodies in the Sacramento River Basin. Adverse effects to these beneficial uses should be carefully considered during the review of a proposed project. Beneficial uses are

Environmental Impact Report 4-105

General Plan and Zoning Amendment
Impact Analysis Colusa Industrial Properties

the desired resources, services, and qualities of the aquatic system that are supported by achieving and protecting high water quality. Beneficial uses are specific to the water body and can vary from water body
to water body, Where beneficial uses have not been assigned to a specific water body, the tributary rule applies. The tributary rule applies the beneficial uses of the nearest downstream water body to the specified water body.
Primary issues for waters in the Central Valley region are associated with construction impacts of erosion and sedimentation from the project, stormwater management (including detention and treatment), groundwater contamination, wetlands disturbance, and compliance with prohibitions on waste discharges due to land development. The discharge prohibitions and limitations in permits are designed to ensure the maintenance of public health and safety, protection of receiving water resources, and safeguarding of the designated beneficial uses (RWQCB 1998).

Local

The Colusa County General Plan identifies goals and objectives to "encourage a balanced mix of
conservation, utilization, and development of Colusa County's natural resources." The Conservation
Element recommends policies intended for the preservation, management, and utilization of the County's water resources. Applicable policies include CO-13, which prohibits the placement of waste disposal sites and other sources of hazardous or polluting materials in close proximity to waterways, and Policy CO-14, which calls for the minimization of sedimentation and erosion through the control of construction,
recreational, and agricultural activities (Colusa County 1989).

Environmental Setting

Regional Hydrology
With respect to surface water, the project area is located within the Sacramento River Hydrologic Region, which encompasses approximately 26,500 square miles. The Sacramento River Basin is bounded by the Sierra Nevada to the east, the Coast Range to the west, the Cascade Range and Trinity Mountains to the
north, and the Delta area to the south. The average runoff from the basin is estimated to be 21.3 million
acre-feet per year. The project area is situated within the Sycamore-Sutter hydrologic subarea, which straddles the Sacramento River (Figure 4.8-1). The subarea is approximately 30 miles long and encompasses about 380 square miles within the Sacramento River Basin.
The Sacramento River is the principal stream in the basin and is located a little over ½-mile to the east of the project area. The melting snow pack in the Sierra Nevada, in combination with the operation of numerous reservoirs within the system, maintains flow in the Sacramento River year round. Major
tributaries to the Sacramento River are the Pit and McCloud Rivers, which join the river from the north,
and the Feather, Yuba, and American Rivers, which are tributaries from the east. Numerous tributary
creeks flow from the east and west. Beneficial uses for surface waters of the region include municipal, agricultural, industrial, and recreational uses, freshwater habitat, migration and spawning, navigation, and wildlife habitat (RWQCB 1998).
The climate in the region is semi-arid with hot, dry summers and wet, mild winters. Surface runoff from
the project area results mainly from precipitation, which occurs principally from November through March with an average annual precipitation for the area of 15.8 inches. Extreme precipitation events are characterized by relatively long periods of intense rainfall resulting from ascending airflow caused by the terrain (orographic lifting). The 100-year storm event, or an event having a return period of once every

hundred years (one percent probability of occurring in any given year), generates rainfall of seven inches in a 24-hour period in the project area.

With respect to groundwater resources, the project area is situated within the Colusa Subbasin of the
Sacramento Valley Groundwater Basin. The Colusa Subbasin ranges from 3 to 9 miles in width and is
bordered on the east by the Sacramento River and on the northwest, west, and south by the low alluvial
plains and fans of the Coast Ranges (Appendix F). The prominent non-marine water-bearing stratigraphic units that underlie the Colusa Subbasin are (from youngest to oldest): the present-day stream channel and basin deposits and the Tehama Formation.

Surface Water Resources
Hydrology. Several rivers, streams, drainages, and lakes occur within 10 miles of the project area and include the Sacramento River, Powell Slough, Hopkins Slough, Colusa Drain, and Butte Creek (Figure 4.8-2). Hydrology for the Basin is generally straight forward, with the surface water features receiving recharge via precipitation or irrigation return flows. The Basin contains 13 significant watersheds that drain winter storm runoff and agricultural return flow into the region's main drainage facility, the Colusa Basin Drain. The drain is a man-made feature that collects and conveys irrigation return flows and storm runoff to the Knights Landing outfall gates in Yolo County, where drain waters discharge into the Sacramento River (Turek 1990). Occasionally the drain floods as a result of downstream drainages reaching capacity and forcing flows back into the drain (Hackney 2007). Flooding hazards in the project area and vicinity are discussed in more detail in Section 4.10 (Hazards and Hazardous Materials).
Elevations on the project area range from approximately 40 feet to approximately 50 feet above mean sea level. A small, unnamed drainage ditch, originating near the northern boundary of the Colusa Golf and Country Club, runs in a north to south direction through the project area. It is roughly six to eight feet deep, six feet across, and about four miles long (from the golf course to the boundary of the Park). This ditch collects and conveys stormwater from the eastern portion of the city of Colusa and the golf course. North of Farinon Road, the ditch has capacity to convey approximately 105 cfs or 67.9 mgd, based on its
cross-section and physical properties (California Engineering Company 2006).
Runoff from the existing buildings and the highway (SR 20) flows into a 5.3-acre detention pond, which empties into the ditch. The detention pond has capacity to temporarily detain 100-year flows until the ditch drains downstream or can be pumped. A pumping system operated by CIP is located near the ditch's exit point from the Park (at the southeast end of the Park at Wescott Road). This pumping system provides the means to drain the ditch during or following major storm events or when the ditch is near capacity (see Section 4.7 Utilities and Service Systems). The ditch is unlined and heavily vegetated in some areas, although vegetation is removed from the ditch on a regular basis (Bolen 2006). The drain water that enters the ditch is eventually delivered into the much larger Colusa Drain approximately 3.5 miles southwest of the project boundary.
Water Quality. Considerable erosion and sediment production occurs within the Sacramento River Basin and is an increasing problem associated with residential and commercial development as well as farming
and silvicultural operations (RWQCB 1998). A significant area of concern that has been identified as a source of suspended sediment is bare soil that is associated with construction sites.
The Basin Plan (RWQCB 1998) establishes beneficial uses of waters with the Central Valley and water quality objectives to achieve or maintain those uses. Table 4.8-1 is an inventory of beneficial uses for the Colusa Drain and Sacramento River.

Groundwater Resources
Hydrology. The Sacramento Valley is a large geological trough filled with sediments having variable permeabilities. In the vicinity of the project area, basin deposits extend from ground surface to a depth of approximately 150 feet below ground surface (bgs). These deposits consist of brown clays with a few isolated gravel beds with approximate thicknesses ranging from to 2 feet. The Tehama Formation extends from a depth of approximately 150 feet bgs to a depth of approximately 1,700 feet bgs. The existing Park wells are both believed to extract water from the Tehama Formation.

In the vicinity of the project area, groundwater levels within the Colusa Subbasin have been fairly stable since the 1930's, with no notable increasing or decreasing trend over time. Static water levels range from at ground surface to approximately 20 to 30 feet bgs. Depth to ground water in the project area is very shallow, ranging from 2 to 8 feet bgs (CH2MHill 2006). Groundwater extraction for the entire subbasin in the 1990s was estimated at 112,703 million gallons (346,000 acre-feet), with the primary sources being agriculture, municipal or industrial, and wetlands (California Department of Water Resources 2006). In 2000, the most recent year with available data, approximately 105,000 million gallons per year (mgy) of groundwater and 229,000 mgy of surface water were used within Colusa County (California Department of Water Resources 2006). The vast majority of groundwater pumped within the County (nearly 99%) was used for irrigation. The other major uses of groundwater were public supply (1,175 mgy) and self- supplied domestic use (175 mgy). Despite the amount of ground water used in the County, there have been no indications of overdraft within the Colusa Subbasin or in the region of the project area (City of Colusa 2007a). In fact, when groundwater levels are at ground surface and there is no remaining storage space for ground water, recharge will likely be refused.

Groundwater flow direction below the project area is variable with season and land disposal of industrial
process wastewater, most recently flowing from northwest to southeast (CH2MHill 2006). Because of the characteristics of the groundwater aquifer and distance of the Park well site to domestic groundwater wells in the City (see Section 4.7 Utilities and Service Systems), pumping from the Park's wells does not likely affect other domestic water supply wells in the area (see Appendix F).
Water Quality. Groundwater sources in the Colusa Basin are of good quality and are considered Class ] for agricultural use (Turek 1990). Ground water, however, is generally of lesser quality than that of Sacramento River water delivered to the basin via irrigation canals.

In the vicinity of the project area, iron and manganese are frequently present in elevated concentrations,
sometimes exceeding the DHS Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCL) for these constituents. These
MCLs are secondary, or aesthetic, rather than health-based. Arsenic can be encountered in concentrations
that approach the primary, health-based MCL. Groundwater quality in the project area exhibits relatively high concentrations of total dissolved solids (TDS) (1,647 mg/L), low concentrations of nitrates (1.67 mg/L), and relatively high concentrations of total coliform (2,164 MPN/100 mL) (CH2MHill 2006). Neither well exceeded the MCL for iron, manganese, or arsenic during sampling in 2006 (Appendix F). Water from both wells, however, a has a notable sulfur odor. Slightly increased nitrate concentrations in one well have resulted in installation of a pond liner (Pond 1) to control releases from domestic grey
water (CH2MHill 2006).

4.8.2 Impact Analysis

Methodology
The environmental setting is based on a review of available literature, including the Sacramento River and San Joaquin River Basin Plan (RWQCB 1998) and 2005 Groundwater Technical Assessment Report (CH2MHill 2006), and results of groundwater well sampling in the project area during 2006 (Appendix F). The impact analysis evaluated the proposed land uses and construction activities to determine
potential effects on existing surface and groundwater resources in the project vicinity. The significance of each impact was evaluated using the thresholds identified below, and mitigation measures were identified to reduce significant impacts.

Environmental Impact Report 4-114

General Plan and Zoning Amendment
Impact Analysis Colusa Industrial Properties

Criteria for Determining Significance
Adverse impacts to hydrology and water quality would be considered significant if the project would:
Violate any water quality standards or WDRs.
Substantially degrade surface or groundwater quality through the discharge of point or non-point source pollutants, resulting in the loss of beneficial use of receiving waters.
Substantially alter the existing drainage pattern of the site or area, including the alteration of the
course of a stream or river, or substantially increase the rate or amount of surface runoff in a manner, which would result in flooding, erosion, or siltation on- or off-site.
Create or contribute runoff water, which would exceed the capacity of existing or planned stormwater drainage systems or provide substantial additional sources of polluted runoff.
Otherwise substantially degrade water quality.
Substantially deplete groundwater supplies or interfere substantially with groundwater recharge such that there would be a net deficit in aquifer volume or a lowering of the local groundwater
table level.

Impacts and Mitigation Measures
Impact HWQ-1: Project construction would result in a temporary discharge of pollutants into the unnamed drainage ditch running through the project area.
During construction of the project, land would be cleared and graded. Exposure of surface soils during construction activities would result in increased surface runoff and erosion. Soil disturbances associated
with construction would be temporary because the disturbed ground surface would be paved in the residential and commercial areas and would be covered with sod or vegetation in the golf course area. Construction activities near the ditch would result in discharge of sediments into surface water in the in ditch due to exposed soil and possibly soil erosion.
The sewer system would be constructed within existing road rights-of-way; however, some of the roads
occur adjacent to the ditch. Construction activities along the roads adjacent to the ditch would cause an increase in erosion from the exposed soils and could result in increased sediment delivery into surface water in the ditch.

Increased soil erosion during construction activities could substantially degrade surface water quality of the ditch in the project area and downstream surface water features, including the Colusa Drain and the Sacramento River, which could affect the listed beneficial uses of these waters (Table 4.8-1) and cause a
significant impact.

Significance Level Before Mitigation: Significant.

Mitigation Measure HWQ-1: Implement best management practices to control construction-related stormwater runoff, erosion, and sedimentation.
The County will require compliance with the Stormwater General Permit process prior to project
implementation and issuance of grading permits. The applicant will file a Notice of Intent (NOI) for coverage under the Stormwater General Permit and prepare and submit a SWPPP to the Central Valley RWQCB. The SWPPP must contain a detailed mitigation plan for erosion and sediment control, including

Environmental Impact Report 4-115

General Plan and Zoning Amendment
Impact Analysis Colusa Industrial Properties

plans for implementing BMPs for the control of stormwater runoff, erosion, and sedimentation. Typical BMPs include the following:
Temporary erosion control measures (such as silt fences, staked straw bales, and temporary revegetation) shall be employed for disturbed areas. No disturbed surfaces would be left without erosion control measures in place during the winter and spring months.
Sediment shall be retained onsite by a system of sediment basins, traps, or other appropriate
measures.
A spill prevention and countermeasure plan shall be developed which would identify proper storage, collection, and disposal measures for potential pollutants (such as fuel, fertilizers,
pesticides, etc.) used onsite.
Construction activities shall be scheduled to minimize land disturbance during peak runoff periods and restricted to the immediate area required for construction. Soil conservation practices shall be completed during the fall or late winter to reduce erosion during spring runoff. Existing vegetation would be retained where possible.
Surface water runoff shall be controlled by directing flowing water away from critical areas and by reducing runoff velocity. Diversion structures such as terraces, dikes, and ditches shall collect
and direct runoff water around vulnerable areas to prepared drainage outlets. Surface roughening, berms, check dams, hay bales, or similar devices shall be used to reduce runoff velocity and
erosion.
Sediment shall be contained when conditions are too extreme for treatment by surface protection. Temporary sediment traps, filter fabric fences, inlet protectors, vegetative filters and buffers, or settling basins shall be used to detain runoff water long enough for sediment particles to settle
out. Store, cover, and isolate construction materials, including topsoil and chemicals, to prevent
runoff losses and contamination of ground water.
Topsoil removed during construction shall be carefully stored and treated as an important resource. Berms shall be placed around topsoil stockpiles to prevent runoff during storm events.
Establish fuel and vehicle maintenance areas away from all drainage courses and design these
areas to control runoff.
Disturbed areas would be revegetated after completion of construction activities.
All necessary permits and approvals shall be obtained.

Significance Level After Mitigation: Less than significant because implementation of best
management practices would reduce impacts to surface water quality and minimize impacts to
downstream beneficial uses.

Impact HWQ-2: Development in the project area would result in increased stormwater flows, which could affect water quality of downstream drainages.
Surface runoff from the project area drains into the unnamed ditch and is conveyed to the Colusa Drain and eventually the Sacramento River. Development of the project area would increase the volume of surface flows being discharged into the ditch and into downstream surface waters by approximately 85 cfs. or 54.9 mgd, during a 100-year storm event. During 10-year storm events, this volume would be approximately 58 cfs, or 37.5 mgd (California Engineering Company 2006). The unnamed ditch has capacity to convey up to 105 cfs and would be capable of receiving increased flows from the development area. However, during periods of the year when major storms cause downstream drainages to reach capacity, surface runoff may exceed capacity of the unnamed drainage ditch, resulting in flooding along the ditch and on adjacent land, such as the airport. The exposure of project residents to flooding is discussed in Section 4.10 (Hazards and Hazardous Materials). Flood events could affect water quality of

Environmental Impact Report 4-116

General Plan and Zoning Amendment
Impact Analysis Colusa Industrial Properties

surface water in the drainage ditch by increasing sedimentation and pollutants in the surface water,
resulting in adverse effects on water quality of downstream drainages.

Additionally, stormwater runoff from the development would contain nonpoint source contaminants and could adversely affect surface water quality. Contamination sources include chemical use (e.g., fertilizers, herbicides), oil drippings, and car wash soap and dirt. Pollutants would accumulate on paved areas (impermeable surfaces) until stormwater transports them off the site. The increase in impermeable surfaces would increase surface runoff. As a result of increased runoff, the unlined ditch would be subject to increased erosion, resulting in increased sediment in downstream surface waters.
When CIP operates the pumping station at the downstream end of the Park (during high flows), some of the sediment and pollutants would settle as the water floods the land upstream of the pump, it and it would not be pumped through the levee into downstream surface waters. However, when the pump is not operating or when substantial amounts of sediment and pollutants are present in the water during major flooding, the increased volume of runoff could convey increased sediment and pollutants to downstream surface waters, resulting in a significant impact on water quality.

Significance Level Before Mitigation: Significant.

Mitigation Measure HWQ-2a: Maintain, and widen as necessary, the unnamed ditch from the southern end of the development to the Park boundary.
The applicant will continue to maintain the unnamed ditch within the Park boundaries by periodically removing invasive vegetation and cleaning debris out of the ditch. Additionally, the applicant will coordinate with Colusa County and a qualified engineer to identify segments of the ditch that should be widened between the development area and the Park boundary to be more uniform throughout and be capable of receiving increased flows during periods of flooding. As necessary, the applicant will relocate portions of the ditch that are currently on other private property into the Park's boundaries. As part of this effort, the new ditch would be sized and configured to be uniform with other ditch improvements. Detailed plans for ditch widening will be submitted to the County for review and approval prior to issuance of grading permits and would be subject to subsequent environmental reviews. Ditch modifications will be subject to permitting under the Clean Water Act or Fish and Game Code Secs. 1600 et seq. Regular maintenance and widening the ditch will improve its capacity and allow it to receive increased runoff from the project with reduced erosion and flooding.
Mitigation Measure HWQ-2b: Implement and enforce a stormwater quality management plan and stormwater best management practices to manage urban runoff in the developed area.
The County will require the applicant to prepare a stormwater quality management plan and implement BMPs to reduce pollutants in urban runoff, in compliance with the County's stormwater quality control measures. The stormwater quality management plan will be prepared by a registered civil engineer or a registered professional hydrologist in coordination with the Central Valley RWQCB and Colusa County and will be approved prior to issuance of grading permits. Project-specific stormwater BMPs will be incorporated into project design plans and approved by the County prior to issuance of grading permits.
A variety of stormwater BMPs are available for managing urban runoff. Stormwater BMPs are most effective when implemented as part of a comprehensive stormwater management program that includes proper selection, design, construction, inspection, and maintenance measures. Stormwater BMPs can be grouped into two broad categories: structural and non-structural. Structural BMPs are used to treat the stormwater at either the point of generation or the point of discharge to the storm sewer system or to receiving waters. Non-structural BMPs include a range of pollution prevention, education, institutional,

management, and development practices designed to limit the conversion of rainfall to runoff and to
prevent pollutants from entering runoff at the source of runoff generation. Table 4.8-2 provides a summary of variety of commonly used structural and nonstructural stormwater BMPs (EPA 1999 and
California Stormwater Quality Association 2004).

Table 4.8-2. Typical Best Management Practices for Managing
Post-Construction Urban Runoff

Best Management Practice Purpose
General community outreach Increase public awareness of the need to and how to control
nonpoint source pollution
Catch basin cleaning Capture and remove sediment and debris such as trash and leaf
litter
Commercial and retail space: good Reduce pollutants in runoff by using porous pavement or
housekeeping modular paving systems for vehicle parking lots, limiting exposure of materials and equipment to rainfall, spill cleanup, using dry cleanup techniques instead of wet techniques, and limiting direct runoff of rooftops to storm drains
Pesticide/herbicide use Reduce the amount of pesticides that are carried by urban runoff
through education and using alternatives to pesticides, such as an
integrated pest management program and insecticide soap or natural bacteria
Street cleaning program Remove a significant portion of pollutants contributed from streets and parking lots
Filtration systems Remove constituents found in runoff
Vegetated systems (biofilters) Convey and treat either shallow flow (swales) or sheetflow (filter strips) runoff
Minimizing directly connected Reduce the amount of surface area directly connected to the
impervious surfaces storm drainage system by minimizing or eliminating traditional
curbs and gutters

Mitigation Measure HWQ-2c: Implement a Master Drainage Plan to assure downstream drainages will
accommodate project runoff.

Implement Mitigation Measure U-3b.

Significance Level After Mitigation: Less than significant because maintaining and widening the
ditch would ensure its capability to convey increased flows and implementation of post-construction
stormwater BMPs would reduce the amount and types of contaminants discharged into surface
waters and would minimize impacts to downstream beneficial uses.
Impact HWQ-3: Development of the project area would result in a minor reduction in groundwater recharge in the Colusa Subbasin.
Development of the project area would result in an increase in impervious surfaces, which would increase
surface runoff and decrease groundwater recharge in the project area. Surface runoff downstream of the

development area in the unlined detention basin and the unlined drainage ditch would result in some
percolation into the ground water. The reduction in groundwater recharge would be minimal because the
deposits that underlie the area are typically fine grained and less permeable, consisting mainly of clays,
and do not allow significant recharge (Appendix F). The majority of recharge within the Colusa Subbasin occurs within the foothills where more coarse grained sediments are exposed at the surface and along streams and rivers, such as the nearby Sacramento River. Impacts to the Colusa Subbasin would be less than significant because of the minimal reduction in groundwater recharge.

Significance Level: Less than significant because the project would result in a minimal reduction in
groundwater recharge.

Impact HWQ-4: Groundwater pumping for the project's water supply would increase groundwater
use in Colusa County by 0.15 percent, and the effect on groundwater levels within the Colusa
Subbasin would be minimal.

Groundwater pumping within the project area would increase by approximately 153 mgy based on the water sufficiency analysis for the project (Appendix F). The increased pumping could increase impacts to
the aquifer beneath the project area, reduce available groundwater resources in the area, and potentially
change aquifer flow directions. An analysis of water sufficiency found that groundwater resources in the project area are not in overdraft and that a 0.15 percent increase (153 mgy pumped by the project out of 105,000 total mgy pumped in the County) to pumpage within the county would likely have an insignificant effect on long-term groundwater conditions (Appendix F). Based on the small increase in groundwater pumping for the project, the additional groundwater use associated with the project would cause a less than significant reduction in available groundwater.

Significance Level: Less than significant because the project's groundwater use would have a minor
effect on the groundwater aquifer.

Impact HWQ-5: Land application of treated effluent could affect ground water quality.
Land application of treated effluent could result in pollutant discharge to ground water and possible migration to surface water. In addition to possible migration into ground water, land discharge of tertiary- treated effluent could result in the deposition of contaminants within the soil on the site. Crop rotation as part of the effluent discharge process would ensure salt and contaminant build-up is minimal on the surface.

The primary water quality concern for discharge by domestic water treatment is nitrogen loading, Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD), total suspended solids (TSS), and coliform. After primary and secondary treatment, the effluent would receive tertiary treatment using a sand filtration system, followed by disinfection with chlorine prior to discharge. The resulting water quality would meet Title 22 Recycled Water Standards. Specifically, the design parameters call for the tertiary-treated effluent to contain total
nitrates less than 10 mg/L, BOD less than 10 mg/L, TSS less than 10 mg/L, turbidity less than NTU,
and coliform less than 2.2 CFU/100mL. Tertiary-treated effluent meeting these design parameters would
comply with the Water Quality Objectives for Groundwater detailed in the Basin Plan (RWQCB 1998).
Although the treated effluent would meet recycled water quality standards (Title 22), discharge of the effluent to land could result in increased contaminants in the groundwater aquifer and increased salt build-up on the surface. This could adversely affect groundwater quality and exceed acceptable levels established by the Regional Water Quality Control Board, resulting in a significant impact.
Significance Level before Mitigation: Significant.

Environmental Impact Report 4-119

General Plan and Zoning Amendment
Impact Analysis Colusa Industrial Properties

Mitigation Measure HWQ-S: Comply with Waste Discharge Requirements issued by the Central Valley
Regional Water Quality Control Board.
The County will require the applicant to revise the existing industrial wastewater WDRs issued by the Central Valley RWQCB for the Park (Order No. 5-01-250) prior to issuance of a grading permit for construction of the wastewater treatment facilities. The new wastewater treatment facilities will be
required to comply with the revised WDRs. These requirements would likely be similar to those in place for the current land disposal activities for industrial process wastewater and would ensure groundwater quality is not adversely affected. For the current system, the WDRs include daily measurement of effluent pH, weekly effluent sampling to monitor BOD, TSS, and nitrogen loading, as well as monthly effluent sampling for coliform. In addition to effluent sampling, the WDRs require annual soil sampling for nitrogen, chlorine, iron, manganese, pH, alkalinity, and solids, and quarterly monitoring of groundwater
for pH, chlorine, nitrogen, iron, manganese, solids, coliform, and standard inorganic minerals. In addition to water quality sampling, the depth to ground water, groundwater elevation, and groundwater flow direction are determined on a quarterly basis (CH2MHill 2006). CIP would be responsible for implementing appropriate actions to ensure groundwater quality is protected if monitoring identifies that WDR limits for any pollutants are exceeded.

Significance Level After Mitigation: Less than significant because compliance with WDRs would ensure land application of treated wastewater does not adversely affect groundwater quality.

Significant and Unavoidable Impacts
None.

4.9 GEOLOGY AND SOILS
This section describes the existing geological setting of the project area and identifies geological hazards in the project vicinity. The impact analysis discusses the potential for soils and geologic hazards to affect project facilities. Mitigation measures are identified for significant impacts, followed by determinations of
the residual impact significance after mitigation measures are implemented.

4.9.1 Setting

Regulatory Setting
The Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act (formerly the Alquist-Priolo Special Studies Zones Act), signed into law in December 1972, requires the delineation of zones along active faults in California
(Public Resources Code Secs. 2621 et seq.). Cities and counties must regulate development within active fault zones to protect development from future surface displacement.
The Seismic Hazards Mapping Act of 1990 was developed to protect the public from the effects of strong ground shaking, liquefaction, landslides, Or other ground failure, and from other hazards caused by carthquakes (Public Resources Code Secs. 2690 et seq.). This Act requires the State Geologist to delineate various seismic hazard zones and requires cities, counties, and other local permitting agencies to regulate certain development projects within these zones.

Environmental Impact Report 4-120

General Plan and Zoning Amendment
Impact Analysis Colusa Industrial Properties

The Uniform Building Code (UBC) is a widely adopted model building code in the United States. The California Building Standards Code (Title 24, Code of California Regulations) incorporates the UBC by reference and includes necessary criteria for seismic design. Chapter 16 identifies seismic factors that must be considered in structural design. Appendix Chapter A33 regulates grading activities, including erosion control and construction on expansive soils and areas subject to liquefaction.
The Colusa County General Plan, Safety Element, addresses aspects of the County's natural environment and man-made environment, which may pose threats to human life or property. Applicable goals and objectives include maintaining a high level of public health and safety for all residents of Colusa County, while minimizing threats to life and property from seismic and geologic hazards. Policy SAFE-7 calls for investigations for any development proposal in an area with highly expansive soils in
order to eliminate or mitigate adverse impacts (Colusa County 1989).

Environmental Setting
The project area is situated on the northern portion of the Great Valley Geomorphic Province, which includes the Sacramento and San Joaquin Valleys. The ground composition of this province is characterized by alluvial deposition (deposited by water), which includes silt and cobbles deposited on the
valley floor as a result of erosive processes in the Sierra Nevada Mountains to the east. Although several
large faults occur throughout California, the Sacramento Valley has not historically been a region of significant seismic activity.
Based on historic seismic data (Colusa County 1992) and soils data (Natural Resources Conservation Service 2006) for the project area, geologic hazards such as lateral spreading resulting from liquefaction and subsidence would not be anticipated. Also, landslides would not be expected because of the project area's flat topography. Since these hazards are not expected to occur in the project area, they will not be
further discussed in this section.

Seismicity and Seismic Hazards
The entire state of California is subject to groundshaking from several fault systems throughout the state. The project area is closest to the Willows fault zone, which generally runs parallel to the Sacramento River in the Colusa area. The Willows fault is a northwest trending fault that follows the Sutter Buttes
east of Colusa and continues northward toward Willows and connects to a series of faults that extends to the Oroville area (Harwood and Helley 1987). Seismic events generated from part of the Willows fault zone were documented near Oroville, California (approximately 25 miles northeast of Colusa) in 1975- 1976. The project area is also approximately 75 miles to the east and 75 miles northwest of the Melones Fault System and the Coast Ranges Fault Zone, respectively.
According to the County (1992), a maximum credible earthquake for Colusa County could register at approximately 5.7 on the Richter scale from the Willows fault at the Sutter Buttes. Earthquake occurrences, however, in Colusa County have been relatively few (Colusa County 1989). The project area is not located within an earthquake fault zone as designated by the Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zone
Act (California Geological Survey 2006a). Because the project area is not located on a known fault zone,
seismic events are not considered to be a significant hazard to the project area (California Office of Emergency Services [OES] 2003), and surface rupture is not anticipated. is
USGS has conducted probabilistic mapping for the area; Colusa County has been determined to have a
maximum peak horizontal ground acceleration of 0.15g in a given 50-year period. Compared to the

Environmental Impact Report 4-121

General Plan and Zoning Amendment
Impact Analysis Colusa Industrial Properties

Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale (MMIS), a scale used by U.S. seismologists, 0.15g corresponds with a
MMIS value of VII to VIII, on a scale of I to XII, with XII being the most intense (Colusa County 1992). Earthquakes of this intensity would cause alarm to the population and light to moderate damage to structures depending on method of construction (Federal Emergency Management Agency [FEMA] No
Date).

Soils
Three soil types have been mapped in the project area by the Natural Resources Conservation Service (2006). As shown on Table 4.9-1 and on Figure 4.9-1, the soils in the area include Colusa loam (map unit 136), Grandbend loam (map unit 160), and Willows silty clay (map unit 106).

Table 4.9-1. Soils in the Project Area

Soils Identified in the Expansivity Erosion Percentage in
Development Area Project Area
Colusa loam (1.36), 0 to
2% slopes High Slight 83%

Grandbend loam (160),
0 to 2% slopes High Slight 17%

Willows silty clay (106), 0
to 1% slopes High Moderate Less than 1%

As a result of high expansivity and clay content, these soil types may be subject to seasonal expansion and contraction, which can pose safety hazards and create structural damage to buildings. In general the expansivity of a soil is the result of its clay content.
Soil erosion is described as the loss of soil material from a specific land area through the actions of wind
and water. The dominant soil types in the project area a have a slight erosion potential. According to the County (1989), erosion in Colusa County is not significant due to the general lack of topographical relief. a Nevertheless, erosion is a naturally occurring process, and some erosion is expected within the project
area.

4.9.2 Impact Analysis

Methodology
The impact analysis is based on geological information obtained from Colusa County (1989 and 1992), Natural Resources Conservation Service (2006), United States Geological Survey (2000), and California Geological Survey (2006a and 2006b). The project was analyzed in terms of its compatibility with Colusa County General Plan policies and potential for geologic or soils-related hazards to people or property in the project area.

Environmental Impact Report 4-122

General Plan and Zoning Amendment
Impact Analysis Colusa Industrial Properties

Criteria for Determining Significance
Adverse impacts related to geology and soils would be considered significant if the project would:
Expose people or structures to potential substantial adverse effects, including the risk of loss,
injury, or death involving:

o Rupture of a known earthquake fault, as delineated on the most recent Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Map issued by the State Geologist for the area or based on other
substantial evidence of a known fault. Refer to Division of Mines and Geology Special
Publication 42.

0 Strong seismic ground shaking.
Be located on expansive soil, as defined in Table 18-1-B of the UBC (1994), creating substantial risks to life or property.
Result in substantial soil erosion or the loss of topsoil.

Impacts and Mitigation Measures
Impact GS-1: Earthquakes could result in damage to the project's residences, commercial and
office buildings, wastewater treatment facility, and utility lines, or personal injuries.
The project area is closest to the Willows fault and is located in a region of moderate to moderately high earthquake intensity, ranging from a VII to VIII on the Modified Mercalli Scale (OES 2003). Earthquakes in this region could cause light to moderate damage to structures depending on construction methods. Earthquake activity could also result in personal injuries. Because of the potential for building and infrastructure damage and personal injuries, earthquakes could result in a significant impact.
Significance Level Before Mitigation: Significant
Mitigation Measure GS-1: Design project buildings and infrastructure to withstand earthquake activity.
The County will require the applicant to design all project buildings and infrastructure to comply with the California Building Code (Chapter 16) to ensure minimal damage from earthquake activity. Building and infrastructure design will be approved by the County prior to approval of subdivision maps.
Significance Level After Mitigation: Less than significant because project buildings and infrastructure would be adequately designed to insure minimal damage from earthquakes.

Impact GS-2: Development on expansive soils could cause structural damage and personal injury.
The majority of the County, including the project area, contains soils that are considered to be highly expansive. Rainy and dry seasons could influence the soils' shrink-swell properties and cause differential and cyclical foundation movements. If untreated, the soils' expansive properties could result in damages,
which may include post-construction heave and cracking of foundation footings; warping and cracking of roads and sidewalks; compromising infrastructure with the rupturing of utility lines; and personal injuries resulting from the above. Because the proposed development and wastewater facility would be located on expansive soils, impacts associated with expansive soils would be significant.

Significance Level Before Mitigation: Significant.

Mitigation Measure GS-2: Design project buildings and infrastructure to withstand expansive soil conditions based on geotechnical investigation.
Prior to development, the applicant will retain a qualified soil engineer to conduct a geotechnical investigation and recommend treatment measures deemed necessary to reduce impacts of expansive soils.
The study will be submitted to the County for review and approval prior to issuance of grading permits.
Specific design measures will be approved by the County and may include the use of reinforced steel in foundations; use of drainage control devices; and overexcavating and backfilling with nonexpansive soil during construction activities to minimize adverse effects. Proposed areas of development could also be supported on post-tensioned slab foundations designed to resist or span the expansive soil.

Significance Level After Mitigation: Less than significant because buildings and infrastructure
would be designed to minimize impacts from expansive soils.

Impact GS-3: Construction activities would expose soils in disturbed areas to wind and water
erosion.

Construction activities leading to the disturbance of soils, such as excavating, cutting/filling, and grading, could expose bare soils to water and wind and facilitate erosion in the project area. The entire project area contains soils that are considered to have slight and moderate levels of erosion. The dominant soil types in the project area are slightly erosive soils (Natural Resources Conservation Service 2006), with 110
construction planned on soils with moderate erosion potential. Nevertheless, eroded soils could reach receiving waters and cause significant water quality impacts (see Impact HWQ-1).
Significance Level Before Mitigation: Significant.
Mitigation Measure GS-3: Implement best management practices to control construction-related stormwater runoff, erosion, and sedimentation.

Implement Mitigation Measure HWQ-I.

Significance Level After Mitigation: Less than significant because best management practices
would reduce the effects of soil erosion to a less-than-significant level.

Significant and Unavoidable Impacts

4.10 HAZARDS AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
This section describes the existing hazards and hazardous materials in the project area and evaluates the potential effects of these hazards on the project's land uses. Potential hazards that could affect project area residents include crop-dusting, truck transport, flooding, and chemical uses. Mitigation measures are identified for significant impacts, followed by determinations of the residual impact significance after
mitigation measures are implemented.

4.10.1 Setting

Regulatory Setting

Federal
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulates all civilian aviation activity in the United States. Regulations specific to aerial application operations are described in Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 137, Agricultural Aircraft Operations. The regulations allow aerial application aircraft to approach an airport from virtually any direction and at lower altitudes than the altitudes used by other general aviation aircraft. Aerial application operations have different requirements depending on the surrounding uses and
presence of "congested areas". The FAA does not specifically define congested areas, but it can be assumed that a residential or commercial area that accommodates a group of people would be considered
a "congested area" (Appendix I). For aerial application aircraft flying over a congested area, the operator must obtain written approval from the appropriate official or governing body to be allowed to fly over the
area.

CFR Title 14 is administered at the state level by California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) Division of Aeronautics and requires the FAA to be notified when there is a change in land use that would involve the development of structures and roadways adjacent to an airport. The criterion for notification depends on the height of structures relative to the location of the runway. The FAA conducts an airspace safety review to ensure that building height to distance from airstrip runway ratios comply with FAA safety requirements.

CFR Title 49 prohibits the release of hazardous substances into the environment and requires all containers to meet strict standards for impact resistance, strength, and packing compatibility. Also, CFR Title 49 contains requirements for the training of drivers in inspection, vehicle operation, loading and unloading of cargo, knowledge of materials transported, and use of vehicle controls and equipment.
The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA; 40 CFR 50 et seq.) regulates the distribution, sale, and use of pesticides. FIFRA requires pesticide applicators to pass a licensing examination for status as "qualified applicators," creates a review and registration process for new pesticide products, and requires thorough and understandable labeling that includes instructions for use.

State
California Code of Regulations (CCR) Title 3 states that before applying pesticides or other chemicals, and throughout the application process, applicators are responsible for evaluating their equipment, weather conditions, the property to be treated, and surrounding properties to determine the likelihood of harm or damage. No application may be made or continued when there is a reasonable possibility of

substantial drift to non-target areas or (I) contamination of the bodies or clothing of persons not involved in the application process; (2) damage to non-target crops, animals, or other public or private property; or (3) contamination of public or private property, including the creation of a health hazard that prevents normal use of that property.
CCR Title 22 defines hazardous materials in order to protect public health and the environment. Hazardous materials are defined as: a substance or combination of substances which, because of their quantity, concentration, or physical, chemical or infectious characteristics, may either (1) cause, or significantly contribute to, an increase in mortality or an increase in serious irreversible, or incapacitating reversible, illness; or (2) pose a substantial present or potential hazard to human health or environment when improperly treated, stored, transported, or disposed of or otherwise managed.
CCR Title 26 identifies management criteria for the identification, packaging, and disposal of hazardous waste and materials. Title 26 contains requirements for hazardous materials transport, containment design, treatment standards, disposal facilities, and staff training.
California Food and Agricultural Code (CFAC) Division 6 defines specific requirements for pesticide application within the State of California. CFAC Division 6 requires training for aircraft pilots conducting pest control and requires their possession of valid permit and certificate.

Local
The Colusa County General Plan Safety Element addresses aspects of the County's natural and man- made environment which may pose threats to human life or property. Applicable goals and objectives include maintaining a high level of public health and safety for all residents of Colusa County through land use constraints in community development.
The Colusa County Airport CLUP was adopted in 1995 (Colusa County 1995). The CLUP includes policies that establish land use compatibility standards for height restrictions, noise compatibility, and safety of persons on the ground. These standards are applied primarily to proposed new land uses in the airport vicinity, and not to existing development that may be inconsistent with the standards. Proposed new land uses must be compatible with each of the CLUP's height, noise, and safety standards to be considered consistent with the CLUP (see Section 4.1 Land Use for a description of the CLUP).
Colusa County adopted Ordinance No. 510 (right to farm ordinance) in February 1990. The ordinance promotes the general health, safety, and welfare of the County, establishes goals to preserve and protect
lands zoned for agricultural use, and encourages continued agricultural operations. Disclosure statements
identifying that the property may be subject to inconvenience or discomfort from agricultural uses will be required in any County document (evidencing the sale, purchase, transfer, or lease of real property) and by the seller of the property. The ordinance is intended to limit nuisance litigation regarding agriculture or affecting agriculture activities; however, such ordinances have limited effectiveness in eliminating conflicts.

Environmental Setting
The project area is located in close proximity to active agricultural land, industrial uses, a state highway (SR 20), the Sacramento River, and a small airport. Each of these uses creates different potential hazards
to the project's land uses.

Environmental Impact Report 4-128

General Plan and Zoning Amendment
Impact Analysis Colusa Industrial Properties

Industrial Uses
Industrial uses within the Park include tomato and rice straw processing facilities and other agricultural- related services. Specific facilities within the Park include East Colusa Farms and Monitoring Station, located on Sunrise Boulevard, John Taylor Fertilizers Colusa Facility on Farinon Road, Miller's Flying Service, Colusa Bean Growers, and Simplot Soilbuilders south of Farinon Road.
Available Federal, State, and local databases were searched to evaluate environmental risks associated with current uses in the Park (Environmental Data Resources, Inc. [EDR] 2006). No mapped sites indicating toxic releases or hazardous materials were identified in EDR's search of government records (EDR 2006). Due to this information, hazardous materials associated with industrial uses in the Park are
not further discussed in this section.

Truck Transport
Highways in Colusa County provide major thoroughfares for commuter traffic and truck transports. Three highways (SR 20, SR 45, and Interstate 5) are located in the vicinity of the project area. SR 20 is the closet highway to the project area, directly adjacent the project's eastern boundary. According to the traffic study for the project, SR 20 carries 7 percent of the daily traffic on SR 20 through Colusa (Appendix C). Trucks traveling through Colusa County commonly carry a variety of hazardous materials, including gasoline and various crude oil derivatives. When properly contained, these materials do not typically present a hazard to the nearby communities. In the event of an accident, these materials may be released in either liquid or gas form.

Airport
The Colusa County Airport extends to the southern boundary of the project area at Farinon Road. The project area boundary is located approximately 250 ft north of the end of the runway. Colusa County Airport is classified as a Basic Utility Stage II airport, with a landing strip that can serve single-engine and multi-engine airplanes used for personal and business purposes (Colusa County 1995). As identified by the airport manager (Krug 2007), current uses of the airport include general aviation and agricultural activities.

There are approximately 28,000 flights annually from the Colusa County Airport, of which 40 percent of the operations result from general aviation. According to the National Transportation Safety Board's (NTSB) accident database and FAA's Aviation Safety Information Analysis and Sharing database, one general aviation accident occurred in 1995 in flooded rice field near the Colusa County Airport. The cause of the accident was reported as engine failure and lack of experience of the pilot (NTSB 1995). Also, a crop-dusting plane that took off from the Colusa County Airport was recently involved in an accident just west of the project area on Wescott Road on May 13, 2007; the pilot was killed in the accident (Colusa County Sun-Herald 2007).
The majority of the airport's operations result from agricultural crop-dusting activities. Approximately 90 percent of all agricultural activities occur between the months of April and August, with heaviest crop- dusting in April and June. Crop-dusting planes operate during daylight hours and result in about 250 take- in offs and landings per day during the heaviest period (Krug 2007). Airplanes take off and land to the north over the project area, and many crop-dusting planes turn west or east at the end of the runway to access agricultural lands in those directions. Approximately half of the crop-dusting traffic takes off and lands over the project area (Appendix I).

Environmental Impact Report 4-129

General Plan and Zoning Amendment
Impact Analysis Colusa Industrial Properties
The crop-dusting airplanes using the airport apply mainly herbicides on the agricultural lands throughout the County, including on lands directly west and adjacent to the project area. Chemicals including Ordram, Bolero, Clincher, Abolish, Propanil, Cerano, and Regiment are highly used applicants in crop- dusting operations and are stored at the airport prior to being applied (Krug 2007). According to the California Department of Pesticide Regulations (CDPR 2003), the chemicals used for crop-dusting have been identified as being potentially toxic to humans. Between 2000 and 2005, two chemical exposure incidents have been recorded by the CDPR in the County; incidences were the result of direct contact (spill, leakage, or emersion) and other/unknown (ingestion, residue from spill, or unknown) exposure to the chemical. No documented incidences caused by chemical drift or residue were filed (CDPR 2000 and 2005).

Flooding
The Sacramento River is the closest natural channel subject to flooding. It is located approximately one mile northeast of the project area. The river follows the northern border of the City of Colusa and travels east-southeast through the County. Butte Sink, located in Butte County northeast of the City of Colusa, is used as a flood basin to carry overflow from the Sacramento River prior to reaching the City. Water is diverted to Butte Sink from the river through a weir located north of the City of Colusa (Colusa County 1989). A levee system along the southern and western boundaries of the river protects City residents from flooding. This system is part of the Sacramento River Flood Control System and was designed to protect downstream areas from a 100-year flood event. Sites located near the City of Colusa (River Mile 154.5 and 145.9) are currently undergoing emergency repairs (Ayres 2005).
The Colusa Basin Drain is man-made channel that conveys surface runoff and irrigation return flows from the project area and vicinity to the Sacramento River. The Colusa Basin Drain is located approximately 2.5 miles west of the project area, and the unnamed ditch in the project area drains into the drain. Occasionally, the Sutter Bypass, a downstream channel that serves a similar purpose as the Colusa Basin Drain, becomes too full and can force water into the Colusa Drain and upstream channels. During large storm events, this can result in flooding in the Park and on the nearby airport property (Hackney 2007).

According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency flood maps (Flood Maps 06011C0535, 06011C0550, 06011C0555, 06011C0575 2003; FEMA 2003), the project area is located within FEMA classification Zone X, which is defined as having a 0.2-percent annual chance (or 500-year) of a significant storm event. FEMA is currently remapping floodplains in the Sacramento Valley. This
remapping effort takes into account changes in hydrology due to recent development, as well as new information on the condition of levees.

There are five dams (Lake Oroville, Lake Shasta, Whiskeytown Lake, Black Butte Lake, and East Park Reservoir) of various jurisdictions (DWR, BOR, and USACE) that retain water from tributaries of the Sacramento River. According to the County (1989), earthquakes centered close to the dams would be the greatest concern for dam failure. However, because earthquake occurrences have been relatively few from 1985 to present, seismic events causing dam failure are not a considered to be a significant hazard to the project area and will not be further discussed in this section.

4.10.2 Impact Analysis

Methodology
The environmental setting is based on natural and man-made hazards obtained from various sources, including CDPR (2003), Colusa County General Plan (1989), EDR's (2006) identification of known hazardous materials sites, and personal communications with airport personnel and others. The impact analysis evaluates the project's potential to expose people and property in the project area to significant hazards. An analysis of airport operations was conducted by Mead and Hunt to address potential noise and safety concerns associated with the nearby airport (Appendix I).

Criteria for Determining Significance
Adverse impacts related to hazards and hazardous materials would be considered significant if the project would:

Create significant hazard to the public or the environment through the routine transport, use, or disposal of hazardous materials.
Create a significant hazard to the public or the environment through reasonably foreseeable upset and accident conditions involving the release of hazardous materials into the environment.
Expose people residing or working in the project area to health and safety risks due to the project's close proximity to a public use airport.
Impair implementation of or physically interfere with an adopted emergency response plan or emergency evacuation plan.
Expose people or structures to significant risk of loss, injury or death involving on-site or off- site flooding, including flooding as result of the failure of a levee or dam or due to increased
rates and amounts of surface runoff.

Impacts and Mitigation Measures
Impact HHM-1: Releases of hazardous materials from truck traffic along State Route 20 would
pose minimal risks to project residents.

Trucks traveling through Colusa County along SR 20 carry a variety of hazardous materials, including gasoline and various chemicals. When properly contained, these materials would not present a hazard to the public or the environment. Hazardous materials recovery procedures are enforced by the State and adhered to by private transportation companies. Primary respondents to a truck accident would be the Colusa County Sheriff's Office and Sacramento River Fire District (see Section 4.3 Public Services). Because of the proximity of SR 20 to the high-density residential and commercial areas, residents and properties adjacent to the highway would be at greatest risk of the effects of truck accidents and the
release of hazardous materials.

Although there are risks of truck accidents on SR 20, and project traffic could increase these risks, truck transports account for only seven percent of total daily traffic on SR 20 going through Colusa County, and the transportation of hazardous materials by truck is strictly regulated by federal regulations (CFR 49). Given the low percentage of daily truck traffic on SR 20 and compliance with federal regulations, impacts to residents and properties from truck accidents or hazardous materials spills along the highway would be less than significant.

Environmental Impact Report 4-131

General Plan and Zoning Amendment
Impact Analysis Colusa Industrial Properties

Significance Level: Less than significant because truck accidents along State Route 20 would pose minimal risks to project residents.
Impact HHM-2: Hazards associated with routine use of the project gas station would pose minimal
risks to project residents or the environment.

The project includes a gas station in the commercial zone at the corner of SR 20 and Farinon Road. The
gas station's storage tank would be refilled on a regular basis. Refilling storage tanks could create an additional risk of release of fuel into the environment from fueling truck accidents or spills. Even though there are risks associated with the use and maintenance of fueling stations, the use of these fuels is highly regulated. Federal (CFR 49) and state (CCR 22) regulations impose safety and operational guidelines in order to reduce the risk to human health and the environment from the use of hazardous substances. Project residences would be located more than one-quarter mile west and north of the gas station, so exposure to hazards and hazardous materials associated with routine use of the gas station would be minimal. Because the gas station would comply with federal and state regulations and project residences would be located away from the gas station, risks to project residents or the environment would be minimal and represent a less than significant impact.
Significance Level: Less than significant because gas station operation would pose minimal risks to project residents and the environment.
Impact HHM-3: Airport operations would expose project residents, visitors, and workers to health and safety risks associated with routine crop-dusting.
The immediate proximity of residential and commercial uses to the Colusa County Airport would expose residents, visitors, and workers to excessive noise from airplanes, potential hazards from aircraft accidents, health risks associated with crop-dusting chemicals, and a general concern for resident safety. Noise impacts are discussed in Section 4.5; airport traffic would expose residents, visitors, and workers to excessive noise that could cause sleep disruptions and general disturbances during daily routines.
Although airplane accidents are fairly rare, a recent accident occurred just west of the project area on Wescott Road (Colusa County Sun-Herald 2007). The potential for accidents is expected to be higher during the high traffic periods when crop-dusting planes average about 250 trips per day (between April and August). Crop-dusting planes routinely fly over the project area during take-offs and landing; about half of crop-dusting traffic flies over the project area (Appendix I). Construction of residences and other buildings in a currently undeveloped area would increase the potential for airplane accidents in the project area because these buildings could affect normal take off and landing routines. As discussed in Section
4.1 (Land Use), the project's buildings would meet height restrictions established by the airport CLUP;
therefore, the buildings would conform with take off and landing paths and would not create barriers in
flight paths that could cause an accident. However, the presence of a relatively high density of residences in close proximity to the airport (within the overflight zone) a would expose a large number of people to potential accidents. Although the project identifies an overflight corridor along the southern boundary of the low density residential area, crop-dusting planes would not be capable of making the quick turn needed to utilize this corridor without compromising flight safety (Appendix I). Thus the corridor would not reduce concerns with safety and potential hazards from routine crop-dusting operations. Because of the potential for airplane accidents in the project area, project residents, visitors, and workers would be exposed to substantial hazards.
In addition to potential crashes, crop-dusting planes flying over the project area carry heavy loads of crop- dusting chemicals (herbicides, fungicides, pesticides, and other potentially harmful chemicals) when taking off and have potential to accidentally release chemicals over the project's residences and

Environmental Impact Report 4-132

General Plan and Zoning Amendment

commercial/office buildings. Additionally, the spraying of crop-dusting chemicals on nearby fields may create health hazards to project residences if the chemicals drift into the project area. The chemicals sprayed are strictly regulated by federal and state regulations and used in accordance with FIFRA label restrictions by qualified personnel. According to the Colusa County Airport Commissioner (Krug 2007), crop-dusting does not occur when wind velocity exceeds 10 miles per hour, to minimize drift to populated areas. Standard crop-dusting practices have not resulted in any reported instances of illnesses or injuries related to chemical drift in the County (CDPR 2000 and 2005). Even though crop-dusting activities would be confined to the targeted areas, with minimal chemical drift, in accordance with regulations and airport
procedures, the proximity of residents, visitors, and workers to crop-dusting activities and agricultural lands could still expose people to unacceptable levels of chemicals during applications.
Airport operations, particularly those associated with crop-dusting activities, would expose project residents, visitors, and workers to unacceptable health and safety risks from airport noise, potential accidents, and exposure to crop-dusting chemicals. These impacts would be significant.

Significance Level Before Mitigation: Significant.
Mitigation Measure HHM-3a: Notify all prospective purchasers and users of property near or adjacent to agricultural operations of inconveniences or discomforts that may accompany agricultural operations.
Prior to the selling, purchasing, transferring, or leasing of real property, full disclosure of inconveniences or discomforts arising from agriculture operations would be made by the seller in accordance with Ordinance No. 510 (right to farm ordinance). Inconveniences or discomforts may include, but are not limited to, exposure to herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, rodenticides, and fertilizers, and generation of dust, smoke, noise, and odor. Full disclosure would be made to the buyer and in County documents (building permits, etc.). Seller and County Clerk would obtain and keep copies of the buyer-signed disclosure statement. The notice would allow purchasers to take steps to minimize outdoor activities during crop-dusting periods. Although this would not reduce impacts, the measure would inform prospective buyers or renters of the inconveniences and allow them to use the knowledge in their decision of buying or renting a home.
Mitigation Measure HHM-3b: Encourage aerial application operators to takeoff to the south and land to the north when weather conditions permit.

See Mitigation Measure N-4c. This measure would reduce direct overflights of the sensitive uses in the project area; however, it would not be feasible for the reasons identified under Mitigation Measure N-4c.
Mitigation Measure HHM-3c: Encourage aerial application operators to make early turns (left or right) during Runway 31 departures (northbound take-offs).
See Mitigation Measure N-4d. This measure could reduce overflights of sensitive areas, depending on the specific turn locations; however, it would not be feasible for the reasons identified under Mitigation Measure N-4d.

Mitigation Measure HHM-3d: Encourage straight-out departures for Runway 31 operations (northbound
take-offs).

See Mitigation Measure N-4e. This measure would reduce direct overflights of the sensitive uses in the project area; however, it would not be feasible for the reasons identified under Mitigation Measure N-4e.

Environmental Impact Report 4-133

General Plan and Zoning Amendment

Mitigation Measure HHM-3e: Require aerial application operators to comply with Federal Aviation Administration regulations for operations over congested areas, prohibiting loaded aircraft from overflying the development area at low altitudes.
See Mitigation Measure N-4g. This measure would reduce direct overflights of the sensitive uses in the project area; however, it would not be feasible for the reasons identified under Mitigation Measure N-4g.
Significance Level After Mitigation: Significant and unavoidable because the mitigation measures would not reduce safety concerns associated with routine crop-dusting operations.
Impact HHM-4: Road improvements associated with the project would have a minimal effect on emergency access.

Roadway improvements would consist of expanding Farinon Road through the project area to Wescott Road, realigning Farinon Road out of the airport property, extending Davison Drive from the existing office buildings to the proposed highway commercial uses, and terminating Sunrise Boulevard at a cul- de-sac west of the commercial/office space. These road improvements would improve access to the project area and facilitate increased project traffic as well as improve response times of emergency service vehicles.

The extension of Farinon Road to Wescott Road would provide alternate access to and from Colusa for
emergency purposes as well as for project traffic. The Sacramento River Fire District would be the first to
respond to emergencies in the project area, including rescue, hazardous material spills, EMS, and fire
protection. The improvements do not appear to conflict with the current adopted emergency response plans, according to a personal communication with the Fire Chief (Winters 2007). With a current average response time of seven to nine minutes to the project area, these road extensions would likely improve the
Fire District's
2007). response time to be closer to the target response time of three to four minutes (Winters

The project's road improvements would improve access to and through the project area and would not interfere with emergency response, resulting in less than significant impact.
Significance Level: Less than significant because the project's road improvements would improve emergency response to the project area.
Impact HHM-5: Project residents and structures may be exposed to flooding from increased flows
in the unnamed ditch during major storm events.
Although the project area is not located in a 100-year flood zone as identified by FEMA flood maps (2006), major storm events can cause the unnamed ditch in the project area to overflow and flood adjacent lands (Hackney 2007). Development of the project area would increase impervious surfaces and increase surface runoff, resulting in increased flows in the ditch. The ditch would have capacity to receive these additional flows during normal storm events, as discussed in Section 4.8 (Hydrology and Water Quality). However, occasional flooding may occur in portions of the development area as a result of stormwater exceeding the capacity of downstream facilities, such as the Colusa Basin Drain, and forcing flows back into the unnamed ditch. Flooding in the development area would expose project residents, visitors, and workers to safety concerns, and buildings could be damaged. This would be a significant impact.
Significance Level Before Mitigation: Significant.

Environmental Impact Report 4-134

General Plan and Zoning Amendment Impact Analysis Colusa Industrial Properties
Mitigation Measure HHM-5: Maintain, and widen as necessary, the unnamed ditch from the southern end of the development to the Park boundary.
Implement Mitigation Measure HWQ-2a.
Significance Level After Mitigation: Less than significant because improvements to the unnamed ditch would reduce the potential for flooding in the development area.

Significant and Unavoidable Impacts
Impact HHM-3: Airport operations would expose project residents, visitors, and workers to health and safety risks associated with routine crop-dusting.

4.11 BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES
This section describes the biological resources of the project area and identifies the potential for special status species to occur in the project area. The section is based on the biological resources assessment prepared for the project (Appendix G). The impact analysis discusses the potential for the project to affect biological resources, particularly sensitive resources.

4.11.1 Setting

Regulatory Setting

Federal
The Federal Endangered Species Act (ESA, 16 United States Code (USC) 1531 et seq.) protects threatened and endangered plants and animals and their critical habitat. Procedures for addressing impacts to federally listed species follow two principal pathways, both of which require consultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), which administers the Act for all terrestrial species. The first pathway,
Section 10(a) incidental take permit, applies when a private landowner's actions result in take of a listed species, but do not require a federal permit or approval. The second pathway, Section 7 consultation, applies to projects directly undertaken by a federal agency or private projects requiring : federal permit or approval, when these projects may adversely affect a listed species or modify critical habitat.
The Migratory Bird Treaty Act (16 USC 703 et seq.) implements international treaties between the United States and other nations devised to protect migratory birds, their parts, eggs, and nests from activities such as hunting, pursuing, capturing, killing, selling, and shipping, unless expressly authorized in the regulations or by permit. The State of California has incorporated the protection of birds of prey in Sections 3800, 3513, and 3503.5 of the Fish and Game Code (FGC).

All raptors and their nests are protected from take or disturbance under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and California statute (FGC Sec. 3503.5). The golden eagle is also afforded additional protection under the Eagle Protection Act, amended in 1973 (16 USC 669 et seq.).
Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (33 USC 1344 et seq.) prohibits the discharge of dredged or fill material into "waters of the United States" without a permit from the USACE. The USACE and the EPA

Environmental Impact Report 4-135

General Plan and Zoning Amendment
Impact Analysis Colusa Industrial Properties
administer the Act. In addition to streams with a defined bed and bank, the definition of waters of the U.S. includes wetland areas in or adjacent to jurisdictional waters "that are inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do a support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions" (33 CFR 328.3
7b).

Projects with substantial impacts to waters of the U.S. may require an individual permit. Small-scale projects with minimal impacts may be authorized by nationwide permits, which have an expedited process compared to the individual permit process. Mitigation of wetland impacts is required as a condition of the Section 404 permit and may include on-site preservation, restoration, or enhancement or offsite restoration or enhancement. The characteristics of the restored or enhanced wetlands must be
to or better than those of the affected wetlands to achieve no net loss of wetlands. equal

State
The California Endangered Species Act (CESA, FGC 2050 et seq.) provides protection to California's endangered and threatened species. Section 2080 of the FGC prohibits the taking of plants and animals listed under the California Endangered Species Act. Section 2081 established an incidental take permit program for state-listed species. In addition, the Native Plant Protection Act of 1977 (FGC 1900 et seq.) gives the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) authority to designate state endangered, threatened, and rare plants and provides specific protection measures for designated populations.
The CDFG has also identified many "species of special concern.' Species with this status have limited distribution or the extent of their habitats has been reduced substantially, such that their populations may be threatened. While they do not have statutory protection, impacts to these species are typically considered significant in the CEQA review process, requiring mitigation when feasible.
Also, sensitive species that would qualify for listing but are not currently listed are afforded protection under CEQA. The CEQA Guidelines Section 15065 ("Mandatory Findings of Significance") requires that a substantial reduction in numbers of a rare or endangered species be considered a significant effect. CEQA Guidelines Section 15380 ("Rare or Endangered Species") provides for assessment of unlisted species as rare or endangered under CEQA if the species can be shown to meet the criteria for listing.
FGC Secs. 1601 to 1606 require that a Notification of Lake or Streambed Alteration be submitted to the CDFG for "any activity that may substantially divert or obstruct the natural flow or substantially change the bed, channel, or bank of any river, stream, or lake." The CDFG reviews the proposed actions and, if necessary, submits to the applicant a proposal for measures to protect affected fish and wildlife resources. The final proposal that is mutually agreed upon by the CDFG and the applicant is the Lake or Streambed Alteration Agreement. Projects that require a Lake or Streambed Alteration Agreement may also require a permit from the USACE under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act.
FGC Secs. 3500 to 5500 outline protection for fully protected species of mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish. Species that are fully protected by these Sections may not be taken or possessed at any time. The CDFG cannot issue Sec. 2081 permits that would authorize the incidental take of a fully protected species. Specific sections of the FGC pertinent to the current project include:
Section 3503 (which prohibits the taking, possession, or needless destruction of the nest or eggs of any bird);

Environmental Impact Report 4-136

General Plan and Zoning Amendment

Section 3503.5 (which prohibits the taking, possession, or destruction of any bird in the order Falconiformes or Strigiformes (birds-of-prey) or the taking, possession, or destruction of the nest or eggs of any such bird); and
Section 3513 (which prohibits the taking or possession of any migratory non-game bird as designated in the Migratory Bird Treaty Act).

Local
The Colusa County General Plan (1989) identifies goals and policies to protect and preserve the county's open space character and natural resources. The Open Space and Conservation Elements discuss goals to preserve lands as open space and maintain their quality for future generations. Several areas of the County have been preserved for resource protection, including National Wildlife Refuges, National Forest lands, and riparian communities. These lands provide high quality habitat for a variety of wildlife species, particularly waterfowl and geese during the migration seasons.

Environmental Setting
The project area is located in the Central Valley and historically contained annual grasslands and possibly freshwater marshes and seasonal wetlands or vernal pools. Much of this habitat has been converted for agricultural use in Colusa County, as is evident in the project area. is Wildlife is not abundant in the project area, possibly due to the nearby developed areas and the low quality of the habitats. Limited foraging habitat is available on the fallow agricultural fields, but little to no nesting habitat is present.

Vegetation and Habitats
The dominant habitat in the project area is weed-infested fields previously used for agricultural production (approximately 93 acres). The remainder of the project area is generally disturbed and includes developed areas, habitat consisting primarily of weedy or invasive plant species (i.e., ruderal), a detention pond (under construction at the time of the field survey), two wastewater ponds, agricultural fields, and a ditch. Adjacent lands include agricultural fields, residential development, industrial development, and a golf course. Table 4.11-1 provides a breakdown of the acreage of each habitat type in the project area. Figure 4.11-1 shows the locations of each habitat type within the project area.

The development area consists of developed land and unused agricultural fields, which have not been in production since before the Park was established in the early 1980s. The project area was historically valley grassland habitat before being used for agriculture and development (Colusa County 1981). Species documented on site in the early 1980s and in the unused agriculture fields in 2005 (ECO- ANALYSTS 2005) include non-native, invasive plants, such as Russian thistle (Salsola sp.), mustard (Brassica sp.), yellow star thistle (Centaurea solsitialis), dock (Rumex sp.), filaree (Erodium sp.), and foxtail barley (Hordeum jubatum). These species continue to dominate the fields in the development area, and the fields are regularly disked to control the invasive plants. Native trees, such as oaks (Quercus spp.) and cottonwoods (Populus sp.), have been planted in the office complex area and are present on the golf
course.

An unnamed ditch traverses the central portion of the project area from north to south. It conveys runoff from the eastern portion of the City of Colusa and the adjacent golf course and directs it to the Colusa Drain, about 3.5 miles southwest of the project area. Site runoff during storm events and drainage from the existing offices also flow into the ditch via a system of storm drains. Water was present in the upper portion of the ditch (north of Sunrise Boulevard) during the field visit in September 2006. Vegetation in and around the ditch includes cattails (Typha sp.), bulrush (Scirpus sp.), and various invasive plants, such as those identified above. A few valley oaks (Quercus lobata) are present along the ditch north of the project area and near Farinon Road. The vegetation along the ditch is of low quality to wildlife because it consists primarily of weedy species and is not very dense. Although habitat in the ditch may be suitable for some wildlife species, the ditch is cleared of vegetation every few years to regulate flows and control invasive plants (Bolen 2006).
The detention pond consists of an unlined basin, about 5.3 acres in size, just east of the ditch. This basin
was cleared of vegetation and did not contain water at the time of the field survey in 2006.

Two wastewater ponds are located in the southern portion of the project area. One pond is lined and is
used as an evaporation pond for domestic grey water. This pond does not support vegetation, but it contained a small amount of water at the time of the field survey in 2007. The second pond is unlined and used for emergency storage of industrial process wastewater. It was dry at the time of the field survey in 2007 and contained some weedy plants around the edges. The ditch conveys flows to the south, just east of the ponds, but the ponds do not contribute water to the ditch.
Land to the south of the wastewater ponds contains agricultural fields used for rice crops and sudan grass. The 34-acre site is used for land application of industrial process wastewater and is supplemented with flows from the Park's groundwater wells, when crop production is needed. Another 500+ acres of land to the south of the project area, within the Park, is also used for rice production. The fields provide forage for a variety of wildlife.

Wildlife
Wildlife in the project area is scarce. Songbirds were observed in the trees around the office complex, but no wildlife species were encountered in the old fields or ditch. A variety of water birds, including egrets, ducks, and geese, utilize the rice fields south and west of the project area. Migratory birds and other species may pass over or through the project area in search of food, habitat, or other resources. A variety of wildlife likely utilizes the habitats along the nearby Sacramento River; however, the project area does not provide similar types of habitat favored by riparian or wetland species. Species would be expected to stop briefly in the project area in search of food and then continue on to more suitable habitat.

Environmental Impact Report 4-141

General Plan and Zoning Amendment

The ditch, fields, and nearby golf course may provide resting habitat for waterfowl or other migratory birds during spring and fall migrations. Permanent and intermittent water sources are often utilized by waterfowl for brief periods, as they pass over an area. The ditch in the project area, however, does not
contain sufficient vegetative cover suitable for nesting. The detention pond east of the ditch is not expected to attract wildlife because it will only hold water for short periods of time (during and after major storm events). The detention pond serves as temporary facility to detain large amounts of run-off until the ditch can drain downstream or be pumped.

Special Status Biological Resources
Twenty-one special status species and five sensitive habitats have documented occurrences within 10 miles of the project area. Another five federally listed wildlife have documented occurrences in the project vicinity (within the Meridian or Colusa quadrangles, Appendix G). Of the 26 special status species (8 plants; 18 wildlife), four wildlife species have marginally suitable habitat in the project area. Suitable habitat for the other wildlife species and for each of the plant species is not present in the project area. Also, none of the sensitive habitats occurs in the project area based on habitat descriptions and the low quality of the habitats in the project area. Brief descriptions of the species with moderate potential to occur in the project area are provided below. Although the species have potential to occur, high quality habitat is not present in the project area and may preclude the species from being present. Appendix G provides additional information on the special status species and sensitive habitats with nearby
occurrences.

The giant garter snake (Thamnophis gigas) is listed as threatened under the ESA and CESA. Habitat requirements for this species include adequate water during its activity season that supports its prey base (small fishes, tadpoles, and frogs); emergent, herbaceous wetland vegetation (such as cattails and bulrushes); grassy banks and openings in waterside vegetation for basking; and upland habitat for cover and refuge during inactivity in the winter. The giant garter snake inhabits agricultural wetlands and other waterways such as irrigation and drainage canals, sloughs, ponds, small lakes, low gradient streams, and adjacent uplands in the Central Valley. The nearest occurrence of giant garter snake is 7 miles to the south of the project area, along Colusa Trough (CDFG 2006). This species may utilize the ditch in the project area in search of other suitable habitat, but it is not expected to breed or spend long periods of time in the project area due to the low quality of the habitat in and around the ditch.
Tricolored blackbird (Agelaius tricolor) is species of special concern in California. Colony locations are tracked in the California Natural Diversity Database (CNDDB) because they are essential to protecting the species. Tricolored blackbirds nest in colonies that can range from several pairs to several thousand pairs, which may be dependant upon prey availability, predators, or human disturbance. Nesting habitat consists of emergent marsh, riparian thickets, and brambles with saturated soils nearby. These species are often observed foraging in agricultural fields and ditches. The nearest CNDDB occurrence is in the rice fields in the extreme southwest corner of the industrial park. This species could utilize the fields in the project area for foraging, but it is not expected to nest on-site due to a lack of marsh and riparian habitats.
Aleutian Canada goose (Branta canadensis leucopareia) was federally delisted in 2001 after being listed as endangered in 1967 and downlisted to threatened in 1990. This goose is a subspecies of the Canada goose that nests in the Aleutian Islands. They spend the winter in the Central Valley before traveling to the islands in the spring. The nearest CNDDB occurrence is approximately 2 miles to the northeast along the Sacramento River. This species may utilize the agricultural fields in the project area and vicinity for foraging during the winter.

Swainson's hawk (Buteo swainsoni) is listed as threatened under CESA. The preferred breeding habitat of this raptor consists of large trees near extensive areas of grassland or open fields. The trees serve as nesting sites, and the grasslands and open fields provide foraging habitat. Grasslands and agricultural lands (with the exception of orchards and vineyards) provide suitable foraging habitat for this species. The nearest occurrence of Swainson's hawk is 2 miles to the north of the project area, along the Sacramento River (CDFG 2006). Several nesting occurrences have been documented along the Sacramento River from the early 2000s, but the most recent nest site recorded by the CNDDB is from
2003 (CDFG 2006). Swainson's hawks were observed flying over nearby agricultural fields in September 2006 during the field visit. This species could utilize the fields in the project area for foraging, but it is not expected to nest on-site a due to a lack of large trees.

4.11.2 Impact Analysis

Methodology
Biological resources in the project area were described based on available literature, a database search, site visits, and habitat mapping. Literature reviewed during preparation of the section included previous EIRs prepared for the Park (Colusa County 1981 and 1992) and the Colusa County General Plan (Colusa County 1989). The California Natural Diversity Database (last updated September 5, 2006) was queried to develop a list of special-status species and sensitive habitats with potential to occur in the project area (species with known occurrences within 10 miles). A field reconnaissance was conducted on September 19, 2006 and again on January 23, 2007 to collect information on biological resources in the project area. Habitats in the project area were mapped using data digitized from the field visit.
The impact analysis focused on those special status species with potential to occur in the project area and be affected by project activities. The loss of habitat was quantified using the habitat maps, and the effects of this loss were determined based on the species that could occur in the project area.

Criteria for Determining Significance
Adverse impacts to biological resources would be considered significant if the project would:
Substantially reduce the habitat of a fish or wildlife species.
Cause a fish or wildlife population to drop below self-sustaining levels.
Threaten to eliminate a plant or animal community.
Substantially reduce the number or restrict the range of an endangered, rare, or threatened
species.
Have a substantial adverse effect, either directly or through habitat modifications, on any species identified as a candidate, sensitive, or special status species in local or regional plans, policies, or regulations, or by the CDFG or FWS.
Have a substantial adverse effect on any riparian habitat or other sensitive natural community
identified in local or regional plans, policies, regulations or by the CDFG or FWS.
Have a substantial adverse effect on federally protected wetlands as defined by Section 404 of the
Clean Water Act (including vernal pool, seasonal wetlands and ponds) through direct removal, filling, hydrological interruption, or other means.

Interfere substantially with the movement of any native resident or migratory fish or wildlife species or with established native resident or migratory wildlife corridors, or impede the use of native wildlife nursery sites.
Conflict with any local policies or ordinances protecting biological resources.

Impacts and Mitigation Measures
Impact BR-1: Development of the project area would result in a loss of low quality foraging habitat, including 93 acres of former agricultural fields, 23 acres of disturbed habitat, two acres of active
agricultural fields, and 0.7 acre of oak trees.
The habitats in the project area provide low quality foraging habitat for wildlife species; none of the habitats are suitable for nesting. Former agricultural fields and disturbed habitat (consisting mostly of weedy species) would be converted to residential, commercial, and recreational uses as part of the project,
affecting approximately 93 acres of fields and 23 acres of disturbed habitat. Less than two acres of active agricultural fields would be affected by expansion of Farinon Road from the development area to Wescott Road. A few oak trees would be removed to accommodate single-family homes. The loss of old fields, a disturbed habitat, a small amount of agricultural fields, and a few trees would be less than significant because these habitats are low quality and do not support a diversity of wildlife species or native plant species.

Significance Level: Less than significant because the loss of low quality foraging habitat would have a minimal impact on biological resources.
Impact BR-2: Construction of the wastewater treatment plant would result in the loss of one acre of
agricultural fields.
The agricultural fields in the project area provide foraging habitat for a variety of wildlife species, including migratory birds and possibly sensitive species. The wastewater treatment plant would be located within a 34-acre active agricultural field currently used for rice straw and sudan grass crops. Construction of the plant would disturb less than one acre of the field and would not result in a substantial loss of
foraging habitat or agricultural fields. This impact would be less than significant.
Significance Level: Less than significant because the loss of one acre of foraging habitat would have a minimal impact on biological resources.

Impact BR-3: Construction activities may result in discharge of sediment into the unnamed ditch
and could adversely affect low quality habitat within the ditch.
Construction activities would not result in direct impacts to the ditch, such as placement of dredge or fill material or modification of the ditch. The ditch and wetland habitat (some cattails and bulrush) would not
be developed or altered as part of the project, and the ditch would continue to be used to drain run-off from the project area. Access to the land west of the ditch would be obtained using existing roads that cross over the ditch. Indirect impacts from soil erosion and runoff could result in discharge of sediments
into the surface water in the ditch (see Section 4.8 Hydrology and Water Quality). This could affect water quality and the small amount of habitat in the ditch. Because of the low quality of habitat in the ditch, impacts from construction activities would be less than significant.

Significance Level Before Mitigation: Less than significant.

Environmental Impact Report 4-144

General Plan and Zoning Amendment

Mitigation Measure BR-3: Implement best management practices to control construction-related stormwater runoff, erosion, and sedimentation.

Implement Mitigation Measure HWQ-1.

Significance Level After Mitigation: Less than significant because water quality impacts in the unnamed ditch would have minimal effects on biological resources.
Impact BR-4: Construction activities inay temporarily disturb wildlife in the project vicinity, but impacts would not be substantial.
The use of heavy equipment during construction activities would produce noise and ground vibrations that could disturb wildlife in the immediate area (project area and adjacent agricultural fields/grazing lands). Wildlife utilizing the Sacramento River would not be affected by construction activities due to the
distance of the river from the project area. Common species, such as rodents, lizards and snakes, may be present in the fields at the time of construction and could be harmed by equipment and ground
disturbance. Migratory or sensitive birds, such as the Aleutian Canada goose and tricolored blackbird,
may be present in the agricultural fields during construction and could be adversely affected by noise and human disturbances. Impacts to wildlife would be temporary and less than significant because sensitive species populations would not be affected (see Impacts BR-5 and BR-6).
Significance Level: Less than significant because temporary construction disturbances would not be
substantial.

Impact BR-5: Construction activities would have minimal impacts on the giant garter snake, if it is present in the ditch, and other species utilizing the unnamed ditch.
Although the project would not involve direct impacts to the ditch, construction on the adjacent land would produce noise and ground vibrations that could disturb species utilizing the ditch, such as the giant garter snake. If present, the garter snake would likely be using the ditch as a travel corridor and not for breeding, and construction disturbance would have a minimal impact on the species. The disturbance would force species to move further upstream or downstream along the ditch. Development of the adjacent lands would also remove low quality habitat for the giant garter snake; however, the golf course expansion could create additional water or wetland habitat for the snake if it passes through the area. Because of the low quality of habitat in and around the ditch, impacts to the giant garter snake would be
less than significant.

Significance Level: Less than significant because construction activities would have minimal effects
on species utilizing the unnamed ditch.
Impact BR-6: Construction activities would have a minimal effect on Swainson's hawk, and development of the project area would remove low quality foraging habitat.
The project would not result in a loss of nesting habitat for the Swainson's hawk; however, it would result in the loss of foraging habitat within five miles of known nest sites along the Sacramento River. Use of
heavy equipment, as discussed under Impact BR-4, would result in ground disturbance and noise that could adversely affect Swainson's hawk if it is present at the time of the activities. Construction impacts are considered minimal, however, because hawks would likely avoid the area and utilize nearby suitable habitat, such as the agricultural fields to the east of the project area across SR 20, if they are in the area at the time of construction, Development of the site would result in the loss of disturbed (ruderal) fields that could provide foraging habitat and a prey base for nearby nesting pairs. However, the fields are

surrounded on three sides by development (golf course and residential homes to the north; offices to the east; and industrial and airport uses to the south) and likely provide low quality foraging habitat for Swainson's hawks in comparison to the agricultural fields west of the project area and east of SR 20. Due to the low quality of the habitats in the project area and ability of the Swainson's hawk to use other nearby fields and open space for foraging, impacts would be less than significant.
Significance Level: Less than significant because the loss of low quality foraging habitat would have a minimal effect on Swainson's hawk.

Significant and Unavoidable Impacts
None.

4.12 AGRICULTURAL RESOURCES
This section describes the existing agricultural setting of the project area and vicinity. The impact analysis discusses the potential for direct and indirect impacts to agricultural resources. Mitigation measures are identified for significant impacts, followed by determinations of the residual impact significance after mitigation measures are implemented.

4.12.1 Setting

Regulatory Setting
The California Department of Conservation's (CDC's) Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Program (FMMP) produces maps and statistical data used for analyzing impacts on California's agricultural resources. Agricultural land is rated according to soil quality and irrigation status; the best quality land is called Prime Farmland. The maps are updated every two years with the use of aerial photographs, a computer mapping system, public review, and field reconnaissance. Colusa County's agricultural lands
were last reviewed in 2004.

The FMMP uses seven categories to classify land based on its physical and chemical characteristics for the production of crops, including water capacity, soil temperature, acid-alkali balance, water table, soil
sodium content, flooding, erodibility, permeability, rock fragment content, and rooting depth (CDC 2006). Descriptions of the important farmland are provided below:
Prime Farmland: Irrigated land with the best combination of physical and chemical characteristics for the production of crops. It has the soil quality, growing season, and moisture supply needed to produce sustained high yields of crops when treated and managed, including water management, according to current farming methods. This land has the soil quality, growing season, and moisture supply needed to produce sustained high yields. Prime Farmland must have been used for production of irrigated crops at some time during the four years prior to the mapping date. It does not include publicly owned lands for which there is an adopted policy preventing agricultural use.
Unique Farmland: Lesser quality soils used for the production of the state's leading agricultural crops. It has the special combination of soil quality, location, growing season, and moisture supply needed to produce sustained high quality or high yields of a specific crop when treated and

Environmental Impact Report 4-146

General Plan and Zoning Amendment

managed according to current farming methods. Examples of such crops may include oranges, olives, avocados, rice, grapes, and cut flowers. This land is usually irrigated, but may include non-irrigated orchards or vineyards as found in some climatic zones in California. Land must have been used for production at some time during the four years prior to the mapping date. It does not include publicly owned lands for which there is an adopted policy preventing agricultural use.
Farmland of Statewide Importance: Land other than Prime Farmland that has a good combination of physical and chemical characteristics for the production of crops. This land has minor shortcomings, such as greater slopes or less ability to store soil moisture than Prime Farmland. Land must have been used for production of irrigated crops at some time during the four years prior to the mapping date. It does not include publicly owned lands for which there is an adopted policy preventing agricultural use.
Farmland of Local Importance: Farmlands that have physical characteristics that would qualify for Prime or Statewide except for the lack of irrigation water. This land includes soils that qualify for Prime Farmland or Farmland of Statewide Importance, but generally are not cultivated or irrigated. Farmland of Local Importance is either currently producing crops, has the capability of production, or is used for the production of confined livestock. This land may be important to the local economy due to its productivity or value. It does not include publicly owned lands for which there is an adopted policy preventing agricultural use. Also, farmlands that produce crops are not listed under Unique but are important to the economy of the county or city. Farmland of Local Importance was initially identified by a local advisory committee set up by the Soil Conservation Service in each county. Authority to recommend changes to the category now rests with the County Board of Supervisors.
The Colusa County General Plan (1989) contains several policies to protect and preserve agricultural lands, including prime soils. The County classifies agricultural lands into three categories:

Lands capable of supporting grazing based on resource characteristics (soils, climate, and access
to water)
Lands capable of supporting crop production (in current production, based on resource characteristics listed above, or with prime soils)
Agricultural lands within a community's sphere of influence or ultimate growth area
The Land Use, Community Plan, Resource Conservation, and Open Space and Recreation Elements of the General Plan provide measures to protect the integrity of agriculture and preserve agricultural areas outside of designated communities. Agriculture is the County's most distinguishing feature because it establishes the rural environment and character enjoyed by the residents. Policies established in the General Plan are designed to preserve and protect agricultural lands and ensure continued agricultural production while allowing development in and adjacent to established communities and service district
areas.

Colusa County LAFCO seeks to preserve open space and agricultural lands through its Policies, Standards, and Procedures (LAFCO Resolution 2004-1, adopted February 5, 2004). Development projects must demonstrate planned, orderly, and efficient development if conversion of open space or agricultural lands is required. Effects on adjacent agricultural lands is also considered. As part of LAFCO review, the consideration of conservation easements and agricultural buffers should be evaluated to reduce or avoid impacts on agricultural lands. Agricultural buffers normally include open space areas between a development and agricultural lands. This buffer may be up to 300 feet wide and should include additional features, such as walls, fencing, or landscaping, for smaller buffers to reduce conflicts with the adjacent land (Benoit 2007).

Environmental Impact Report 4-147

General Plan and Zoning Amendment
Impact Analysis Colusa Industrial Properties

LAFCO policies use the definition of prime agricultural land provided in the California Government
Code, Section 56064. The code defines "prime agricultural land" as:
an area of land, whether a single parcel or contiguous parcels, that has not been developed for a use other than an agricultural use and that meets any of the following
qualifications:

(a) Land that qualifies, if irrigated, for rating as class I or class II in the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service land use capability classification, whether or not land is actually irrigated, provided that irrigation is feasible.

(b) Land that qualifies for rating 80 through 100 Storie Index Rating.

(c) Land that supports livestock used for the production of food and fiber and that has an annual carrying capacity equivalent to at least one animal unit per acre as defined by the United States Department of Agriculture in the National Handbook on Range and Related Grazing Lands, July, 1967, developed pursuant to Public Law 46, December 1935.

(d) Land planted with fruit or nut-bearing trees, vines, bushes, or crops that have a nonbearing period of less than five years and that will return during the commercial bearing period on an annual basis from the production of unprocessed agricultural plant production not less than four hundred dollars ($400) per acre.

(e) Land that has returned from the production of unprocessed agricultural plant products an annual gross value of not less than four hundred dollars ($400) per acre for three of the
previous five calendar years.

Colusa County adopted Ordinance No. 510 (right to farm ordinance) in February 1990. The ordinance promotes the general health, safety, and welfare of the County, establishes goals to preserve and protect lands zoned for agricultural use, and encourages continued agricultural operations. Disclosure statements
identifying that the property may be subject to inconvenience or discomfort from agricultural uses will be required in any County document (evidencing the sale, purchase, transfer, or lease of real property) and by the seller of the property. The ordinance is intended to limit nuisance litigation regarding agriculture or affecting agriculture activities; however, such ordinances have limited effectiveness in eliminating
conflicts.

Environmental Setting
Colusa County is a rural county dependent on agriculture as its primary source of revenue. In 2004, the County was ranked 21st in the state based on the value of its agricultural production, which was more than $351 million (California Farm Bureau Federation 2006). Rice is the primary agricultural crop; other types of crops include wheat, almonds, processing tomatoes, and rice seed.
Land surrounding the project area and the Park consists of active farmland and grazing land as well as developed or built-up land (Figure 4.12-1). Lands to the west have been classified as Prime and Unique Farmland by the FMMP (CDC 2004); these lands are used for rotation crops, including onions, wheat, cotton, and other crops. An approximate 500-foot-wide strip of land adjacent to the western project

boundary has not been used for row crops, based on aerial photographs dating back to 1998 (see Figure 4.11-1). This land may be capable of agricultural production, but currently serves as a buffer between the project area and the agricultural crops further west. Lands to the east have been classified as Farmland of Local Importance (adjacent to the project area) and as Prime and Unique Farmland (along the Sacramento River) according to the FMMP (CDC 2004). Adjacent land to the east is part of the Dolan Preserve, which is used for grazing cattle. Other nearby lands are used for rice and seed rice production.

Land within the Park was previously used for rice and wheat production; however, most of the land has been unused since the early 1980s. According to the FMMP, the land within the project area is classified is as Prime Farmland, Unique Farmland, Farmland of Local Importance, Grazing Land, and developed or Urban and Built-up Land (Figure 4.12-1; CDC 2004). Most of the development area is considered suitable for grazing (97.6 acres, Table 4.12-1), and small portion (27.4 acres) is considered suitable for agricultural production, except for the lack of irrigation water.
The development area contains old fields that have become dominated by invasive plants and are regularly disked to control weeds. The site is not currently used for grazing or other agriculture-related uses. Based on the soils in the development area (Colusa loam and Grandbend loam) and the land's past uses, the land is not considered prime agricultural land using LAFCO's definition. Colusa loam has an estimated Storie Index rating of 8 and is considered a class IV soil based on the NRCS land use capability classification, which means it is not suitable for agriculture (NRCS 2006). Grandbend loam has a Storie Index rating of 70 and is considered a class II soil if irrigated (NRCS 2006), which would have moderate limitations for agricultural productivity; however, the soil is not currently irrigated (no infrastructure in place) and has not been used for agricultural production for more than 20 years.
The wastewater facilities site contains mostly Unique Farmland (30 acres), with a small amount of Prime Farmland (1 acre) and some Built-up Land (9 acres where the disposal ponds occur) according to the FMMP (CDC 2004). Thirty acres of the land are reserved for disposal of industrial process wastewater for
agricultural crops (sudan grass), although less than 5 acres were used in 2006 (Hulbert 2006). The primary soil at the wastewater facilities site is Colusa loam, which is not considered suitable for
agricultural production; however, portions of the land have been used for crop production. Based on the soil characteristics, crop type, and small amount of land under production, the site would not likely meet the LAFCO definition of prime agricultural land.

4.12.2 Impact Analysis

Methodology
The impact analysis involved a review of FMMP data and maps showing the agricultural classifications of the project area and surrounding lands and a site visit to identify existing conditions and uses in the project vicinity. The ability of the undeveloped land to be capable of agricultural production was reviewed to assess the significance of impacts.

Environmental Impact Report 4-152

General Plan and Zoning Amendment
Impact Analysis Colusa Industrial Properties

Criteria for Determining Significance
Adverse impacts to agricultural resources would be considered significant if the project would:
Convert a substantial amount of Prime Farmland, Unique Farmland, or Farmland of Statewide Importance, as shown on the maps prepared pursuant to the Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Program of the California Resources Agency, or convert prime agricultural land, as defined by Section 56064 of the Government Code, to non-agricultural use.
Involve other changes in the existing environment, which, due to their location or nature, could
result in conversion of farmland to non-agricultural use.
Impair agricultural productivity or use of neighboring areas.
Result in cumulative loss of farmland, as defined above, on neighboring lands.

Impacts and Mitigation Measures
Impact AR-1: Development of the project area would result in the conversion of less than two acres of Prime Farmland, 27 acres of Farmland of Local Importance, and 98 acres of Grazing Land to non-agricultural uses, but would not result in a loss of agricultural productivity in the project area.
Development of the mixed use community would result in the conversion of approximately 27 acres of Farmland of Local Importance and 98 acres of Grazing Land (CDC 2004) to non-agricultural uses (residential, commercial, and recreational). The locations of these farmland classifications are shown on Figure 4.12-1. Conversion of these lands would prevent them from being used for agricultural production in the future; however, the lands are considered of low value for agricultural use based on their classifications and current conditions (lack of irrigation, presence of invasive or weedy plants, and lack of use for agriculture for more than 20 years). The Farinon Road extension from the development area to Wescott Road would result in the loss of less than two acres of Prime Farmland. This impact would result in a minor loss of active farmland; however, the road corridor is currently owned by CIP and was acquired for the purpose of constructing a road. The project a would have a minimal effect on agricultural productivity in the County as a result of the loss of Prime Farmland, Farmland of Local Importance, and Grazing Land; therefore direct impacts to agricultural lands in the development area would be less than significant.

Significance Level: Less than significant because the loss of agricultural lands in the project area would have minimal effect on agricultural productivity in Colusa County.
Impact AR-2: Construction of the wastewater treatment plant would result in the conversion of one acre of Unique Farmland to non-agricultural uses and would result in a minimal loss of agricultural productivity in the project area.
The wastewater treatment plant would be located on land classified as Unique Farmland by the FMMP (CDC 2004). Construction of the plant would result in the loss of one acre of Unique Farmland. The remaining land at the wastewater facilities site would be used for disposal of tertiary effluent (treated domestic wastewater) and would be used to irrigate sudan grass or other similar crops. This land would not be removed from agricultural production. Because of the small amount of agricultural land that would
be converted, impacts from the wastewater treatment facilities on Important Farmland and agricultural
productivity in Colusa County would be less than significant.
Significance Level: Less than significant because the wastewater treatment plant would result in a
minimal loss of agricultural productivity in Colusa County.

Environmental Impact Report 4-153

General Plan and Zoning Amendment
Impact Analysis Colusa Industrial Properties

Impact AR-3: Development in the project area would increase agricultural-residential conflicts and could reduce productivity of adjacent agricultural lands.
Development of the project area would result in a residential population and a commercial center that attracts visitors and provides employment opportunities for residents. Indirect effects of the development may include:

Unauthorized access on adjacent agricultural lands, which could adversely affect crop production, disturb cattle, or result in vandalism;
Limits on aerial spraying of pesticides;
Modifications to flight paths of crop-dusting planes;
Limitations on using equipment, such as night harvesting or early morning use only;
Conflicts between project vehicles and slow-moving farm vehicles and equipment.
The project would include a 100-foot open space buffer between the low-density residential homes and the land to the west (zoned for agriculture) to provide a transition between the two uses. The existing non- agricultural strip of land between the proposed residential uses and row crops on the adjacent parcel to the
west would also serve as a buffer between the two uses, which would reduce conflicts. Residential uses adjacent to agricultural uses may result in resident complaints related to aerial spraying and harvesting activities (health concerns, odor, noise), which could place limitations on these activities and reduce productivity. The project's overflight corridor would require some crop-dusting planes to slightly modify their flight path (turn west further south of current path). Although this may cause safety concerns for the planes (see Section 4.4), crop-dusting activities would continue.
Grazing lands to the east of the development area are separated by the highway (SR 20), so land use conflicts with these lands are not anticipated.
Project traffic on nearby local roads may also create conflicts with agricultural traffic, which could result in accidents. As discussed in Section 4.4 (Transportation and Traffic), the project's road improvements would improve access and circulation and minimize conflicts.
Because of the potential for conflicts between agricultural lands to the west and the project's residential land uses, the project could reduce agricultural productivity of adjacent lands, resulting in a significant impact

Significance Level Before Mitigation: Significant.
Mitigation Measure AR-3a: Construct a wall along western project boundary to provide a barrier between residences and agricultural uses.
The County will require the applicant to construct a minimum 6-foot tall wall along the western border of the low density residential uses to minimize conflicts with adjacent agricultural lands. The wall will be constructed along the border of the residential properties, between the homes and the open space buffer. The open space buffer will incorporate landscaping along the wall and be regularly maintained to minimize invasive plant growth. The wall will be identified on the subdivision map and will be approved by the County prior to approval of the final subdivision map.

Environmental Impact Report 4-154

General Plan and Zoning Amendment
Impact Analysis Colusa Industrial Properties

Mitigation Measure AR-3b: Notify all prospective purchasers and users of property near or adjacent to agricultural operations of inconveniences or discomforts that may accompany agricultural operations.
Implement Mitigation Measure N-4b.
Significance Level After Mitigation: Less than significant because provision of a physical barrier would ensure minimal conflicts between agricultural and residential uses and minimize impacts on agricultural productivity.

Impact AR-4: Project implementation could encourage the conversion of adjacent farmland to non-
agricultural uses.

Development of residential and commercial uses in the project area could encourage conversion of adjacent or nearby agricultural lands to non-agricultural uses. The extension of Farinon Road and potential conflicts between project activities and agricultural activities on adjacent agricultural land could make it more attractive for agricultural landowners to consider selling their land for development. The conversion of Prime or Unique Farmland on nearby lands would be a significant effect and would require separate environmental analyses prior to project implementation.
Significance Level Before Mitigation: Significant.
Mitigation Measure AR-4: Construct a wall along western project boundary to provide a barrier between residences and agricultural uses.

Implement Mitigation Measure AR-3a.

Significance Level After Mitigation: Significant and unavoidable because development of the
project area to urban uses could encourage conversion of adjacent or nearby agricultural lands to
non-agricultural uses

Significant and Unavoidable Impacts
Impact AR-4: Project implementation could encourage the conversion of adjacent farmland to non-
agricultural uses.

4.13 CULTURAL RESOURCES
This section describes the cultural resources setting for the project area and identifies the potential for such resources to occur within the project area. The impact analysis discusses the potential for the project to affect cultural resources. The information is summarized from the cultural resources inventory for the project (Appendix H).

4.13.1 Setting

Regulatory Setting
CEOA Guidelines Section 15064.5 requires evaluation of historical resources to determine their eligibility for listing on the California Register of Historical Resources (CRHR). The purposes of the

Environmental Impact Report 4-155

General Plan and Zoning Amendment
Impact Analysis Colusa Industrial Properties

register are to maintain listings of the state's historical resources and to indicate which properties are to be protected from substantial adverse change (California Office of Historic Preservation 1997). According to Public Resources Code (PRC) Section 5024.1, a resource is considered historically significant if it meets at least one of the following criteria:

(1) Is associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of California's history and cultural heritage;

(2) Is associated with the lives of persons important in our past;

(3) Embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, region or method of installation, or represents the work of an important creative individual, or possesses high artistic values; or

(4) Has yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history.

California Senate Bill 18 (SB 18) requires consultation with California Native American tribes prior to adoption of a general plan, specific plan, amendment to such plans, or designation of open space land. SB 18 places responsibility of initiating consultation on local governments for tribal input early in the planning process to preserve or mitigate impacts to Native American places of prehistoric, archaeological, cultural, spiritual, and ceremonial importance ("cultural places" as defined in PRC Sections 5097.9 and 5097.993). SB 18 incorporates increased protection of California Native American cultural places into land use planning for cities, counties, and agencies. Colusa County has complied with SB 18, as documented in Appendix H.
The Colusa County General Plan (1989) Conservation Element addresses preservation, management, and utilization of the County's natural, cultural and historic resources. Applicable policies include CO-24: the County shall encourage and cooperate with cities, special districts, state and federal agencies, and private landowners in acknowledging and preserving the County's cultural heritage, historical and archaeological structures, sites and landmarks; and CO-25: an archaeological survey should be required prior to approval of any project which would require excavation in an area known to contain cultural
resources.

Environmental Setting
The project area is situated on a level a plain in the Sacramento Valley, within an area that was occupied by different prehistoric cultures dating to at least 4,500 years ago (Moratto 1984). It is also within the ethnohistoric territory of the Patwin, linguistically of the Wintuan family (Kroeber 1925). Both prehistoric peoples and ethnographic Patwin established villages or base camps along the banks of the Sacramento River, located only 0.6-mile east of the project area (Johnson 1978). Like the majority of Native Californians, the Patwin relied on acorns as a staple food, collected in the fall and then stored before processing with bedrock or portable mortars and pestles (Moratto 1984). In terms of seasonal resources, the Sacramento River drainage system associated with the project area would have been a very productive environment during prehistoric and ethnohistoric times. A wide variety of tools, implements, and enclosures were used for hunting, collecting, or processing resources (e.g., bows and arrows, traps, nets, seed beaters, burden baskets, digging sticks, anvils, knives, and twined basketry) (Johnson 1978).

Environmental Impact Report 4-156

General Plan and Zoning Amendment
Impact Analysis Colusa Industrial Properties
Early historic land use in the project vicinity focused on agriculture, a pattern that continues to the present day. The town of Colusa, part of which lies within the Jimeno Rancho land grant, was initially settled in
1850 (Gudde 1998). With the coming of the Southern Pacific Railroad (later Central Pacific, now Southern Pacific Railroad) to the area in the 1860s, Colusa grew and prospered as an agricultural shipping center (Southern Pacific Company 2006). By 1907 maps show the predecessor of SR 20, and in 1913, the Colusa branch of the electric Sacramento Northern Railway connected the town to the main Sacramento to Chico line (Trimble 2005).

Because prehistoric peoples and ethnographic Patwin established villages or base camps along the banks of the Sacramento River, the area is considered highly sensitive for the potential presence of prehistoric or ethnohistoric resources. The area is considered to be low to moderately sensitive for the discovery of historic-era cultural resources because of its proximity to Euro-American settlement and agricultural production in the vicinity. Although the project area has been highly disturbed by agricultural activities, artifacts previously disturbed by the plow zone may now be on the ground surface. Prehistoric materials might include flaked stone tools, toolmaking debris, stone milling tools, fire-affected rock, or soil darkened by cultural activities (midden). Historic materials might include metal, glass, or ceramic artifacts or debris.

Within the project area, no historic-era buildings or structures and no sites of traditional Native American value, sacred sites, or contemporary use areas have been identified. Within a 2-acre intensive of the wastewater facilities site, no prehistoric or historic-era cultural resources were identified.

4.13.2 Impact Analysis

Methodology
The environmental setting is based on the following: a literature search by the Northwest Information
Center at Sonoma State University; Sacred Lands file search by the Native American Heritage Commission and related communication with local Native American groups and individuals; reconnaissance-level visual inspection conducted in September 2006 and January 2007 to view the general vicinity and provide information on the presence/absence of historic-era buildings or structures
within the project boundaries; and an ntensive pedestrian survey in January 2007 of two acres in the project area. This impact analysis is based on the cultural resources inventory (Appendix H) and relevant regulations. The project was analyzed in terms of its potential to impact undocumented and potentially significant cultural resources, including buried human remains, in the project area.

Criteria for Determining Significance
Adverse impacts to cultural resources would be considered significant if the project would:
Cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of a historical resource as defined in Section 15064.5.
Cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of an archaeological resource pursuant to
Section 15064.5.

. Disturb any human remains, including those interred outside of formal cemeteries.

Environmental Impact Report 4-157

General Plan and Zoning Amendment
Impact Analysis Colusa Industrial Properties

Impacts and Mitigation Measures
Impact CR-1: Ground disturbance could affect undocumented cultural resources, including human
remains.

Although no prehistoric, ethnohistoric, or historic-era cultural resources have been recorded within the project area, likely because the project area has not been intensively surveyed, it is possible that undocumented cultural resources, including human remains, may be affected during construction or
ground-disturbing activities. Due to the possible presence of undocumented cultural resources within the
project area, construction-related impacts on cultural resources would be significant.

Significance Level Before Mitigation: Significant
Mitigation Measure CR-la: Conduct a pre-construction survey for cultural resources and ensure
adequate recordation, protection, or recovery of any significant resources.
Prior to initiation of ground-disturbing activities, the applicant will obtain a qualified professional archaeologist to complete an intensive level pedestrian survey of the project area, with the exception of the two-acre area within the wastewater facilities site surveyed by SWCA in January 2007. This requirement will be identified on grading plans and construction contracts and will include a list of measures (see below) that would be implemented if significant resources are discovered. The County will approve the measures prior to issuance of grading permits.
The pedestrian survey will be conducted in compliance with CEQA requirements (14 CCR 15064.5 and PRC 21083.2) and in accordance with the standards set by the Secretary of the Interior. After completion of the survey, the qualified archaeologist will complete a technical report documenting the results of all work, and any cultural resources identified during the survey will be formally recorded on Department of Parks and Recreation series 523 forms. The report is to meet the Secretary of Interior's Standards and Guidelines and follow the Office of Historic Preservation's ARMR guidelines (Archaeological Resource Management Reports: Recommended Contents and Format) (1990). The report will include assessment of the significance of any newly identified resources, and recommend appropriate procedures to either further investigate or mitigate adverse impacts in conformance with the protocols set forth in PRC Section
5097.98. The applicant will be required to ensure the locations of cultural resources or human remains are
not disturbed and may be required to implement the following measures, depending on the resources
identified and the agency or Native American providing the recommendation:

The nondestructive removal and analysis of human remains and items associated with Native
American human remains.
Preservation of Native American human remains and associated items in place.
Relinquishment of Native American human remains and associated items to the descendents for
treatment.

Mitigation Measure CR-Ib: Ensure adequate recordation, protection, or recovery of inadvertent resource discoveries (prehistoric or historic cultural resources, including human remains) during construction activities.

If cultural resources, including human remains, are discovered during construction, the applicant will halt all activities within 100 feet of the find until a qualified professional archaeologist can evaluate it. The archaeologist will examine the resources, assess their significance, and recommend appropriate

procedures to either further investigate or mitigate adverse impacts on the resources encountered in conformance with the protocols set forth in PRC Section 5097.98 (see Mitigation Measure CR-la). Any human remains encountered during construction will be treated in accordance with the California Health and Safety Code Section 7050.5. All measures will be identified on grading plans and construction contracts and will be approved by the County prior to issuance of grading permits.
Significance Level After Mitigation: Less than significant because implementation of mitigation measures would ensure that any undocumented cultural resources or inadvertent discoveries of cultural resources during construction or ground-disturbing activities would be properly recorded and the historical significance of the resources documented.

Significant and Unavoidable Impacts

4.14 AESTHETICS
This section evaluates changes to the visual character of the project area and vicinity caused by project implementation. The information presented in this section is based on field observations, photographs, and aerial photography interpretation.

4.14.1 Setting

Regulatory Setting
The Colusa County General Plan (1989) identifies goals and policies that seek to protect the scenic values of Colusa County by promoting design standards intended to encourage visually attractive development and by preserving views of regional focal points, including the Sutter Buttes, the Sacramento River, and prominent peaks in the Coast Range (e.g., Snow Mountain and St. John Mountain), wherever possible.

The Colusa County zoning ordinance (County Ordinance No. 534) includes development standards that apply to all buildings and land uses within the County, and includes measures to minimize annoyance and hazards caused by light sources. Section 8.01(e) of the zoning ordinance requires light fixtures and all other sources of illumination to

...be equipped with lenses or other devices which concentrate the illumination upon such buildings, landscaping, signs, and parking and loading areas. No unshielded lights, reflectors, or spotlights shall be SO located and directed that they shine toward or are directly visible from adjacent properties or streets.

Environmental Impact Report 4-159

General Plan and Zoning Amendment Impact Analysis Colusa Industrial Properties

Environmental Setting
The visual character of the project area is consistent with its location on the edge of an agricultural city in the Sacramento Valley. Panoramic views from any given location can include homes, light industrial and manufacturing facilities, offices, farms, fallow fields, grain silos, highways, trees, canals, overhead utility lines, and expansive views across the valley floor to the Coast Range and Sierra Nevada. The Sutter Buttes are located ten miles east of Colusa. The region's flat topography allows views of the Sutter Buttes from many locations. Buildings in the project vicinity are typically low (two stories or less) and often have yards or undeveloped land between them. Consequently, views of the Sutter Buttes and the surrounding area are also available between and over buildings in many locations.
Along SR 20 north of the project area, the visual setting of the City of Colusa is characterized by residential and commercial land uses including single-family homes, apartments, a mobile home park, restaurants, shops, commercial and government buildings, retail centers, and gas stations.
No scenic resources are located on-site, and no designated state scenic highways or eligible highways are located in the project vicinity, These resources are not discussed further in this EIR.

Views From the Project Area
Close range views from the project area are characterized by homes, trees, farms, vacant fields, light industrial and manufacturing buildings, Colusa Rice Company's storage silos, SR 20, the Colusa County Airport, and the golf course. Distant views include the Sutter Buttes 10 miles east (Photograph 4.14-1, see Figure 14.4-1 for photograph locations and directions), the Sierra Nevada to the east, and the Coast Range (including Snow Mountain and St. John Mountain) to the west. These features are visible from some
locations within the project area, but are less prominent because of their distance from the Park and
because haze and intervening trees can obscure or obstruct views.

Views to the east include SR 20 in the foreground and farmland and trees in the middle distance. The Sacramento River is less than a mile east of the project area, but is not visible from the project area. The Sutter Buttes and the Sierra Nevada can be seen from some locations. Views to the west include farmland
and fields in the foreground and middle distance and views of the Coast Range in the distance. Views to the north feature the golf course. Some of the homes surrounding the golf course are also visible from the project area. Trees within the golf course and the nearby residential neighborhoods obstruct distant views to the north. Views to the south of the development area include the Colusa County Airport, light industrial and manufacturing buildings, and Colusa Rice Company's storage silos in the foreground and middle distance. The flat topography of the valley floor and the long distance to any mountains or visible topography to the south offers no long-range views in that direction.

Views of the Project Area
Distant views of the project area would be available only from the Sutter Buttes; however, the project would be indistinct in the overall landscape when viewed from that distance. Close range views from the east are available from SR 20. No landscape screening separates SR 20 from the Park. Views of the portion of the project area in the Park from SR 20 include offices, vacant fields, and undeveloped parcels (Photographs 4.14-2 and 4.14-3). Views of the golf course (and the golf course portion of the project area) are available along the southernmost 400 feet of the golf course/highway interface (Photograph 4.14-4).

Environmental Impact Report 4-160

General Plan and Zoning Amendment
Impact Analysis Colusa Industrial Properties

A row of tall trees along the eastern edge of the golf course screens most of the golf course from SR 20. Views of the clubhouse and parking lot are also readily available from SR 20. Close range views from the west are available from some of the residences northwest of the project area. Unobstructed views from the west are only available from few residences at the eastern end of Birchwood Place.
Views from residences further north are screened or obstructed by golf course trees. Views of the Park portion of the project area from these homes are nearly entirely obstructed, whereas views of the golf course portion of the project area are intermittently obstructed (Photographs 4.14-5 and 4.14-6). Golf course trees also screen or intermittently obstruct views of the Sutter Buttes from these residences. The
peaks of the Sutter Buttes are intermittently visible above distant trees (see Photograph 4.14-5). Close range views from the north are available from the golf course. Close range views from the south are available from the airport and from other portions of the Park (Photograph 4.14-6).
The wastewater facility site is a located on fallow rice land a mile south of the development area and surrounded by large tracts of farmland and heavy industrial uses (Photograph 4.14-7). Close range public views of this site are not readily available.

Nighttime Views of the Project Area and Vicinity
Nighttime views in the project vicinity include lights from the City of Colusa to the north; unlit fields and farmland to the east, west, and south; vehicle lights on SR 20; and lighting fixtures within the Park and the airport. On clear nights, individual light sources are most apparent, versus an overall nighttime "skyglow."

Most of the project area is undeveloped and does not produce any nighttime lighting. The dominant source of night light within the project area is the Park office complex. Light sources include overhead parking lights and exterior security lights fixed to the office buildings. Because the office complex is well lit and sits adjacent to SR 20, it is quite noticeable to motorists on SR 20. The golf course is not lit at night. Night light sources within the golf course are limited to a single overhead parking light and interior light visible through the clubhouse windows.
The primary sources of night light south of the development area include the heavy industrial portion of the Park and the airport. Lighting in this area of the Park includes security and perimeter lights and individual light fixtures secured to the industrial buildings. Flood lighting and vehicle and equipment lights are visible when the industrial facilities perform seasonal nighttime operations. Airport lighting includes a green and white rotating beacon and lighting fixtures secured to buildings. Runway and taxi lights are only lit when needed by pilots.

4.14.2 Impact Analysis

Methodology
Visual impacts were evaluated by comparing expected visual changes the project would generate against the existing visual character of the project area and vicinity. This analysis also considers whether the project would affect scenic vistas, especially views of the Sutter Buttes, from public viewing areas.

Criteria for Determining Significance
Adverse impacts to aesthetics would be considered significant if the project would:
Have a substantial adverse effect on a scenic vista, such as by blocking public views to a public resource from designated open space areas or public roads or by substantially altering the natural landform.

Substantially damage scenic resources, e.g., features of a state scenic highway.
Substantially degrade the existing visual character or quality of the site and its surroundings.
Create a new source of substantial light or glare, which would adversely affect day or nighttime
views in the area.

Impacts and Mitigation Measures
Impact A-1: Nighttime construction lighting could adversely affect adjacent residences and could interfere with the nighttime vision of drivers on State Route 20.

Environmental Impact Report 4-167

General Plan and Zoning Amendment
Impact Analysis Colusa Industrial Properties

Construction can involve numerous potential sources of nighttime lighting, including earth-moving and other construction equipment, temporary construction trailers, employee vehicles, and flood and security lighting. Project buildout would involve sporadic construction over several years. Nighttime construction lighting could adversely affect adjacent residences and could interfere with nighttime vision of drivers on SR 20. This would be a significant impact.

Significance Level Before Mitigation: Significant.

Mitigation Measure A-1: Restrict construction to daytime hours (7 a.m. to 7 p.m.).
The County will require the applicant to limit construction to daytime hours (7 a.m. to 7 p.m.). Any nighttime lighting from construction trailers will be located and directed to shine away from adjacent residences and streets and will not be directly visible from adjacent properties or streets. The applicant will identify these measures on grading plans and construction contracts and ensure implementation of the measures by the construction contractor during all construction activities.
Significance Level After Mitigation: Less than significant because the restriction of nighttime construction would minimize adverse effects from nighttime construction lighting.
Impact A-2: The project would have no effect on views of Sutter Buttes from public viewpoints and a minor effect on views from non-public viewpoints.
Public viewpoints near the project area are primarily limited to public roads, and the nearby road with the best views of the Sutter Buttes is SR 20. Because SR 20 is east of the project area, the project would not affect views of the Sutter Buttes from the highway.
The Colusa Golf and Country Club is a public golf course. Golf course trees, including the row of tall trees along SR 20, screen and intermittently obstruct views of the Sutter Buttes from the golf course. The proposed residences near SR 20 would block views of the Sutter Buttes from certain spots on the golf course that now have intermittent views. Intermittent views would remain available in other sections of the course. Because of their scarcity, views of the Sutter Buttes are not a dominant feature of the Colusa
golf course experience. The project, therefore, would not have a substantial adverse effect on Sutter Butte views from the golf course.

Golf course trees also screen or intermittently obstruct views of the Sutter Buttes from the private
residences west of the golf course. The peaks of the Sutter Buttes are intermittently visible above distant trees. The proposed residences near SR 20 would be about 900 feet from these homes at their closest point and would not be visible above the tops of the trees that currently hinder views. The project,
therefore, would not obstruct views of the Sutter Buttes from these residences.

In summary, the proposed project would not block views of the Sutter Buttes from public viewpoints and would not substantially affect views from non-public viewpoints, such as existing residences. The project, therefore, would result in a less-than-significant impact related to effects on scenic vistas.

Significance Level: Less than significant because views of the Sutter Buttes would not be
obstructed.

Impact A-3: The project would change the visual character of the project area and proposed uses along State Route 20 may be inconsistent with the visual character of nearby residential, commercial, and industrial uses.

Environmental Impact Report 4-168

General Plan and Zoning Amendment Impact Analysis Colusa Industrial Properties
With project implementation, views of the project area would include highway commercial uses along SR 20, a golf course near the center of the project area, and residences in the western portion of the Park and along SR 20 in the golf course portion of the project area.
Views of the project area from SR 20 would include a hotel or motel, family restaurant, gas station, and convenience commercial and landscaping associated with these highway commercial uses. These views may be inconsistent with the uses to the south (airport and industrial) and the office park to the north within the Park. Views from the residences to the northwest would include obstructed views of residences
and the expanded golf course, consistent with the visual character of the land north and northwest of the project area. Eastward views from these residences would continue to be dominated by the existing golf course and would include intermittent views of the proposed residences along SR 20, screened by golf course trees. Views of the project area from the existing golf course would include the golf course expansion to the south and the proposed high-density residences to the east. Residences currently border much of the golf course; therefore, additional residences to the east would not adversely affect the visual character of the golf course. Views from the south would include highway commercial uses, the golf course, and residences. These views would be consistent with the residences in the City to the northwest, the existing golf course to the north, and the existing office buildings in the Park along SR 20.
The visual character of the project area would be changed from open land with some office buildings to residential community with commercial and office buildings along SR 20. The northern portion of the a Park currently provides a transition area between the City of Colusa and the Park's industrial uses, and this buffer would be maintained by the proposed golf course expansion, highway commercial uses, and office and commercial uses. Additionally, the western portion of the project area currently provides a transition area between the office park and other buildings along SR 20 and the agricultural lands to the
west. This transition area would be converted to a residential community, which would include an open space buffer along the western boundary. The buffer would provide a transition area between the residential and agricultural uses, and the residential community would be consistent with the residential community in the City to the northwest; this would ensure the project has a minimal impact on the visual character of the adjacent agricultural land.

The proposed wastewater treatment facility would be a self-contained package plant enclosed within a 59- foot by 36-foot, one-story building that would be visually consistent with small agricultural and industrial buildings in the project vicinity.

In summary, the visual character of the project would generally be consistent with the visual character of the residential and commercial uses in the project vicinity; however, the highway commercial uses may be inconsistent with the nearby office, airport, and industrial uses. The project, therefore, could substantially degrade the existing visual character or quality of the project area and its surrounding, and impacts would be significant.
Significance Level Before Mitigation: Significant.
Mitigation Measure A-3: Implement a landscaping plan for uses along State Route 20.
The County will require the applicant to prepare and implement a landscaping plan for highway commercial uses along SR 20. The landscaping plan will identify measures to blend the uses into the existing setting and screen views of the buildings to minimize adverse views of the project from SR 20. Landscaping similar to that used in the existing office park would be required, and adequate landscaped buffer areas along the highway will be identified. The landscaping plan should be prepared by a qualified landscape architect and will be submitted to the County for review and approval prior to approval of subdivision maps.

Environmental Impact Report 4-169

General Plan and Zoning Amendment
Impact Analysis Colusa Industrial Properties

Significance Level After Mitigation: Less than significant because implementation of landscaping plan will ensure minimal adverse effects on views from State Route 20.
Impact A-4: The project would increase nighttime lighting and could affect visibility of drivers on
State Route 20.

Nighttime light from the project could have two adverse impacts. First, light can affect light-sensitive land uses (e.g., residences) by interfering with sleep and views of the nighttime sky. Second, light can adversely affect drivers of motor vehicles by interfering with nighttime vision. Views of unshielded light sources can temporarily blind drivers and cause hazardous driving conditions, especially at highway speeds.

The project includes highway commercial uses along SR 20, including a hotel or motel, family restaurant, gas station, and convenience commercial. These uses typically require night lighting because they must attract customers and operate at night. Night light sources for highway commercial uses include signage, parking and walkway lights, overhead lighting at gas pumps, security and perimeter lighting, and interior lighting visible through business windows. All project lighting would be required to comply with Colusa County lighting standards, prohibiting lights from shining toward or directly at adjacent properties or streets. However, the project would create new sources of night light and glare along SR 20 and could adversely affect drivers along the highway because of the close proximity of the uses to the highway.
The golf course would sit at the center of the project area and would remain relatively dark, similar to the
existing golf course. Nighttime lighting is not proposed for the golf course. Light sources would be limited to the new clubhouse and might include parking and walkway lights and security and perimeter lights. These lights would be minimal and would not affect surrounding uses.
Nighttime views of the remainder of the project area would include light sources from the proposed residential land uses, including streetlights, vehicle lights, landscape and security lighting, and interior lighting visible through windows. This lighting could adversely affect nighttime views from existing residential neighborhoods to the northwest and adjacent land to the west and south. The residential uses in the project area would block views of new commercial light sources along SR 20 from existing residential neighborhoods to the northwest and from the adjacent agricultural lands because of the flat topography. Lighting from residential uses along SR 20 would be partially shielded by landscaping, which would minimize effects of nighttime lighting and glare on travelers. Drivers on SR 20 would have minimal views of lighting from the low density residences in the western portion of the project area because views would be blocked by the highway commercial uses and existing structures along the highway.
The project would create a new source of light and glare adjacent to existing development and agricultural lands. Commercial buildings along the highway could adversely affect visibility of nighttime drivers, resulting in a significant impact.

Significance Level Before Mitigation: Significant.

Miligation Measure A-4a: Implement a landscaping plan for uses along State Route 20.
Implement Mitigation Measure A-3.
Mitigation Measure -4b: Implement a lighting plan for uses along State Route 20.
The County will require the applicant to prepare and implement a lighting plan for highway commercial uses along SR 20. The lighting plan may be prepared in conjunction with the landscaping plan. It will

identify measures to avoid directing light at drivers along the highway and minimize bright light sources that could affect driver visibility. Lighting similar to that used in the existing office park would be required. The lighting plan should be prepared by a qualified landscape architect and will be submitted to the County for review and approval prior to approval of subdivision maps.
Significance Level After Mitigation: Less than significant because use of landscaping and control of light sources along State Route 20 would ensure minimal impacts to drivers.

5. CUMULATIVE IMPACTS

5.1 CEQA REQUIREMENTS FOR CUMULATIVE IMPACT ANALYSIS
This EIR provides an analysis of cumulative impacts of the proposed project, as required by CEQA Guidelines Section 15130. Cumulative Impacts are defined in CEQA Guidelines Section 15355 as "two
or more individual effects which, when considered together, are considerable or which compound or increase other environmental impacts." A cumulative impact occurs from "the change in the environment which results from the incremental impact of the project when added to other closely related past, present, and reasonably foreseeable probable future projects. Cumulative impacts can result from individually minor but collectively significant projects taking place over a period of time" (CEQA Guidelines Section 15355[b]).

Consistent with CEQA Guidelines Section 15130(a), the discussion of cumulative impacts in this EIR focuses on significant or potentially significant cumulative impacts. CEQA Guidelines Section 15130(b) provides, in pertinent part:
The discussion of cumulative impacts shall reflect the severity of the impacts and their likelihood of occurrence, but the discussion need not provide as great detail as is provided for the effects attributable to the project alone. The discussion should be guided by standards of practicality and reasonableness, and should focus on the cumulative impact to which the identified other projects contribute rather than the attributes of other projects which do not contribute to the cumulative impact.

This cumulative impact analysis is based on a list of present and reasonably foreseeable probable future projects producing cumulative impacts. The significance thresholds presented in Chapter 4 were used to assess cumulative impacts of the project and related projects. Impacts of past projects are already built
into the baseline for the project's impact analysis (see Chapter 4).

5.2 RELATED PROJECTS

5.2.1 Buildout of Colusa Industrial Park
Approximately 310 acres of the Colusa Industrial Park (Park) outside the limits of the project area are currently zoned for industrial uses. Some of this area has already been developed. Eventual buildout of the remainder of the industrial park is reasonably foreseeable and is considered a related project. The development schedule would be based on market conditions.

5.2.2 City of Colusa General Plan Update
The City of Colusa is in the process of updating its 1990 General Plan. The City's Public Draft General Plan Update (Colusa GPU) was released in January 2007; it was revised and re-released in May 2007. It is intended to serve as the primary planning document for the City through 2025. Assuming a mid-range density scenario, the Draft General Plan Update estimates that buildout of the City's sphere of influence (SOI) could yield up to 9,089 dwelling units that will house a population of about 25,000 residents, including existing development and residents (City of Colusa 2007b). This would represent a 400 percent

Environmental Impact Report 5-1

General Plan Amendment and Zoning Amendment Cumulative Impacts Colusa Industrial Properties
population increase within a the City, and a 200-percent population increase in the County. General Plan buildout is not expected to be completed before 2025, but is reasonably foreseeable and is considered a related project. The northern portion of the Park, including the proposed development area, is located within the City's SOI.

5.2.3 Colusa Casino
The Cachil Dehe Band of Wintun Indians is currently implementing a two-phase expansion of its Colusa Casino. The I Phase I expansion is nearly complete, and includes a three-story hotel with 62 rooms; a 10,000-square foot warehouse; a buffet room, restaurant, and new main kitchen; a casino/hotel lobby; a new asphalt parking lot; three new domestic wells; expansion and renovation of an existing wastewater treatment plant and subsurface effluent disposal facilities; a new 100-year storm water detention basin; and a new cogeneration facility. Phase II will include 14,000 square feet of additional space for gaming operations; a 20,000-square foot expansion of the hotel, including 38 rooms and conference space; and parking for 500 additional vehicles (Analytical Environmental Services 2004).

5.3 CUMULATIVE IMPACT ANALYSIS
The following section discusses cumulative impacts expected to result from implementation of the proposed and related projects. Some of the projects' environmental effects would not contribute to significant cumulative impacts because they would clearly not result in cumulatively considerable impacts when considered with the effects of the related projects. Examples include environmental effects related to geology and soils; cultural resources; and aesthetics. These topics are not discussed further in the cumulative impact analysis. Cumulative land use impacts are not separately assessed; instead, this section addresses cumulative land use impacts by evaluating the cumulative physical effects that would result from land use changes associated with the proposed and related projects.

5.3.1 Population, Housing, and Employment
Cumulative Impact PHE-1: The proposed and related projects would increase population within the County by 2010, but County population projections would not be exceeded.
The Colusa GPU expects the City's SOI, including the proposed development area within the Park, will grow at 3-4 percent annually for the next 20 years, and that the growth rate might be higher than 3-4 percent initially (City of Colusa 2007b). Assuming a 3.5 percent annual growth rate, the City's SOI would grow to about 6,630 persons by 2010 (the estimated project completion date), thereby adding about 1,048 residents to the County's overall population by that time.
Buildout of the Colusa GPU would bring the County's overall population to about 21,928 by 2010, which would be 1,572 persons less than the County's projections from their 1989 General Plan of 23,500. Buildout of the project and reasonably foreseeable projects within the Colusa GPU by 2010 would increase the overall population of the County, but population projections would not be exceeded. Cumulative impacts of the project and related projects would not induce unplanned growth, and cumulative impacts would be less than significant.
Significance Level: Less than significant because cumulative growth would not exceed County population projections.

Environmental Impact Report 5-2

Cumulative Impacts General Plan Amendment and Zoning Amendment Colusa Industrial Properties

Cumulative Impact PHE-2: The proposed and related projects would add more than 300 dwelling units to the housing stock within Colusa County by 2010, but County housing projections would not be exceeded.

Based on the Colusa GPU's anticipated growth rate of 3-4 percent annually (City of Colusa 2007b), the number of residences within the City's SOI would grow from about 2,000 housing units to about 2,217 units by 2010, thereby adding about 217 units to the County's overall housing stock by 2010.
Buildout of the Colusa GPU would add approximately 217 units to the County, bringing the overall number of housing units in the County to about 7,559 in 2010, which would account for approximately 28 percent of the County's overall housing growth projection of 772 units by that time. The proposed project would add 286 residences to the County, a portion of which are contemplated in the Colusa GPU.
Buildout of the project and reasonably foreseeable projects within the Colusa GPU by 2010 would increase the overall number of housing units in the County, but housing projections would not be exceeded. Cumulative impacts of the project and related projects would not induce unplanned growth, and cumulative impacts would be less than significant.
Significance Level: Less than significant because cumulative growth would not exceed County housing projections.
Cumulative Impact PHE-3: The proposed and related projects may not include adequate affordable housing to be consistent with affordable housing policies and programs.
The Colusa GPU provides for a variety of land use designations and a mixture of housing units, including medium and high density housing that could provide affordable housing within the plan area. According to the City's Housing Element (City of Colusa 2004), the City should provide 290 new affordable housing units by 2008. The Colusa GPU Draft Master EIR concludes that the City has adequate sites to meet this goal (City of Colusa 2007a). Additionally, the proposed project does not include provision of affordable housing within the project area to be consistent with County Housing Element policies. If County and City affordable housing policies are not implemented, cumulative impacts would be significant.
Significance Level Before Mitigation: Significant

Mitigation Measure Cumulative PHE-3: Implement County and City affordable housing policies to provide new affordable housing units.

The project will implement Mitigation Measure PHE-3 to provide at least 29 affordable housing units in the project area (10 percent of the total unit count). The County will enforce this measure and ensure other development within the County provides adequate affordable housing for low-income populations. The City should implement affordable housing policies in the City's Housing Element.
Significance Level After Mitigation: If this mitigation measure is implemented, less than significant because sufficient affordable housing would be provided in the County and City as part of future project approvals.

Environmental Impact Report 5-3

General Plan Amendment and Zoning Amendment Cumulative Impacts Colusa Industrial Properties

5.3.2 Public Services
Cumulative Impact PS-1: The proposed and related projects would increase demand for law enforcement services, resulting in a need for new staff members and possibly new or expanded facilities.

The Park and the Colusa Casino are located in unincorporated Colusa County, where law enforcement services are provided by the Colusa County Sheriff. The Sheriff's Department receives relatively few calls from the Park. Prior to the Colusa Casino expansion, the Sheriff's Department responded to about three calls per month from the casino (Analytical Environmental Services 2004). The Colusa County Sheriff's Department has a mutual aid agreement with the City of Colusa Police Department. The City Police, therefore, respond to occasional calls from the Park and the Casino.
The proposed and related projects would increase demand on the County Sheriff and the City Police. Buildout of the Park would increase employment and visitation at the Park; the casino expansion would increase visitation and commerce at the casino and increase traffic volumes through the City; and both the proposed project and buildout of the Colusa GPU would increase the local population, thereby increasing the need for police services within the City and surrounding unincorporated areas. The Sheriff's station is operating near capacity and the police station is operating at capacity. Cumulative demands would result in the need for additional Sheriff and police staffing and facilities, the construction of which could have adverse environmental impacts. Increased demand for police services would, therefore, result in a
significant cumulative impact.

Significance Level Before Mitigation: Significant

Mitigation Measure Cumulative PS-1: Provide fair share funding for new or expanded facilities and
staffing for the Sheriff and City Police.
The County will require all new development projects in the unincorporated County to provide fair share funding, proportionate to the increased demand based on population increases, for new Sheriff facilities and staffing. The project will implement Mitigation Measure PS-1 to provide funding for two new Sheriff Department staff.
The City and Cachil Dehe Band of Wintun Indians should be responsible for requiring new projects to provide fair share funding for new facilities and staffing for the Sheriff and City Police, as appropriate. The proportion of fair share funding should be coordinated with the Sheriff and Police and should be based on the increased demand each project causes. Specific projects within the Colusa GPU should be required to provide adequate funding to meet their fair share requirements. The City should implement applicable policies in its GPU to ensure adequate police services are provided for its residents (Policy SAF-6.1; Policy SAF-6.2; Policy MFS-1.1; Policy MFS-3.2). Note that this is beyond the County's legal ability to implement.
Significance Level After Mitigation: If fair share funding is implemented, impacts on law enforcement services would be less than significant.

Environmental Impact Report 5-4

General Plan Amendment and Zoning Amendment
Cumulative Impacts Colusa Industrial Properties

Cumulative Impact PS-2: The proposed and related projects would substantially increase demand for County jail services, resulting in need for new staff members and possibly new or expanded facilities.

The Sheriff's station includes the County's only jail. The jail has 92 beds and the jail's average daily population from March 2005 through August 2006 was 45 inmates. The jail serves City and County residents as well as non-residents.

The proposed and related projects would increase demand for jail services, which increases proportionally with the County's population. The jail currently operates at about half capacity. Buildout of the Colusa GPU would double the County's current population, causing the jail to reach or exceed its capacity. The casino expansion would increase visitation and commerce at the casino and therefore would be expected to increase demand for jail services. The proposed project would increase the County's population and would generate demand for about two jail beds, which could be met by the existing facilities. Cumulative demands, however, would result in the need for additional jail staffing and facilities, the construction of which could have adverse environmental impacts. Increased demand for jail services would, therefore, result in a significant cumulative impact.

Significance Level Before Mitigation: Significant
Mitigation Measure Cumulative PS-2: Provide fair share funding for new or expanded facilities and staffing for the County jail.
The County will require new development projects in the unincorporated County that contribute substantially to the demand on jail services to provide fair share funding, proportionate to the increased demand based on population increases, for new jail facilities and staffing.
The City and Cachil Dehe Band of Wintun Indians should be responsible for requiring new projects to provide fair share funding for new facilities and staffing for the County jail, as appropriate. Note that this measure is beyond the County's legal ability to implement.
Significance Level After Mitigation: If fair share funding is implemented, impacts on the County jail would be less than significant.

Cumulative Impact PS-3: The proposed and related projects would substantially increase demand for fire protection services, resulting in need for new staff members and possibly new or expanded facilities.

The Park and the Colusa Casino are located in unincorporated Colusa County, where fire protection services are provided by the Sacramento River Fire District (SRFD). The SRFD receives occasional calls from the Park, mostly involving medical emergencies, with a few structure fires on the developed parcels, and vegetation fires on the undeveloped parcels. Prior to the Colusa Casino expansion, the SRFD responded to about eight calls per month from the casino, mostly involving medical emergencies
(Analytical Environmental Services 2004).
Thé City of Colusa Fire Department responds to fire emergencies at the casino because it has trucks equipped to fight hotel fires, if needed. The City Fire Department receives very few calls for mutual aid
assistance at the Park (Randy Dunn, personal communication 2007).
Buildout of the Colusa GPU would substantially increase demand on the City Fire Department. Buildout of the Park, the casino expansion, and the proposed project would contribute to new demand on the SRFD

Environmental Impact Report 5-5

General Plan Amendment and Zoning Amendment Cumulative Impacts Colusa Industrial Properties

and the City Fire Department that would result in a significant cumulative impact when combined with increased demand from Colusa GPU buildout. Cumulative demands would result in the need for additional fire staffing and facilities, the construction of which could have adverse environmental impacts. Increased demand for fire services would, therefore, result in a significant cumulative impact.
Significance Level Before Mitigation: Significant
Mitigation Measure Cumulative PS-3: Provide fair share funding for new or expanded facilities and staffing for the Sacramento River Fire District and City Fire Department.

The County will require all new development projects in the unincorporated County to provide fair share funding, proportionate to the increased demand based on population increases, for new SRFD facilities and staffing. The project will implement Mitigation Measure PS-3 to provide funding for one new firefighter.

The City and Cachil Dehe Band of Wintun Indians should be responsible for requiring new projects to provide fair share funding for new facilities and staffing for the SRFD and City Fire Department, as appropriate. The proportion of fair share funding should be coordinated with the SRFD and Fire Department and should be based on the increased demand each project causes. Specific projects within the Colusa GPU should be required to provide adequate funding to meet their fair share requirements. The City should implement applicable policies in its GPU to ensure adequate fire protection services are provided for its residents (Policy SAF-3.4; Policy MFS-1.1; Policy MFS-3.1; Policy MFS-3.3). Note that this is beyond the County's legal ability to implement.
Significance Level After Mitigation: If fair share funding is implemented, impacts on fire protection services would be less than significant.

Cumulative Impact PS-4: Growth expected within the Colusa Unified School District would exeeed the capacity of its schools by the year 2015.
The proposed and related residential projects are all located in the Colusa Unified School District
(CUSD). The CUSD expects student enrollment to increase substantially over the next 10 years, primarily from a forecasted increase in residential development. The CUSD expects that Burchfield Elementary School will reach capacity in the next two years, and the remaining schools will reach capacity by the year 2015 (School Works, Inc. 2006). Cumulative demands would result in the need for additional school facilities, the construction of which could have adverse environmental impacts. This would be a
significant cumulative impact.

Significance Level Before Mitigation: Significant
Mitigation Measure Cumulative PS-4: Provide fair share funding for new facilities for the Colusa Unified School District.

The CUSD will assess developer fees for the proposed and related projects to help pay for additional facilities needed to serve new students generated by the project. The CUSD can assess these fees at a maximum rate of $2.63 per square foot of assessable space for residential development and $0.42 for commercial or industrial development as specified in Government Code Section 65995. These fees
constitute the exclusive means of both "considering" and "mitigating" school facilities impacts of projects and are "deemed to provide full and complete school facilities mitigation" (Government Code Section 65996[a] and [h]). Additionally, Colusa County may require fair share funding through development agreements with all new projects in the County. The City should implement applicable policies from the

Environmental Impact Report 5-6

General Plan Amendment and Zoning Amendment Cumulative Impacts Colusa Industrial Properties
GPU to ensure adequate school facilities are available for its residents (Policy MFS-5.1; Policy MFS-5.2). Note that this is beyond the County's legal ability to implement.
Significance Level After Mitigation: If this measure is implemented, impacts on the Colusa Unified
School Distriet would be less than significant.

Cumulative Impact PS-5: The proposed and related projects would substantially increase City park usage and accelerate physical deterioration of the City's park facilities.
Buildout of the Colusa GPU would substantially increase the City's population. As part of the Colusa GPU, approximately 71 acres of new parks, recreational lands, and open space would be provided for City residents. Within this acreage is a 50-acre community park and expansion of recreational opportunities along the Sacramento River to benefit the residents. The proposed project includes expansion of the Colusa Golf and Country Club and provision of walking trails around the golf course to provide some recreation opportunities for project residents. Despite the provision of new or expanded
recreational opportunities, use of the City parks would increase substantially. This increase would inhibit the ability of the City's park system to adequately serve the community and would accelerate physical deterioration of the park facilities. This is a significant cumulative impact.
Significance Level Before Mitigation: Significant
Mitigation Measure Cumulative PS-5: Provide fair share funding for park development, maintenance, operation, and renovations in the City of Colusa or provide adequate park facilities to meet the increased demand within new development projects.

The County will require all new development projects in the unincorporated County near Colusa to
provide fair share funding, proportionate to the increased demand based on population increases, for City
park operation and maintenance, or alternatively providing adequate park facilities as part of the
development to meet the specific project's demand. The project will implement Mitigation Measure PS-5 to provide fair share funding based on an increased demand of 15 percent.

The City should be responsible for requiring new development projects to provide fair share funding to the Parks and Community Development Department or provide new facilities to support the added population. The proportion of fair share funding should be coordinated with the Department and should be based on the increased demand each project causes. Specific projects within the Colusa GPU should be
required to provide adequate funding or park facilities to meet their fair share requirements. The City should implement applicable policies in its GPU to ensure adequate park facilities are provided for its residents (Policy PRC-2.1; Policy PRC-2.2; Policy PRC-2.3; Policy PRC-3.2; Policy MFS-1.1). Note that this is beyond the County's legal ability to implement.
Significance Level After Mitigation: If fair share funding is implemented, impacts on the City park
system would be less than significant.

Cumulative Impact PS-6: The proposed and related projects would substantially increase demand for library, behavioral health, medical, and court facilities and services, resulting in the need for
new or expanded facilities and staffing.
Buildout of the Colusa GPU would substantially increase the City's population. When combined with the projected population increase generated by the proposed project, demand for Colusa County Library, behavioral health, public health and medical services, and court services would increase substantially. The casino expansion would increase visitation and commerce in Colusa County and would contribute to

Environmental Impact Report 5-7

General Plan Amendment and Zoning Amendment
Cumulative Impacts Colusa Industrial Properties

increased demand on medical and court services. Some of these services and facilities are already operating at capacity (see Section 4.3). Cumulative demands would result in the need for additional library, behavioral health, public health, medical, and court facilities, the construction of which could have adverse environmental impacts. This would be a significant cumulative impact.
Significance Level Before Mitigation: Significant
Mitigation Measure Cumulative PS-6: Provide fair share funding for new or expanded facilities and staffing for the library, behavioral health, medical, and court services.

The County will require new development projects in the unincorporated County that contribute substantially to the demand on other community services to provide fair share funding, proportionate to the increased demand based on population increases, for new facilities and staffing.
The City and Cachil Dehe Band of Wintun Indians should be responsible for requiring new projects to provide fair share funding for new facilities and staffing for other community services, as appropriate. Note that this measure is beyond the County's legal ability to implement.
Significance Level After Mitigation: If fair share funding is implemented, impacts on library, medical, health, and court services would be less than significant.

5.3.3 Transportation and Traffic
Cumulative traffic impacts and mitigation are discussed in Section 4.4 (Transportation and Traffic).

5.3.4 Noise
Cumulative Impact N-1: The proposed and related projects would increase traffic noise levels along State Route 20 and would expose existing and new residents and commercial tenants to significant noise levels.

Existing traffic noise levels in the project area along SR 20 exceed the County's accepted exterior noise levels for residential (60 dB), hotel (60 dB), office (65 dB), and restaurant (70 dB) uses. The proposed and related projects would increase traffic on SR 20, causing a further increase in SR 20 noise levels and
adversely affecting existing and proposed residential and commercial uses along SR 20.
As shown in Figure 5-1, cumulative traffic noise levels based on buildout of the Colusa GPU in 2025
(City of Colusa 2007b) would exceed 60 dB at existing and proposed uses within approximately 600 feet of SR 20. Because cumulative traffic noise would exceed County noise standards and adversely affect receptors at sensitive land uses along SR 20, traffic-related noise would be a significant cumulative
impact.

Significance Level Before Mitigation: Significant.

Cumulative Impacts Colusa Industrial Properties

Mitigation Measure Cumulative N-1: Provide appropriate barriers, setbacks, and insulation for new homes and businesses along State Route 20, east of Colusa, to reduce traffic noise levels by 5-10 dB.
The County will ensure new development within the unincorporated County along SR 20 (east of Colusa) provides appropriate barriers, setbacks, and insulation to reduce traffic noise levels by 5-10 dB for
sensitive receptors. The project will implement Mitigation Measure N-2 to reduce traffic noise levels in the high density residential area and commercial areas along SR 20.
The City should be responsible for ensuring new development projects along SR 20 are designed to reduce traffic noise levels by 5-10 dB, as appropriate to meet acceptable noise levels. The City should implement applicable policies in its GPU to ensure new development meets acceptable traffic noise levels (Policy N-1.1; Policy N-1.2; Policy N-1.3; Policy N-1.4; Policy N-1.5; Policy N-1.6). Note that this is
beyond the County's legal ability to implement.

Significance Level After Mitigation: Significant and unavoidable because it is not feasible to retrofit
existing homes, and exterior traffic noise levels would not be reduced to acceptable levels for all
uses along State Route 20.

Cumulative Impact N-2: The proposed and related projects in close proximity to the Colusa County Airport would expose sensitive receptors to excessive noise levels from aircraft overflights.
The Colusa GPU and proposed project include residential and commercial uses in close proximity to the Colusa County Airport. Ongoing aircraft noise levels would expose future residents and tenants to excessive noise levels, exceeding the airport's Comprehensive Land Use Plan (CLUP) standard of 55 dB community noise exposure level (CNEL) for these uses, depending on their specific locations near the airport. Noise exposure in some locations (particularly within the proposed project) would range from 55 to more than 75 dB CNEL, according to noise contours prepared for the airport (see Appendix D). The exposure of proposed uses associated with the proposed and related projects to excessive noise levels would be a significant cumulative impact.
Significance Level Before Mitigation: Significant.
Mitigation Measure Cumulative N-2: Design new homes and businesses near the airport lo reduce interior aircraft-related noise levels by up to 30 dB.
The County will ensure new development within the unincorporated County and in close proximity to the Colusa County Airport provides appropriate design measures to reduce interior noise levels associated with aircraft overflights by up to 30 dB. The project will implement Mitigation Measure N-4a to reduce interior aircraft-related noise levels throughout the project area by up to 30 dB.
The City should be responsible for ensuring new development projects in close proximity to the airport are designed to reduce aircraft-related, interior noise levels by up to 30 dB, as appropriate to meet acceptable noise levels. The City should implement applicable policies in its GPU to ensure new development meets acceptable interior noise levels (Policy N-1.1; Policy N-1.2; Policy N-1.3). Note that this is beyond the County's legal ability to implement.

Significance Level After Mitigation: Significant and unavoidable because the proximity of sensitive
uses to the airport would still expose sensitive receptors to excessive aircraft noise.

5.3.5 Air Quality
Cumulative Impact AQ-1: The proposed and related projects would generate short-term construction-related dust and vehicle emissions that would exceed established emissions thresholds for ROG, NOx, and PM10, resulting in adverse effects on local air quality.
Short-term air quality impacts can occur during grading and other construction operations. As discussed in Section 4.6 (Air Quality), construction emissions associated with the proposed project would exceed the construction emission thresholds. Specifically, the project could generate up to 376 pounds per day of ROG, 712 pounds per day of NOx, and 707 pounds per day of PM10, thereby exceeding the significance thresholds of 25, 25, and 80 pounds per day, respectively, for each of these pollutants.
The related projects would also include grading and other construction activities that would generate ROG, NOx, and PM10. Cumulatively, construction activities for the proposed and related projects would exceed the significance thresholds, resulting in a significant cumulative impact.
Significance Level Before Mitigation: Significant
Mitigation Measure Cumulative AQ-1: Reduce construction emissions through water application, covering loads, periodic cleaning of paved areas, and establishing speed limits.
The County will ensure new development in the unincorporated County implements measures, such as those described in Mitigation Measure AQ-1, during construction to reduce construction pollutants. The project will implement Mitigation Measure AQ-1 to reduce construction pollutants and emissions.
The City and the Cachil Dehe Band of Wintun Indians should be responsible for implementing similar measures during construction activities to reduce construction-related pollutants and emissions. The City should implement applicable policies in its GPU to reduce construction pollutants and emissions (Policy PRC-5.1). Note that this is beyond the County's legal ability to implement.
Significance Level After Mitigation: Significant and unavoidable because although the mitigation would reduce construction emissions, it would not reduce the construction emissions on all days to levels that would not substantially contribute to potential air quality violations of PM10 or ozone
standards in the project vicinity.

Cumulative Impact AQ-2: The proposed and related projects would result in long-term stationary and mobile emissions that exceed air quality thresholds for ROG, NOx, and PM10.

Long-term air quality impacts can be generated by increased vehicle trips, fuel combustion related to natural gas, wood stoves, fireplaces and landscape maintenance, and to a lesser extent, use of consumer products such as hair sprays and deodorants.
As discussed in Section 4.6 (Air Quality), operational emissions associated with the proposed project would exceed the emission thresholds. Specifically, the project could generate up to 249 pounds per day of ROG, 118 pounds per day of NOx, and 142 pounds per day of PMI0, thereby exceeding the significance thresholds of 25, 25, and 80 pounds per day, respectively, for each of these pollutants.
The related projects would generate new vehicle trips, increase fuel combustion, or increase use of consumer products, thereby generating ROG, NOx, and PM10. Cumulative emissions would exceed the significance thresholds, resulting in a significant cumulative impact.
Significance Level Before Mitigation: Significant.

Environmental Impact Report 5-12

General Plan Amendment and Zoning Amendment Cumulative Impacts Colusa Industrial Properties
Mitigation Measure Cumulative AQ-2a: Design new homes to include certified woodstoves and outdoor electrical outlets.

The County will ensure new housing development in the unincorporated County incorporates measures to design homes with certified woodstoves and outdoor electrical outlets. The project will implement Mitigation Measure AQ-2a to reduce operational pollutants.
The City should be responsible for incorporating similar design requirements in new housing development to reduce operational pollutants. Note that this is beyond the County's legal ability to implement.

Mitigation Measure Cumulative AQ-26: Provide sidewalks, bike routes, and other opportunities for alternative forms of transportation within the City of Colusa and adjacent unincorporated County.
The County will ensure new development in the unincorporated County implements measures, such as those described in Mitigation Measure AQ-2b, to provide opportunities for alternative forms of transportation. The project will implement Mitigation Measure AQ-2b to provide sidewalks and bike paths in the project area.
The City should be responsible for incorporating similar measures in designing new development projects to provide alternative forms of transportation. The City should implement applicable policies in its GPU to provide alternative transportation and reduce operational emissions (Policy PRC-5.1; Policy PRC-5.2; Policy PRC-5.3; Policy PRC-5.4; Policy PRC-5.5). Note that this is beyond the County's legal ability to implement.

Significance Level After Mitigation: Significant and unavoidable because with implementation of these measures, localized operational emissions would be reduced, but no feasible mitigation measures have been identified that would reduce the operational emissions on all days to levels that would not substantially contribute to potential air quality violations of PM10 or ozone in the
project vicinity.

Cumulative Impact AQ-3: The proposed and related projects would increase CO concentrations at intersections, but would not expose sensitive receptors to substantial CO concentrations.

Vehicle exhaust emissions include CO, a chemical harmful to human health. Localized concentrations
(i.e., hot spots) of CO can occur along congested sections of roadways and at intersections where vehicles idle while waiting to proceed. As discussed in Section 4.6 (Air Quality), CO concentrations were modeled at five sensitive receptors along the most congested sections of roadway identified in the traffic study. The modeling included an analysis of cumulative conditions in the year 2025, including the proposed project. As shown in Table 4.6-5, cumulative CO emissions would not exceed the significance thresholds. Cumulative CO impacts, therefore, would be less than significant.
Significance Level: Less than significant because cumulative CO emissions would not expose sensitive receptors to substantial pollutant concentrations.

5.3.6 Utilities and Service Systems
Cumulative Impact U-1: The proposed and related projects would increase demand for water supply, wastewater service, and solid waste disposal services, but existing and proposed facilities
would be capable of serving the demand.
The proposed and related projects would cumulatively increase demand for water supply, wastewater treatment and disposal, and solid waste disposal. This EIR evaluates cumulative water supply impacts in terms of effects on the Colusa Subbasin (groundwater aquifer) from increased pumpage (see Cumulative Impact HWQ-5 below) and evaluates cumulative impacts on stormwater drainage systems in terms of the capacity of the drainage ditch running through the Park (see Cumulative Impact HWQ-3 below).
The project's wastewater treatment facility has been designed to have adequate capacity to serve the proposed project and all existing industrial and office uses within the Park and can be expected to accommodate flows from buildout of the Park. The City and the Cachil Dehe Band of Wintun Indians wastewater facilities will be designed to accommodate projected flows in their service areas. Therefore, cumulative impacts related to wastewater services would be less than significant.
The Ostrom Road Landfill has a permitted capacity of more than 41 million cubic yards, and approximately 40 million cubic yards were estimated as remaining in 2004 (CIWMB 2006). The landfill can receive up to 3,000 tons of solid waste per day and has an expected closure date of 2066 (Norcal Waste Systems 2006). The landfill is, therefore, expected to have sufficient capacity to serve the proposed and related projects, resulting in a less than significant cumulative impact with respect to solid waste services.

Significance Level: Less than significant because existing and proposed service systems would be capable of serving the increased cumulative demand.

5.3.7 Hydrology and Water Quality
Cumulative Impact HWQ-1: The proposed and related projects could impair surface water quality
and alter beneficial uses of the Sacramento River.

The proposed and related projects could adversely affect Sacramento River water quality and alter beneficial uses. Construction activities would expose surface soils during construction activities that could result in increased surface runoff and erosion. Construction activities would also increase the
likelihood for inadvertent spills of construction-related chemicals. After construction, stormwater runoff carrying urban pollutants from parking lots and roadways and fertilizers and pesticides from landscaped areas could reach the Sacramento River. Impairment of surface water quality and alteration of beneficial uses of the Sacramento River would be a significant cumulative impact.
Significance Level Before Mitigation: Significant
Mitigation Measure Cumulative HWQ-la: Implement best management practices during construction to
control construction-related stormwater runoff, erosion, and sedimentation.

The County will ensure new development in the unincorporated County implements best management practices (BMPs), such as those described in Mitigation Measure HWQ-1, to minimize construction- related pollutants during construction activities. The project will implement Mitigation Measure HWQ-1 to implement BMPs during construction activities.

Environmental Impact Report 5-14

General Plan Amendment and Zoning Amendment
Cumulative Impacts Colusa Industrial Properties
The City and Cachil Dehe Band of Wintun Indians should be responsible for incorporating similar BMPs in construction phases of their projects. The City should implement applicable policies in its GPU to reduce construction-related pollutants (Policy PRC-7.1). Note that this is beyond the County's legal ability to implement.

Mitigation Measure Cumulative HWQ-1b: Implement and enforce stormwater quality management plans and stormwater best management practices to manage urban runoff in developed areas.
The County will ensure new development in the unincorporated County prepares a stormwater quality management plan and implements BMPs, such as those described in Mitigation Measure HWQ-2b, to minimize urban-related pollutants following construction. The project will implement Mitigation Measure HWQ-2b to prepare a stormwater quality management plan and incorporate urban BMPs into the project design.

The City and Cachil Dehe Band of Wintun Indians should be responsible for preparing stormwater quality management plans and incorporating similar BMPs as part of their projects. The City should implement applicable policies and implementing actions in its GPU to reduce urban-related pollutants (Policy PRC- 7.1; Implementing Action LU-6.3.g). Note that this is beyond the County's legal is ability to implement.
Significance Level After Mitigation: If these measures are implemented, impacts on water quality of the Sacramento River would be less than significant.
Cumulative Impact HWQ-2: Development of the project area, the upstream section of the City, and the remaining portions of the Park would result in increased stormwater flows in the unnamed
ditch and downstream drainages.

Surface runoff from the project area, the eastern portion of the City of Colusa, and the remaining portions
of the Park drains into the unnamed ditch running through the Park and is conveyed to the Colusa Drain
and eventually to the Sacramento River. Development of these areas would increase the volume of
surface flows being discharged into the ditch and into downstream surface waters and could cause the ditch to exceed its capacity during major storm events, resulting in a significant cumulative impact related to localized flooding. The unnamed ditch has capacity to convey up to 105 cfs and would be capable of receiving increased flows from the proposed project without resulting in flooding; however, increased runoff from upstream development could exceed capacity of the ditch.
The City has indicated that current and future City development upstream of the Park has been planned to drain through the Park. Buildout of the portion of the City upstream of the project area could cause the ditch to exceed capacity during storm events when combined with increased runoff generated by the
proposed project and development of the remaining sections of the Park. The increased runoff could cause localized flooding in the Park, including within the project area, at the airport, on downstream properties, and upstream of the project area, if flows back up in the ditch. This would be a significant cumulative
impact.

Significance Level Before Mitigation: Significant.
Mitigation Measure Cumulative HWQ-2a: Maintain, and widen as necessary, the unnamed ditch in the
Park.

The project will implement Mitigation Measure HWQ-2a to maintain and widen the unnamed ditch in the Park. In addition, the County and City should ensure new projects provide additional stormwater retention or detention to limit surface runoff to pre-development rates.

Environmental Impact Report 5-15

Cumulative Impacts General Plan Amendment and Zoning Amendment Colusa Industrial Properties
Mitigation Measure Cumulative HWQ-2b: Implement master drainage plans to assure downstream drainages can accommodate increased runofffrom new projects.
The County will ensure new development in the unincorporated County prepares a master drainage plan
to identify measures to reduce and control surface runoff and minimize the effects on downstream
drainages. The project will implement Mitigation Measure HWQ-2c to prepare a master drainage plan.
The City should be responsible for preparing master drainage plans as part of its projects. The City should implement applicable implementing actions in its GPU to control surface runoff in developed areas (Implementing Action LU-6.3.g). Note that this is beyond the County's legal ability to implement.

Significance Level After Mitigation: If these measures are implemented, impacts on downstream
drainages would be less than significant.

Cumulative Impact HWQ-3: The proposed and related projects would result in a minor reduction in groundwater recharge in the Colusa Subbasin.
Development of the proposed and related projects would result in an increase in impervious surfaces, which would increase surface runoff and decrease groundwater recharge in developed areas. The reduction in groundwater recharge would be minimal because the majority of recharge within the Colusa Subbasin occurs within the foothills where more coarse grained sediments are exposed at the surface and
along streams and rivers, such as the nearby Sacramento River. The proposed and related projects, therefore, would not result in a significant cumulative impact related to groundwater recharge.
Significance Level: Less than significant because the reduction in groundwater recharge would be minimal.

Cumulative Impact HWQ-4: The proposed and related projects would increase groundwater use in the Colusa Subbasin, but would have a minimal effect on groundwater levels.
The proposed and related projects would increase groundwater pumping for water supply within the Colusa Subbasin. The project would increase groundwater use by approximately 153 million gallons per year, which represents a 0.15 percent increase in pumpage within the county. The Colusa GPU water demand is estimated at 8,839 acre-feet per year at full buildout, which is less than the current demand by approximately 194 acre-feet per year (City of Colusa 2007a). The overall decrease in demand is a result of conversion of agricultural uses, which typically generate more demand, to urban uses. Groundwater resources in the aquifer are not in overdraft, so cumulative increases in pumpage within the county would not create a significant groundwater impact.

Significance Level: Less than significant because the increased demand on groundwater use in the
Colusa Subbasin would have a minimal effect on groundwater levels.
Cumulative Impact HWQ-5: The proposed and related projects would include uses that could adversely affect groundwater quality within the Colusa Subbasin.
The project would increase wastewater generated within the Park and would involve land application of treated effluent, which could result in adverse effects on groundwater quality if effluent percolates into the groundwater aquifer. The Colusa GPU would involve land uses that would generate pollutants that could percolate into the groundwater aquifer, especially in areas where stormwater runoff is temporarily detained. Increased pollutants in developed areas could adversely affect groundwater quality, resulting in significant cumulative impacts.

Significance Level Before Mitigation: Significant.
Mitigation Measure HWQ-5: Comply with Waste Discharge Requirements issued by the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board.
The County will ensure new development in the unincorporated County obtains and complies with Waste
Discharge Requirements (WDRs), as required. The project will implement Mitigation Measure HWQ-5 to
comply with revised WDRs to be issued by the Central Valley RWQCB.
The City should be responsible for ensuring its projects obtain and comply with WDRs, as required. The City should implement applicable policies and implementing actions in its GPU to reduce pollutants in developed areas and minimize adverse effects on groundwater quality (Policy PRC-7.1; Policy PRC-9.2; Policy SAF-4.3; Implementing Action SAF-4.1.a). Note that this is beyond the County's legal ability to implement.

Significance Level After Mitigation: If this measure is implemented, impacts on groundwater quality of the Colusa Subbasin would be less than significant.

5.3.8 Hazards and Hazardous Materials
Cumulative Impact HHM-1: Colusa County Airport operations would expose residents, visitors, and workers to health and safety risks associated with routine crop-dusting.
The proposed project and Colusa GPU include residential land uses within the Colusa County Airport overflight zone, which would be incompatible with the Colusa County Airport CLUP. The CLUP only allows single-family residential uses within the overflight zone at a density of at least five acres per residence in order to minimize the number of people exposed to potential hazards with aircraft accidents. Other uses within the overflight zone would also expose people to potential hazards from aircraft
operations. Additionally, routine crop-dusting would expose residents and others within the flight path of the crop-dusting planes to potential hazards from chemical spills (pesticides, fungicides, and herbicides). The exposure of a substantial number of people to hazards associated with airport operations would be a significant cumulative impact.

Significance Level Before Mitigation: Significant.
Mitigation Measure: No feasible mitigation measures are available to reduce this impact (see Section
4.10).

Significance Level After Mitigation: Significant and unavoidable because no feasible mitigation measures exist to reduce exposure of a substantial number of people to health and safety risks
associated with airport operations.

5.3.9 Biological Resources
Cumulative Impact BR-1: Land conversion for the proposed and related projects would cause a cumulative loss of wildlife habitat and adverse impacts on special status species.
Buildout of the Colusa GPU would convert large tracts of undeveloped farmland to urban uses and could result in a loss of some wetlands, riparian habitat, and native trees. Buildout of the Park would convert old
agricultural fields and disturbed habitat to industrial uses. The project would convert old agricultural

Environmental Impact Report 5-17

General Plan Amendment and Zoning Amendment Cumulative Impacts Colusa Industrial Properties

fields and disturbed habitat, remove a few oak trees, and would convert three acres of farmland to developed uses. The cumulative loss of agricultural habitat in the area would result in a loss of foraging habitat for various migratory and non-migratory birds, mammals, and possibly special status wildlife and could result in the loss of nesting habitat for waterfowl, other migratory birds, and special status wildlife. Although the project's impacts would be minor, the cumulative loss of habitat would be a significant a cumulative impact.
Significance Level Before Mitigation: Significant.
Mitigation Measure Cumulative BR-1: Avoid adverse impacts to biological resources, and provide appropriate mitigation to offset unavoidable adverse impacts.
The County will ensure new development in the unincorporated County complies with applicable biological regulations (i.e., federal and state Endangered Species Acts, Clean Water Act), as required, and implements mitigation measures to avoid impacts to biological resources where feasible and offset unavoidable impacts through habitat replacement or other measures. For impacts to federally or state listed species, applicants may be required to consult with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service or California Department of Fish and Game and obtain incidental take permits. Impacts to waters of the U.S. would require permitting through the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. These regulatory agencies would identify appropriate mitigation, in coordination with the applicant, to fully mitigate impacts to biological resources. Typical mitigation would include replacing habitat, either through an on-site or off-site conservation easement or use of an existing mitigation bank; construction avoidance measures, such as establishing buffers around active nest sites, limiting construction to the non-breeding period, or using construction fencing around avoidance areas; and transplanting sensitive plant populations or relocating sensitive wildlife to a suitable off-site location.

The City should be responsible for ensuring its projects comply with applicable biological regulations, as required, and implement appropriate mitigation measures to reduce impacts. The City should implement applicable policies in its GPU to avoid or reduce impacts to biological resources (Policy PRC-1.1; Policy PRC-1.2; Policy PRC-6.1; Policy PEC-6.2; Policy PRC-9.1). Note that this is beyond the County's legal ability to implement.

Significance Level After Mitigation: If this measure is implemented, impacts on biological resources would be less than significant.

5.3.10 Agricultural Resources
Cumulative Impact AR-1: The proposed and related projects would convert a substantial amount of farmland, resulting in a cumulative loss of farmland and a reduction in agricultural productivity
in the County.

Buildout of the Colusa GPU would convert a substantial amount of Prime Farmland to urban uses; buildout of the Park would convert Unique Farmland and Farmland of Local Importance to industrial uses; casino expansion could convert several acres of Prime Farmland to casino and hotel uses; and the project would convert 2 acres of Prime Farmland and 1 acre of Unique Farmland for site development. Farmland conversion caused by the proposed and related projects would result in a significant cumulative
impact.

Significance Level Before Mitigation: Significant.

Environmental Impact Report 5-18

Cumulative Impacts General Plan Amendment and Zoning Amendment
Colusa Industrial Properties

Mitigation Measure Cumulative AR-l: Provide conservation easements or other preservation areas to protect large blocks of existing farmland in Colusa County in perpetuity.
The County, City, and the Cachil Dehe Band of Wintun Indians will be responsible for performing environmental evaluations (CEQA or their equivalent) for future projects proposed within their jurisdictions. The analyses will include evaluations of farmland conversion and consistency with the applicable farmland preservation policies of their respective planning documents and will require mitigation of significant environmental impacts when feasible. Such mitigation may include establishment of conservation easements to protect large blocks of existing farmland in Colusa County in perpetuity. The applicants would be responsible for acquiring the land and protecting it from future land conversion to ensure agricultural productivity in the County continues. Note that the implementation of this measure for City and Cachil Dehe Band projects is beyond the County's legal ability to implement.
Significance Level After Mitigation: Significant and unavoidable because, notwithstanding CEQA and other environmental reviews, it is probable that future projects would contribute to further farmland conversion and result in a net loss of agricultural land in the County.

5.3.11 Significant and Unavoidable Impacts
Cumulative Impact N-1: The proposed and related projects would increase traffic noise levels along State Route 20 and would expose existing and new residents and commercial tenants to significant noise levels.
Cumulative Impact N-2: The proposed and related projects within the Colusa County Airport overflight corridor would expose sensitive receptors to excessive noise levels from aircraft overflights.
Cumulative Impact AQ-1: The proposed and related projects would generate short-term construction- related dust and vehicle emissions that would exceed established emissions thresholds for ROG, NOx,
and PM10, resulting in adverse effects on local air quality.
Cumulative Impact AQ-2: The proposed and related projects would result in long-term stationary and mobile emissions that exceed air quality thresholds for ROG, NOx, and PM10,

Cumulative Impact HHM-1: Colusa County Airport operations would expose residents, visitors, and workers to health and safety risks associated with routine crop-dusting.
Cumulative Impact AR-1: The proposed and related projects would convert a substantial amount of farmland, resulting in a cumulative loss a of farmland and a reduction in agricultural productivity in the County.

6. CLIMATE CHANGE

This section defines climate change and greenhouse gasses, presents the current legislation and programs to address climate change in California, analyzes potential impacts to climate change from the project, and provides mitigation measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

6.1 INTRODUCTION
Climate change refers to any significant change in measures of climate (such as temperature, precipitation, or wind) lasting for an extended period (decades or longer) (EPA 2007). Climate change may result from:

Natural factors, such as changes in the sun's intensity or slow changes in the Earth's orbit around
the sun;
Natural processes within the climate system (e.g. changes in ocean circulation);
Human activities that change the atmosphere's composition (e.g. through burning fossil fuels) and the land surface (e.g. deforestation, reforestation, urbanization, desertification, etc.)
Human activities, such as fossil fuel combustion, release photochemically important gasses, termed greenhouse gasses (GHGs). GHGs are effective in trapping infrared radiation which otherwise would have escaped the atmosphere, thereby warming the atmosphere (EPA 2007).

6.1.1 Greenhouse Gases and Global Climate Change

Greenhouse Gases
GHGs are any gas that absorbs infrared radiation in the atmosphere (EPA 2007). GHGs, as defined in Assembly Bill 32 (AB 32), includes the following gasses: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous
oxide (N20), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SFG). A brief summary of each GHG is summarized below (EPA 2007):

Carbon Dioxide (CO2)
A naturally occurring gas and also a by-product of burning fossil fuels and biomass as well as land use
changes and other industrial processes (EPA 2007). It is the principal anthropogenic greenhouse gas that affects the Earth's radiative balance.

Methane (CH4)
A hydrocarbon that is greenhouse gas with a global warming potential most recently estimated at 23 times that of CO2. Methane is produced through anaerobic (without oxygen) decomposition of waste in landfills, animal digestion, decomposition of animal wastes, production and distribution of natural gas
and petroleum, coal production, and incomplete fossil fuel combustion.

Environmental Impact Report 6-1

General Pian Amendment and Zoning Amendment
Climate Change Colusa Industrial Properties

Nitrous Oxide (N2O)
N2O is a powerful greenhouse gas with a global warming potential of 296 times that of CO2. Major sources of nitrous oxide include soil cultivation practices, especially the use of commercial and organic fertilizers, fossil fuel combustion, nitric acid production, and biomass burning.

Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)
Compounds introduced as alternatives to ozone depleting substances in serving many industrial, commercial, and personal needs. HFCs are emitted as by-products of industrial processes and are also used in manufacturing. They do not significantly deplete the stratospheric ozone layer but they are powerful greenhouse gasses with global warming potential ranging from 140 to 11,700 times that of CO2.

Perfluorocarbons (PFCs)
These chemicals were introduced along with hydrofluorocarbons as alternatives to ozone depleting substances. In addition, PFCs are emitted as by-products of industrial processes and are also used in manufacturing. PFCs do not deplete the stratospheric ozone layer but they are powerful greenhouse gasses with global warming potential ranging from 5,700 to 11,900 times that of CO2.

Sulfur Hexafluoride (SF6)
A colorless gas soluble in alcohol and ether, slightly soluble in a water, with a global warming potential
22,200 times that of CO2. SF6 is a very powerful greenhouse gas used primarily in electrical transmission and distribution systems and as a dielectric in electronics.

6.1.2 Global Climate Change
A series of reports issued by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has synthesized the results of recent scientific studies of climate change (UNIPCC 2007a, 2007b, 2007c). Key findings of these reports include the following:
Global atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide have increased
markedly as a result of human activities since 1750, and now far exceed pre-industrial levels.
Global increases in carbon dioxide concentration are due primarily to fossil fuel use and land use change, and global increases in methane and nitrous oxide are due primarily to agriculture.
Warming of the global climate due to GHGs is unequivocal, as evidenced by increases in air and
water temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice, and rising global average sea level. Most of the increase in global average temperatures since the mid-twentieth century is very likely due to increases in GHGs from human activities. GHG emissions increased 70 percent between 1970 and 2004.
Numerous long-term climate changes observed have included changes in arctic temperatures and ice, precipitation, ocean salinity, wind patterns, and the frequency of extreme weather events such as droughts, heavy precipitation, heat waves, and tropical cyclone intensity.
Continued GHG emissions at current rates would cause further warming and climate change during the twenty-first century that would very likely be larger than that observed in the twentieth
century.

Environmental Impact Report 6-2

General Plan Amendment and Zoning Amendment
Climate Change Colusa Industrial Properties

Climate change is expected to have adverse impacts on water resources, ecosystems, food and
forest products, coastal systems and low-lying areas, urban areas, and public health. These
impacts will vary regionally.

6.1.3 California GHG Emissions and Climate Change
In California, the main sources of GHG emissions are from the transportation and energy sectors. According to the California Air Resources Board (CARB) draft GHG emission inventory for the year
2004, 39 percent of GHG emissions result from transportation and 25 percent of GHG emissions result
from electricity generation. California produced 497 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent (MMtCO2e)
in 2004 (CARB 2007). California produces about 2 percent of the world's GHG emissions.

The potential effects of future climate change on California resources include (CCCP 2007):

Air temperature: increases of 3-10.4 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century, depending on
the aggressiveness of GHG emissions mitigation
Sea level rise: 6-30 inches by the end of the century, depending on the aggressiveness of GHG
emissions mitigation
Water resources: reduced Sierra snowpack, reduced water supplies, increased water demands,
changed flood hydrology
Forests: changed forest composition, geographic range, and forest health and productivity
Ecosystems: changed habitats, increased threats to certain endangered species
Agriculture: changed crop yields, increased irrigation demands
Public health: increased respiratory illness and weather-related mortality

6.2 CALIFORNIA CLIMATE CHANGE LEGISLATION AND PROGRAMS

6.2.1 Vehicle Climate Change Standards
With the passage of AB 1493 (Chapter 200, Statutes of 2002), California moved to the forefront of reducing vehicle climate change emissions. This bill required the state to develop and adopt regulations that achieve the maximum feasible and cost-effective reduction of climate change emissions emitted by passenger vehicles and light duty trucks. Regulations were adopted by CARB in September 2004. CARB analysis of this regulation indicates emissions savings of 1 MMtC02e by 2010 and 30 (MMtCO2e) tons C02 equivalent by 2020. For these standards to go into effect, EPA must approve a waiver of Clean Air Act requirements to allow California (and other states) motor vehicle standards to exceed federal
standards.

6.2.2 Assembly Bill 32
In September 2006, the Governor signed into law the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (Assembly Bill 32, Health & Safety Code Secs. 38500 et seq.). This law requires CARB to design and implement emission limits, regulations, and other measures, such that statewide GHG emissions are reduced in a technologically feasible and cost-effective manner to 1990 levels by 2020 (representing a 25
percent reduction). The following summarizes outputs from AB 32 to date.

Environmental Impact Report 6-3

Climate Change General Plan Amendment and Zoning Amendment
Colusa Industrial Properties

Early Action Plans At the June 21, 2007 CARB hearing, 37 early actions were approved, including three strategies that were determined to meet the statutory definition of "discrete early actions." On September 7, 2007, CARB released a list of additional early action measures and discrete early actions. CARB staff will present recommendations at the October 25-26 board hearing.
Draft Emission Inventory AB 32 requires that CARB determine the statewide 1990 GHG emission levels to be achieved by 2020. The most recent version of the emission inventory was presented at a workshop on August 13, 2007. CARB will release a draft staff report on the emission inventory in fall 2007, and the inventory will go to the Board for consideration at the hearing in December 2007.
Draft Mandatory Reporting Requirement AB 32 also requires that CARB adopt a regulation to require the mandatory reporting and verification of GHG emissions. A preliminary draft of the reporting requirement regulation was presented at a workshop on August 15, 2007. CARB staff will use the comments received
a to prepare a proposed regulation and staff report to be released on October 19, 2007 for a formal 45-day
comment period. The regulation and staff report will go to the Board for consideration at the hearing in December 2007.

6.2.3 Senate Bill 1368
SB 1368 (Public Utilities Code Sections 8340 et seq.) is an AB 32 companion bill that was signed into law in 2006. It requires the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) to establish a GHG performance standard for baseload generation from investor-owned utilities and the California Energy Commission (CEC) to establish a similar standard for publicly-owned utilities. These standards may not exceed the GHG emission rate from a baseload combined-cycle natural gas fired plant. The bill also requires all imported electricity provided to California to be generated from plants meeting CPUC and CEC standards.

6.2.4 Renewable Portfolio Standard Program
The CPUC and CEC coordinate the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS), which calls for more energy to come from clean, renewable sources such as wind and sun. In 2003, the Governor called for an
acceleration of the RPS to 20 percent by 2010 rather than 2017; this goal was codified by SB 107 (Chapter 464, Statutes of 2006). In 2005, the Governor called for an acceleration of the RPS to 33 percent by 2020.

6.2.5 Senate Bill 97
The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) requires the Office of Planning and Research (OPR) to prepare and develop proposed guidelines for implementation of CEQA by public agencies. Accordingly, SB 97 (Chapter 185, Statutes of 2007) requires OPR to develop guidelines for the feasible mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions or the effects of greenhouse gas emissions by July 1, 2009. The Resource Agency must certify and adopt those guidelines by January 10, 2010. Until these guidelines are adopted, there is no formal guidance on how to conduct climate change analyses in CEQA documents.

6.2.6 Governor's Executive Orders
Executive Order S-3-05 was signed in 2005. The Executive Order calls for a reduction of GHG emissions
to 2000 levels by 2010; a reduction of GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2020; and a reduction of GHG

Environmental Impact Report 6-4

General Plan Amendment and Zoning Amendment
Climate Change Colusa Industrial Properties

emissions to 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050. The order directs the California Environmental Protection Agency (CalEPA) secretary to coordinate development and implementation of strategies to achieve the GHG reduction targets in conjunction with the secretary of Business, Transportation and
Housing Agency, the secretary of the Department of Food and Agriculture, the secretary of the Resources
Agency, the chairperson of the Air Resources Board, the chairperson of the CEC, and the president of the
CPUC.

CalEPA developed the Climate Action Team made up of representatives from the agencies listed above to implement the strategies to reduce GHG emissions. The order also includes a reporting requirement for the CalEPA to the governor and legislature. The first report was released in March 2006 (CalEPA 2006), and a report will be issued bi-annually in the future. The Climate Action Team has also issued a report on proposed early actions to mitigate climate change in California (CAT 2007).
Executive Order S-1-07, the Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) (issued on January 18, 2007), calls for a reduction of at least 10 percent in the carbon intensity of California's transportation fuels by 2020. The executive order instructed the CalEPA to coordinate activities between the University of California, the CEC. and other state agencies to develop and propose a draft compliance schedule to meet the 2020 target. Furthermore, the order directed CARB to consider initiating regulatory proceedings to establish and implement the LCFS. In response, CARB identified the LCFS as an early action item with a regulation to be adopted and implemented by 2010.

6.3 IMPACT ANALYSIS

6.3.1 Methodology
GHG emissions associated with the project were estimated using CO2 emissions as representative of CH4, N20, HFCs, PFCs, and SF6. Emissions of the latter pollutants were not separately estimated; therefore, the total GHGs associated with the project would be greater than the CO2 emissions calculated here. The analyses considered operations emissions only; project construction would generate additional CO2 emissions which are minor when compared to operational emissions.

Operation Emissions
Operation emissions were estimated using the same methodology as used in the City of Colusa General Plan Update Draft EIR (City of Colusa 2007). The following CO2 emissions factors were used:

Residential energy use: 44,130 lbs/yr CO2 per dwelling unit
Commercial energy use: 11.356 lb/yr CO2 per square foot
Transportation: 294.4 lbs/yr C02 per daily vehicle mile traveled (VMT)

Methodology Uncertainties
Several uncertainties affect the CO2 emissions estimates presented in this EIR:

The analysis assumes today's CO2 emissions factors will apply in future years. The extent to which construction and operations emissions factors will change in the future is unknown. It is

Environmental Impact Report 6-5

General Plan Amendment and Zoning Amendment Climate Change Colusa Industrial Properties
likely that AB 32 and other GHG regulatory programs will reduce at least some of these emissions factors.
The analysis assumes all CO2 emissions associated with the project are "new." However, some of these emissions would actually be "redistributed" from existing developments in other locations, but the extent of this redistribution is uncertain.
Although it is possible to calculate the project's incremental CO2 emissions, it is not possible to demonstrate that the project's relatively minor incremental contribution to global GHG emissions would contribute to global climate change effects.

6.3.2 Criteria for Determining Significance
Specific significance criteria for GHG emissions have not been developed under CEQA. However, for this project, adverse impacts to climate change would be considered significant if the project would:
Generate a substantial increase in GHG emissions relative to existing conditions.

6.3.3 Impacts and Mitigation Measures
Impact CC-1: Project operation would generate 10,270 metric tons of CO2 per year.

Using the emissions factors presented previously, the project would generate the following CO2 emissions:

Residential energy use: 12,621,000 lbs/yr
Commercial energy use: 1,323,900 lbs/yr
Transportation: 8,697,100 lbs/yr
Total: 22,642,000 lbs/yr, equal to 10,270 metric tons/yr
The project's CO2 emissions represent about 3.4 percent of the City of Colusa General Plan Update
buildout emissions of 658,226,000 lbs/yr (City of Colusa 2007).
California GHG emissions in 2004 were estimated to be 497 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent per year (CARB 2007). The project's operational CO2 emissions (0.01 million metric tons) represent a very small fraction of this total. Even if project construction emissions and project emissions of GHGs other than C02 were added to project operational emissions, project emissions would still represent a very small fraction of the state's GHG emissions. Nevertheless, the project's incremental contributions to GHG emissions are considered cumulatively significant because they are considered substantial increases compared to existing undeveloped land uses in the project area,

Significance Level Before Mitigation: Significant.
Mitigation Measure CC-1: Implement measures to reduce GHG emissions from energy use.
To reduce GHG emissions from direct and indirect energy use, the applicant will be required to:
Ensure only EPA Phase II certified stoves are used, and equip residential structures with front and rear electric outlets (see Mitigation Measure AQ-2a)

Environmental Impact Report 6-6

General Plan Amendment and Zoning Amendment Climate Change Colusa Industrial Properties
Meet or exceed the latest Title 24 energy efficiency standards applicable to the project (Title 24 standards are energy efficiency standards for residential and non-residential buildings established by Title 24, Part 6 of the California Code of Regulations)
Mitigation Measure CC-2: Implement measures to encourage alternative modes of transportation.
To reduce VMT, the project applicant will be required to:
Create a bicycle path/walkway between the project area and City of Colusa, and encourage use of
dial-a-ride services (see Mitigation measure AQ-2b)
Provide bicycle parking facilities for residential and non-residential uses
Provide easy pedestrian access and minimize barriers between the project's residential and non- residential uses
Identify and reserve a bus stop site for use if transit services are extended to the project area.
Significance Level After Mitigation: Significant and unavoidable because it is not possible to calculate the effectiveness of these mitigation measures in reducing GHG emissions. With mitigation, project GHG emissions would likely still be substantial compared to existing conditions.

Growth-Inducing Effects Colusa Industrial Properties

7. GROWTH-INDUCING EFFECTS
According to Section 15126.2(d) of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) guidelines, Environmental Impact Reports (EIRs) must discuss growth-inducing effects of the project. Section 15126.2(d) states the EIR will:

Discuss the ways in which the proposed project could foster economic or population growth, or the construction of additional housing, either directly or indirectly, in the surrounding environment.

The project would include the development of 286 residential units with an estimated population of 860 persons. The project area would include provision of some commercial services, which would likely meet some of the needs for the new population because of their close proximity. The new residential development could generate indirect demand for other services such as banks, grocery stores, and various retail stores. Additionally, the provision of commercial services along SR 20 south of the City of Colusa could generate a demand for new homes in the undeveloped areas on the east side of SR 20. These demands could lead to future commercial and residential development close to the project area, which would be a growth-inducing effect.
The project would extend Farinon Road through the project area to Wescott Road. This road would provide new access to adjacent parcels currently in agricultural production west of the project area. As a result of improved access and potential conflicts between agricultural and project activities, development pressure on these parcels would increase, which would be a growth-inducing effect.
The project would involve construction of a new wastewater treatment facility, but the facility is being designed to serve the project's uses and domestic wastewater requirements for the Park. Sewer lines, as
well as water lines and drainage facility improvements, would be constructed within the Park. These
facilities would not be designed to serve surrounding lands or future uses in the vicinity and would not be
expected to have growth-inducing effects.

General Plan and Zoning Amendment Alternatives to the Project Colusa Industrial Properties

8. ALTERNATIVES TO THE PROJECT

8.1 INTRODUCTION
The analysis of alternatives is an important element of the Environmental Impact Report (EIR) process. CEQA Guidelines Section 15126.6(a) requires an evaluation of "…a range of reasonable alternatives to the project, or to the location of the project, which would feasibly attain most of the basic objectives of the project but would avoid or substantially lessen any of the significant effects of the project, and evaluate the comparative merits of the alternatives." The project objectives are stated in Section 3.2.1 (Project Objectives). Alternatives are used to determine whether or a not a variation of the project would reduce, or eliminate, significant project impacts within the basic framework of the objectives. CEQA Guidelines Section 15126.6(f) specifies that the range of alternatives is governed by the "rule of reason," requiring evaluation of only those alternatives "necessary to permit a reasoned choice." Further, an EIR "..need not consider an alternative whose effect cannot be reasonably ascertained and whose implementation is remote and speculative" (CEQA Guidelines Section 15126.6(f)(3)).
CEQA Guidelines Section 15126.6(e) requires that, among other alternatives, a "No a Project" alternative be evaluated in comparison to the project. CEQA Guidelines Section 15126.6(e)(2) requires that the No Project analysis discuss "…what would be reasonably expected to occur in the foreseeable future if the project were not approved, based on current plans and consistent with available infrastructure and community services." Accordingly, the No Project alternative analyzed in this EIR discusses buildout of the project area according to its existing land use and zoning designations.
CEQA Guidelines Section 15126.6(d) requires an EIR to discuss significant effects caused by the alternative, but permits the evaluation to be conducted in less detail than is done for the project. Potential environmental impacts for each alternative are provided in comparison to the project. The advantages and disadvantages of each alternative, compared to the project, are presented. Any significant impacts created or avoided exclusively by an alternative are also identified. Additionally, the feasibility and ability of each alternative to meet project objectives was evaluated. Table 8-1 provides a summary of the project alternatives analyzed and their environmental advantages and disadvantages. The project objectives, as defined in Chapter 3, include:
Create a mixed-use community that can serve as the gateway to the City of Colusa and provides superior quality development with an aesthetically pleasing landscape.
Provide a mix of uses and facilities that create a positive financial impact on the County over the long term.
Provide a recreational area that benefits the community and increases tourism revenue in the County and City of Colusa.
Accommodate a percentage of future job creation and population growth by providing office and commercial space and residential units in a mix of residential unit types and densities.

Alternatives to the Project General Plan and Zoning Amendment
Colusa Industrial Properties

8.2 DESCRIPTION AND ANALYSIS OF ALTERNATIVES
The following alternatives are evaluated in this chapter and compared to the project:

• No Project Alternative
Development Alternative 1 - Reduced Residential Density
Development Alternative 2 - Reduced Commercial Zoning
Wastewater Alternative - Connect to City Wastewater Facility

8.2.1 No Project Alternative
Under the No Project alternative, Colusa Industrial Properties (CIP) would continue to develop the portion of the project area within the Colusa Industrial Park (Park) with land uses allowed under its current zoning and Declaration of Protective Covenants (DPC). The golf course would not be modified. It is reasonable to assume CIP would propose construction and operation of a wastewater treatment facility similar to the facility currently proposed with sufficient capacity to serve the Park. Under this alternative, CIP would build commercial uses allowed by the DPC and office space in the subdivided parcels that run parallel to SR 20. Gas stations and hotels are not allowed in this area. CIP would also build light industrial uses within the undeveloped portion of the M-PD zone and the remainder of the development area. Similar to the project, this alternative includes all necessary internal infrastructure, including roads and utility lines. This alternative would not include the widening and extension of Farinon Road through the development area to Wescott Road. Table 8-2 shows an estimate of land uses within the development area for the No Project alternative.
The No Project alternative would not meet any of the project objectives because it would not provide a mixed use community (no residential uses) and would not provide recreational opportunities, although it
would accommodate a percentage of future job creation in the County,

Alternatives to the Project Colusa Industrial Properties

Impact Analysis

Land Use
The No Project alternative would be consistent with County General Plan land use and zoning designations and would not require any amendments.
Similar to the project, aircraft-related noise levels would exceed the airport's Comprehensive Land Use Plan (CLUP) and County General Plan exterior noise standards for offices and other commercial uses, but unlike the project, no residential uses would be adversely affected by the noise because these uses are not allowed under current zoning.
This alternative could include construction of buildings and other facilities within the approach-departure zone, which may not be consistent with the CLUP because of safety concerns with potential crashes.
However, the alternative would not construct incompatible residential uses in either the approach/departure zone or overflight zone, which would be an advantage over the project.
Similar to the project, this alternative would create conflicts with uses in the City relating to increased traffic, but the industrial and commercial/office uses would generally be consistent with existing uses in the Park and adjacent agricultural uses, with the provision of adequate buffers and setbacks between active farmland and larger industrial facilities.

Population, Housing, and Employment
Unlike the project, this alternative would not include new housing and would not directly increase the
local population by 860 people. Similar to the project, however, this alternative would generate short-term (i.e. construction) and long-term (i.e., office, commercial, industrial) employment opportunities. The provision of an increased number of long-term jobs could indirectly induce growth by attracting more people to the Colusa area, resulting in an increased demand for new homes and other services.

Public Services
This alternative would increase demand on public services, but at a lower level than the project because it would not include a permanent residential population. Through indirect growth-inducing effects, the demand on police, fire, school, park, and other local services would increase, but these impacts would be mitigable through provision of funding as new homes and commercial/office buildings are built.

Traffic and Circulation
This alternative would generate more daily and peak hour vehicle trips than the project, resulting in longer delays at affected intersections and higher traffic volumes on affected roadways (see Appendix C Traffic Impact Study). Based on industry standard trip generation rates published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers, business park land uses generate 150 daily trips per acre and light industrial uses generate 52 daily trips per acre (Institute of Transportation Engineers 2003). This alternative would, therefore, generate approximately 8,600 new daily trips as compared to the 7,017 new trips (10,500 total trips, including the existing offices) generated by the project and would result in similar traffic impacts as the project.

Environmental Impact Report 8-7

General Plan and Zoning Amendment
Alternatives to the Project Colusa Industrial Properties
Similar to the project, this alternative would incrementally create additional demand for transit services in the Colusa area because it would provide new employment opportunities.

Unlike the project, this alternative would not affect air traffic patterns because it would not include
incompatible residential uses that could result in air traffic being redirected along an overflight corridor or
away from the residential uses. Air traffic patterns would remain similar to current.

Noise
This alternative would generate more daily and peak hour vehicle trips than the project and would, therefore, generate more traffic noise than the project. Traffic noise along SR 20 currently ranges from 69.3 dB to 71.2 dB, exceeding the County's accepted exterior noise levels for office (65 dB), retail (70
dB), and other commercial uses (70 dB). Project-related traffic would result in a further 1.7 dB increase in SR 20 noise levels, affecting land uses along SR 20. Interior noise levels would be reduced through standard construction practices and mitigation measures similar to those identified for the project. The No Project alternative would result in higher increase in traffic noise along SR 20, exacerbating the existing traffic noise levels that exceed County and City exterior noise standards at existing residences within the City and resulting in a significant, unavoidable impact.
Similar to the project, existing aircraft-related noise levels would exceed County and CLUP accepted exterior noise levels for offices and other commercial uses, resulting in a significant and unavoidable impact. Unlike the project, however, aircraft noise levels would not affect residents or hotel guests because residential and hotel land uses are not allowed under current zoning.
Unlike the project, the operation of industrial facilities in close proximity to existing residences in the City could result in increased noise levels and complaints from nearby residents. Industrial noise would
cause a significant but mitigable impact.

Air Quality
This alternative would generate construction emissions over a longer period of time than the project, resulting in air quality violations until the project area is built out with industrial and commercial/office uses. This impact would remain significant and unavoidable because no feasible mitigation measures have been identified that would reduce the construction emissions on all days to levels that would not
substantially contribute to potential air quality violations of PM10 and/or ozone in the project vicinity.
Similar to the project, long-term air quality impacts would consist of mobile source emissions generated by project-related traffic and stationary source emissions generated directly and indirectly by the natural gas and other similar fuels consumed. Long-term emissions would be generated from vehicle trips to and from the project area and fuel combustion related to natural gas and landscape maintenance. This alternative would generate more vehicle trips than the project and would, therefore, generate more vehicle emissions. Because this alternative does not include residential or hotel land uses, stationary emission sources would not include wood stoves or fireplaces. Similar to the project, operations emissions would be expected to exceed the significance thresholds used for ROG, NOx, and PM10, resulting in significant and unavoidable air quality impacts.
Because this alternative would generate more vehicle trips than the project, it would generate more CO emissions. Similar to the project, however, CO emissions would not be expected to exceed CAAQS Co
standards.

General Plan and Zoning Amendment
Alternatives to the Project Colusa Industrial Properties
Because this alternative would include a new wastewater treatment facility similar to the project, it would a result in a significant but mitigable impact related to odor generation; however, fewer complaints would
be expected because the facility would be located at greater distance from residential uses. Unlike the
project, the operation of industrial facilities in close proximity to existing residences in the City could result in additional odor complaints; this would be considered a significant but mitigable impact.

Utilities and Service Systems
Water demand for the No Project alternative would depend on the specific type of industrial uses proposed. Water demand estimates for this alternative would be speculative, but it is assumed that the Park's groundwater wells would supply the necessary demand to serve the uses. Additionally, new industrial facilities would not be allowed unless adequate water supply is available.
Similar to the project, the wastewater treatment facility would accommodate wastewater demand generated by the No Project alternative. This alternative would generate stormwater runoff similar to the project because the acreage of developed land would be similar to the project at buildout of the alternative, and planned drainage facilities, with some modifications identified as mitigation, would accommodate this demand. Similar to the project, the Maxwell Transfer Station and Ostrom Road Landfill would have adequate capacity to serve the No Project alternative.

Hydrology and Water Quality
Similar to the project, increased soil erosion and sedimentation during and after construction, and runoff of urban pollutants following construction, could substantially degrade surface water quality, resulting in significant but mitigable impacts with respect to surface water quality.
Similar to the project, development of the project area for the No Project alternative would cause a minor reduction in groundwater recharge due to a similar acreage of land being developed at buildout and a relatively small increase in groundwater pumping, resulting in a less than significant impact on
groundwater supply.

Similar to the project, land application of treated effluent could contaminate groundwater, but compliance
with waste discharge requirements would ensure that groundwater quality is monitored and contaminants do not exceed acceptable levels in the aquifer.

Geology and Soils
Environmental effects related to geology and soils would be similar to the project. Earthquake hazards, expansive soils, and erosion during construction would cause significant but mitigable impacts.

Hazards and Hazardous Materials
The No Project alternative would result in fewer concerns relating to hazards from truck traffic along SR 20, airplane overflights, crop-dusting operations, and 100-year flood risks because no residential uses would be allowed in the project area. These impacts would be less than significant, except for safety
hazards associated with airport operations because of the presence of workers in the project area.

Environmental Impact Report 8-9

General Plan and Zoning Amendment
Alternatives to the Project Colusa Industrial Properties
Because this alternative would not include a gas station, it would not result in an impact related to routine use of the gas station. Because this alternative would not include the widening and extension of Farinon Road through the development area to Wescott Road, emergency response times would be similar to
current conditions.

Depending on the industrial uses built at the Park, this alternative could increase generation of hazardous
materials and waste compared to the project.

Biological Resources
Environmental effects related to biological resources would be similar to the project because a similar acreage of land would be developed at buildout.

Agricultural Resources
Environmental effects related to agricultural resources would be similar to the project because a similar acreage of land would be developed at buildout and because the No Project Alternative could encourage unplanned population and housing growth in the project vicinity and result in the conversion of adjacent or nearby agricultural lands to non-agricultural uses. This alternative, however, would result in fewer conflicts with adjacent agricultural uses and have less of an indirect effect on productivity of nearby agricultural uses.

Cultural Resources
Similar to the project, ground disturbance for construction activities could affect undocumented cultural resources. This would be a significant but mitigable impact.

Aesthetics
Aesthetic effects would be reduced compared to the project because the industrial and commercial/office uses would generally be consistent with adjacent uses to the south and existing office uses in the Park and
would generate less night lighting than the project. New lighting along SR 20 could adversely affect vision of nighttime drivers, but this would be considered a significant but mitigable impact.

Conclusions
Based on the above analyses, it can be concluded that the No Project alternative would result in similar environmental impacts as the project with the following exceptions. The No Project alternative would not include residences, so it would not directly increase the local population by 860 people, and it would result in a lower demand on public services. This alternative would generate more daily and peak hour vehicle trips than the project and would generate more vehicle noise and emissions than the project, including industrial noise and potential odors. No project residential or hotel land uses would be affected by excessive noise levels near SR 20 or from the airport. Notably, this alternative would not include the widening and extension of Farinon Road through the development area to Wescott Road and therefore would not provide a new route for public and emergency access to the Park from the west. Additionally, the alternative would result in fewer agricultural conflicts. Because this alternative would not include a gas station, it would not result in an impact related to routine use of the gas station. Because highway

Environmental Impact Report 8-10

General Plan and Zoning Amendment
Alternatives to the Project Colusa Industrial Properties
commercial uses (e.g., gas station and hotel) would not be built along SR 20, this portion of the site would require less nighttime lighting and would be less noticeable from SR 20 than the project. Unlike the project, this alternative would be more compatible with the CLUP because of the lack of residences in the overflight zone. Residential uses would not be exposed to hazards from airport operations or other nearby uses, and air traffic patterns would not be modified as a result of the alternative.

This alternative would not be expected to result in significant, unavoidable impacts that would not occur under the project, nor would it reduce any significant, unavoidable impacts to a less than significant level. Also, this alternative would not attain the project objectives to create a mixed-use community or provide residential units in a mix of residential unit types and densities.

8.2.2 Development Alternative 1 - Reduced Residential Density
Under this alternative, all proposed residential land uses would be rezoned Rural Residential (RR) with 5-acre minimum parcel size (Figure 8-1). This housing mix would allow a maximum of 21 residences a instead of 286 units as proposed. All other land uses and project components would be the same as the project. Similar to the project, this alternative includes all necessary internal infrastructure, including roads, utility lines, and the wastewater treatment facility. This alternative would provide consistency with the land use guidelines provided in the airport's CLUP, although concerns regarding noise and hazards would remain.

The Reduced Residential Density alternative would meet all of the project objectives because it would provide a mixed use community, provide recreational opportunities, and accommodate a percentage of future job creation in the County, although it would have less of a financial benefit because of the reduced number of housing units and it would not provide a mix of residential housing types and densities.

Impact Analysis

Land Use
Similar to the project, the Reduced Residential Density alternative would be consistent with County General Plan land use and zoning designations and would not be consistent with General Plan Policies LU-12 and LU-35 because noise standards would be exceeded and safety concerns would remain for residential uses. The rural residential uses would create less of a conflict with adjacent agricultural uses, but increased traffic would create conflicts with uses in the City.

Notably, this alternative would provide the density of residential uses allowed by the CLUP within the overflight zone.

Population, Housing, and Employment
The Reduced Residential Density alternative would substantially reduce the population and housing generated by the project. This alternative would include 21 new residences rather than 286, and would directly increase the local population by 63 residents rather than 860. Similar to the project, this alternative would generate short-term (i.e. construction) and long-term (i.e., office, commercial, industrial) employment opportunities. Given the large lot sizes, however, the provision of low-income housing would be less feasible under this alternative.

Alternatives to the Project Colusa Industrial Properties

Public Services
This alternative would have less demand on public services because it would generate less population growth than the project. As discussed in Section 4.3 (Public Services), the project would cause Burchfield Elementary School to exceed its capacity and would accelerate physical deterioration of the City's park facilities as well as increasing demand on fire, sheriff, and other local services. These are significant but mitigable impacts of the project.
Burchfield Elementary has a remaining capacity of about 30 students. This alternative would generate seven new elementary school students (21 residences x 0.323 elementary students/household 7 = 7 new
students) and would not exceed the capacity of the elementary school. This alternative would therefore reduce this significant but mitigable impact to a less than significant level.

Alternatives to the Project Colusa Industrial Properties
This alternative would generate less demand on City parks than the project. Direct and indirect growth generated by this alternative, however, would accelerate physical deterioration of the City's park facilities, resulting in a significant but itigable impact.

Traffic and Circulation
The Reduced Residential Density alternative would generate substantially fewer vehicle trips than the
project because substantially fewer residences would be constructed. The 286 residences in the project would generate 2,308 new daily vehicle trips; whereas, the 21 residences in this alternative would generate 202 new daily trips. This reduction of 2,100 daily trips represents 30 percent fewer new daily trips than the project. Under this alternative, some significant and unavoidable impacts related to intersection levels of service and roadway traffic volumes may be less than significant.
This alternative would create less additional demand for transit services in the Colusa area than the project. This alternative would also generate less bicycle and pedestrian traffic than the project because it would include fewer residences. This alternative would therefore lessen the project's significant but mitigable impact related to pedestrian and bicycle activity.

Noise
The Reduced Residential Density alternative would generate 30 percent fewer vehicle trips than the project, but would still increase vehicle trips by 70 percent over existing traffic levels. This alternative would therefore increase SR 20 noise levels, exacerbating the current traffic noise levels that exceed
County and City exterior noise standards at existing residences, but this increase would not be as high as the project. The Reduced Residential Density alternative would, therefore, reduce this significant, unavoidable impact, but might not reduce this impact to a less than significant level.
This alternative would include fewer residences, thereby exposing fewer residences to excessive traffic noise levels near SR 20. However, similar to the project, aircraft-related noise levels would exceed County and ALUC accepted exterior noise levels for residential uses, hotels, and other uses, resulting in a significant and unavoidable impact. Under the Reduced Residential Density alternative, however, fewer project residents would be affected because fewer residences would be built.

Air Quality
Although this alternative would include fewer residences, the Reduced Residential Density alternative would involve a substantial amount of construction. Similar to the project, construction-related air quality impacts would remain significant and unavoidable because no feasible mitigation measures have been identified that would reduce the construction emissions on all days to levels that would not substantially contribute to potential air quality violations of PM10 and/or ozone in the project vicinity.
This alternative would generate fewer vehicle trips than the project and would, therefore, generate fewer vehicle emissions, Similar to the project, however, operations emissions would be expected to exceed the significance thresholds used for ROG, NOx, and PM10, resulting in significant, unavoidable air quality
impacts.

Because this alternative would generate fewer vehicle trips than the project, it would generate less CO. Similar to the project, therefore, CO emissions would not be expected to exceed CAAQS CO standards.

Because this alternative would include a new wastewater treatment facility, it would result in a significant but mitigable impact related to odor generation,

Utilities and Service Systems
Water demand for the Reduced Residential Development alternative would be less than the project. Similar to the project, the available capacity of the CIP wells is more than sufficient to supply the estimated demands associated with the Reduced Residential Density alternative; therefore, impacts would
be less than significant.

Similar to the project, the wastewater treatment facility would accommodate wastewater demand generated by this alternative. This alternative would generate stormwater runoff similar to the project, but planned drainage facilities, with some modifications identified as mitigation, would accommodate this

Geology and Soils
Environmental effects related to geology and soils would be similar to the project, except that fewer
residences would be constructed, so fewer buildings would be affected by earthquakes and expansive soil.

Hazards and Hazardous Materials
The Reduced Residential Density alternative would have similar impacts related to releases of hazardous materials from truck traffic along SR 20, routine use of the gas station, airport safety hazards, hazards from routing crop-dusting practices, and 100-year flood risks. All of these impacts would be less than significant, except crop-dusting which is a significant and unavoidable impact. The reduction in residential units would reduce the number of people exposed to substantial hazards from airport operations; however, impacts would not be reduced to a less a than significant level and would not be
mitigable.

Biological Resources
Environmental effects related to biological resources would be similar to the project because similar land
areas would be developed.

Agricultural Resources
Environmental effects related to agricultural resources would be similar to the project because similar
land areas would be developed. Also, the Reduced Residential Density alternative could encourage
unplanned population and housing growth in the project vicinity and result in the conversion of adjacent or nearby agricultural lands to non-agricultural uses. This alternative, however, would include fewer
residents living onsite and would result in fewer indirect effects on productivity of nearby agricultural
uses.

Cultural Resources
Similar to the project, ground disturbance for construction activities could affect undocumented cultural resources. This would be significant but mitigable impact.

Aesthetics
Aesthetic effects would be similar to the project, except views of the site would include fewer residential buildings and more yard area surrounding the residences.

Conclusions
Based on the above analyses, it can be concluded the Reduced Residential Density alternative would result in similar environmental impacts as the project with the following exceptions. The Reduced Residential Density alternative would substantially reduce the population and housing generated by the project and would, therefore, reduce overall demand for public services and generate less traffic. The residential uses would be compatible with the airport CLUP; however, noise levels and safety concerns would still create adverse impacts on project residents.
The Reduced Residential Density alternative would generate 30 percent fewer daily and peak hour vehicle trips than the project. Under this alternative, some significant and unavoidable impacts on intersection levels of service and roadway traffic volumes may be reduced to less than significant. This alternative would generate less vehicle noise and emissions than the project, and fewer project residences would be affected by excessive noise from SR 20. Similar to the project, aircraft-related noise levels would exceed County and ALUC accepted exterior noise levels, but fewer project residents would be affected because fewer residences would be built.

This alternative would not be expected to result in significant impacts that would not occur under the project, but may reduce two significant unavoidable traffic impacts to a less than significant level. This alternative would not attain the project objective of accommodating a percentage of future job creation
and population growth by providing office and commercial space and residential units in a mix of residential unit types and densities. Additionally, the alternative might not be economically feasible because of the restriction on residential land uses within the overflight zone to single-family detached residences with a density of at least five acres per residence.

8.2.3 Development Alternative 2 - Reduced Commercial Zoning
The parcels along Davison Drive south of Sunrise Blvd would retain their Industrial (M) zoning and would not be changed to Community Commercial (C-2) and Highway Commercial (CH) as currently proposed (Figure 8-2). These parcels total 21.67 acres. This alternative would reduce the acreage of commercial uses from 28.19 to 6.52 acres. The 6.52 acres of commercial use would include the existing
business park north of Sunrise Boulevard.

Gas stations, hotels, restaurants, and general retail uses are not allowed in the Industrial (M) zone.
Therefore, the land uses on the parcels along Davison Drive south of Sunrise Blvd would include
additional business park uses.

All other land uses and project components would be the same as the project, including all proposed residential land uses. Similar to the project, this alternative includes all necessary internal infrastructure, including roads, utility lines, and the wastewater treatment facility. This alternative would reduce traffic generated by the project because industrial land uses generate fewer vehicle trips than commercial uses.
The Reduced Commercial Zoning alternative would meet all of the project objectives because it would a provide a mixed use community, provide recreational opportunities, and accommodate a percentage of
future job creation in the County, although it would have less of a financial benefit because of the lack of
retail-type uses.

Impact Analysis

Land Use
Similar to the project, the Reduced Commercial Zoning alternative would be consistent with County General Plan land use and zoning designations and would not be consistent with General Plan Policies
LU-12 and LU-35 because noise standards would be exceeded and safety concerns would remain for residential uses. Similar to the project, the alternative would create conflicts with agricultural uses and uses in the City.

Population, Housing, and Employment
Similar to the project, the Reduced Commercial Zoning alternative would include 286 new residences and would directly increase the local population by 860 residents. Similar to the project, this alternative would generate short-term (i.e. construction) and long-term (i.e., office, commercial, industrial) employment
opportunities.

Public Services
This alternative would generate a similar demand on public services as the project because it would
include the same number of residences as the project and would add the same number of residents to the
project vicinity.

Alternatives to the Project Colusa Industrial Properties

Traffic and Circulation
This alternative would generate fewer daily and peak hour vehicle trips than the project. The project's commercial land uses along Davison Drive would generate 4,436 new daily trips. Business park land uses
generate 150 daily trips per acre (Institute of Transportation Engineers 2003). Under this alternative,
therefore, new business park uses in this 21.67-acre area would generate about 3,250 new daily trips (21.67 x 150 = 3,250 trips). This represents 1,186 fewer daily trips than the project and would therefore result in fewer peak hour vehicle trips. This represents 17 percent fewer new daily trips than the project. Under this alternative, some significant and unavoidable impacts related to intersection levels of service
and roadway traffic volumes may be less than significant.
Similar to the project, the new residences would incrementally create additional demand for transit services in the Colusa area and would increase bicycle and pedestrian traffic in the project area.

Noise
The Reduced Commercial Zoning alternative would generate 17 percent fewer vehicle trips than the project, but would still increase vehicle trips by 83 percent over existing traffic levels. This alternative would therefore increase SR 20 noise levels, exacerbating the current traffic noise levels that exceed
County and City exterior noise standards at existing residences, but this increase would not be as high as
the project. The Reduced Commercial Zoning alternative, therefore, would reduce this significant
unavoidable impact, but not to a less than significant level.
This alternative would not include hotel uses; therefore, hotel guests would not be exposed to excessive noise from SR 20. The Reduced Commercial Zoning alternative would therefore reduce this significant
but mitigable impact related to traffic noise.
Similar to the project, aircraft-related noise levels would exceed County and ALUC accepted exterior noise levels for residential and other uses, resulting in a significant unavoidable impact. Under the Reduced Commercial Zoning alternative, however, aircraft noise levels would not affect project hotel guests because hotels are not allowed in the Industrial zone.

Air Quality
The Reduced Commercial Zoning alternative would involve a substantial amount of construction. Similar
to the project, construction-related air quality impacts would remain significant and unavoidable.
This alternative would generate fewer vehicle trips than the project and would, therefore, generate fewer vehicle emissions. Similar to the project, however, operations emissions would be expected to exceed the significance thresholds used for ROG, NOx, and PM10, resulting in significant, unavoidable air quality
impacts.

Because this alternative would generate fewer vehicle trips than the project, it would generate less CO. Similar to the project, CO emissions would, therefore, not be expected to exceed CAAQS CO standards.
Because this alternative would include a new wastewater treatment facility similar to the project, it would result in a significant but mitigable impact related to odor generation.

Aesthetic effects would be similar to the project, with the following exceptions: because highway commercial uses (e.g., gas station, hotel) would not be built along SR 20, this portion of the site would require less nighttime lighting and would be less noticeable from SR 20 than the project.

Conclusions
Based on the above analyses, it can be concluded the Reduced Commercial Zoning alternative would result in similar environmental impacts as the project with the following exceptions.

This alternative would not be expected to result in significant impacts that would not occur under the project, nor would it reduce any significant unavoidable impacts to a less than significant level. This alternative would partially attain the project objectives of creating a mixed-use community because it would include residential, industrial, and commercial uses, but would not include Community Commercial (C-2) or Highway Commercial (CH), and therefore, would not provide as wide a range of commercial uses as the project. Because this alternative would include less commercial land use than the
project, it might be economically infeasible.

8.2.4 Wastewater Alternative - Connect to City Wastewater Facility

City Wastewater Treatment Plant
is This alternative is being considered because the City of Colusa stated in its July 6, 2006 NOP response letter that the City's wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) will have capacity to serve the project and because this alternative would avoid the need for a new wastewater treatment facility in the Park to serve the proposed residential uses.

Environmental Impact Report 8-22

General Plan and Zoning Amendment Alternatives to the Project Colusa Industrial Properties
City of Colusa owns and operates its own wastewater collection and treatment system. The WWTP has a rated capacity of 0.7 million gallons per day (mgd) and a design capacity of 0.9 mgd. The WWTP is located 2 miles southeast of downtown Colusa on Will S. Green Avenue.

Wastewater is collected and transported to the WWTP by a system of underground sewer collection lines (underground) and lift stations located in City and County roads and right-of-ways. The collection line closest to the Park is a 15-inch diameter line running along Wescott Road, one-quarter mile west of the development area. South of Ashley Drive, a lift station pumps the wastewater into an 8-inch force main that runs west for a mile beneath agricultural fields before reaching the WWTP.
The WWTP treats wastewater using a pond system that produces effluent considered equivalent to secondary effluent produced by conventional mechanical treatment processes. The treated effluent is
disinfected by adding chlorine. After disinfection, residual chlorine is neutralized with sulfur dioxide before the treated effluent is discharged to an unnamed tributary of Powell Slough (ECO:LOGIC 2004).
In March 2002, the Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) issued the City of Colusa's WWTP a cease and desist order (Order No. R5-2002-0021), enforcing the City's compliance with the its Waste Discharge Requirements (WDRs) (Order No. R5-2002-0020). The cease and desist order requires the City to comply with WDR effluent limitations on ammonia and aluminum by February 1, 2007. The RWQCB has not banned new connections to the City's WWTP (Pat Leary 2007).
The City is planning to improve its WWTP to ensure compliance with the WDRs by upgrading to a tertiary treatment system and changing the surface water discharge location to Colusa Basin Drain. The City plans to complete these improvements in approximately one year (i.e., Spring 2008).
The City's project will allow its WWTP to continue operating up to its rated capacity of 0.7 mgd. The City is also contemplating a second phase expansion of its WWTP to accommodate buildout of the City's sphere of influence. The schedule for Phase 2 will be based on demand within the City's service area and has not yet been defined (Ponticello 2007).

The City's WWTP appears to have capacity to accommodate domestic wastewater generated by the Park. The City's WWTP is rated at 0.7 mgd, and the current average daily flow rate is about 0.5 mgd. The wastewater generation for the mixed use project is estimated to be 0.1 mgd, about half of the City WWTP's remaining rated capacity. However, if the project used this 0.1 mgd capacity, there would be less capacity available for future buildout of projects within the City.

Alternative Description
Under this alternative, wastewater from the Park would be treated at the City's WWTP. The applicant would construct a sewer main in the proposed Farinon Road extension from the Park to Wescott Road, then south for about 500 feet to the City's lift station. To ensure the City's collection system would have sufficient capacity to accommodate CIP-generated wastewater, this alternative would include any necessary modifications to the lift station, and construction of a new underground force main (about mile long) to augment or replace the City's 8-inch line between the lift station and the WWTP.
All other land uses and project components would be the same as the project. Similar to the project, this alternative includes all necessary internal infrastructure, including roads and utility lines.

Impact Analysis

Land Use
This alternative would have similar land use impacts to the project.

Population, Housing, and Employment
Similar to the project, the Wastewater Alternative would include 286 new residences and would directly increase the local population by 860 residents. Similar to the project, this alternative would generate short-term (i.e. construction) and long-term (i.e., office, commercial, and industrial) employment opportunities.

Public Services
This alternative would have similar demand on public services because the land uses in the development area would be the same as the project.

Traffic and Circulation
This alternative would have similar traffic and circulation impacts to the project because the land uses in the development area would be the same as the project. Unlike the project, this alternative would likely require temporary lane closure on Wescott Road while a 500-foot section of sewer line is constructed, but this impact would be short term and mitigable.

Noise
This alternative would have similar noise impacts to the project because the land uses in the development area would be the same as the project.

Air Quality
This alternative would have similar air quality impacts to the project because the land uses in the development area would be the same as the project. This alternative would avoid the significant but mitigable impact related to odor generation because no wastewater treatment facility would be constructed onsite. Project-generated wastewater would be treated at the City's WWTP, where odors would not be distinguishable from odors generated by the City's plant.

Utilities and Service Systems
Demand for utilities under this alternative would be similar to the project because land uses in the development area would be the same as the project. Under this alternative, however, no wastewater treatment facility would be built, thereby avoiding any impacts of the project's wastewater treatment facility (as discussed in project Impact U-2, all impacts would be less than significant).

Environmental Impact Report 8-24

General Plan and Zoning Amendment Alternatives to the Project Colusa Industrial Properties

Hydrology and Water Quality
The development component of this alternative would have similar impacts related to surface water quality and groundwater supply because land uses in the development area would be the same as the
project.

Unlike the project, however, this alternative could exacerbate water quality impacts associated with the WWTP's noncompliance with WDR effluent limitations on ammonia and aluminum if connection to the City's WWTP were to occur before the WWTP regains compliance. This would be a significant, unavoidable impact of this alternative.

Geology and Soils
Environmental effects related to geology and soils within the development area would be similar to the project because the same land areas would be developed. This alternative would include construction of a force main and lift station between the proposed intersection of Wescott Road and Farinon Road and the WWTP, which would be about the same length as the proposed sewer line between the development area and CIP's proposed wastewater treatment facility. Geology and soil impacts of this sewer line would be similar to the project's sewer line.

Hazards and Hazardous Materials
This alternative would have similar hazard impacts to the project because the land uses in the development area would be the same as the project.

Biological Resources
Biological effects of the proposed land use changes would be similar to the project because similar land areas would be developed.
This alternative would include construction of a new underground force main across 1 mile of agricultural fields that could support wildlife habitat. Construction impacts to biological resources would be temporary, but could result in a significant but mitigable impact that would not occur under the project.
This alternative would increase the amount of treated effluent discharged to surface waters by the City's WWTP. This alternative would, therefore, exacerbate any impacts to aquatic biology resulting from the WWTP's noncompliance until compliance is achieved. This potential effect would not occur with the project.

Agricultural Resources
Effects on agricultural resources from the proposed land use changes would be similar to the project because similar land areas would be developed. This alternative would not include construction of the proposed wastewater treatment facility and therefore would not result in the loss of 1 acre of Unique Farmland in this location.

This alternative would include a construction of a new underground force main across 1 mile of Prime Farmland between Wescott Road and the City's WWTP. Construction of this force main could

Environmental Impact Report 8-25

General Pian and Zoning Amendment Alternatives to the Project Colusa Industrial Properties
temporarily impair agricultural productivity of this a farmland. This would be a significant impact of this alternative that would not occur with the project.

Cultural Resources
Similar to the project, ground disturbance for construction activities could affect undocumented cultural resources. This would be a significant but mitigable impact.

Aesthetics
Environmental effects related to aesthetics would be similar to the project because similar land areas would be developed.

Conclusions
Based on the above analyses, it can be concluded the Wastewater Alternative would result in similar environmental impacts as the project with the following exceptions. Unlike the project, this alternative would likely require a temporary lane closure on Wescott Road while a 500-foot section of sewer line is constructed. This impact would be short term and mitigable. This alternative would avoid the significant but mitigable impact related to odor generation because no wastewater treatment facility would be built at the Park. Unlike the project, this alternative could exacerbate water quality impacts associated with the WWTP's noncompliance with WDR effluent limitations on ammonia and aluminum if connection to the City's WWTP were to occur before the WWTP regains compliance. This would be a significant, unavoidable impact of this alternative. This alternative would also exacerbate any impacts to aquatic biology resulting from the WWTP's noncompliance until compliance is achieved. This potential effect would not occur with the project. This alternative would eliminate the less than significant impact related to aerosol drift from the proposed wastewater treatment facility at the Park. Construction of a sewer line from the Park to the WWTP could impair farmland productivity and adversely affect wildlife habitat. These would be significant impacts of this alternative that would not occur with the project. The Wastewater Alternative would attain all of the project objectives, but might not be feasible due to concerns with the timing of improvements to the City's WWTP.

8.3 ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED AND REJECTED
CEQA Guidelines Section 15126.6(c) provides that an EIR "should also identify any alternatives that were considered by the lead agency but were rejected as infeasible during the scoping process and briefly explain the reasons underlying the lead agency's determination." One such alternative is an alternative
location.

In determining whether alternative locations for the project need to be considered in an EIR, CEQA Guidelines Section 15126.6(f)(2)(A) states:
The key question and first step in analysis is whether any of the significant effects of the project would be avoided or substantially lessened by putting the project in another location. Only locations that would avoid or substantially lessen any of the significant effects of the project need be considered for inclusion in the EIR.

Environmental Impact Report 8-26

General Plan and Zoning Amendment Alternatives to the Project Colusa Industrial Properties

An important project objective includes creation of a mixed-use community that can serve as the gateway to the City of Colusa. Feasible alternative locations, therefore, must be located near the edge of the City along SR 20 or SR 45, the primary roads entering the City. Locations that meet these criteria include undeveloped or agricultural land east of SR 20/SR 45 near the project area, along SR 20 west of the City, and along SR 45 north of the City.
CEQA Guidelines Section 15126.6(f)(1) further states that site suitability, economic viability, and availability of infrastructure can be used to judge the feasibility of alternatives.
The first location (east of SR 20/SR 45) is near the Colusa County Airport. As shown on Figure 4.5-1, noise levels on this land are similar to noise levels in the development area. This location, therefore, would not avoid or substantially lessen significant unavoidable impacts related to airport noise. The soils underlying the remaining locations are considered Prime Farmland if irrigated (and drained in some cases). These sites are not suitable because moving the project to these locations would convert a substantial amount of Prime Farmland, resulting in a new significant unavoidable impact that would not occur under the project.

Another option considered is the current golf course location. The alternative would require acquisition of the golf course property by CIP and would involve developing all of the proposed residential uses within the golf course property, while redesigning the golf course on land within the Park, where the proposed residential uses would be developed. Under this alternative, however, the residential uses would still be within the overflight corridor of the airport, and safety concerns would remain, although noise concerns would be reduced. This alternative would not be feasible because CIP does not currently have the ability to access or acquire the golf course property, and redesigning the golf course would be economically infeasible.

The economic viability of moving the project to these locations would be a concern. The applicant has owned the Park for many years and moving the project to land not owned by the applicant would require substantial amount of land to be purchased at current market prices.
No feasible alternative locations exist that would avoid or substantially lessen any of the significant effects of the project or that would not result in a new significant unavoidable impact. Alternative locations are not considered further.

8.4 ENVIRONMENTALLY SUPERIOR ALTERNATIVE
As shown by the previous analysis, the Reduced Residential Density alternative can be considered the environmentally superior alternative because it would reduce overall demand for public services; generate the fewest vehicle trips (30 percent fewer than the project), thereby reducing vehicle noise and emissions, and possibly reducing two significant unavoidable traffic impacts to a less than significant level; expose fewer project residents to excessive airport noise and safety concerns; and would not conflict with CLUP land use guidelines for residential uses within the overflight zone. However, the alternative might not be economically feasible because of the restriction on residential land uses within the overflight zone to single-family detached residences with a density of at least five acres per residence.

TRAFFIC IMPACT ANALYSIS FOR
COLUSA INDUSTRIAL PROPERTIES REZONE

INTRODUCTION

This report summarizes KD Anderson & Associates, Inc. analysis of the potential short-term and long-term traffic impacts associated with re-zoning and development of a portion of Colusa Industrial Properties (CIP) in Colusa County, California. As currently proposed, the project involves rezoning 138 acres near the City of Colusa to permit development of 286 residential units and 28 acres of commercial uses. Access to the project would be via Sunrise Blvd and Farinon Road, two existing streets that link the site with SR 20 south of the Colusa city limits. New access to
SR 20 north of Sunrise Blvd would also be created for the multiple family residential portion of the project, and Farinon Road would be extended west to provide additional site access via Wescott
Road.

The location of the project site is presented in Figure 1, while the project site plan is Figure 2,
Study Scope. The purpose of this analysis is to present an assessment of potential project specific and cumulative traffic impacts associated with the project and to suggest feasible measures for mitigating identified impacts. The analysis includes evaluation of existing circulation conditions in the area based on current a.m. and p.m. peak hour traffic. The characteristics of the proposed project have been determined, including estimated trip generation, the directional distribution, and assignment of the project traffic. By superimposing project trips onto existing traffic volumes, the impacts of project traffic on the operating conditions of streets and intersections in the area have been identified.

This report also considers the impacts of the project within the context of two future cumulative traffic conditions. The first cumulative scenario assumes existing traffic plus trips associated with other approved / pending project identified by Colusa County. The second cumulative scenario is based on future traffic volume forecasts based on preliminary information developed for the City of Colusa General Plan Update (GPU) EIR.

Five existing intersections and associated roadway segments were identified for investigation during the study scoping process. The study intersections include:

1. SR 20 (Bridge Street) / Fremont Street
2. SR 20 (Bridge Street) / Sioc Street
3. SR. 20 (Bridge Street) / Wescott Road
4. SR 20 / Sunrise Blvd
5. SR 20 / Farinon Road

The roadway segments analyzed in this report were:

1. Bridge Street (SR 20) north of Fremont Street
2. Bridge Street (SR 20) between Fremont Street and Sioc Street
3. Bridge Street (SR 20) between Wescott Road and Sioc Street
4. SR 20 between Wescott Road and Sunrise Blvd
5. SR 20 between Sunrise Blvd and Farinon Road
6. SR 20 east of Farinon Road 7. Fremont Street between 3ld Street and Bridge Street 8. Sioc Street between 3rd Street and Bridge Street

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY /RECOMMENDATIONS

Existing Conditions. Under existing conditions, the operation of the study area street system meets minimum standards for Level of Service (i.e., LOS C on city streets and county roads and LOS D on state highways through the City of Colusa). While motorists waiting to turn onto SR 20 do experience peak period delays that are indicative of Levels of Service in excess of these minimum
standards, current traffic volume at study intersections do not satisfy traffic signal warrants.
Project Characteristics. The proposed project lies immediately north of the Colusa Airport along SR 20. The project is a mix of residential and commercial uses that is expected to generate approximately 7,017 new daily vehicle trips (i.e., one inbound trip and one outbound trip is two trip ends). Of that total, about 506 trips are expected during the a.m. peak hour, and 531 are expected during the p.m. peak hour. As a comparison, development of the site under current designation would result in 31 acres of office type uses and 76 acres of light industrial uses generating 8,581 daily, 1,156 a.m. and 1,074 p.m. peak hour trips.

Trips generated by the project will have destinations primarily in the City of Colusa, but a portion of the project traffic will be destined for locations in the Yuba City-Marysville area to the east or along the Interstate 5 corridor to the west.

The project includes proposed circulation system improvements. Frontage improvements to SR 20
are already programmed and were started in spring 2007, including development of turn lanes on the state highway. The project will also extend Farinon Road to Wescott Road in a manner that is
consistent with the new City of Colusa General Plan.

Project Impacts. Trips generated by this project were superimposed onto current background traffic volumes, and "plus project" traffic conditions were identified to determine the significance of project impacts.

Development of the project will increase the daily traffic volume on SR 20 in the area between Sioc Street and Fremont Street to a volume that exceeds the minimum Level of Service (i.e., greater than
LOS D). Development of the project will result in Levels of Service in excess of the LOS D minimum at study intersections, but traffic signal warrants are not projected to be met at any intersection. Development of the residential elements of the project will result in the need to create pedestrian facilities via Wescott Road to link the site with Colusa schools.

Cumulative Impacts - Existing Plus Pending / Approved Projects. Colusa County identified three (3) other development projects that were included in an "Existing Plus Approved Projects" background condition. These projects are:
Riverbend Estates: 2,235 low-density residential units, 295 medium-density residential units, on 442 acres, north of Moonbend Road, cast of Bridge Street and SR 20/45, approximately 1.5 miles north of CIP project. This project has not been approved by the City of Colusa and no traffic impact analysis has been conducted.

Traffic Impact Analysis for Colusa Industrial Properties Rezone (Revised October 8, 2007) Page 5

Tennant Estates: 101-lot residential subdivision, approved with traffic study. Hoblit Subdivision: 12-unit single family residential subdivision, under construction.
With the development of Pending projects and the proposed project, the length of minor street approach delays would increase at Bridge Street / Fremont Street intersection, and the Level of Service for motorists waiting to turn on SR 20 would exceed the LOS D threshold. Similarly, very long delays would be expected at the Bridge Street / Wescott Road intersection, and the Level of
Service for motorists waiting to turn north onto Bridge Street would exceed the LOS D minimum. Motorists waiting to turn left onto SR 20 at the SR 20 / Sunrise Blvd intersection would experience delays that are indicative of LOS E.
Cumulative Impacts - City of Colusa General Plan Build Out. The proposed project is consistent with the land uses envisioned under the City of Colusa General Plan Update, and the project's cumulative impacts were included in the traffic study being conducted for the GPU EIR.
By the time that the City of Colusa General Plan is built out, the volume of traffic on many streets in the area of the project will exceed minimum Level of Service thresholds and improvements will be required. SR 20 would need to be improved to a four lane a section, although improvement to this standard may not be possible along the entire length of SR 20 through the City of Colusa. Traffic signals will be required at major intersections along SR 20, and auxiliary turn lanes will be needed to deliver minimum Levels of Service at those locations. The volume of traffic forecast for Wescott Road and Farinon Road in the area of the project is forecast to exceed the LOS C threshold for a collector street, indicating that improvement to arterial standards may eventually be needed. Cumulative impacts to Sioc Street and Fremont Street were also identified.
Mitigations. The proposed project should mitigate its project specific and cumulative impacts by providing the following mitigations measures:

EXISTING SETTING

This report section describes current traffic volume levels and accompanying traffic operations on the roadways and intersections within the study area.

Existing Street System

Regional access to the site will be via SR 20 to the east and west of Colusa. Access to the developed areas of Colusa will be via existing roads such as Wescott Road, Bridge Street, Sioc Street, and Fremont Street. The text that follows describes these facilities.

State Route 20. State Route 20 (SR 20) is the primary regional access to the Colusa area. SR 20 originates at an intersection on SR in Mendocino County and continues easterly across northern California to its junction with Interstate 80 in Nevada County. In Colusa County SR 20 provides access to Interstate 5 in Williams and links the County with the Yuba City-Marysville area to the east. Locally, SR 20 is the main route through the City of Colusa as it enters the east end of the community as 10th Street, continues easterly as Market Street then turns south as Bridge Street before passing the project site. In the vicinity of the proposed project SR 20 is a two lane rural highway with auxiliary turn lanes at major intersections. Today the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) reports that SR 20 carries an Average Daily Traffic (ADT) volume of 9,700 per day in the area south of Moonbend Road, with the volume reported by Caltrans to be 25,000 vehicles per day on Market Street. Trucks comprise 7% of the daily traffic on SR 20 through Colusa. While the reported volume in the area south of Moonbend Road is consistent with spot traffic counts conducted for the City of Colusa GPU, daily volumes counted in the northern part of the study area were lower.

Wescott Road is a Collector street that links southern Colusa with SR 20 at the southern edge of the downtown area. Wescott Road also extends southerly into rural Colusa County. This two lane road varies in width, with limited shoulders available on the south end of the road but more urban features
(i.e., wider shoulder and sidewalks) available near the intersection with SR 20. Traffic counts conducted in 2006 revealed that Wescott Road carried approximately 1,750 ADT in the area south of Cynthia Drive, with the volume rising to 4,550 ADT between SR 20 and Florimond Drive.
Sunrise Blvd. Sunrise Blvd is a Collector street that today provides access to the existing office- commercial development in the Colusa Industrial Park via Davison Court. The existing portion of Sunrise Blvd is a four lane road that extends westerly from SR 20 for one block. Today Sunrise Blvd carries approximately 750 ADT.

Fremont Street and Sioc Street. Fremont Street and Sioc Street are east-west Collectors that link
10th Street (SR 20) and Bridge Street (SR 20) in the area north of the project site. Both are wide two lane roads that accommodate on-street parking and have direct residential frontage. Today both streets carry approximately 5,000 ADT in the area west of Bridge Street.

Traffic Impact Analysis for Colusa Industrial Properties Rezone (Revised October 8, 2007) Page

G

Farinon Road. Farinon Road is a Collector street that extends west from an intersection on SR 20
to serve Colusa Airport as well as the existing industrial development along the west side of the Colusa Airport via Niagra Avenue. This two lane road is relatively wide near SR 20 but narrows to two travel lanes and limited shoulders in the area of Niagra Avenue. Today Farinon Road carries fewer than 250 ADT.

Cynthia Drive, Country Club Drive and Butte Vista Way. Today several local streets link SR 20 with Wescott Road in the area north of the project site. Three local streets intersect SR 20 in this area: Cynthia Drive, Country Club Drive and Butte Vista Drive. These streets are connected to Wescott Road via other local streets such as Tara Drive and Florimond Drive. The volume of traffic
on these local connections is in the range of 1,000 vehicles per day.

Study Intersections

Because the quality of traffic flow on urban streets is typically governed by the operation of major intersections, this analysis assesses current conditions and addresses project impacts at five existing and one future intersection:

1. SR 20 (Bridge Street) / Fremont Street (EB/WB Stop) 2. SR 20 (Bridge Street) / Sioc Street (Signal) 3. SR 20 (Bridge Street) / Wescott Road (EB Stop) 4. SR 20 / Sunrise Blvd (EB Stop)
5. SR 20 / Farinon Road (EB Stop)
6. Wescott Road / Farinon Road Extension (future)

Existing Traffic Volumes

To quantify existing traffic conditions, a.m. and p.m. peak hour traffic counts were made by the consultant at several study intersections in August 2006 to supplement traffic counts conducted for the City of Colusa GPU in June and October 2005. The a.m. and p.m. peak hours were selected as being representative of typical "worst case" background traffic conditions, based on review of daily traffic counts in Colusa and based on the highest hours of project trip generation. This approach is consistent with the analyses contained in other recent EIRs in Colusa County. Observed traffic volumes are presented in Figure 3.

Level of Service: Methodology and Standards

To quantitatively evaluate traffic conditions and to provide a basis for comparison of operating conditions with and without project generated traffic, "Levels of Service" were determined at study area intersections and on individual roadway segments.
"Level of Service" (LOS) is a quantitative measure of traffic operating conditions whereby a letter grade "A" through "F" is assigned to an intersection. LOS "A" through "F" represents progressively worsening traffic conditions. The characteristics associated with the various LOS for intersections are presented in Table 3.

The Colusa County General Plan Circulation Element and the City of Colusa General Plan establish the allowable Level of Service standard for roadways and intersections, while Caltrans has also established goals for state highways. For example, the pending City of Colusa GPU establishes LOS "C" as the applicable standard on city streets but accepts LOS D on state highways. Colusa County's minimum standard is LOS C on County roads. Caltrans strives to maintain LOS C at locations where new construction is anticipated.
For this analysis it has been assumed that LOS C is the minimum standard for all streets and intersections within the City of Colusa that are not on state highways. LOS D is assumed to be the minimum on state highways.
The City's pending GPU includes policies relating to the significance of traffic impacts, as noted below.

Traffic Impact Analysis for Cofusa Industrial Properties Rezone (Revised October 8, 2007) Page 12

Implementing Action CIR-1.1.a: Streets and Roadways Master Plan

The City will prepare, adopt and periodically update a Streets and Roadways Master Plan that establishes LOS C as the minimum acceptable LOS for City streets and intersections. If conditions of LOS D or worse are already present, future proposed projects may not cause roadway volumes to increase by five percent or more and shall be accompanied by other mitigation measures intended to reduce trip generation. LOS D is the minimum standard for state highways.
Levels of Service were calculated for different intersection control types and roadway segments using the applicable methodology contained in the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual.
Signalized Intersections. Procedures used for calculating Levels of Service at signalized intersections are as presented in the Highway Capacity Manual, 2000 edition. In addition to traffic volume, these procedures make use of geometric information and traffic signal timing data to estimate delay by approach and overall delay.
Unsignalized Intersections. The procedure for calculating the Level of Service at unsignalized intersections is based on the relative availability of gaps in traffic and the delay experienced for each movement that must yield the right-of-way. The number of gaps is related to delay and is a function of the volume and speed of conflicting traffic, type of control (stop or yield), and qualitative intersection geometrics. Like signalized intersections where overall traffic operation is described by one Level of Service grade, a Level of Service is calculated for the intersection but can also be calculated for each movement yielding the right-of-way to others. Levels of Service at unsignalized intersections controlled by side street stop signs are indicative of the magnitude of the delay incurred by motorists turning at the intersection. Because these calculations ignore the condition of through traffic flow (which is assumed to flow freely) traffic signal warrant analysis is performed to determine the significance of unsignalized conditions.
While the unsignalized Level of Service may indicate very long delays (i.e., LOS "E") traffic
conditions are generally not assumed to be unacceptable unless a significant number of motorists are delayed. For this analysis, the satisfaction of traffic signal warrants has been used to suggest the significance of unsignalized Level of Service. Meeting signal warrants signifies that an intersection has unacceptable operating conditions, but it does not mean that installation of a signal is the only way to mitigate those conditions. It is often possible to improve an intersection with additional lanes or improved geometrics so that signalization is not necessary. The signal warrant criteria employed for this study are those presented in the California Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices (CMUTCD).

Level of Service based on Roadway Segment Traffic Volume. For planning purposes, it is also possible to suggest the general Level of Service that is likely to occur on roadways based on the observed traffic volumes. The pending City of Colusa GPU EIR introduces daily volume thresholds that can be used for identifying Levels of Service based on roadway segment traffic volumes. These guidelines are presented in Table 4.

Current Levels of Service

Peak Hour Intersection Levels of Service. Current a.m. and p.m. peak hour Levels of Service were calculated at the study intersections (Refer to the Appendix for calculation worksheets) and are summarized in Table 5. Current Levels of Service were compared to adopted standards to determine whether existing conditions are satisfactory.

As noted, one location experiences Levels of Service in excess of the adopted standards. Motorists waiting to turn onto northbound SR 20 at the Wescott Road intersection experience delays that are indicative of LOS E. However, while this individual Level of Service exceeds the LOS D minimum, current traffic volumes do not reach the level that satisfy peak hour volume warrants for signalization.

Roadway Levels of Service. The current roadway segment Level of Service is presented in Table 6. As shown, recent traffic counts conducted for the City of Colusa GPU are indicative of LOS D or better conditions at all locations, with all city streets operating at LOS C or better. However, the Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) published by Caltrans are much higher in some locations and indicate LOS F. This study addresses project impacts to state highways relative to both published and observed daily traffic volumes.

PROJECT IMPACTS

Project Characteristics

Trip Generation. To quantify the amount of vehicular traffic generated by the proposed project, peak hour rates presented in the 7th Edition of the ITE publication Trip Generation were consulted.
Applicable rates are indicated in Table 7.

Table 8 presents estimated site trip generation under the current proposal. As indicated, the project is expected to generate a gross total of 10,497 daily trip ends. Of this total, 3,480 daily trips would be "pass-by" trips drawn to retail uses from passing traffic along SR 20. A total of 7,017 new daily trips are forecast, with 506 trips expected during the a.m. peak hour and 531 trips expected to occur during the p.m. peak hour. As a comparison, development of the site under current designation would result in 31 acres of office / business park type uses and 76 acres of light industrial uses generating 8,581 daily, 1,156 a.m. and 1,074 p.m. peak hour trips.
Trip Distribution and Assignment. The distribution of project trips will reflect the general location of employment, shopping and schools within the Colusa area and the project's location with regard to the regional street system. To quantify the project trip distribution, information developed for the City of Colusa GPU EIR traffic study regarding the location of employment, shopping and schools in Colusa was reviewed. The project's regional trip distribution was identified, as indicated in Table 9. Figure 4 depicts the project-only assignment of trips through the study intersections.

The development of "Existing plus oject" traffic volumes is intended to isolate the specific traffic impacts of the proposed project. Thus, while it is possible and perhaps likely that some traffic generated by existing Colusa residents will use the new routes created by the project, the effect of non-project traffic is not included in these projections but is included under Cumulative traffic
volume forecasts.

Project Traffic Impacts

Existing Plus Project Volumes. Using the trip generation and distribution described above, project generated automobile trips were superimposed onto current background traffic, as indicated in Figure 5. Resulting "Existing Plus Project" Levels of Service were calculated for the study intersection under these conditions. The results of these calculations are shown in Table 10.

Project Impact-1: Addition of project trips would have an incremental impact on traffic operations at the study intersections.

The length of minor street approach delays would increase at Bridge Street / Fremont Street / intersection, and the Level of Service for motorists waiting to turn on SR 20 would exceed the LOS D threshold. Similarly, very long delays would be expected at the Bridge Street / Wescott Road intersection, and the Level of Service for motorists waiting to turn north onto Bridge Street would exceed the LOS D minimum. Motorists waiting to turn left onto SR 20 at the SR 20 / Sunrise Blvd intersection would experience delays that are indicative of LOS E. Levels of Service at all other intersections would remain at LOS D or better conditions.

An increase in traffic at the Bridge Street / Fremont Street intersection, the Bridge Street / Wescott Road intersection, and the SR 20 / Sunrise Blvd intersection would exceed the LOS D threshold and
would result in significant impacts.
Level of Significance Before Mitigation: Significant.
Mitigation Measure for Project Impact-1: Eventually a traffic signal will be needed at the Bridge Street (SR 20) / Fremont Street intersection to meet minimum LOS Standards, The project should contribute its fair share to the cost this traffic signal. However, it is unlikely that Caltrans will permit the signal to be installed until warrants are met. Thus, payment of a fair share may still result in a significant and unavoidable impact if the signal is not installed.
Level of Significance After Mitigation: Significant and Unavoidable.

Project Impact-2: Addition of project trips would reduce the LOS on SR 20 (Bridge Street) in the area between Sioc Street and Fremont Street.

The relative impact of the proposed project on study area roads can be understood from comparison of daily traffic volumes with and without the proposed project. As shown in Table 11, the addition of project trips alone would reduce the Level of Service on SR 20 (Bridge Street) in the area between Sioc Street and Fremont Street from LOS D to LOS F. This exceeds the LOS D threshold

Traffic Impact Analysis for Colusa Industrial Properties Rezone (Revised October 8, 2007) 8. Page 19

established by the City of Colusa GPU and would result in a significant impact. The amount of traffic added by the project on this roadway segment represents a 23% increase over existing volumes. This exceeds the 5% threshold of significance identified in the City of Colusa GPU.
Level of Significance Before Mitigation: Significant.
Mitigation Measure for Project Impact-2: Due to right of way constraints and existing development, it is not feasible to widen SR 20 to a four lane section in the area between Sioc Street and Fremont Street. The City of Colusa GPU recognizes that alternative routes linking Bridge Street and 10th Street will be needed as development proceeds, and these new routes will divert some traffic from SR 20. However, completion of new routes is beyond the financial capabilities of this project. Thus, no feasible mitigation measure exists.
Level of Significance After Mitigation: Significant and Unavoidable.
Project Impact-3: The project would add additional traffic to study intersections, but resulting volumes would not reach the level that would satisfy peak hour traffic signal warrants.
While the project will incrementally contribute to the eventual need for signalization, signals are
unlikely to be installed until such time as warrants are met, even though Levels of Service do not meet minimum standards.

Level of Significance Before Mitigation: Less than significant.

Impacts to Non - Automotive Circulation

Project Impact-4: The development of the project's uses along the SR 20 corridor east of Colusa
would incrementally increase demand for the area's non-automotive transportation facilities.
Pedestrian / Bicycle Activity. When the project is completed, some new pedestrian and bicycle activity may occur between the site, schools, shopping, etc. in Colusa. Non-automotive travel would be expected along SR 20 and along Wescott Road in locations where sidewalks or improved shoulders are not uniformly available. The mix of automobïles, pedestrians and cyclists sharing the travel way could create safety conflicts. Impacts from increased pedestrian and bicycle activities would be significant.

Transit Services. The project will incrementally create additional demand for the transit services in the Colusa area. However, it is unlikely that development of this project would by itself create the need to modify existing routes or expand current services. Impacts to transit services would be less than significant.

Level of Significance Before Mitigation: Significant.

Mitigation Measure for Project Impact-4: Create a safe pedestrian walkway between the project and Wescott Road and along Wescott Road to the limits of existing sidewalks.
Level of Significance After Mitigation: Less than Significant.

SHORT TERM CUMULATIVE CONDITIONS

Pending / Approved Projects. Colusa County identified three (3) other development projects that were included in an "Existing Plus Approved Projects" background condition. These projects are:
Riverbend Estates: 2,235 low-density residential units, 295 medium-density residential units, on 442 acres, north of Moonbend Road, east of Bridge Street and SR 20/45, approximately 1.5 miles north of CIP project. This project has not been approved by the City of Colusa and no traffic impact analysis has been conducted. Tennant Estates: 101-lot residential subdivision, approved with traffic study. Hoblit Subdivision: 12-unit single family residential subdivision, under construction.

Trip Generation Forecasts. Table 12 identifies the trip generation characteristics of the three identified projects.

Trip Distribution Assumptions. Because no traffic study has been prepared for the Riverbend Estates project and the project is not yet approved, there is no quantitative information available regarding the directional distribution of traffic associated with this project. Table 13 presents the
assumptions made for this study

West Fremont Street west of 3rd Street 19%

East SR 20 east of Farinon Road 25%

Traffic Impact Analysis for Colusa Industrial Properties Rezone (Revised October 8, 2007) Page 25

It is important to note that the assignment of trips generated by a project as large as Riverbend Estates will be relatively "rough", since no traffic study is available for that project. The intent of these background forecasts is, therefore to develop a reasonable forecast of the additional traffic accompanying this level of development in the area of the proposed Re-zone.
Short term "plus project" traffic volumes reflect traffic generated by other pending projects using project streets. However, to isolate the specific impacts of pending projects and the proposed project, no redistribution of existing traffic has been assumed. Use of project streets by "non- project" traffic is identified under long term cumulative conditions.
Traffic Volume Forecasts / Levels of Service. Figure 6 and 7 present "Existing Plus Pending Projects" traffic volumes with and without development of the properties included under the CIP Rezone. Resulting Levels of Service are presented in Tables 14 and 15.
The relative impact of the proposed project on study area roads can be understood from comparison of daily traffic volumes with and without the proposed project. As shown in Table 10, the addition of project trips would exacerbate the poor Level of Service on SR 20 (Bridge Street) in the area between Market Street and the proposed project. Conditions will exceed the LOS D threshold established by the City of Colusa GPU with or without the project and would result in a significant impact. The amount of traffic added by the project on this roadway segment represents a 23% increase over existing volumes. This exceeds the 5% threshold of significance identified in the City of Colusa GPU.

Existing Plus Pending Projects Plus Project Impact-1: LOS E at SR 20 / Sioc Street Intersection, Addition of project trips would result in LOS E conditions at the SR 20 / Sioc Street intersection.

Level of Significance Before Mitigation: Significant.

Mitigation Measure for Existing Plus Pending Projects Plus Project Impact-1:

The amount of project traffic added to the intersection represents more than 5% of the current volume at the intersection. To deliver LOS D or better conditions it would be necessary to reconfigure the intersection to add an eastbound overlap right turn. However, because of the grade differential between SR 20 and Sioc Street, the intersection would likely need to be reconstructed to accommodate this improvement, and right of way acquisition would be required. The project should contribute its fair share to the cost of this improvement. However, because there is not an adopted funding mechanism to pay for the balance of the cost of this improvement, the impact will remain significant and unavoidable.

Level of Significance After Mitigation: Significant and Unavoidable.

Existing Plus Pending Projects Plus Project Impact-2 at Bridge Street Fremont Street: The length of minor street approach delays would increase and the Level of Service for motorists waiting to turn on SR 20 would exceed the LOS D threshold.

Level of Significance Before Mitigation: Significant.
Mitigation Measure for Existing Plus Pending Projects Plus Project Impact-2:
To deliver LOS D or better conditions it would be necessary to install a traffic signal and to widen the intersection to provide left turn lanes and right turn lanes on each leg of the intersection. Because this improvement is also needed without the proposed project, a "fair share" contribution is applicable. However, because there is not an adopted funding mechanism to pay for the balance
of the cost of this improvement, the impact will remain significant and unavoidable.
Level of Significance After Mitigation: Significant and Unavoidable.
Existing Plus Pending Projects Plus Project Impact-3 at SR 20 /Wescott Road: Very long delays would be expected at the intersection, the Level of Service for motorists waiting to turn north onto SR 20 would exceed the LOS D minimum and traffic signal warrants are met.

Level of Significance Before Mitigation: Significant.

Mitigation Measure for Existing Plus Pending Projects Plus Project Impact-3:

To deliver LOS D or better conditions it would be necessary to signalize the intersection and to widen the intersection to provide a northbound left turn lane. Because this improvement is also

Traffic Impact Analysis for Colusa Industrial Properties Rezone (Revised October 8, 2007) Page 31

needed without the proposed project, a "fair share" contribution is applicable. However, because there is not an adopted funding mechanism to pay for the balance of the cost of this improvement, the impact will remain significant and unavoidable.

Level of Significance After Mitigation: Significant and Unavoidable.

Existing Plus Pending Projects Plus Project Impact-4 at SR / 20 / Sunrise Blvd: Very long delays would be expected at the intersection. The Level of Service for motorists waiting to turn north onto SR 20 would exceed the LOS D minimum and traffic signal warrants are met.
Level of Significance Before Mitigation: Significant.

Mitigation Measure for Existing Plus Pending Projects Plus Project Impact-4:

To deliver LOS D or better condition it would be necessary to signalize the intersection. Because this improvement is not needed without the proposed project, the project should be responsible for installation with reimbursement from other development for costs beyond its "fair share" contribution. However, because there is not an adopted funding mechanism to pay for the
balance of the cost of this improvement, the impact will remain significant and unavoidable.

Level of Significance After Mitigation: Significant and Unavoidable.

Existing Plus Pending Projects Plus Project Impact-5 at SR 20 Farinon Road: Side street delays would exceed LOS D, but forecast traffic volumes do not reach the level that satisfies peak
hour warrants.

Level of Significance Before Mitigation: Significant

Mitigation Measure for Existing Plus Pending Projects Plus Project Impact-5:
The project shall contribute its fair share to the cost of a traffic signal at this intersection. However, because there is not an adopted funding mechanism to pay for the balance of the cost of this improvement, the impact will remain significant and unavoidable.
Level of Significance After Mitigation: Significant and Unavoidable.
Existing Plus Pending Projects Plus Project Impact-6: The addition of project trips would exacerbate conditions that are projected to exceed the LOS D standard on SR 20 through Colusa in the area from Market Street south through the study area.
Level of Significance Before Mitigation: Significant
Mitigation Measure for Existing Plus Pending Projects Plus Project Impact-6:
To achieve LOS D it is necessary to widen SR 20 to a four lane section from Market Street south

Traffic Impact Analysis for Colusa Industrial Properties Rezone (Revised October 8, 2007) Page 32

through the Farinon Road intersection. However, it is unlikely that such widening is feasible in the developed area of Colusa. Because this improvement is also needed without the proposed project, a "fair share" contribution is applicable. However, because there is not an adopted funding mechanism to pay for the balance of the cost of this improvement, the impact will remain
significant and unavoidable.

Level of Significance After Mitigation: Significant and Unavoidable.

Existing Plus Pending Projects Plus Project Impact-7 on Fremont Street: Daily traffic volumes are forecast to exceed the LOS C standard with and without the proposed project.
Level of Significance Before Mitigation: Significant
Mitigation Measure for Existing Plus Pending Projects Plus Project Impact-7:
The Colusa General Plan Update notes options of addressing conditions on Fremont Street which include re-striping the road to 4 lanes or converting Sioc Street and Fremont Street to a one-way couplet. However, while the proposed project could contribute its fair share to the cost of this improvement, implementing either action is within the jurisdiction of the City of Colusa. Because Colusa County has no control over this mitigation, this impact remains significant and unavoidable.

Level of Significance After Mitigation: Significant and Unavoidable.

LONG TERM CUMULATIVE CONDITIONS

The relative impacts of the proposed project were also assessed within the context of future traffic conditions occurring with buildout of the City of Colusa GPU. The future traffic volumes presented herein are based on preliminary long term traffic volume forecasts presented in the Colusa GPU
EIR.

Land Use. The proposed project involves development of land use designations that are reflected in the pending City of Colusa GPU. The amount of new development anticipated under build out of the new Colusa General Plan includes development in "reserve" areas under current Colusa County designations.

As noted in Table 16, under "mid-range" assumptions for density, implementing the City General Plan could result in more than 7,000 new dwelling units in Colusa. Another 5.9 million square feet of non-residential development is also anticipated.
The trip generation associated with new development has also been estimated. As shown, new residences could generate more than 67,000 new daily trips. Non-residential uses could generate
slightly fewer than 78,000 daily trips.

Planned Circulation System Improvements. The future cumulative traffic scenarios addressed herein assume both area-wide development and implementation of the circulation system inherent to the policies of City of Colusa GPU (July 2007) Circulation Element. The GPU's implementation measures include the creation of a Streets and Roadways Master Plan that will identify improvements needed to accommodate growth and will be the basis for an updated

Traffic Impact Analysis for Colusa Industrial Properties Rezone (Revised October 8, 2007) Page 34

traffic mitigation fee program. The GPU Circulation Diagram identifies several new streets which will carry traffic through the community and provide access to new growth areas. These
include:

Farinon-Railroad Collector. New development in southern Colusa will create the need for a collector street that provides access to SR 20. The GPU Circulation diagram indicates that the Farinon Road - Railroad Collector will generally follow the alignment of the abandoned railroad right of way from an intersection on SR 20 west of Wil S Green Street to Westcott Road.
The eastern portion of the route will follow Farinon Road as it links Westcott Road and SR 20 in
eastern Colusa. The intent of the General Plan is to provide access to new development while avoiding creation of a "bypass" that would divert through traffic away from downtown Colusa.
East Side Collector. New development east of SR 20 will be served by a new collector that will extend north from the SR 20 Sunrise Ave intersection to the extension of Market
Street.

Wil S Green Street extension. West side development will be served by creating a collector that links Wilson Avenue with SR 20 at the Wil S Green intersection.
3r0 Street, 5th Street and gth Street Extensions. The existing downtown grid street system will be extended south into new growth areas.

Colusa Avenue Extension. Colusa Avenue will be extended easterly from Wil S Green Street to 3rd Street.

Tenant Drive. Tenant Drive will be extended westerly from Wescott Road to Wil S Green Street to serve new south Colusa development.
Traffic Model Forecasts. The traffic volume forecasts contained in the City of Colusa GPU EIR were developed using a manual assignment process (TRAFFIX model) that accounted for the interaction between existing and future residential and non-residential uses, as well as through traffic growth on SR 20 and the planned expansion of the Colusa Casino. The GPU EIR presents daily traffic volume forecasts, as well as p.m. peak hour projections for key intersections. For this analysis, the model was employed to identify p.m. peak hour turning movement volumes at study intersections, and the model was further refined to create a.m. peak hour forecasts for this study.
These forecasts account for use of project streets by non-project traffic, and project streets will be used by others. For example, project trips represent only 7½% of the total traffic on the Farinon Road extension approaching Wescott Road.

Peak Hour Intersection Volumes. A.m. and p.m. peak hour traffic volumes accompanying build out of the City of Colusa GPU are presented in Figure 8.

Impacts to Intersections. As indicated in Table 17, the addition of trips generated by future development in Colusa would have an appreciable impact on the study area circulation system. Without improvements, all of the study intersections will operate at Levels of Service that exceed adopted standards. Table 18 notes the share of project traffic as a percentage of the "new" traffic through each intersection (i.e., total minus existing) and as a percentage of the total traffic at GPU build out.

Cumulative Impact - 1: The Bridge Street (SR 20) / Fremont Street intersection will operate at LOS F. With long term development motorists waiting to turn onto Bridge Street will experience long delays that are indicative of LOS F conditions. This exceeds minimum standards. The amount of project traffic added to the intersection represents more than 5% of the current
volume at the intersection. To deliver the minimum Level of Service (i.e., LOS D), it would be necessary to create separate left turn lanes on Bridge Street and develop a right turn lane on eastbound Freemont Street, as noted in Figure 9.

Level of Significance Before Mitigation: Significant
Mitigation Measure for Cumulative Impact 1: The project shall contribute its fair share to the cost of cumulative mitigations by paying the fees to be established via the City planned Street and
Highways Master Plan, or alternatively identifying the cost of constructing left turn lancs on Bridge Street and a right turn lane on Fremont Street and make a financial contribution in proportion to the project's traffic volume, which is 3.8% of the "new" traffic occurring at GPU buildout or 2.0% of
the total traffic at build out.

Level of Significance After Mitigation. Because no adopted program exists to ensure that funding is available for the balance of the cost of this mitigation, this impact remains significant and
unavoidable.

Cumulative Impact 2: The intersection of SR 20 / Sioc Street will operate at LOS F. Projected conditions at this intersection will exceed the minimum LOS standard. The amount of
project traffic added to the intersection represents more than 5% of the current volume at the intersection. To deliver LOS D or better conditions it would be necessary to widen and signalize the intersection. Two through lanes would be needed in each direction on Bridge Street, and Sioc Street would have to be widened and reconfigured. However, it is unlikely that mainline SR 20 can be widened to a four lane section through this intersection, and widening the intersection to provide auxiliary lanes may also be difficult without right of way acquisition. It may be that impacts to this intersection are significant and unavoidable.

Level of Significance Before Mitigation: Significant

Mitigation Measure for Cumulative Impact 2: The project shall contribute its fair share to the
cost of cumulative mitigations by paying the fees to be established via the City's planned Street and Highways Master Plan, or alternatively identifying the cost of widening Bridge Street and Sioc Street and make a financial contribution in proportion to the project's traffic volume, which is 3.4% of the "new" traffic occurring at GPU buildout or 1.9% of the total traffic at build out.
Level of Significance After Mitigation: Because no adopted program exists to ensure that funding is available for the balance of the cost of this mitigation, this impact remains significant and
unavoidable.

Cumulative Impact 3: The intersection of SR 20 / Wescott Road will operate at LOS
F. Projected conditions at this intersection will exceed the minimum LOS standard, and a traffic signal will be warranted. The amount of project traffic added to the intersection represents more than 5% of the current volume at the intersection. As noted in the discussion of daily traffic volumes, while a four lane SR 20 is desirable, it is unlikely that mainline SR 20 can be widened a to a four lane section north of this intersection. It may be possible to widen the road to create a northbound left turn lane, a second northbound through lane and a separate southbound right turn lane (with overlap) on SR 20. Assuming separate left turn and right turn lanes on the Wescott Road approach, under this configuration the intersection will operate at LOS D with signalization. Alternatively, a roundabout intersection could be installed at this location.

Level of Significance Before Mitigation: Significant

Mitigation Measure for Cumulative Impact 3: The project shall contribute its fair share to the cost. of cumulative mitigations by paying the fees to be established via the City planned Street and Highways Master Plan, or alternatively identifying the cost of signalization plus constructing northbound left turn lane, a second northbound through lane and a separate southbound right turn lane (with overlap) on SR 20, as well as the cost of creating separate left turn and right turn lanes on the Wescott Road approach and make a financial contribution in proportion to the project's traffic volume, which is 4.3% of the "new" traffic occurring at GPU buildout or 2.4% of the total
traffic at build out.

Level of Significance After Mitigation. Because no adopted program exists to ensure that funding
is available for the balance of the cost of this mitigation, this impact remains significant and
unavoidable.

Cumulative Impact 4: The intersection of SR 20 / Sunrise Blvd will operate at LOS F. Projected conditions at this intersection will exceed the minimum LOS standard, and a traffic a signal will be warranted. The amount of project traffic added to the intersection represents more than 5% of the current volume at the intersection. Mainline SR 20 will need to be widened to a
four lane section through this intersection, and separate right turn lanes will be needed. Assuming separate left turn lanes on each approach, the intersection will operate at LOS C with
signalization.

Level of Significance Before Mitigation: Significant
Mitigation Measure for Cumulative Impact 4: The project shall contribute its fair share to the cost of cumulative mitigations by paying the fees to be established via the City planned Street and Highways Master Plan, or alternatively identifying the cost of signalization plus widening SR 20 to four lanes with right turn lanes with separate left turn lanes on each approach and make a financial contribution in proportion to the project's traffic volume, which is 6.3% of the "new" traffic occurring at GPU buildout or 4.8% of the total traffic at build out.
Level of Significance After Mitigation. Because no adopted program exists to ensure that funding is available for the balance of the cost of this mitigation, this impact remains significant and
unavoidable

Cumulative Impact 5: The SR 20 Farinon Road intersection will operate at LOS F. Projected conditions at this intersection will exceed the minimum LOS standard, and a traffic signal will be warranted. The amount of project traffic added to the intersection represents more than 5% of the current volume at the intersection. Mainline SR 20 will need to be widened to a
four lane section through this intersection, and separate right turn lanes will be needed. Dual northbound left turn lanes will be needed, and with the level of improvement, the intersection will operate at LOS C with signalization.

Level of Significance Before Mitigation: Significant

Mitigation Measure for Cumulative Impact 5: The project shall contribute its fair share to the cost of cumulative mitigations by paying the fees to be established via the City planned Street and Highways Master Plan, or alternatively identifying the cost of signalization, widening SR 20 to four lanes with right turn lanes and dual northbound left turn lanes and make a financial contribution in
proportion to the project's traffic volume, which is 3.3% of the "new" traffic occurring at GPU
buildout or 2.7% of the total traffic at build out.

Level of Significance After Mitigation. Because no adopted program exists to ensure that funding is available for the balance of the cost of this mitigation, this impact remains significant and
unavoidable

Cumulative Impact 6: The Wescott Road / Farinon Road intersection will operate at
LOS F. Projected conditions at this intersection will exceed the minimum LOS standard, and a traffic signal will be warranted. The amount of project traffic added to the intersection represents more than 5% of the current volume at the intersection. Separate left turn and right turn lanes will be needed on each approach. With this level of improvement, the intersection will operate at
LOS C with signalization.

Level of Significance Before Mitigation: Significant

Mitigation Measure for Cumulative Impact 6: The project shall contribute its fair share to the
cost of cumulative mitigations by paying the fees to be established via the City planned Street and Highways Master Plan, or alternatively identifying the cost of constructing left turn lanes on each approach and signalizing the intersection and make a financial contribution in proportion to the project's traffic volume, which is 3.3% of the "new" traffic occurring at GPU buildout or 2.7% of the total traffic at build out.

Level of Significance After Mitigation. Because no adopted program exists to ensure that funding is available for the balance of the cost of this mitigation, this impact remains significant and unavoidable.

Impacts to Roadway Segments. The cumulative impact of all development anticipated in Colusa can be understood from review of future daily traffic volumes, as shown in Table 18. Key cumulative impacts identified from this data are summarized as follows:

Cumulative Impact 7: Traffic volumes on SR 20 are indicative of the need for 4 lane
facility. The volume of traffic forecast for SR 20 through Colusa will exceed the LOS D threshold for a 2 lane arterial. The amount of project traffic added to SR 20 represents more than 5% of the current volume at locations on Bridge Street and along the project's frontage. While widening to a four lane facility should be possible in new growth areas, it would be difficult to provide a four lane section in the developed areas along the 10th Street corridor from Market Street south to the fairgrounds and on the Bridge Street corridor from Market Street south to Wescott Avenue. Thus,
exceeding the City's LOS D threshold in these areas is a significant and unavoidable impact.

Level of Significance Before Mitigation: Significant

Mitigation Measure for Cumulative Impact 7: The project shall contribute its fair share to the cost of cumulative mitigations by paying the fees to be established via the City planned Street and
Highways Master Plan. However, it is likely due to limited rights of way and the location of existing development that widening the highway to 4 lanes is not feasible.

Level of Significance After Mitigation: Because it is not feasible to widen SR 20 through the
developed area of the City of Colusa, this impact is significant and unavoidable.

Traffic Impact Analysis for Colusa Industrial Properties Rezone (Revised October 8, 2007) Page 42

+.. -

Cumulative Impact 8: Traffic Volumes on SR 20 immediately north of the Project will
result in Levels of Service in excess of adopted standards. The volume of traffic forecast on eastern SR 20 north of the project site will approach or exceed the LOS D threshold for a 4 lane facility. While creating a 6 lane section would theoretically deliver LOS D or better conditions, this level of improvement is not being considered as part of the City's GPU, and this impact would be better mitigated by adding auxiliary turn lanes at major intersections. An SR 20 access management plan will be needed.

Level of Significance Before Mitigation: Significant

Mitigation Measure for Cumulative Impact 8: The project shall identify the right of way needed to accommodate future traffic conditions under City of Colusa General Plan build out and make an irrevocable offer of dedication for that right of way within the project. The project shall contribute its fair share to the cost of constructing cumulative mitigations by paying the fees to be established via the City planned Street and Highways Master Plan. Alternatively, the project shall identify the
cost of widening SR 20 to four lanes plus auxiliary lanes from the Wescott Road intersection to
Farinon Road and make a financial contribution in proportion to the project's traffic. Project traffic is 7.2% of the new traffic and 4.9% of the total traffic on this segment of SR 20 at build out of the
Colusa GPU.

Level of Significance After Mitigation: Because no adopted program exists to ensure that funding
is available for the balance of the cost of this mitigation, this impact remains significant and
unavoidable

Cumulative Impact 9: Traffic volumes on Fremont Street are indicative of LOS D
conditions. The volume of traffic expected on Fremont Street will exceed the LOS C threshold for a
collector street. The amount of traffic added by the proposed project exceeds 5% of the current
volume. To deliver LOS C it would be necessary to prohibit on-street parking and stripe the street as
a four lane facility. Alternatively, it would be possible to re-stripe Sioc Road and Fremont Street as
two-lane one-way streets as part of a one-way couplet. Alternatively development of additional east west capacity elsewhere could reduce the volume on Fremont Street.
Level of Significance Before Mitigation: Significant
Mitigation Measure for Cumulative Impact 9: The project shall contribute its fair share to the cost of cumulative mitigations by paying the fees to be established via the City planned Street and Highways Master Plan, or by making financial contribution towards the cost of re-striping Fremont
Street to four lanes. The project's traffic represents 2.4% of the new traffic and 1.5% of the total traffic at build out on Fremont Street. However, this mitigation may not be implemented by the City of Colusa.

Level of Significance After Mitigation: Because the City of Colusa may not elect to re-stripe
Fremont Street for 4 lanes, create a one-way Fremont Street - Sioc Street couplet or change the draft
general plan to create additional east-west capacity elsewhere, this impact is significant and
unavoidable

Traffic Impact Analysis for Colusa Industrial Properties Rezone (Revised October 8, 2007) Page 43

Cumulative Impact 10: Traffic volumes on Sioc Street are indicative of LOS F
conditions. The volume of traffic expected on Sioc Street will exceed the LOS C threshold for a collector street. The amount of traffic added by the proposed project exceeds 5% of the current volume. To deliver LOS C it would be necessary to prohibit on-street parking and stripe the street as a four lane facility, or create a Sioc Street - Fremont Street one-way couplet or develop additional
east-west capacity elsewhere.

Level of Significance Before Mitigation: Significant

Mitigation Measure for Cumulative Impact 10: The project shall contribute its fair share to the cost of cumulative mitigations by paying the fees to be established via the City planned Street and Highways Master Plan, or by making a financial contribution towards the cost of re-striping Sioc Street to four lanes, creating a Sioc Street - Fremont Street couplet or creating additional east-west capacity elsewhere. The project's traffic represents 1.6% of the new traffic and 1.2% of the total traffic at build out on Sioc Street. However, this mitigation may not be implemented by the City of
Colusa.

Level of Significance After Mitigation: Because the City of Colusa may not elect to re-stripe Sioc
Street for 4 lanes, create a one-way couplet or create additional east-west capacity, this impact is
significant and unavoidable

Cumulative Impact 11: Traffic volumes on the Farinon Rd Extension between SR 20 and
Westcott Road are indicative of LOS D conditions. The volume of traffic expected on Farinon
Road will exceed the LOS C threshold for two lane collector street. To deliver LOS C it would be necessary to widen the roadway to 4 lanes. However, a four lane Farinon Road may not be consistent with the intent of the City of Colusa GPU, which strives to avoid creation of an SR 20
"bypass". Alternatively, modifying the City's circulation plan to extend Sunrise Blvd west to Wescott Road could reduce the volume on Farinon Road to a level that may be accommodated by a
collector street, although the effect on Wescott Road traffic is undetermined. However, changes to the City of Colusa GPU circulation diagram are beyond the control of this project.

Level of Significance Before Mitigation: Significant

Mitigation Measure for Cumulative Impact 11: The project shall identify the right of way needed to accommodate a four lane Farinon Road and shall make an irrevocable offer of dedication for this right of way. The project shall contribute its fair share to the cost of cumulative mitigations by paying the fees to be established via the City planned Street and Highways Master Plan, or by
making a financial contribution towards the cost of widening Farinon Road beyond the currently
planned width to four lanes. The project's traffic represents 3.2% of the new traffic and 3.2% of the total traffic at build out on Farinon Road between Wescott Road and SR 20.

Level of Significance After Mitigation. Because no adopted program exists to ensure that funding is available for the balance of the cost of this mitigation, this impact remains significant and
unavoidable

Traffic Impact Analysis for Colusa Industrial Properties Rezone (Revised October 8, 2007) Page 44

Cumulative Impact 12: Traffic Volumes on Wescott Road between Cynthia Avenue and the Railroad Collector are indicative of LOS D conditions. The volume of traffic on the southern
end of Westcott Road will exceed the LOS C threshold on a 2 lane collector street. The amount of
traffic added by the proposed project exceeds 5% of the current volume. To deliver LOS C it would be necessary to acquire right of way and improve the road to an arterial standard.

Level of Significance Before Mitigation: Significant
Mitigation Measure for Cumulative Impact 12: The project shall contribute its fair share to the cost of cumulative mitigations by paying the fees to be established via the City planned Street and Highways Master Plan, or by making a financial contribution towards the cost of widening Wescott Road to an arterial standard in this area. The project's traffic represents 1.4% of the new traffic and
1.2% of the total traffic at build out on Wescott Road between Cynthia Avenue and the Railroad
Collector.

Level of Significance After Mitigation. Because no adopted program exists to ensure that funding is available for the balance of the cost of this mitigation, this impact remains significant and
unavoidable.

Cumulative Impact 13: Traffic volumes on SR 20 east and west of the City of Colusa
sphere of influence are indicative of LOS F conditions. Regionally, development in and near to Colusa will contribute to the need to improve SR 20 to a four lane section from SR 99 to Interstate 5.
While the inter-regional street system is not the sole responsibility of development in or near the City of Colusa, the City and County should investigate mechanisms for local development to participate on a "fair share" basis in the costs of maintaining and improving roads outside of the City limits. The City and Colusa County, as well as communities such as Williams and Yuba City need to work with Caltrans towards a mechanism to address impacts to the state highway system.

Level of Significance Before Mitigation: Significant

Mitigation Measure for Cumulative Impact 13: The project shall be contribute its fair share to the cost of cumulative mitigations by paying the fees to be established via the City's planned Street and Highways Master Plan, or by making financial contribution towards the cost of widening SR 20 a to a four lane section from Interstate 5 to SR 99. The project's traffic represents 2.0% of the new traffic and 1.4% of the total traffic at build out on SR 20 west of Colusa and 2.1% of the new traffic
and 1.7% of the total traffic on SR 20 east of Colusa.

Level of Significance After Mitigation. Because no adopted program exists to ensure that funding is available for the balance of the cost of this mitigation, this impact remains significant and
unavoidable

Traffic Signal Warrants. Traffic signal warrants are met at all study intersections under cumulative conditions. Fair share contribution to the cost of signalization is identified in Cumulative
mitigations No. 1,3,4,5 and 6.

Tocersectione that exceed this warrant are probably more likely to meët one  or more of the other volume based signal Marrant (such as the 4hour or 8-houz warrants).
The peak hour warrant analysis in this réport la not intended to replace a rigorous and complete traffie stgnal warrant analÿsis bÿ the responsible juriediction. Consideration of the other signal warcante, which is beyond the saope öf this software; may vield different results.

INTRODUCTION
This analysis has been prepared to describe the environmental noise setting, evaluate potential impacts, and recommend mitigation measures for the Colusa Industrial Properties development project. Colusa Industrial Properties (CIP) is proposing a Colusa County General Plan Amendment and Zoning Amendment to change land use designations and zoning classifications within the northern portion of the Colusa Industrial Park (Park). The Park is located entirely within unincorporated Colusa County, just south of the City of Colusa and west of State Route
(SR) 20.

The project area encompasses approximately 138 acres within the northernmost portion of the 950-acre Park, 13 acres within the Colusa Golf and Country Club, and 30 acres in the central portion of the Park. The proposed development area includes the 138 acres in the north and the 13 acres on the golf course, and the proposed wastewater treatment facilities would be located on the 30-acre site south of the development area. The Colusa County Airport is located south and east of the project area, and the Colusa Golf and Country Club forms the northern boundary of the Park. Surrounding land uses include agriculture fields, industrial facilities, and residential
development.
The project would consist of a mixed-use community with approximately 286 residential units, improvements to the existing golf course, various commercial and office uses along SR 20, and wastewater treatment facilities to serve the mixed-use community and other uses in the Park.

SIGNIFICANCE CRITERIA

California Environmental Quality Act
The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) requires that significant environmental impacts be identified and that such impacts be eliminated or mitigated to the extent feasible. A significant effect from noise may exist if a project would result in:

o Exposure of persons to, or generation of, noise levels in excess of standards established in the local General Plan or noise ordinance, or applicable standards of other agencies;

o Exposure of persons to or generation of excessive groundborne vibration or groundborne noise levels;
A substantial permanent increase in ambient noise levels in the project vicinity above levels existing without the project; or

0 A substantial temporary or periodic increase in ambient noise levels in the project vicinity above levels existing without the project.
For non-transportation noise sources affecting noise sensitive land uses, most jurisdictions consider an increase in ambient noise levels of 3 dBA to be potentially significant. This amount

For explanation of acoustical terms, refer to Appendix A.

of change in environmental noise levels is generally considered to be perceptible, though not necessarily clearly noticeable, by most people.

Traffic and Aircraft Noise Criteria
Some additional guidance as to the significance of changes in ambient noise levels is provided by the 1992 findings of the Federal Interagency Committee on Noise (FICON), which assessed the annoyance effects of changes in ambient noise levels resulting from aircraft operations. The FICON findings are based upon studies that relate aircraft and traffic noise levels to the percentage of persons highly annoyed by the noise. Annoyance is a summary measure of the general adverse reaction of people to noise that generates speech interference, sleep disturbance, or interference with the desire for tranquil environment.
The rationale for the FICON findings is that it is possible to consistently describe the annoyance of people exposed to transportation noise in terms of Ldn or CNEL. The changes in noise exposure that are shown in Table I are expected to result in equal changes in annoyance at sensitive land uses. Although the FICON findings were specifically developed to address aircraft noise impacts, they are considered as measures of potential noise impacts in this analysis for residential uses affected by traffic and aircraft noise.

60-65 dB +3.0 dB or more
>65 dB +1.5 dB or more
Source: Federal Interagency Committee on Noise (FICON), 1992, as applied by Brown-Buntin Associates, Inc.

Another measure of annoyance due to aircraft noise is the potential for aircraft noise events to result in awakening. Sleep disturbance may be reasonably predicted in terms of noise levels of individual noise events occurring at night. Research in the United Kingdom? on outdoor noise events below maximum noise levels (Lmax) of about 80 dBA found that average sleep disturbance rates are unlikely to be affected by aircraft noise. At higher levels (up to 95 dBA Lmax), the chance of the average person being awakened is about 1 in 75.
The Federal Interagency Committee on Aviation Noise (FICAN) has recommended a conservative dose-response relationship' for the combined field data on sleep disturbance due to the Sound Exposure Levels (SEL) measured indoors during aircraft noise events. The curve thus developed represents the upper limit of the observed field data and should be interpreted as predicting the "maximum percent of the exposed population expected to be behaviorally

awakened" or the "maximum % awakened" for a given a residential population. FICAN cautions that the curves should not be applied to campgrounds, trailer parks, or other temporary residences, since the studies were based on long-term residents. Similarly, FICAN states that it cannot be assumed that the curve can be generalized to include children, as only adults were included in the field studies. Figure shows the FICAN curve superimposed on the field data.

Indoor sound exposure level (SEL), dB 120

To apply the FICAN curve to outdoor SEL values due to aircraft noise events, it is usually assumed that noise levels would be reduced inside a home by at least 15 dBA, which is consistent with a home having windows partially opened for ventilation. Therefore outdoor SEL values would be about 15 dB higher than the corresponding indoor SEL values in the FICAN graph.

FICAN provides no guidance as to the significance of the values obtained from the curye in Figure 1. There are currently no guidelines for the environmental significance of maximum awakening rates of 5%, 10% or other values. However, one may review studies prepared by other jurisdictions to weigh relative measures of significance.
For example, the recent EIR prepared for the LAX Master Plan established an outdoor criterion value of 94 dBA SEL as the limit of funding for airport sound insulation projects. This value was selected assuming that windows would be open and that about 10% of the area population would be awakened at least once in ten days, based upon the assumed frequency of flights by the loudest aircraft type. Using Figure 1, this outdoor noise level would be expected to result in 9.2% maximum awakening.
The Supplemental EIR prepared for the Oakland International Airport ADP (Airport Development Plan) displayed the 80 dBA and 90 dBA SEL contours for different aircraft types, without passing judgment on the significance of those levels. However, the 80 dBA SEL contour

3

was considered the threshold of potential significance, consistent with the United Kingdom study cited above. This value would yield maximum awakening rate of 5.1%. The 90 dB SEL value would yield a maximum awakening rate of 7.9%.
For this analysis, an exterior aircraft single event noise exposure of 80 dB SEL is considered the threshold of significance for sleep disturbance in residential areas. This value would yield a maximum awakening rate of 5.1%.

Construction Noise and Vibration Criteria
Noise due to construction activities
compliance if: may be considered to be insignificant in terms of CEQA

o the construction activity is temporary;

o use of heavy equipment and noisy activities is limited to daytime hours;

o no pile driving or blasting is planned; and

o all industry-standard noise abatement measures are implemented for noise-producing equipment.

These general parameters acknowledge that people are not as likely to be annoyed by activities that are perceived as being necessary for normal commerce, so long as the inconveniences due to noise are of relatively short duration and that all practical measures are being implemented to reduce the impacts of noise-producing activities.
The vibration assessment methodology and criteria used for this project were derived from the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) document entitled Transit Noise and Vibration Assessment, dated April 1995. In this document, the criteria for ground-borne vibration are expressed in terms of the "vibration velocity level", in VdB, with a reference velocity of 10-6 in/sec.

The threshold of vibration perception is taken by the FTA to be 65 VdB, and the threshold of potential architectural damage to fragile structures is about 100 VdB. For residential uses, vibration levels less than 72 VdB are considered acceptable for exposures to more than 70 vibration events per day, and vibration levels less than 80 VdB are considered acceptable for exposures to fewer than 70 vibration events per day.
Caltrans has prepared guidelines for acceptable vibration limits in terms of the induced peak particle velocity (PPV). Tables I and III represent Tables 19 and 20 of the Caltrans Transportation- and Construction-induced Vibration Guidance Manual'.

APPLICABLE STANDARDS

California Code of Regulations - Title 21 Subchapter 6. Noise Standards
Section 5012 of the Airport Noise Standard states:
"The standard for the acceptable level of aircraft noise for persons living in the vicinity of airports is hereby established to be a community noise equivalent level of 65 decibels.'
The standard determines that "residences, including but not limited to, detached single-family dwellings, multi-family dwellings, high-rise apartments or condominiums, and mobile homes" within the 65 dB CNEL contour are incompatible land uses. Although this standard is not used for this analysis, it is mentioned for purposes of comparing the local standards with the state standard.

Safety Element of the Colusa County General Plan
The Safety Element contains noise standards to be applied to new projects. Specifically, Policy SAFE-14 states that:

"New projects should be conditioned, improved, or denied according to the standards of Table SAFE-3. When necessary, environmental impact reports should be used to gauge the existing and projected noise environments for proposed projects. All projects in areas above the "conditionally acceptable" noise level shall provide the county with proof from a professional acoustical consultant that occupants of the project will be protected from excessive noise.'
Table SAFE-3 is shown on the following page.

Colusa County Airport Comprehensive Land Use Plan
The Noise Element of the Colusa County Airport Land Use Plan adopts Compatibility Guidelines for Noise. These guidelines indicate that single-family detached and multi-family dwellings are compatible with aircraft noise exposures of 55 dB CNEL or less. Hotels, motels, inns, and bed and breakfast places are considered compatible up to CNEL 80, provided that:
"Measures to achieve an interior noise level of 50 CNEL must be incorporated in the design and construction of portions of buildings where the public is received, office areas, and other areas where eople work or congregate.'
Furthermore, the ALUC guidelines require that measures to achieve an interior noise level of 45 dB CNEL must be incorporated into the design and construction of all noise sensitive areas, including sleeping rooms. It is assumed that this standard would apply to residential units and hotels/motels.

The ALUC guidelines included CNEL contours for the Colusa County Airport for the year 1981. Those CNEL contours were subsequently updated in March 2004 by Aries Consultants LTD (refer to Appendix C). The Aries study included projected CNEL contours for the year 2015.

SETTING
The project area includes agricultural, recreational, and office and commercial building uses. The project site is bordered to the north by the Colusa Golf and Country Club, to the northwest by single-family residential uses, and to the south by the Colusa County Airport. Immediately west and east of the project site are agricultural uses. With the exception of aircraft noise due to Colusa County Airport operations, the noise environment on the property itself is that of a quiet rural area. Traffic noise from SR20 and aircraft noise and overflights from Colusa County Airport are the dominant noise sources.

Ambient Noise
To describe the ambient noise environment, Brown-Buntin Associates, Inc., conducted continuous noise measurements on the project site from May 16 through May 23, 2006. Ambient noise levels were obtained for this seven-day period at three separate locations on the project site. Site was located at the northwest corner of the project site, at the property line of the existing single-family residences. Site 2 was located at the southern border of the project site at the northwest boundary of the Colusa County Airport. Site 3 was located adjacent to SR20 at the edge of the existing golf course driving range. The measurement sites are shown in Figure 2. The continuous noise measurements were conducted to describe the day/night distribution of ambient noise levels, and to calculate hourly noise levels and Day/Night Levels. Appendices B-1 through B-21 present the hourly noise measurement data in graphic format.
The sound measurement equipment used consisted of Larson Davis Laboratories (LDL) Model 820 precision integrating sound level meters equipped with B&K Type 4176 ½" microphones. This measurement equipment was calibrated immediately before and after measurements using a B&K Type 4230 calibrator. The measurement systems meet the specifications of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) for Type 1 sound measurement systems.
Noise measurements were conducted in terms of the Leq and other statistical descriptors, which describe trends in ambient noise levels throughout the day and nighttime periods. Table IV summarizes the measured 24-hour noise levels.

2 Sites 1 and 2 were subject to noise exposures from aircraft overflights. At these sites, the noise measurement equipment was set to record noise events exceeding 65 dB for more than 5 seconds. These events were presumed to be caused by aircraft operations.
During the measurement period, a total of 266 presumed aircraft noise events were recorded at
Site 1. The average measured Sound Exposure Level (SEL) for these events was 84.4 dB, and the average of the maximum noise levels was 73.7 dB.
At Site 2, 495 presumed aircraft noise events were recorded during the one-week period. The average measured SEL for these events was 93.9 dB, and the average of the maximum noise levels for aircraft-caused events was 74.4 dB.

Traffic Noise
Short-term traffic noise level measurements were conducted adjacent to SR20 on May 16, 2006. The short-term measurement site is shown in Figure 2. The purpose of the noise measurements was to determine the accuracy of the FHWA model in predicting noise levels due to SR20 traffic
affecting the project site.
Measurements were taken at microphone heights of 5 feet and fifteen feet to represent ground floor and second floor receivers, respectively. Traffic counts were conducted during the measurement period. The noise measurements were conducted in terms of the Leq, and the measured values were later compared to the values predicted by the FHWA model using the observed traffic volumes, speed, and distance to the microphones. The temperature was 78 degrees Fahrenheit, and the sky was clear. Humidity was low, and the wind was calm.
Table V compares the measured and modeled noise levels for the observed traffic conditions.

The FHWA model under-predicted the measured average noise levels for traffic on SR20 by 0.6 dB at the five-foot microphone height and by 2.5 dB at the fifteen-foot height. Given the close agreement between measured and predicted values at the lower (first-floor) receiver height, the FHWA model is expected to be reasonably accurate for first-floor receptor locations. The under- prediction of 2.5 dB at the fifteen-foot microphone height is consistent with Brown-Buntin Associates, Inc. file data which indicates that it is typical to 3 experience a 3 dB increase in sound levels at second floor (and higher) receiver heights due to reduced ground absorption.

POTENTIAL NOISE IMPACTS

Traffic Noise
For this analysis, it was assumed that worst-case noise exposures would occur at a reference distance of 50 feet from the centerline of the arterial roadways. Truck mix for local roadways was estimated from BBA file data. For SR20, Caltrans Vehicle and Data Systems Unit data were used to derive the truck mix factors. Day/evening/night distribution of traffic noise was assumed to be 74%/10%/16%, based on the ambient noise measurement data collected from May 16-23, 2006.

Based upon the traffic volume analysis prepared for this project by KD Anderson & Associates, Inc., the FHWA model was run to predict existing and future traffic noise levels for the roadways included in the traffic analysis. Table VI lists the basic FHWA model input assumptions for existing conditions. Table VII lists the assumed traffic volumes for existing and future traffic on the roadways in the project vicinity. Table VIII shows the predicted noise levels at the reference distance of 50 feet from the roadway centerlines.

Future No Project traffic noise levels for the above roadway segments would exceed the Colusa County Noise Element standard of 60 dB Ldn at a distance of 50 feet from the roadway centerlines. This condition would occur with or without
significant effect associated with the project. the project and is not considered to be a

New noise sensitive uses located within about 500 feet of SR20 would receive traffic noise exposures exceeding 60 dB Ldn. In accordance with the Colusa County Safety Element, acoustical analyses would be required for these uses by Policy SAFE-14 to demonstrate compliance with the standards shown by Table SAFE-3.
As compared to existing conditions, project-related traffic would cause traffic noise levels to increase by up to 2.2 dB. These increases would occur in the near-term and would eventually be

13

overtaken by future traffic with or without the project. Using the FICON significance guidance, the predicted project-related increases in traffic noise in the near-term would be potentially significant for sensitive land uses along SR20 between Sioc Street and Sunrise Boulevard.
The current land use on the east side of this roadway segment is predominantly agricultural or industrial and is not considered to be noise-sensitive. On the west side of the roadway, the land use is primarily residential, and those receivers would be exposed to potentially significant increases in traffic noise in the near-term. However, since the predicted changes in traffic noise levels over the short-term would be overtaken by future traffic with or without the project, the short-term traffic noise impact is considered less than significant.
Using the FICON significance guidance, the project-related increases in traffic noise under future (cumulative) conditions would be less than significant.

Colusa County Airport Noise
To define potential noise impacts resulting from aircraft operations at the Colusa County Airport, Brown-Buntin Associates, Inc., conducted a peer a review of the June 1, 2005 report prepared by Bollard and Brennan Inc. for the Residential Development Near Colusa County Airport Colusa, California (see Appendix D). The report presented an analysis of proposed residential development immediately to the northwest of the Airport.
The Bollard and Brennan analysis applied the cumulative noise exposure criteria established by the Colusa County General Plan Noise Element, and by State and Federal Guidelines. Based on a continuous 24-hour noise measurement at a site located to the north-northwest of the departure end of Runway 31 (approximately mid-distance to the southeast corner of the existing single- family residential land uses), the cumulative aircraft noise level at that location was approximately 69 dB Ldn- This measurement was consistent with the CY2015 noise exposure contour map for the Colusa County Airport, which indicates the measurement site was near the 70 dB Ldm noise contour. The Bollard and Brennan report recommended that the CY2015 CNEL contours be used for land use planning in the Airport's vicinity.
The Bollard & Brennan analysis further explained that more than 70% of the then-proposed project area would be exposed to aircraft noise levels of 65 dB Lén/CNEL, and at least 15% of the site would be exposed to 70 dB Ldn/CNEL or greater by the year 2015. It was estimated that the majority of the aircraft noise exposure at the proposed project site was (and would be in 2015) generated by crop duster aircraft departing Runway 31 and turning left (west) over the project site.
The noise contour produced for the June 2005 Bollard and Brennan report appears to validate the general location and shape of the CNEL contours projected by Aries Consultants LTD for the year 2015. The projected future cumulative aircraft noise exposures would result in a significant a noise impact on the proposed residential uses.
Crop duster activity is typically concentrated in spring and summer months, during the morning hours of the day, beginning at first light. This means that, during the crop dusting season, aircraft

14

may fly over the proposed project site beginning as early as 5:30 a.m. These early morning flights (before 7 a.m.) would introduce the potential for sleep disturbance.
Based upon the noise measurements performed by BBA, residents of the project would be exposed to single event noise levels ranging from 84 dB SEL to 94 dB SEL during crop duster overflights. Based upon the FICAN findings describing the potential for awakening due to aircraft noise events, these values would correspond to a range of maximum likelihood of awakening of 6% to 9%. This potential for sleep disturbance would be associated with each early morning flight. This would be considered a significant impact.

Wastewater Treatment Plant Noise
The proposed wastewater treatment facility (WWTP) would be an activated sludge process plant sized to accommodate a peak daily flow of 200,000 gallons. The plant would be housed in a block building that would incorporate an office and a laboratory. The system would include several pumps and blowers. Potential noise sources include the pump motors and blowers, as well as the motors fitted with Variable frequency Drives (VFDs). The motor sizes would range from 2.5 to 10 horsepower. The design plans indicate that the pumps and blowers would be enclosed in the building.
A 100 kW emergency generator is also specified, though its location is not known. This type of generator is typically powered by a diesel engine and may be fitted with silencers for engine intake and cooling air, as well as for the engine exhaust.
The WWTP would be located in the existing industrial park and would be surrounded by industrial and agricultural land uses. The nearest proposed residential development associated with the project is about 0.7-mile north of the WWTP. No existing residential uses are located nearby.
The WWTP facility description states that noise control measures would be incorporated into the project design, presumably to ensure satisfaction of occupational noise exposure requirements. The relatively small motors and blowers used for the WWTP are not expected to produce significant noise exposures for adjacent properties, especially if they are enclosed.
Noise produced by the emergency generator could be significant if noise sensitive uses were located nearby. Emergency operation of such a unit is not usually considered to be subject to noise standards, but the routine exercising of the unit to ensure fluid circulation could be of concern to nearby sensitive uses. Routine exercising is usually conducted during daytime hours, typically for about one hour each month.
Given the facility design and the location of the WWTP, the noise produced by the WWTP pumps and blowers, and by the emergency generator, is expected to be less than significant.

15

During the construction phase of the project, noise from construction would dominate the noise Construction Noise

environment in the immediate area. The nearest potentially affected sensitive receivers would be the homes northwest of the project site. Equipment used for construction on this project would be expected to generate noise levels in the range indicated in Table IX. Maximum noise levels from different types of equipment under different operating conditions could range from 70 dBA to 90 dBA at a distance of 50 feet, which would correspond to the locations of the nearest houses
under worst-case conditions.

The actual noise effects at any given sensitive receiver in the vicinity would be the result of a series of construction tasks. For example, land clearing would be followed by trenching. The trenching could be performed by a backhoe or by boring. Other equipment would deliver and install building materials. Workers would use power tools to complete the construction. Compressors and generators could be used at any time. For any given receiver, the total time of exposure to heavy construction noise would likely be in the range of less than one week. Noise due to framing and construction of houses would be typically spread over a period of about one month.

Construction noise impacts could be significant, as nighttime operations or use of unusually noisy equipment could result in annoyance or sleep disruption for nearby residences.

Construction Vibration
Construction activities such as bulldozer and heavy truck movements, use of jackhammers, impact hammers, and compactors may produce detectable levels of vibration at nearby sensitive land uses. Ground vibrations due to construction activities very rarely reach the levels that can damage structures, but they can cause levels that are perceptible in buildings close to the site* Exceptions may occur where fragile historical buildings are close to the site, as these structures may be more susceptible to vibration-induced damage than modern buildings.
Vibration levels caused by representative construction equipment have been published by the Federal Transit Administration®, as shown in Table X. Based upon these values, vibration due to the operation of equipment such as heavy trucks and bulldozers associated with the project could be perceptible and could result in annoyance for residents in homes located within about 60 feet of the construction site. Structural damage due to construction-related vibration is unlikely within 25 feet of the construction site.

17

The majority of construction activity is expected to occur at distances greater than 60 feet from sensitive structures. The use of heavy equipment that would produce the highest vibration levels would be intermittent and would be limited to daytime hours. As a result, construction-related is vibration is expected to be less than significant.

RECOMMENDED MITIGATION

Traffic Noise
New noise sensitive uses located within about 500 feet of SR20 would receive traffic noise exposures exceeding 60 dB Ldn• In accordance with the Colusa County Safety Element, acoustical analyses would be required for these uses by Policy SAFE-14 to demonstrate compliance with the standards shown by Table SAFE-3. The specific mitigation measures for these uses would depend upon the site layout, building orientation, and building design. In general, it can be anticipated that suitable noise mitigation measures would include building setbacks, traffic noise barriers, and acoustical design of building facades. In most cases, acoustical design features for residential building facades would include conformance with modern energy-conserving building practices, the use of acoustically-rated window assemblies and stucco (or similarly massive) siding.

Colusa County Airport Noise
A potential noise mitigation measure for Colusa County Airport operations would be to re-route aircraft so that they would not fly over the proposed residential areas. The June 2005 Bollard and Brennan analysis stated, "If instead, these (crop duster) operations turned right (east), then noise exposure on the project site would be significantly reduced. In this case, the CY2015 Colusa County Airport noise exposure would not exceed 70 dB Ldn/CNEL on the project site; and much of the proposed residential project site would be outside of the 65 dB Ldn/CNEL aircraft noise
exposure contour."

In July 2005, Bollard and Brennan conducted an additional analysis of projected year 2015 CNEL contours after making the assumption that agriculture related aircraft would use only

18

eastbound departure flight tracks so that there would be no flights directly over the project area (see Appendix E). Making that assumption, the projected noise exposure at the proposed residential site would be less than 65 dB CNEL. However, the aircraft noise exposure would continue to exceed the 55 dB CNEL guideline of the Airport Land Use Commission, so that residential land uses would remain incompatible. This would be considered a significant and unavoidable impact.
If the noise standards of the Colusa County Safety Element were applied to this project instead of the ALUC guidelines, an exterior noise exposure in the range of 55 to 65 dB CNEL would be considered to be "conditionally acceptable." In this range of noise exposures, the County standards indicate that standard building construction may not be adequate to achieve acceptable interior noise levels, and that mitigation measures may be easily employed. An analysis of mitigation measures by a qualified acoustical professional would be required, to be approved by the County.
The redirection of aircraft away from the residential areas would ensure that single event noise
levels experienced during crop duster overflights would be reduced to less than 80 dB SEL. This would be considered a less than significant impact.
To implement this mitigation measure, the Airport proprietor (Colusa County) would have to place departure path restrictions on all agricultural aircraft operations so as to preclude overflight of the proposed residential sites by these aircraft. It is not known whether this practice would be consistent with safe and orderly operation of the airport, or whether an effective mechanism could be put in place to enforce this type of restriction.
If the redirection of aircraft were achieved, and if the County Safety Element noise standards were applied, noise mitigation could be implemented to achieve the interior noise standard of 45
dB CNEL, and to ensure that single event noise levels would not exceed 65 dB SEL inside the noise sensitive rooms. The specific measures to be employed would depend upon the construction details for the proposed residential buildings, but would typically include specifications for insulation of roof/ceiling assemblies and exterior walls, and for acoustically- rated windows and doors.

Construction Noise
Noise and vibration effects due to the project will be less than significant if construction noise is managed to the maximum practical extent. The following mitigation measures are recommended:
1. Construction should be limited to daytime hours (7 a.m, to 10 p.m.).
2. Construction contractors shall maintain all manufacturer-installed engine mufflers and enclosures on powered construction equipment in proper working order. Impact tools shall be fitted with adequate mufflers and shrouding.
3. Construction contractors shall locate construction staging areas as far as possible from
sensitive receivers.
4. Construction contractors shall locate fixed powered construction equipment such as generators and compressors as far as possible from sensitive receivers. Contractors shall

19

provide shielding or enclosures for fixed equipment to reduce noise
exposures at sensitive receivers. as necessary

5. Construction contractors shall implement all practical techniques to minimize ground- borne vibration at sensitive structures, including the use of setbacks.

APPENDIX A

FUNDAMENTALS OF ACOUSTICS

Noise is often described as unwanted sound, and thus is a subjective reaction to the physical phenomenon of sound. Sound is variations in air pressure that the ear can detect.
The ear responds to pressure changes over a range of 1014 to 1. This is roughly equivalent to the range of 1 second as compared to 3.2 million years, or 1 square yard compared to the entire surface area of the earth. To deal with the extreme range of pressures which the ear can detect, researchers express the amount of acoustical energy of a sound by comparing the measured sound pressure to a reference pressure, then taking the logarithm (base 10) of the square of that number, This original unit of sound measurement, named the bel after Alexander Graham Bell, corresponded well to human hearing characteristics if it was divided by a factor of 10. The resulting unit, one tenth of a bel, is called the decibel, and is abbreviated as dB.
The threshold of hearing is considered to be zero (0) dB, and the range of sounds in normal human experience is 0 to 140 dB.
Because sound pressure levels are defined as logarithmic numbers, the values cannot be directly added or subtracted. For example, two sound sources, each producing 50 dB, will produce 53 dB when combined, not 100 dB. This is because two sources have two times the energy of one source, and 10 times the logarithm of 2 equals 3. Similarly, ten sources produce a 10 dB higher sound pressure level than one source, as ten times the logarithm of 10 equals 10.
The ear responds to pressure variations in the air from about 20 times per second to about 20,000 times per second. The frequency of the variations is described in terms of hertz (Hz), formerly called cycles per second. The ear does not respond equally to all frequencies. For example, we do not hear very low frequency sounds as well as we hear higher frequency sounds, nor do we hear very high frequency sounds very well. This difference in perceived loudness varies with the sound pressure level of the sound. In general, the maximum sensitivity of the ear occurs at frequencies between about 500 and 8000 Hz.
To compensate for the fact that the ear is not as sensitive at some frequencies and sound pressure levels as at others, a number of frequency weighting scales have been developed. The "A" weighting scale is most commonly used for environmental noise assessment, as sound pressure levels measured using an A-weighting filter correlate well with community response to noise sources such as aircraft and traffic.

When an A-weighting filter is used to measure sound pressure levels, the results may be expressed as sound levels, in decibels (dB). It is sufficient to use the abbreviation "dB" if these terms are well defined, but many people prefer to use the expressions dBA or dB(A) for clarity. For convenience, many people use the term "noise level" interchangeably with "sound level." Table A-1 shows typical sound levels and relative loudness for various types of noise environments.

21

The ambient noise level is defined as the noise from all sources near and far. This term usually refers the ambient noise level that is present before a noise source being studied is introduced. A synonymous term is pre-project noise level.
Noise exposure contours or noise contours are lines drawn about a noise source representing constant levels of noise exposure. CNEL or Ldn (DNL) contours are frequently utilized to graphically portray community noise exposure. The terms CNEL and Ldn (DNL) are defined in the following section.

Environmental Noise Descriptors
Most environmental noise sources produce varying amounts of noise over time, so the measured sound levels also vary. For example, noise produced during a train passage will vary from relatively quiet background levels before the event to maximum value when the train passes by, then returning down to background levels as the train leaves the observer's vicinity. Similarly, noise from traffic varies with the number and types of vehicles, speed, and proximity to the observer.

Variations in sound levels may be addressed by statistical methods. The simplest of these are the maximum (Lmax) and minimum (Lmia) noise levels, which are the highest and lowest levels observed. To describe less extreme variations in sound levels, other statistical descriptors may be used, such as the L10 and L50 and L90. The L10 is the A-weighted sound level equaled or exceeded during 10 percent of a time period. Similarly, the L50 and L90 are the sound levels

22

equaled or exceeded during 50 and 90 percent of a time period. The most common time period used with these statistical descriptors 1 is 1 hour, although any time period could be used so long
as it is stated.

Because statistical descriptors such as L10, L5o, etc. are sometimes cumbersome to calculate, the equivalent sound level (Leq) or energy average sound level is often used to describe the "average" sound level during stated time period, usually 1 hour.

The Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL) is calculated from hourly Leg values, after adding a "penalty" to the noise levels measured during the evening (7 p.m. to 10 p.m.) and nighttime (10 p.m. to 7 a.m.) periods. The penalty for evening hours is a factor of 3, which is equivalent to 4.77 dB. The penalty for nighttime hours is a factor of 10, which is equivalent to 10 dB. To calculate Ldn (also called DNL), the evening penalty is omitted.

RE: RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT NEAR COLUSA COUNTY AIRPORT-COLUSA,
CALIFORNIA

Dear Mr. Kley:

Bollard & Brennan, Inc. has completed acoustical measurements, analysis, and recommendations for the above-referenced project in accordance with our agreement dated March 29, 2005. The following is based on acoustical measurements recorded on the project site on May 10-11, 2005, applicable Colusa County noise exposure criteria, and the CY2015 noise exposure contour map for the Colusa County Airport.

The proposed project site is located north/northwest of Colusa County Airport (008), as shown in the attached graphic. The project site is primarily impacted by Airport aircraft departures from Runway 31 turning left (west) over the project site. Significant impacts are expected during peak crop-duster activities, such as those recording during our noise measurement session in May 2005.
Applicable Noise Exposure Criteria:

For the purposes of evaluating noise impacts due to new projects, the criteria contained within the Colusa County Noise Element of the General Plan are used. The General Plan establishes a "normally acceptable" exterior noise level standard for residential uses of 60 dB Láns which is applied in all outdoor activity areas. A "conditionally acceptable" exterior noise level standard of 70 dB Lqn is applied only after careful study and determination of protective measures has been completed.

Mr. Jacob H. Kley
Colusa Industrial Properties June 1, 2005

The County has also established an interior noise level criterion of 45 dB Lin- This standard has been established as a means of providing an acceptable noise environment for indoor communication
and sleep. The 45 dB Lan interior noise exposure standard is consistent with State and Federal
guidelines.

Local, State, and Federal guidelines typically use the 65 dB Ldn (or CNEL) as a criterion for significance with respect to aircraft noise exposure and residential land uses. Typically, residential construction is not recommended in locations were aircraft noise exposure exceeds (or will exceed) 65 dB Ldn/CNEL. Although the County does offer a "conditionally acceptable" range (60-70 dB Ltn), the Colusa County Noise Element does not specifically state that new residential developments will be allowed were the exterior noise exposure is, or is expected to be, in this range.

Noise Level Measurements:

Noise level measurements were conducted on or near the residential project site by Bollard & Brennan, Inc. staff on May 10 & 11, 2005. Long-term (24-hour) automated noise level measurements were conducted at Site 1, while short-term measurements were conducted at Site 2.
Please see the attached graphic for locations of the measurement sites. The sound level meter at Site
was programmed to collect single-event data (aircraft overflights), as well as hourly noise levels. The instrumentation used to complete these measurements included Larson-Davis Laboratories
(LDL) Model 820 sound level meters fitted with a LDL Model 2560 ½" free-field microphones. These systems were calibrated in the field using a LDL Model CAL200 acoustical calibrator.
At Site 1, aircraft noise exposure was measured to be approximately 69 dB Láns with maximum recorded noise levels (Lmax) of 66-107 dB for individual aircraft operations. Generally speaking, typical crop-duster operations over the project site generated noise levels of 95-107 dB Luax at Site 1. It is estimated, based on the short-term measurements collected at Site 2, that aircraft noise
exposure during peak crop-dusting periods is approximately 16 dB less at Site 2 than at Site 1. Therefore, an exposure of approximately 53 dB Lin is expected at Site 2 during current worst-case crop-dusting activity at the Colusa County Airport.

Colusa County Airport CY2015 Aircraft Noise Contours

The most recent Colusa County Airport noise contours, produced using CY2015 assumptions (i.e., operations, flight patterns, fleet mix, etc.), are presented in the attached graphic. As shown, the

project site is expected to be impacted by aircraft noise exposure between 55-70+ dB Lan/CNEL. It is estimated that more than 70% of the project site will be exposed to aircraft noise exposure of 65 dB Ldn/CNEL or more by 2015: Therefore, it is estimated that more than 70% of the project site will experience aircraft noise exposure in excess of the accepted significance criterion. As shown in the attached graphic, it is estimated that at least 15% of the project site will experience aircraft noise exposure of 70 dB Ldr/CNEL or greater. The highest exterior aircraft noise exposure on the proposed residential project site is expected to be approximately 75 dB La/CNEL.
The aircraft noise exposure expressed by the CY2015 Airport noise contours is higher than that recorded during our noise measurement session of May 2005. We recommend that these contours be used for land use planning in the Airport's vicinity.

Analysis:

Standard residential construction, including that proposed for this project, will generally provide no less than 25 dB of exterior-to-interior noise level reduction (NLR) with all exterior doors and windows closed. Therefore, exterior noise exposure greater than 70 dB Lan/CNEL would be required to exceed the 45 dB Lin interior noise exposure criterion.

Maximum Aircraft Noise Levels:

It is expected that worst-case maximum aircraft noise exposure will be near 82 dB L'max (107 dB L'max - 25 dB NLR = 82 dB Lmax) within noise-sensitive project rooms on the east side of the project site (under the flight path). This level of exposure will likely be viewed by building occupants as extreme noise intrusion. Typical conversation/speech generally lies in the range of 50-70 dB, and would be significantly impacted by individual aircraft noise events. Without significant building construction improvements, there would likely be high levels of aircraft-related noise complaints from occupants of the proposed project dwellings.

Average Aircraft Noise Level:

Based on the CY2015 aircraft noise contours presented in the attached graphic, the calculated worst- case aircraft noise exposure within project homes on the east side of the project site (under the flight

path) is expected to be approximately 50 dB Lh/CNEL (75 dB LA/CNEL - 25 dB NLR = 50 dB Ldr/CNEL). This level exceeds the applicable interior noise exposure criterion by 5 dB. It is expected that construction improvements, beyond typical residential construction practices, may provide the exterior-to-interior NLR required to meet the applicable 45 dB Lam interior noise exposure criterion. However, residential building construction inside of the 70 dB La/CNEL noise contour is not recommended for this project.

Crop Duster Flight Path:

Based on our site observations and noise exposure measurements, Bollard & Brennan, Inc. estimates
that a majority of the aircraft noise exposure on the project site is (and will be in 2015) generated by crop duster aircraft departing Runway 31 and turning left (west) over the project site. If instead, these operations turned right (cast), then noise exposure on the project site would be significantly reduced. In this case, it could be argued that CY2015 Colusa County Airport noise exposure would
not exceed 70 dB Lin/CNEL on the project site; and much of the proposed residential project site would be outside of the 65 dB LA/CNEL aircraft noise exposure contour.

Recommendations:

Bollard & Brennan, Inc. recommend the following with respect Colusa County Airport aircraft noise
exposure on the proposed residential project site.
Residential construction should not be considered within the 70 dB La/CNEL CY2015 Colusa County Airport aircraft noise exposure contour.
An interpretation from the County should be requested as to precisely what exterior noise standard should be applied to residential development on this site. If residential dwellings are allowed within the 65-70 dB Län/CNEL CY2015 Colusa County Airport aircraft noise exposure contours, the dwellings should incorporate several building construction improvements to mitigate interior aircraft noise exposure. The improvements
include the following. All exterior wall construction should be stucco. A standard three-coat system is
acceptable. If a single-coat system is desired, then one layer of ½"+ exterior gypsum board or plywood sheathing is required under the foam exterior foam board.

1293 Lincoln Way, Suite A Auburn, CA 95603 * Phone: (530) 745-0191  Fax: (530) 745-0192

All exterior doors (including sliding-glass doors) and windows, and their associated hardware, should provide sound insulation performance of STC 40 or better. A laboratory test should be required to prove this performance rating. All attic vents (eave or gable) should be acoustically baffle to minimize sound flaking through the ceiling. Bollard & Brennan, Inc. staff would be happy to help the project architect/contractor with these baffle designs.
• All project buildings should be provided with adequate and appropriately designed mechanical ventilation systems (i.e., air conditioning) so that exterior doors and windows may remain closed during worst-case noise exposure times. A qualified acoustical consultant should review all project architectural drawings, details, and notes to verify incorporation of the above-described construction elements.

• The project developer should inform all prospective home owners of the aircraft noise exposure issues associated with the project using appropriate documentation. In addition, the project developer and County should seek legal advise and require the appropriate legal documentation from project home owners to mitigate future legal action with respect to noise exposure and other issues associated with the operations of the Airport.
It should be noted that any residential construction on the proposed project site, regardless of noise mitigation efforts, will likely produce aircraft noise exposure complaints from future residents. The measures presented above are intended to reduce the potential for these complaints; but given the subjective nature of human reaction to noise, no guarantee can be provided that complaints will not
arise.

RE: RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT NEAR COLUSA COUNTY AIRPORT - COLUSA,
CALIFORNIA

Dear Mr. Kley:

Bollard Acoustical Consultants, Inc. has completed Colusa County Airport aircraft noise
modeling as requested by Colusa Industrial Properties. The purpose of this study was to
determine the future aircraft noise impact on the project property assuming that agriculture-
related aircraft (crop dusters) would utilize eastbound departure flight tracks only (no flights
directly over the project property), and compare this impact with the published CY2015 Colusa
County Airport aircraft noise exposure contours. This exercise was completed for both the
existing 3,000-foot runway system and the proposed future 3,700-foot runway system.

The proposed project site is located north/northwest of Colusa County Airport (008) as shown in
the attached graphics. The project site is primarily impacted by Airport aircraft departures from
Runway 31 turning left (west) over the project site.

The following is based on Integrated Noise Model (INM) Version 6.1 study files for the Colusa
County Airport provided by Brown-Buntin Associates, Inc. This INM study was altered with
respect to runway length and flight track allocation where needed to provide for the above-
described comparison.

Applicable Noise Exposure Criteria:

For the purposes of evaluating noise impacts due to new projects, the criteria contained within
the Colusa County Noise Element of the General Plan are used. The General Plan establishes
a "normally acceptable" exterior noise level standard for residential uses of 60 dB Ldn which is

applied within all outdoor activity areas (backyards). A "conditionally acceptable" exterior noise
level standard of 70 dB Ldn is applied only after careful study and determination of protective
measures has been completed.

The County has also established an interior noise level criterion of 45 dB Ldn. This standard has
been established as a means of providing an acceptable noise environment for indoor
communication and sleep. The 45 dB Ldn interior noise exposure standard is consistent with
State and Federal guidelines.

Local, state, and federal guidelines typically use 65 dB Ldin (or CNEL) as a criterion for
significance with respect to aircraft noise exposure and residential land uses. Typically, residential construction is not recommended in locations where aircraft noise exposure is
expected to exceed 65 dB Ltin/CNEL. Although the County does offer a "conditionally
acceptable" range (60-70 dB Lmn/CNEL), the Colusa County Noise Element does not specifically state that new residential developments will be allowed where the exterior noise exposure is
expected to be in this range.

Colusa County Airport CY2015 Aircraft Noise Modeling:

The aircraft noise exposure modeling described below was completed using the Federal
Aviation Administration's (FAA) Integrated Noise Model (INM) software, Version 6.1. This is the
latest version of the software.

The most recent Colusa County Airport noise contours produced using CY2015 assumptions
(i.e., operations, flight patterns, fleet mix, etc.) and both the existing 3,000-foot and proposed
future 3,700-foot runway systems are attached. As shown, the project site is expected to be
impacted by aircraft noise exposure between 55-75 dB CNEL. It is estimated that more than
70% of the project site will be exposed to aircraft noise exposure of 65 dB CNEL or more by
2015. Therefore, it is estimated that more than 70% of the project site will experience aircraft
noise exposure in excess of the accepted significance criterion. As shown in the attached
graphics, it is estimated that as-much-as 20% of the project site may experience aircraft noise
exposure of 70 dB CNEL or greater. The highest exterior aircraft noise exposure on the
proposed residential project site is expected to be between 70-75 dB CNEL.

Bollard Acoustical Consultants, Inc. completed additional aircraft noise modeling assuming that
all agriculture-related aircraft would utilize eastbound departure flight tracks only. This analysis
was also completed for both the existing 3,000-foot runway system and the proposed future
3,700-foot runway system. The resulting noise contour maps (attached) show that, under this
hypothetical

flight track allocation scenario, future CY2015 Colusa County Airport aircraft noise exposure on
the project site would not be expected to exceed 65 dB CNEL. This is below the established
significance criterion and within the County's "conditionally acceptable" noise exposure range.

AERIAL APPLICATION OPERATIONAL ANALYSIS
FOR
COLUSA COUNTY AIRPORT

October 19, 2007

The following analysis was prepared by Mead & Hunt, Inc. under contract to SWCA Environmental Consultants. The purpose of this analysis is to assess the potential operational interaction and impacts of a proposed residential / commercial development on aerial application operations at the Colusa County Airport. This anal ysis will be considered in the preparation of the Environmental Impact Report for the proposed development located northwest of the Colusa County Airport. In preparing this analysis, the consultant interviewed several individuals and agencies with an interest in and knowledge of aerial application operations at the Colusa County Airport (see Attachment 1).
Overview / Description of Aerial Application Operational Factors
Aerial application operations (also referred to as "agricultural aircraft operations", "crop dusting" "ag flying" etc.) have been conducted at the Colusa County Airport for many decades. It is considered by many to be a primary use of the County's general aviation airport and a vital a component of the region's important agricultural economy. The Federal Aviation Administration (CFR Part 137) defines such activity as:
Agricultural aircraft operation means the operation of an aircraft for the purpose of (1) dispensing any economic poison, (2) dispensing any other substance intended for plant nourishment, soil treatment, propagation of plant life, or pest control, or (3) engaging in dispensing activities directly affecting agriculture, horticulture, or forest preservation, but not including the dispensing of live insects.

The Federal Aviation Administration regulates all civilian aviation activity in the United States. The regulations specific to aerial application operations are detailed in the Code of Federal Regulations - Part 137 - Agricultural Aircraft Operations (see Attachment 2).
The State of California's State Aeronautics Act provides rules and regulations for the operation of all civilian aircraft within the state. The State of California has not promulgated any aeronautical regulations specific to the operation of aerial application aircraft.
Approximately one dozen operators make use of the Colusa County Airport for the purposes of aerial application operations. One operator, Valley Air, is based at the Airport and another operator, Martin's Dusters, has its facilities located adjacent to the Airport and operates on a "through-the-fence" basis. During the rainy season, operators of aerial application aircraft who typically operate at outlying unimproved private airfields will occasionally make use of the Colusa County Airport because of its paved all-weather runway/taxiway system.

Mead & Hunt Page 1 of 8

1818S= 1S-......

Aerial application operations occur throughout the year with increased activity during specific time periods. Due to the nature of the application process, aerial application operations typically occur during early morning/dawn and late afternoon/dusk. The aircraft seldom fly higher than 500 feet above the ground while enroute to the fields, and when working the fields, they operate at very low altitudes - literally mere feet above the fields. Much of this low altitude flying involves relatively slow speeds, steep turns, and other maneuvers required to efficiently position the aircraft for the application process, The aircraft generally depart the Airport fully loaded with chemicals or other agricultural agents and return to the Airport empty having discharged their loads onto the target fields. The aircraft utilized for aerial applications are primarily relatively noisy, single-engine, propeller-driven, fixed-wing airplanes (e.g., Grumman/Schweizer Ag Cat, Air Tractor 301, Ayers Thrush, Cessna Ag Truck, etc.). Some of these airplanes are powered by older-style large radial piston engines and some are powered by more modern turboprop engines. In addition, light helicopters are used for aerial application. Helicopters' vertical takeoff and landing capabilities make them less dependent upon the availability of a nearby airport.
Some of the chemicals and agricultural agents carried by aerial application aircraft are hazardous to people and animals if improperly dispersed. In this regard, any overflight of residential / commercial areas by aerial application aircraft carrying hazardous materials poses a potential threat in the event of an aircraft accident or inadvertent chemical discharge. Therefore, wherever possible, overflight of residential / commercial areas by aerial application aircraft carrying hazardous materials should be avoided. Aerial application operators, as normal operating practice, endeavor to avoid such flight operations over or in the vicinity of people and animals. (It should be noted that in May of this year, an aerial application airplane fatally crashed near the south end of Wescott Road just west of the Colusa County Airport.)
The Airport utilizes a standard left-hand traffic pattern for Runway 13 operations and standard right-hand traffic pattern for Runway 31 operations in accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration's recommended procedures (see Attachment 3). The traffic pattern altitude is 800 feet above airport elevation. These traffic patterns and their relationship to the proposed development area are depicted in Attachment 4. Presented in Attachment 5 are a series of aerial photographs taken of the subject development area and its relationship to Colusa County Airport's traffic patterns. These aerial photographs were taken from a typical small general aviation airplane (Cessna 182 Skylane) flying the standard traffic patterns at the Colusa County Airport.

It can be anticipated that general aviation aircraft operating in the traffic patterns at the Colusa County Airport will regularly overfly the proposed development area at low altitudes and at high engine power settings. In addition, sideline noise from such aircraft operations may be a source of considerable annoyance for both the proposed development's residential users and commercial users (e.g., hotel, restaurant, etc.). On an aircraft's initial climb-out, immediately following lift-off from the departure runway, pilots frequently adjust their engine's power setting by changing the propeller speed and/or throttle setting. Similarly, during the final stages of an aircraft's approach to a landing, pilots frequently adjust engine power and/or the aircraft's configuration. The result of these actions is a noticeable change in the sound of the aircraft. This change in sound is often perceived by persons on the ground as disturbing and/or

Mead & Hunt Page 2 of 8

•4 P-IRVPOEDS

threatening. This factor will also prove problematic for both the proposed development's residential users and commercial users (e.g., hotel, restaurant, etc.).
Aerial application operators typically do not utilize an airport's standard traffic patterns. In fact, they typically avoid interacting with the general aviation operations at an airport. Aerial application aircraft are permitted by CFR Part 137.45 (see Attachment 2) to approach the airport from virtually any direction and at much lower altitudes than those altitudes used by other general aviation aircraft. Asa normal mode of operation, the aerial application operators at the Colusa County Airport endeavor to avoid overflying noise sensitive areas - part of their "Good Neighbor" effort. The operators adjust their approach and departure paths as much as is safe and practical to avoid creating unwanted noise exposure or overflight hazard.
Fixed-wing airplane aerial application operations at the Colusa County Airport are conducted utilizing the Airport's single paved runway - Runway 13/31. According to the Colusa County Airport Environmental Assessment and Environmental Impact Report (prepared in 2004), "Cropdusters" utilize the runway on a balanced basis. That is, cach runway end sees an equal amount of takeoffs and landings (see Table 4-1 below).

Aerial application aircraft generally depart the Airport heavily loaded. As a result, their climb performance and maneuverability are limited. It is not advisable for aircraft departing under such conditions to make sharp turns or maneuver excessively during departure. Generally, it is advisable for such aircraft to climb straight-out until a safe altitude is reached or make gentle turns prior to proceeding on course. In addition, such takeoffs require the use of maximum rated engine power and the resultant high levels of noise (primarily propeller tip noise and engine exhaust noise). Aerial application aircraft typically create more of a noise impact on nearby land uses than similarly-sized general aviation aircraft due to the acrial application aircrafts' larger engines, higher propeller tip speeds, compromised climb capability, and lower operating altitudes. In addition, aerial application aircraft may be carrying chemicals or other agricultural agents that if improperly dispersed, could pose a health hazard to persons on the ground.

Mead & Hunt Page 3 of 8

The Colusa County Airport Environmental Assessment and Environmental Impact Report (prepared in 2004), projects that the Existing and Year 2015 CNEL noise levels in the proposed development area will be in the range of 60 dB CNEL - 65 dB CNEL. We believe that aircraft making the departure turns as depicted in the Report's figures will, in fact, fly directly over the proposed development area. As a result, we a anticipate that the noise levels impacting the proposed development area will be significant due to low altitude overflight and sideline noise. These noise levels would be in excess of those noise levels considered compatible with development of residential uses and other noise-sensitive activities (e.g., hotel, restaurant, etc.). Furthermore, such low altitude operations by aerial application aircraft directly over populated arcas (c.g., such as the proposed residential / commercial areas) should be avoided due to the potential, albeit small, for an aircraft accident or inadvertent chemical discharge.
The Colusa County Airport is currently served by three nonprecision instrument approach procedures (VOR-A, GPS Rwy 13, and GPS Rwy 31) - see Attachment 6. All three of these instrument approaches bring aircraft into the airport environs at low altitudes (approximately 500 feet above airport elevation) during inclement weather conditions. The procedure for the VOR- A approach requires aircraft executing e Missed Approach to fly directly over the proposed residential development area at low altitude and at high engine power settings. Similarly, the procedure for the GPS Rwy 31 approach requires aircraft executing a Missed Approach to fly over the proposed commercial development area at low altitude and at high engine power settings. Although the Airport will likely have a low number of instrument approaches during the course of a year and aerial application aircraft do not typically utilize an airport's instrument approach capability, it can be anticipated that the noise and aircraft overflights associated with these instrument approach operations will negatively impact the proposed development area.
Analysis of Alternative Flight Paths and Procedures for Aerial Application Aircraft Operations at the Colusa County Airport

CFR Part 137.49 and 137.51 (see Attachment 2) specify the federal regulations that apply to acrial application operations over "other than congested areas" and over "congested areas". (Note that the Federal Aviation Administration does not formally define the term "congested areas". However, any assemblage of residential units and/or commercial development accommodating groups of people would likely be viewed by the Federal Aviation Administration as a "congested area").

At the present time, virtually all of the area in the immediate vicinity of the Colusa County Airport would likely be considered by the Federal Aviation Administration as "other than congested area". Therefore, there has been no reason for Airport's aerial application operators to formally submit and comply with the requirements (e.g., coordinate, advertise, plan, avoid, etc.) identified in CFR 137.51 - Operation over Congested Areas: General. If the proposed development were to be implemented, it is likely that this new development area would be considered a "congested area" for the purposes of this federal regulation. If overflight of this new development area by aerial application aircraft were to then occur, the requirements of CFR 137.51 would apply. CFR Part 137.51 specifies the following (specific excerpts relevant to this analysis have been highlighted):

Mead & Hunt Page 4 of 8

•** .-.84

(a) Notwithstanding Part 91 of this chapter, an aircraft may be operated over a congested area at altitudes required for the proper accomplishment of the agricultural aircraft operation if the operation is conducted--

(1) With the maximum safety to persons and property on the surface, consistent with the operation; and

(2) In accordance with the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section.
(b) No person may operate an aircraft over a congested area except in accordance with the requirements of this paragraph.
(l) Prior written approval must be obtained from the appropriate official or governing body of the political subdivision over which the operations are conducted.
(2) Notice of the intended operation must be given to the public by some effective means, such as daily newspapers, radio, television, or door-to-door notice.
(3) A plan for each complete operation must be submitted to, and approved by appropriate personnel of the FAA Flight Standards District Office having jurisdiction over the area where the operation is to be conducted. The plan must include consideration of obstructions to flight; the emergency landing capabilities of the aircrafl to be used; and any necessary coordination with air traffic control.
(4) Single engine aircraft must be operated as follows:
(i) Except for helicopters, no person may take off a loaded aircraft, or make ( turnaround over a congested area. a

(ü) No person may operate an aircraft over a congested area below the altitudes prescribed in Part 91 of this chapter except during the actual dispensing operation, including the approaches and departures necessary for that operation.

(ii) No person may operate an aircraft over a congested area during the actual dispensing operation, including the approaches and departures for that operation, unless it is operated in a pattern and at such an altitude that the aircraft can land, in an emergency, without endangering persons or property on the surface.
As noted previously, there is 110 such operational plan in effect at the Colusa County Airport nor is one required at present. If the proposed residential / commercial development were to be implemented, then such an operational plan would likely be required by the Federal Aviation Administration in accordance with CFR 137.51.

Under certain circumstances, it is possible for alternative flight paths and/or procedures to be locally developed that can somewhat mitigate the noise and overflight impacts of aerial

Mead & Hunt Page 5 of 8

application aircraft operations. All such paths and procedures must comply with Federal Aviation Administration rules, regulations, and operating standards.
The recommended paths and procedures must be "voluntary" in that these paths and procedures cannot be "required" by the local airport owner/operator. As the overseer of the nation's aviation system, only the Federal Aviation Administration can "require" unique flight paths and non- standard operational procedures. The development and implementation of such "required" procedures is typically a lengthy and costly process. The local airport owner/operator can "encourage" the voluntary use of some procedures, but does SO at some liability risk. In all cases, the safety of flight operations remains paramount at all times.
The project proponent has suggested that one or more "overflight corridors" could be established that would channel or otherwise route aerial application aircraft so as to avoid direct overflight of the proposed residential / commercial development area (see Attachment 4). Our analysis concludes that the suggested "overflight corridors" are neither practical nor safe as proposed. The proposed corridors are positioned too close to the airport for safe aircraft maneuvering, are too narrow to have any meaningful effect, are too difficult for pilots to consistently see and use, and do not realistically provide any meaningful noise or safety enhancement. We do not believe that there is any practical corridor routing or configuration that would effectively mitigate the potential hazard associated with aerial application aircraft overflight of the proposed development area.

Analysis of Five Potential Operational Procedures
In the specific case of Colusa County Airport's aerial application operations and their relationship to the proposed residential/commercial development area, the following five potential operational procedures were explored:
1. Encourage aerial application operators to utilize the runway direction and traffic pattern which minimizes noise and overflight exposure in the proposed development area.
This could be accomplished by requesting that noisy and/or potentially hazardous aircraft takeoff to the south (depart on Runway 13) and land to the north (on Runway 31) whenever winds, weather, air traffic, and safety considerations permit. Air traffic and wind permitting, this procedure is already used by some aerial application operators at the Airport as part of their "Good Neighbor" effort. Generally speaking, this procedure is not a desirable operational scenario at a public-use airport like Colusa County Airport, Aircraft, particularly small general aviation aircraft and heavily-loaded aerial application aircraft, seek to takeoff and land into the wind as much as possible. Therefore, wind and weather conditions dictate the appropriate runway to use. This is an important flight safety issue. The imposition of the nonstandard, designated runway use procedure noted above introduces the potential for counter-flow of aircraft within the Airport's traffic patterns. Aircraft may find themselves operating head-to- head in the traffic patterns while maneuvering to approach/depart conflicting runways. This is also an important flight safety issue. Such a designated runway use procedure is also inefficient in terms of aircraft operating time and fuel consumption. Aircraft departing Runway 13 will continue to produce significant departure noise reverberating back from the approach end of Runway 13 into the proposed development area.

Mead & Hunt Page 6 of 8

.... ....... ........

2. Encourage aerial application operators to execute an early turn (left or right) during departure from Runway 31.

As noted carlier in this analysis, aerial application aircraft generally depart the Airport heavily loaded with chemicals or other agricultural agents. As a result, their climb performance and maneuverability are limited. They are operating at low altitudes with high engine power settings. It is not advisable for aircraft departing under such conditions to make sharp turns or maneuver excessively during departure. Generally, it is advisable for such aircraft to climb straight-out until a safe altitude is reached or make gentle turns prior to proceeding on course. An early turn to the west would result in the departing aircraft flying directly over the proposed residential development area at low altitude and at high engine power. An early turn to the east would result in the departing aircraft flying directly over the proposed commercial development area at low altitude and at high engine power. None of these scenarios is operationally desirable, significantly reduces noise exposure, or is safe. The overflight accident potential and sideline noise impacting the proposed development area would still be considerable irrespective of the early turn location or direction.

3. Encourage aerial application operalors to execute straight-out departures for Runway 3/ operations.

This procedure avoids the negative safety and operational implications associated with early turns at low altitudes and direct overflight of the proposed residential / commercial development areas. However, it can be anticipated that the departure sideline noise impacting the proposed development area will be considerable and unsuitable for development of residential uses and noise-sensitive commercial activities (e.g., hotel, restaurant, etc.). Furthermore, any extended straight-out departure from Runway 31 will likely result in exposing the existing residential areas located in the southern portion of the City of Colusa to increased aircraft noise and low altitude overflight.

4. Encourage aerial application operators fo execute an engine power reduction on departure from Runway 31.

While somewhat decreasing propeller and engine noise levels, this procedure also potentially decreases the climb rate, altitude, and speed of the departing aircraft. As a result, the time that the aircraft spends overflying the development area is increased, thus potentially exacerbating the noise exposure and potential safety hazard. In addition, the operating manuals for many aircraft types specify the use of high engine power for the initial takeoff roll and climb-out so as to maximize the attainment of altitude and airspeed during the initial stages of the departure. Some pilots view any significant reduction in the aircraft manufacturer's specified takeoff power during a departure as potentially compromising flight safety.
5. Require aerial application operators to comply with the requirements of CFR 137.5 - Operation over Congested Areas: General
As noted previously, if the proposed residential / commercial development were to be implemented, it is likely that this new development area would be considered a "congested area" for the purposes of CFR 137.51. Accordingly, aerial application operations at the Airport would

Mead & Hunt Page 7 of 8

have to comply with the provisions of CFR 137.51. The County, Airport, associated political subdivision, and aerial application operators would have to jointly develop a set of operational procedures that would comply with CFR 137.51 and be approved by the Federal Aviation Administration. Such operational procedures would likely prohibit aerial application aircraft loaded with hazardous chemicals or other agricultural agents from overflying the proposed residential / commercial development areas at low altitude. Such prohibition would significantly degrade the safely of Airport operations by imposing artificially derived, nonstandard runway use assignments such as those previously described in alternative operational procedure #1 above. To avoid overflight of the proposed residential / commercial development area, the CFR 137.51 procedures could require loaded acrial application aircraft to depart on Runway 13 irrespective of wind conditions and the traffic pattern in use at the time. The imposition of this nonstandard operational procedure could result in counter-flow (i.e., head- to-head) aircraft traffic within the traffic pattern and a resultant reduction in the safety of Airport operations. In addition, the resultant departure with a tailwind component has the potential of further degrading aircraft operational safety.

Conclusions

This analysis concludes that there are no reasonably implementable alternative flight paths and/or practical operational procedures that could be implemented at the Colusa County Airport that would sufficiently mitigate the negative impact that the proposed residential/commercial development area would have on the Airport's aerial application aircraft operations. The proposed development area is to be situated in an area that will be exposed on a regular and continuing basis to significant aircraft noise and low altitude overflights during both normal general aviation aircraft operations and aerial application aircraft operations. It can be anticipated that some of these aerial application aircraft-related noise impacts will occur at times that are most sensitive to residential land uses - early morning/dawn and late afternoon/dusk. No alternative flight paths and/or operational procedures were identified that would meaningfully mitigate or significantly reduce this negative noise impact and overflight exposure.

() No person may take off a multiengine airplane over a congested area except under conditions that will allow the airplane to be brought to a safe stop within the effective length of the runway from any point on takeoff up to the time of attaining, with all engines operating at normal takeoff power, 105 percent of the minimum control speed with the critical engine inoperative in the takeoff configuration or 115 percent of the power-off stall speed in the takeoff configuration, whichever is greater, as shown by the accelerate stop distance data. In applying this requirement, takeoff data is based upon still-alr conditions, and no correction is made for any uphill gradient of 1 percent or less when the percentage is measured as the difference between elevation at the end points of the runway divided by the total length. For uphill gradients greater than percent, the effective takeoff length of the runway is reduced 20 percent for each 1-percent grade.

(il) No person may operate a multiengine airplane at a weight greater than the weight that, with the critical engine inoperative, would permit a rate of climb of at least 50 feet per minute at an altitude of at least 1,000 feet above the elevation of the highest ground or obstruction within the area to be worked or at an altitude of 5,000 feet, whichever is higher. For the purposes of this subdivision, it is assumed that the propeller of the inoperative engine is in the minimum drag position; that the wing flaps and landing gear are in the most favorable positions; and that the remaining engine or engines are operating at the maximum continuous power available.

(18I) No person may operate any multiengine aircraft over a congested area below the altitudes prescribed in part 91 of this chapter except during the actual dispensing operation, including the approaches, departures, and turnarounds necessary for that operation.

4-3-3. Traffic Patterns

At most airports and military air bases, traffic pattern altitudes for propeller-driven aircraft generally extend from 600 feet to as high as 1,500 feet above the ground. Also, traffic pattern altitudes for military turbojet aircraft sometimes extend up to 2,500 feet above the ground. Therefore, pilots of en route aircraft should be constantly on the alert for other aircraft in traffic patterns and avoid these areas whenever possible. Traffic pattern altitudes should be maintained unless otherwise required by the applicable distance from cloud criteria (14 CFR Section 91.155). (See FIG 4-3-2 and FIG 4-3-3.)

PROJECT BACKGROUND:
Although not specifically proposed at this time, devolopment of the Project properties was anticipated within past and current Genoral Plans of both the Cily of Colusa and County of Colusa. As a result, the above-listed (and additional) Project components have already undergone extensive environmental documentation wilhin the Clty of Colusa 2007 Genaral Plen Masier Environmental Impact Report ("MEIR*), as well as within the General Plan Amandment and Zoning Amendment for Colusa Industrial Properties - Draft & Final Environmental Impaci Reports ("CIP EIR), certified by the County of Colusa In 2008.
In Ociober 2007, the City of Colusa City Couneill certiied the-MEIR, which describes the Project as being wilhln Spécial Planning Area # 5 and Incorporeles specific miligalion measures. The Project is Identilied as a *Subsequent Project and Aclion(s)* within the escope of the MEIR, and it is analyzed as such through the preparation of this Intilal Study In accordance wilh Califomla Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) Guidelines Section $5177. This Initlal Study evaluates the Prolect for anv potentlal, adverse environmenial Impacis ABQVE,AND BEXOND ihose alteady Idenified & mlinated within tha above-refsrenced MEIR: and for some of which the Clty.Council.dulv adopled a stetement of ovemidina considerations. None of the Project components would cause any addilional signiticant effect on the environment which was not previously examined in the MEIR.
Approval of the Project would replace the existing commercial, low-densily, high-densily, open space, and Industrial land usas (already established and zoned wilhin the Gounty of Colusa) with the appropriate reaognized by Ihe City of Colusa. and corresponding land wse / zoning designations
Additionaily, mitigation measures wthln the CIP EIR apply to the Project and supplement those of the MEIR, further reducing Project- related environmental impacis to leveis of insignificance. Where CIP EIR mitigation measures were Insufficient to offaet signiticant environmental Impaots, a Btatement of Ovaiiding Considerations was also adopied by the County of Colusa,

GENERAL PLAN DESIGNATION:
The proposed project ('Projeci") is withln the City of Colusa Sphere of Influence and the General Plan Areà es Special Planning Area $5. Specifically, the Projec Site la dealginated wilh the following Clty of Colusa General Plan land uses:
Low Density Residential 54:01 acres
industrial 13.20 acres
Parks/Recreation/Open Space 116.13 acres
Commercial Profossional 28.54 abres

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING:
The project site is comprised of existing professional / commercial officas within an existing commercial/ Industrial park; other developed and undeveloped commercial /industrial parcels; a 9-hole golf course, driving range, and clubhouse; three (3) residential dwellings; and old fields dominated by invasive plante thal are regularly dlaked to control weeds.. The project site is adjacent to the southeast boundaries of the City of Colusa.

WEST: Alrport, undeveloped Industrial parcels Single-Family Residences, Agriculture

PUBLIC HEARING DATES: PLANNING COMMISSION - APRIL 23, 2014; CITY COUNCIL - MAY 20 2014 (eetmated)
DETERMINATION:
Il is through the Project's consistency within the scope of tha Cily of Colusa 2007 General Plan MEIR, through the supplemental environmental review and mitigation of the CIP EIR, and on the basis of this inillal evaluation that:

7 I find thal the proposed project would have NO ADDITIONAL SIGNIFICANT EFFECT on the environment, ihatNO NEW ADDITIONAL MITIGATION MEASURES OR ALTERNATIVES may be required, and that the ProjectIS WITHIN THE SCOPE of the City of Colusa 2007 General Plan MEIR. Therefore, in accordance with CEQA Suldelines Seclion 15177 (a) & (b), tio additional environmental documents are required,
i Aind that although the proposed project could have a significant effect on the environment, there will not be à significant effect In this case because revisions in the project have been made by or agreed to by the project proponent. A MITIGATED NEGATIVE DECLARATION will be prepared.
= find that the proposed project MAY have a significant effect on the environment, and an ENVIRONMENTAL .IMPACT REPORT is required.
fhd that the proposed project MAY have à *potentially significant Impact" or *potentlally significant unless miligated* impact on the environment, but at least one effect 1) has been adequately analyzed in an earlier document pursuant to applicable Jegal standards, and 2) has been addressed by milgation measures based on the aarlier analysls as described on attached sheels. An ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT is required, but it must analyze only the offects that remain to be addressed.
I find that allhough the proposed project could have a significant effect on the environment, because all polentially bignificant effects (a) have been analyzed adequately in an earller EIR or NEGATIVE DECLARATION pursuant to applicable standards, and (b) have been avoidad or miligaled pursuant to that earlier EIR or NEGATIVE DECLARATION, Including revisions or mitigation mesaures that are Imposed upon the proposed projact, nothing further is required

WHEREAS, the development application for the Colusa Industrial Park, Inc residential project ("Project") was submitted to the City of Colusa in January 2016. Since that time, the City has been in the process of evaluating the Project in accordance with Government Code section 65451; and
WHEREAS, the Project is a 116.1-acre subdivision and Development Agreement (attached hereto as Exhibit A. incorporated herein by reference) supporting new residential land uses and associated infrastructure and roads in the City of Colusa. The Project includes 52.53 acres of Low Density Residential land; 5.98 acres of High Density land; and 117.59 acres of Open Space land.
WHEREAS, the Project was addressed within the City of Colusa 2007 General Plan Master Environmental Impact Report (MEIR), which was certified in accordance with the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). Additionally, the Project was addressed within the General Plan Amendment and Zoning Amendment for Colusa Industrial Properties - Draft & Final Environmental Impact Reports ("CIP EIR"), certified by the County of Colusa in 2008; and

WHEREAS, a subsequent initial study environmental document was prepared for the Project in accordance with the requirements of the California Environmental (CEQA). This initial study determined that Quality Act

The Property is part of Special Planning Area #5, commonly referred to in the City's General Plan, adopted by the Colusa City Council on October 30, 2007 (the "General Plan"). Landowner represents that it holds all legal and equitable interests in the Property, and Landowner agrees to be bound by this Agreement.

C. The Property is currently undeveloped and is located within the City Limits.
D. The General Plan and more specifically the EIR adopted November 2007 reviewed the following land uses within the Property, to be incorporated into subsequent land use entitlements, as set forth below, for the following gross acres:
Low Density Residential Units 52.53
High Density Residential Units 5.98
Open Space 117.59

E. Environmental Impact Report. On May 28, 2008, the County of Colusa, certified as adequate and complete the Final EIR (the "EIR") (State Clearinghouse #2006052113) for the Project. The City of Colusa caused to be prepared and certified as

City acknowledges that under Government Code Section 66452.6, the term of a tentative subdivision map will be automatically extended for a period of time where a subdivision is obligated to install certain improvements located outside the boundaries of the subdivision. In determining the term of any tentative subdivision map that may be approved in the future by the City for the Property, or any portion thereof, and without limiting the effect of any other provisions of the Government

- 8 -

Code dealing with map extensions, the City agrees that any public improvements, exceeding the value set forth in Section 66452.6 at the time of tentative map approval, shall be treated as such off-site improvements for purposes of applying Section 66452.6 of the Government Code.

A subdivision, as defined in Government Code Section 66473.7, shall not be approved unless any tentative map prepared for the subdivision complies with the provisions of said Section 66473.7. This provision is included in this Agreement to comply with Government Code Section 65867.5.

4.3 Moratorium, Quotas, Restrictions or Other Growth Limitations. Subject to applicable law relating to the vesting provisions of development agreements, Landowner and City intend that except as otherwise provided herein, this Agreement shall vest the Initial Entitlements against subsequent City resolutions, ordinances, growth control measures and initiatives or referenda, other than a referendum that specifically overturns City's approval of the Initial Entitlements, that would directly or indirectly limit the rate, timing or sequencing of development, or would prevent or conflict with the permitted uses, density and intensity of uses as set forth in the Initial Entitlements and that any such resolution, ordinance, initiative or referendum shall not apply to the Initial Entitlements and the Project. Landowner shall, to the extent allowed by the laws pertaining to development agreements, be subject to any growth limitation ordinance, resolution, rule, regulation or policy which is adopted and applied on a uniform, City-wide basis and directly concerns an imminent public health or safety issue. In such case, City shall apply such ordinance, resolution, rule, regulation or policy uniformly, equitably and proportionately to Landowner and the Property and to all other public or private owners and properties directly affected thereby. By way of example only, an ordinance which would preclude the issuance of a building permit due to a City-wide lack of adequate sewage treatment capacity to meet additional demand would directly concern an imminent public health issue under the terms of this paragraph and would support a denial of a building permit within the Property if approval would require additional sewage treatment capacity. However, an effort to limit the issuance of building permits because of a general increase in traffic congestion levels on City roads would not be deemed to directly concern a public health or safety issue under the terms of this paragraph,

1.3.1 Effective Date. The term of this Agreement shall commence upon the approval of the tentative map by the City Council. The Agreement shall be recorded against the Property within ten (10) days after City enters into the Agreement, as required by California Government Code Section 65868.5, provided, however, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall not be binding upon the Property, nor shall Landowner have any development rights or improvement or payment obligations, with the exception of costs incurred by City in the processing of the Initial Entitlements, until tentative map approval.
1.3.2 Term. Upon approval by the City Council, the term of this agreement shall run concurrently with the tentative map and expire upon expiration of any tentative maps, and shall also be extended with the extension of any tentative maps.

2.6 Obligation to Meet and Confer.

4.1 Subdivision Maps. City acknowledges that under Government Code Section 66452.6, the term of a tentative subdivision map will be automatically extended for period of time where a subdivision is obligated to install certain improvements located outside the boundaries of the subdivision. In determining the term of any tentative subdivision map that may be approved in the future by the City for the Property, or any portion thereof, and without limiting the effect of any other provisions of the Government Code dealing with map extensions, the City agrees that any public improvements, exceeding the value set forth in Section 66452.6 at the time of tentative map approval, shall be treated as such off-site improvements for purposes of applying Section 66452.6 of the Government Code.

A subdivision, as defined in Government Code Section 66473.7, shall not be approved unless any tentative map prepared for the subdivision complies with the provisions of said Section 66473.7. This provision is included in this Agreement to comply with Government Code Section 65867.5.

Subject to applicable law relating to the vesting provisions of development agreements, Landowner and City intend that except as otherwise provided herein, this Agreement shall vest the Initial Entitlements against subsequent City resolutions, ordinances, growth control measures and initiatives or referenda, other than a referendum that specifically overturns City's approval of the Initial Entitlements, that

- 8 -

would directly or indirectly limit the rate, timing or sequencing of development, or would prevent or conflict with the permitted uses, density and intensity of uses as set forth in the Initial Entitlements and that any such resolution, ordinance, initiative or referendum shall not apply to the Initial Entitlements and the Project. Landowner shall, to the extent allowed by the laws pertaining to development agreements, be subject to any growth limitation ordinance, resolution, rule, regulation or policy which is adopted and applied on a uniform, City-wide basis and directly concerns an imminent public health or safety issue. In such case, City shall apply such ordinance, resolution, rule, regulation or policy uniformly, equitably and proportionately to Landowner and the Property and to all other public or private owners and properties directly affected thereby. By way of example only, an ordinance which would preclude the issuance of a building permit due to a City- wide lack of adequate sewage treatment capacity to meet additional demand would directly concern an imminent public health issue under the terms of this paragraph and would support a denial of a building permit within the Property if approval would require additional sewage treatment capacity. However, an effort to limit the issuance of building permits because of a general increase in traffic congestion levels on City roads would not be deemed to directly concern a public health or safety issue under the terms of this paragraph.

4.3 Sewer and Water Availability. City represents to Landowner that City has the capacity and ability to provide Landowner with sewer and water services for the number of
paragraph D of the Recitals herein. Said sewer and water services residential units referenced in shall be provided by City upon Landowner paying the applicable service fees for residential sewer and water services.

5.3 Enforced Delay, Extension of Times of Performance.

WHEREAS, upon hearing and considering all testimony and arguments, analyzing the information presented and considering comments received, the City Council considered all facts related to the proposed Project and is prepared to render a decision on the matter of land use plan
incompatibilities.
NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the City Council of the City of Colusa as follows:

Section 1. The foregoing recitations are true and correct and are incorporated fully into this
Resolution.

Section 2. The Project was reviewed in conformance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), Public Resources Code Section 21000 el seq., the CEQA Guidelines, Cal. Code Regs, tit. 14, Section 15000 et seq., and the City Council has, prior to or concurrent with the approval of this proposed resolution, considered the Colusa Industrial Park Initial Study, and
determined that the Project would have NO ADDITIONAL SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS on the
environment, that NO NEW ADDITIONAL MITIGATION MEASURES OR ALTERNATIVES
are required, and that the Project IS WITHIN THE SCOPE of the City of Colusa General Plan MEIR. Such Initial Study and determination serve as the environmental documentation for the
proposed Project.

Section 3. Based on the evidence presented, the City Council hereby OVERRULES the decision
taken by the Colusa County Airport Land Use Commission on March 11, 2021 under the authority provided by section 21675.1 (d) of the California Public Utilities Code and based on the following findings, consistent with section 21670 of the California Public Utilities Code:

Finding #1 - The Project will not adversely impact the ability to provide for the orderly development of the public use airport.
The proposed Project is located 2,000 feet northwest of the Colusa County Airport, within a sparsely developed area, and would not affect the orderly development of the Colusa County Airport as it is not immediately adjacent to or located on any airport

O

Resolution 21-57
Page 3

property, nor within any property that could logically be acquired for the purpose of expanding the airport.
Finding #2 - The Project will not adversely impact the ability to provide for the orderly development of the area surrounding the Colusa County Airport so as to promote the overall goals and objectives of the City of Colusa and Colusa County noise standards and will not cause the creation of new noise and safety problems for individuals.
The proposed Project does not interfere with the orderly development of the areas surrounding the Colusa County Airport and is compatible with the surrounding residential uses nearest to the airport. Mitigation measures have been imposed to ensure that the existing exposure of noise levels are consistent with noise standards for
residential uses.

Prior to building permit issuance for any of the homes on the lots that are located within the noise contour above the 70 dBA Ldn noise level shown in the EIR's noise study, an acoustical engineer shall review the building permit plans to ensure that the indoor noise level will be less than 45 dBA Ldn. In the event that the indoor noise level is above 45 dBA Ldn, the acoustical engineer shall detail what additional noise mitigation shall be required in the construction of the homes.
Adoption by the City of the current version of the State Building Code, requires new construction to be built to much higher levels of insulation standards for wall systems, roof systems, windows and doors than the building code requirements in place in 2014 when the ALUCP was adopted. The increased insulation values have the secondary effect of decreasing sound transfer and thereby reducing interior noise levels below those noise levels contemplated by the 2014 ALUCP.
An acoustical analysis was performed by Bollard Acoustical Consultants, Inc. in July of 2021 and found the construction of the homes to be consistent with the requirement
that indoor noise level will be less than 45 dBA Ldn.
The proposed Project does not hinder in any way the use of the airport, and mitigation is in place to ensure there are no impact to aeronautical function, or interference with airport activities and will not expose people to noise beyond acceptable levels and the Project itself will not pose noise issues to the community, thus furthering the goals and objectives of the established noise standards.
Finding #3 - The Project will not adversely impact the ability to protect the public health, safety, and welfare by continuing to ensure the orderly expansion of the airport and will not adversely affect the utility or capacity of the airport.
The ability for the orderly expansion of the Colusa County Airport will not be affected by the proposed Project. The proposed Project is not immediately adjacent to any airport-owned land. Planned expansions historically considered relocation of the

Resolution 21-57
Page 4

airport or expansion to the south. The Project will not adversely affect the public health, safety, and welfare of the community or the use of the airport, nor affect the utility or capacity of the airport. Mitigation Measures have been incorporated that require future improvement plans to be submitted to the Federal Aviation Administration to ensure that the proposed heights are not a hazard to air navigation, thus, the Project will not pose any safety concerns. Given that the Project will not be a hazard to air navigation, it can also be inferred that hazards for those on the ground would be less than significant.
Finding #4 - The Project will not adversely impact the ability to proteet the public health, safety and welfare and incorporates land and safety hazards within the areas around the
public airports to the extent that these areas are not already devoted to incompatible uses.

The proposed Project is not proposing any significant land use changes but rather a
modest increase in single-family homes and elimination or high density residential,
which will reduce the overall population for the Project.
The Project has now been revised to eliminate both the high-density housing and to construct 180 single-family homes. This is well below the minimum housing density originally contemplated. On population basis, the anticipated population would be approximately 512 people, a reduction from the population density previously contemplated. The proposed revised Project has both fewer numbers of units and therefore fewer persons which demonstrates consistency with the ALUCT.
The ALUCP policies for land use development focus on reduced density and intensity (number of persons per acre). The proposed Project, as revised, accomplishes both, therefore, the proposed development is found compatible with the ALUCP and surrounding residential land uses, and will not adversely impact public health, safety, or the general welfare.
The Project also incorporates conditions of approval to ensure that the public will not be exposed to excessive noise or safety hazards, and that the Project residents will be informed and duly noticed as to the presence of aircraft noise and avigation easements
already in place and/or structured. FAA height restrictions are also imposed to ensure that the Project will not be a hazard to air navigation. These mitigation measures ensure the protection of health, safety and general welfare.

The City Clerk shall certify the passage and adoption of this Resolution and enter it into the book
of original resolutions.

Resolution of The Colusa County Airport Land Use Commission Finding of Inconsistency for the CIP Residential Project Page 2 of 6

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that the Colusa County Airport Land Use Commission based on the information detailed in the Staff Report, exhibits presented, and all written and oral testimony does hereby find the following:

I. The County's Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan (ALUCP) required that the City of
Colusa (City) submit the 2016 Colusa Industrial Properties (CIP) residential entitlements, including Ordinance No. 513 and the development agreement for the CIP residential project and Tentative Map 16-14, to the County's Airport Land Use Commission
(ALUC) for a consistency determination with the ALUCP prior to taking final action.

A. Section 1.4.3(c) of the ALUCP states, "Revisions to Approved Development: Filing of a new version of any of the approval documents listed in Paragraph (a) of this policy means that the use no longer qualifies as an Existing Land Use and, therefore, is subject to ALUC review in accordance with the policies of Section 2".

B. Paragraph (a) of Section 1.4.3 of the ALUCP lists a tentative parcel, large lot or subdivision map and development agreement as approval documents which revisions
would trigger ALUC review of ALUCP consistency. Tentative Map 16-14 represented the filing of an amended subdivision map that was significantly different in terms of the number and types of residential units.

C. Section 2.2.2(e) of the ALUCP requires ALUC review of the consistency of development agreements. No previous City development agreement referral had been submitted to the ALUC for consistency review as part of the CIP entitlements.

D. Section 2.2.2(g) of the ALUCP requires ALUC review of the consistency of proposed residential development, including land divisions, consisting of 5 or more dwelling units or parcels. Tentative Map 16-14 contained 181 low-density, single-family
lots.

E. Section 2.6.4(b) of the ALUCP requires additional ALUC review of the consistency of a proposed residential development if the design of the project subsequently changes in a manner that affects previously considered compatibility issues and could raise questions as to the validity of the earlier finding of consistency, The 2008 County Board of Supervisors approval required that the number of low-density,
single-family lots be limited to 84 lots in order to mitigate potential aviation impacts and the 179 low-density, single-family lots of Tentative Map 16-14 significantly affected the Board's previously considered compatibility findings and raised significant questions as to the validity of the Board's carlier finding of consistency.

Il. The County's ALUCP required that the City submit the 2018 CIP residential entitlements, including Ordinance No. 527 and development agreement for the CIP residential project and Tentative Map 01-18 to the County's ALUC for a consistency determination with the ALUCP prior to taking final action.

A. Section 1.4.3(c) of the ALUCP states, "Revisions to Approved Development: Filing of a new version of any of the approval documents listed in Paragraph (a) of this policy means that the use no longer qualifies as an Existing Land Use and, therefore, is subject to ALUC review in accordance with the policies of Section 2".

B. Paragraph (a) of Section 1.4.3 of the ALUCP lists a tentative parcel, large lot or subdivision map and development agreement as approval documents which revisions would trigger ALUC review of ALUCP consistency. Tentative Map 01-18 represented the filing of an amended subdivision map that qualifies as a new version of an approval document (Tentative Map 16-14) and represented the filing of an amended subdivision map that was significantly different in terms of the number and types of residential units from the County's 2008 approval.

C. Section 2.2.2(e) of the ALUCP requires ALUC review of the consistency of development agreements or amendments to such agreements. No previous development agreement referral had ever been submitted to the ALUC for consistency review as part of the CIP entitlements and, thus, the 2018 development agreement is considered a new development agreement. In addition, the 2018 development agreement can also be considered an amendment to the 2016 development agreement.

D. Section 2.2.2(g) of the ALUCP requires ALUC review of the consistency of proposed residential developments, including land divisions, consisting of 5 or more dwelling units or parcels. Tentative Map 01-18 contained 180 low-density, single-family lots that the ALUC never reviewed.

E. Section 2.6.4(b) of the ALUCP requires additional ALUC review of the
consistency of a proposed residential development if the design of the project subsequently changes in a manner that affects previously considered compatibility issues and could raise questions as to the validity of the earlier finding of consistency. The 2008 County Board of Supervisors approval required that the number of low-density, single-family lots be limited to 84 lots in order to mitigate potential aviation impacts and the 180 low-density, single-family lots of Tentative Map 01-18 significantly affected the Board's previously considered compatibility findings and raised significant questions as to the validity of the Board's earlier finding of consistency.

III. The residential development of Tentative Map 01-18 is located in the ALUCP's Compatibility Zones B-1, C-1, and C-2 and the average and maximum densities of the residential development of Tentative Map 01-18 exceeds the average and maximum densities as detailed in Table 3A of the ALUCP and, as such, the residential development of Tentative Map 01-18 is inconsistent with the ALUCP.

A. Compatibility Zone B-1 specifies an average density of 1 dwelling unit per 20 acres and a maximum density of 4 dwelling units per acre. The lots located in
Compatibility Zone B-1 have an average density of I dwelling unit per 3 acres and a maximum density of 4.5 dwelling units per acre.

Resolution Of The Colusa County Airport Land Use Commission Finding of Inconsistency for the CIP Residential Projecs Page 4 of 6

B. Compatibility Zone C-1 specifies an average density of 1 dwelling unit per 10
acres and a maximum density of 4 dwelling units per acre. The lots located in Compatibility Zone C-1 have an average density of 1 dwelling unit per 0.5 acres and a maximum density of 5.2 dwelling units per acre.

C. Compatibility Zone C-2 specifies an average density of 1 dwelling unit per 5 acres and a maximum density of 4 dwelling units per acre. The lots located in Compatibility Zone C-2 have an average density of 1 dwelling unit per 1.1 acres and a maximum density of 5.5 dwelling units per acre.

IV. A number of the homes of Tentative Map 01-18 will have an interior noise level exceeding the ALUCP interior 45 dB Ldn noise standard and, as such, the residential
development of Tentative Map 01-18 is inconsistent with the ALUCP.

A, As shown on Attachment #11 of the ALUC staff report, portions of the residential
project are located above the 70 dB Ldn noise contour projected in the adopted 2008
Environmental Impact Report. In adopting the 2008 EIR, Mitigation Measures LU-la, LU-4a, N-4a, specifies that an acoustical professional must conduct an acoustical
investigation to identify the construction measures necessary in order to meet the interior noise standards of the ALUC and the County.

B. The ALUCP (Section 3.3.2 (a) and Table 3A), the County's General Plan (Policy N 1-2), and the City's General Plan (Policy N-1.1) all require that the interior noise level of residences be no higher than 45 dB Ldn. Typical residential construction provides approximately : 25 dB Ldn reduction in the interior noise levels and, thus, the homes that are located within the 70 dB Ldn noise contour would have interior noise levels
exceeding the ALUCP requirements (as well as the County's and City's General Plans) without additional noise mitigation.

C. County staff inquired as to the noise mitigation construction measures that had been included in the construction of the homes and was informed that an acoustical study had not been conducted and that the City had determined that the insulation and wall framing installed were adequate to mitigate the aircraft noise. Without the acoustical study required by the EIR, which the Board relied on in over-ruling the ALUC inconsistency finding, it is not possible to confirm with a reasonable high-degree of certainty that the interior noise levels of all of the homes will meet the 45 dB Ldn
standard.

IV. The Development Agreement between the residential developer and the City of Colusa obligates the City to allow the construction of the residential project as long as the developer meets their contractual obligations. Based on the findings of inconsistency with the ALUCP given the density and noise levels, said Development Agreement which

4 allows for the construction of the residential project would also be inconsistent with the
ALUCP.

1.0 INTRODUCTION

1.0 INTRODUCTION

This Draft Master Environmental Impact Report (MEIR) assesses the expected environmental impacts resulting from adoption of the proposed City of Colusa General Plan, along with the
impacts of three proposed development projects. The MEIR was prepared in accordance with the provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA - California Public Resources Code Section 21000 et seq.) and the CEQA Guidelines (14 California Code of Regulations Section 15000 et seq.). The City of Colusa is the Lead Agency for the environmental review of the proposed Colusa General Plan and the development projects evaluated herein, and it has it the principal responsibility for approving the project.

1.1 GENERAL PLAN BACKGROUND

Under California Government Code Section 65300 et seq., all cities and counties within the State of California are required to prepare a General Plan. The General Plan provides basic goals,
policies and programs to guide land development in the planning area of the jurisdiction, as well as a land use diagram designating future land uses. The City of Colusa has not updated its
General Plan since 1994 except for the Housing Element, an update of which was adopted in
2004. Changes that have occurred in the City since 1994, plus proposed commercial and residential development both within and outside of the City limits, have prompted the City to pursue a comprehensive update of its General Plan. Since the General Plan guides land development, it has potentially significant impacts on the environment. Therefore, a Draft MEIR will be prepared for the updated Colusa General Plan.
CEQA Guidelines Section 15050(a) states one public agency shall be responsible for preparation of an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for a project to be carried out or approved by more than one public agency. The public agency responsible for the EIR is designated the Lead Agency. As noted above, the City of Colusa is the Lead Agency for the environmental review required by CEQA. The other agencies with approving authority are designated under CEQA as Responsible Agencies. The decision-making body of each Responsible Agency shall consider
the Lead Agency's EIR prior to acting upon or approving the project [CEQA Guidelines Section 15050(b)]. For this project, the Responsible Agencies include:

County of Colusa
Colusa County Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCo)
Colusa County Airport Land Use Commission
Colusa Unified School District
State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB)
Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB), Central Valley Region
California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), District 3
California Department of Fish and Game
California Department of Water Resources
State Reclamation Board
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
The California Department of Fish and Game is also a "trustee agency", as defined in CEQA Guidelines Section 15386. A trustee agency is a State agency having jurisdiction by law over natural resources held in trust for the people of California that may be affected by a project. Resources that could be affected by the project include fish, wildlife and rare and endangered

1.0 INTRODUCTION

plants. Another trustee agency with resources that may be affected by the project is the California Department of Parks and Recreation, which manages the Colusa-Sacramento River State Recreation Area northwest of the City.

1.2 PURPOSE OF THE MEIR

The City of Colusa (City), acting as the Lead Agency, has prepared this Draft MEIR to provide the general public, responsible public agencies, and trustee agencies with information about the potential environmental effects of the proposed Colusa General Plan. As described in the CEQA Guidelines Section 15121(a), an EIR is a public informational document that assesses potential environmental effects of the proposed project, as well as identifies mitigation measures and alternatives to the proposed project that could reduce or avoid its adverse environmental impacts. Public agencies are charged with the duty to consider and minimize environmental impacts of proposed development where feasible, and an obligation to balance a variety of
public objectives, including economic, environmental and social factors.
CEQA requires the preparation of an environmental impact report prior to approving any project, which may have a significant effect on the environment. For the purposes of CEQA, the term "project" refers to the whole of an action, which has the potential for resulting in a direct physical change or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment (CEQA Guidelines Section 15378[a]). with respect to the City of Colusa General Plan, the City
has determined that the proposed General Plan is a "project" within the definition of CEQA.

1.3 REQUIREMENTS OF A MASTER ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT

This EIR has been prepared as a Master Environmental Impact Report. CEQA describes requirements related to a MEIR in California Public Resources Code Section 21157, while CEQA Guidelines Sections 15175 through 15179 describes these requirements in more detail. According to CEQA Guidelines Section 15175(a):

The Master EIR procedure is an alternative to preparing a project EIR, staged EIR, or program EIR for certain projects which will form the basis for later decision making. It is intended to streamline the later environmental review of projects or approval included within the project, plan or program analyzed in the Master EIR. Accordingly, a Master EIR shall, to the greatest extent feasible, evaluate the cumulative impacts, growth inducing impacts, and irreversible significant effects on the environment of subsequent projects.
Public Resources Code Section 21157(a)(1) and CEQA Guidelines Section 15175 (b) (1) states that a MEIR may be prepared for a General Plan. The master-level analysis considers the broad environmental effects of the proposed General Plan. This MEIR will be used to evaluate
subsequent projects and activities under the proposed General Plan. When individual projects or activities under the General Plan are proposed, the City would be required to examine the projects or activities to determine whether their effects were adequately analyzed in the MEIR (CEQA Guidelines Section 15177). If the projects or activities would have no effects beyond those analyzed in this MEIR, no further CEQA compliance would be required. If they have effects not analyzed in the MEIR, a subsequent CEQA document may be required, such as a
focused EIR or a mitigated negative declaration (CEQA Guidelines Section 15178). The MEIR
analysis also addresses the cumulative impacts of development under the proposed General Plan, and analyzes a reasonable range of alternative development scenarios.
The CEQA Guidelines Section 15176 states that the following shall be included in a MEIR (text in italics identifies where in this MEIR the information is located):

1.0-2

1.0 INTRODUCTION

1) A detailed discussion as required by CEQA Guidelines Section 15126. The discussion
must include the following subjects:

Significant environmental effects of the proposed project. Each technical section of this MEIR contains a discussion of potentiai impacts and their significance.

Significant environmental effects that cannot be avoided if the proposed project is implemented. Impacts considered "significant and unavoidable" are identified in each technical section of this MEIR where appropriate.
Significant irreversible environmental changes that would be involved in the proposed project should it be implemented. Section 8.0, Other Sections Required by CEQA, identifies significant irreversible environmental changes.
Growth-inducing impacts of the proposed project. Section 8.0, Other
Sections Required by CEQA, identifies growth-inducing impacts.
Mitigation measures proposed to minimize the significant effects. Each technical section of this MEIR provides mitigation measures for each significant environmental effect identified, where appropriate and feasible.
Alternatives to the proposed project. Section 7.0, Project Alternatives,
describes aiternatives to the proposed project evaluated in this MEIR.

2) A description of anticipated subsequent projects that are within the scope of the
MEIR, including information with regard to the kind, size, intensity, and location of the subsequent projects. This includes, but is not limited to, the following:
The specitic type of project anticipated to be undertaken such as a single- family development, office-commercial development, sewer line installation or other activities. Section 3.0, Project Description, identifies types of subsequent projects anticipated to be undertaken.

The maximum and minimum intensity of any anticipated subsequent project,
such as the number of residences in a residential development, and with
regard to a public works facility, its anticipated capacity and service area. Section 3.0, Project Description, describes anticipated subsequent projects.
The anticipated location for any subsequent development projects, and, consistent with the rule of reason set forth in Section 15126.6(f), alternative
locations for any such projects. Figure 3-3 illustrates the locations of three subsequent development projects: Colusa Riverbend, Colusa Crossings and Brookins Ranch. Given the characteristics of these projects and the project objectives as stated in Section 3.0, Project Description, alternative locations of
these projects are not feasible.

A capital outlay or capital improvement program, or other scheduling or implementing device that governs the submission and approval of subsequent projects, or an explanation as to why practical planning considerations render it impractical to identify any such program or scheduling or other device at the time of preparing the MEIR. Section 3.0

City of Colusa Colusa General Plan
July 2007 Draft Master Environmental Impact Report
1.0-3

1.0 INTRODUCTION

describes implementation of the proposed General Plan Update and the process for reviewing subsequent projects.

3) A description of potential impacts of anticipated projects for which there is not sufficient information reasonably available to support a full assessment of potential impacts in the MEIR. This description shall not be construed as a limitation on the impacts which may be considered in a focused EIR. Sections 5.1 through 5.3 identify potential impacts for which there is not information to fully asses.

4) Where a MEIR is a prepared in connection with a general plan update, the anticipated subsequent projects included within a MEIR may consist of later planning approvals, including parcel-specific approvals, consistent with the overall planning decision for which the MEIR has been prepared. Such subsequent projects shall be adequately described for purposes of CEQA Guidelines Section 15175(b) or of Section 15176 if the MEIR and any other documents embodying or relating to the overall planning decision identify the land use designations and the permissible densities and
intensities of use for the affected parcel(s). The proponents of such subsequent projects shall not be precluded from relying on the MEIR solely because that document did not specifically identify or list, by name, the subsequent project as ultimately proposed for approval. This requirements applies mainly to the three development projects mentioned in 2) above. Sections 5.1 through 5.3 describes anticipated subsequent projects in detail.
The MEIR must include a description of anticipated subsequent projects that are within the scope of the MEIR, including information with regard to the kind, size, intensity and location of the subsequent projects [CEQA Guidelines Section 15176(b)]. Anticipated subsequent projects include future actions taken by the City related to land use, as well as approvals by federal, state, regional and local agencies. In addition, this MEIR identifies three proposed development projects within the scope of the MEIR: Colusa Riverbend, Colusa Crossings and Brookins Ranch. Sections 5.0 through 5.3 describe the regulatory framework considered for subsequent projects,
provide a description of each of these projects, describe the potential environmental impacts of these projects, identify mitigation measures where appropriate and identify environmental impacts not addressed in this MEIR that will require future environmental review.

analysis of the effects of climate change.

The complete text of the NOP is contained in Appendix A of this document.
This MEIR evaluates the existing environmental resources in the vicinity of the City, analyzes potential impacts on those resources due to the proposed project, and identifies mitigation measures that could avoid or reduce the magnitude of those impacts. The MEIR provides a general review of the environmental effects of development of the City in accordance with the
proposed General Plan update, based on proposed land use designations and estimated
public service demands.

1.5 INTENDED USES OF THE MEIR

This Draft MEIR is intended to evaluate the environmental impacts of the updated City of Colusa
General Plan to the greatest extent possible. The MEIR will be used to evaluate the direct and indirect environmental effects of subsequent overail development under the General Plan (e.g., residential subdivisions, rezones, commercial structures, park sites, recreation facilities, infrastructure improvements). It also will be used to evaluate subsequent development projects under the updated General Plan, as mentioned in the preceding subsection. However, this MEIR
may also be used for subsequent projects not identified in this document. After a MEIR has been prepared and certified, subsequent projects that the City determines as being within the scope of the MEIR will be subject to a more focused environmental review. Neither a new environmental document nor the preparation of findings pursuant to CEQA Guidelines Section 15091 shall be required of a subsequent project when all the following requirements are met:

City of Colusa Colusa General Plan
July 2007 Draft Master Environmental Impact Report
1.0-7

1.0 INTRODUCTION

The lead agency for the subsequent project is the lead agency or any responsible agency identified in the MEIR.
The lead agency for the subsequent project prepares an initial study on the proposal. The initial study shall analyze whether the subsequent project was described in the MEIR and whether the subsequent project may cause any additional significant effect on the environment that was not previously examined in the MEIR.

The lead agency for the subsequent project determines, on the basis of written findings, that no additional significant environmental effect will result from the proposal, no new additional mitigation measures or alternatives may be required, and that the project is within the scope of the MEIR. "Additional significant environmental effect" means any
project-specitic effect that was not addressed as a significant effect in the MEIR.
If additional environmental effects are identified that were not examined in the MEIR, a project would require additional CEQA environmental review, pursuant to CEQA Guidelines Section 15178. However, the review would be limited only to those effects not examined in the MEIR.
Public Resources Code Section 21157.6 identifies time limits for the use of MEIRs and parameters
for the use of MEIRs in evaluation of subsequent projects. Exhibit 1-1 below depicts the process for review of subsequent projects.

"5 year time limit; adequacy of environmental review
(a) The master environmental impact report shall not be uses for the purposes of the chapter if
either of the following has occurred:
(1) The certification of the master environmental impact report occurred more than five years prior to the filing of an application for the subsequent project.
(2) The filing of an application for the subsequent project occurs following the certification of the master environmental impact report, and the approval of a project that was not described in the master environmental impact report, may affect the adequacy of the environmental review in the master environmental impact report for any subsequent project.

(b) A master environmental impact report that was certified more than five years prior to the
filing of an application forth subsequent project may be used for purposes of the chapter to review a subsequent project that was described in the master environmental report if the lead agency reviews the adequacy of the master environmental impact report and does either of the following;

(1) Finds that no substantial changes have occurred with respect to the circumstances under which the master environmental impact report was certified or that no new information, which was not known and could not have been known at the time that the master environmental impact report was certified as complete, has become available.
(2) Prepares an initial study and, pursuant to the findings of the initial study, does either of the following;

1.0 INTRODUCTION

1.6 ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW PROCESS

The review and certification process for the MEIR will involve the following general procedural
steps:

NOTICE OF PREPARATION

In accordance with Section 15082 of the CEQA Guidelines, the City issued a Notice of Preparation (NOP) of the Draft MEIR for the General Plan update on July 27, 2005. The purpose of the NOP was to solicit comments on the proposed environmental evaluation. This notice was circulated to the public; to local, state, and federal agencies; and to other interested parties. A
scoping meeting was held on August 17, 2005, to receive additional comments. The Draft MEIR considered concerns expressed during the NOP comment period. On April 5, 2007, the City reissued the NOP due to changes in the proposed General Plan which varied with the description of the General Plan in the original NOP. Appendix A contains the NOP.
DRAFT MEIR
This document constitutes the Draft MEIR. The Draft MEIR contains a description of the project, description of the environmental setting, identification of project impacts, and mitigation measures for impacts found to be significant, as well as an analysis of project alternatives. Also, as required by CEQA Guidelines Section 15176, the MEIR includes a description of anticipated subsequent projects that are within the MEIR scope. Upon completion of the Draft MEIR, the City will file a Notice of Completion (NOC) with the Governor's Office of Planning and Research to begin the public review period (Public Resources Code, Section 21161).

PUBLIC NOTICE/PUBLIC REVIEW

Concurrently with the NOC, the City will provide public notice of the availability of the Draft MEIR
for public review, and invite comment from the public, agencies, organizations, and other
interested parties. The public review and comment period should be no less than thirty (30) days or longer than ninety (90) days. The review period for this Draft MEIR will be forty-five (45) days, which is the minimum length of public review for an EIR that is submitted to the State Clearinghouse for State agency review. Comments on the Draft MEIR will be accepted both in written form and orally at public hearings. Although CEQA does not require public hearings to
accept comments on the Draft MEIR, the City expects to hold a public comment meeting
during the public review period prior to MEIR certification. Notice of the time and location of the
hearing would be published prior to the hearing date. All comments or questions regarding the Draft MEIR should be addressed to:

Eileen Shaw, City Planner
CITY OF COLUSA
425 Webster Street
Colusa, CA 95932

RESPONSE TO COMMENTS/FINAL MEIR

Following the public review period, a Final MEIR will be prepared. In accordance with CEQA Guidelines Section 15088, the Final MEIR will respond to written comments received during the public review period, and to oral comments made at any public hearing. If necessary, the Final MEIR also will include any revisions or additions to the Draft MEIR.

1.0 INTRODUCTION

CERTIFICATION OF THE MEIR/PROJECT CONSIDERATION

The City will review and consider the Final MEIR. If the City finds that the Final MEIR is "adequate
and complete", the City will certify the Final MEIR. Upon certification of the Final MEIR, the
Colusa City Council may take action to approve, revise, or reject the updated General Plan. A decision to approve the General Plan would be accompanied by written findings in accordance with CEQA Guidelines Section 15091 that address the significant impacts identified in the MEIR. These findings must be supported by substantial evidence in the record associated
with the MEIR. Possible findings include:
Changes or alterations have been required in, or incorporated into, the project which avoid or substantially lessen the significant environmental effect as identified in the Final
MEIR.

Such changes or alterations are within the responsibility and jurisdiction of another public
agency and not the agency making the finding. Such changes have been adopted by such other agency, or can and should be adopted by such other agency.

Specific economic, legal, social, technological or other considerations make infeasible the mitigation measures or project alternatives identified in the Final MEIR.
The City Council may adopt the updated General Plan even if the Final MEIR identifies significant environmental impacts that cannot be mitigated to a level that is less than significant. In that circumstance, the City Council must also adopt a Statement of Overriding Considerations, in
accordance with CEQA Guidelines Section 15093.

MITIGATION MONITORING

Public Resources Code Section 21081.6(a), part of CEQA, requires lead agencies to adopt a mitigation monitoring and reporting program that describe measures adopted or made a condition of project approval in order to reduce or avoid significant effects on the environment. The program will include mitigation measures from the MEIR, which clearly identifies these measures and presents them in language that will facilitate establishment of the program. The mitigation monitoring and reporting program need not be included in the MEIR - it can be a separate document. However, it will be presented to the City Council for adoption concurrently with the findings required by CEQA Guidelines Section 15091.

1.7 EFFECTS NOT FOUND TO BE SIGNIFICANT

Typically, an EIR evaluates project or program effects on environmentai issues listed in the Environmental Checklist Form, which is in Appendix G of the CEQA Guidelines. The NOP for the
MEIR identitied potential environmental issues that were generally consistent with those found in the Environmental Checklist. Based on preliminary evaluation associated with preparation of the NOP, the City determined that the proposed General Plan update would have potentially significant effects on all environmental issues mentioned in the Environmental Checklist, except for Mineral Resources. No mineral resources were identified within the proposed Planning Area by the City, Colusa County, or the State through its Mineral Resource Zone designation program. The proposed Planning Area contains no mining operations. Based on this information, the
proposed General Plan and identified subsequent projects would have no impact on mineral
resources.

2.0 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

2.0 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This section provides an overview of the proposed project and the associated environmental analysis. It has been prepared pursuant to the requirements set forth in CEQA Guidelines Section 15123, which describes the content requirements for the summary section of an EIR. For
additional detail regarding specific issues, please consult the appropriate section in Sections 4.1
through 6.0.

2.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE OF THE MEIR

This Draft MEIR will provide, to the greatest extent possible, an analysis of the potential environmental effects associated with the implementation of the City of Colusa General Plan,
pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The Draft MEIR will be used to evaluate the direct and indirect environmental effects of subsequent overall development under the General Plan. It also will be used to evaluate subsequent development projects under the updated General Plan, including three development projects of which this Draft MEIR
evaluates potential environmental effects.

2.2 PROJECT CHARACTERISTICS

California Government Code Section 65300 requires each city and county to adopt a general plan "for the physical development of the county or city, and any land outside its boundaries which bears relation to its planning." The City of Colusa General Plan expresses the community's development goals and embodies public policy relative to the distribution of future land uses, both public and private. The policies of the general plan are intended to underlie most land use decisions. Pursuant to State law, subdivisions, capital improvements, development agreements and many other land use actions must be consistent with the adopted general plan. In counties and general law cities, such as the City of Colusa, zoning and specific pians are also required to conform to the general plan.
Section 3.0, Project Description, contains a detailed description of the proposed City of Colusa General Plan update. The update would cover a proposed Planning Area that includes the existing City Limits and Sphere of Influence, as well as lands proposed for inclusion in the Sphere of Influence. The proposed Planning Area consists of approximately 3,805 acres (5.95 square miles). The comprehensive update proposes revisions to the following elements:

Land Use
Circulation
Safety Open Space and Conservation
Noise

The updated General Plan would include two new elements:
Community Character and Design
Municipal Facilities and Services

The Housing Element is not included in the comprehensive General Pian Update, as the City adopted an updated Housing Element in 2004. The proposed General Plan Update would combine the mandatory Open Space and Conservation Elements into one element, which
State law allows.

The General Plan Update includes a Land Use Diagram that assigns land use designations to all lands within the proposed Planning Area (see Figure 3-3). These designations will provide
City of Colusa
July 2007 Colusa General Plan Draft Master Environmental Impact Report
2.0-1

2.0 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

guidance for future development decisions by the City. New designations would include Urban Reserve, Office Professional/Light Industrial, and Mixed Use. The existing Residential designation would be split into Medium-Density Residential and High-Density Residential. The existing Open Space/Public Facility designation would be divided into separate Public Facility and Parks/Recreation/Open Space designations. The existing Rural Residential designation would become Estate Residential. The General Plan update contains goals and policies regarding land use within the proposed Planning Area, and implementing actions designed to carry out these goals and policies.

The Draft MEIR also will be used to evaluate the potential environmental impacts of three proposed development projects, which are within the proposed Planning Area of the updated General Plan. The proposed development projects are as follows:

Colusa Riverbend - a 442-acre residential project in eastern Colusa.

Colusa Crossings - a 320-acre residential/commercial project adjacent to and southwest
of Colusa.

Brookins Ranch - a 161-acre residential project adjacent to and south of Colusa.

2.3 AREAS OF CONTROVERSY

Pursuant to the CEQA Guidelines, the scope of this Draft MEIR includes specific issues and concerns identified as potentially significant physical effects on the environment. The scope was determined by City staff and from comments received in response to the Notice of Preparation (NOP) for the Draft MEIR. Based on these sources, this Draft MEIR addresses the following topics in depth:

Land Use and Agricultural Resources - potential conflicts with other land use plans and regulations, conversion of farmland.
Population and Housing - impacts related to population growth and additional housing units.

Transportation and Circulation - decrease in levels of service on streets and intersections,
including State highways; increased demand for transit services; increased need for
bicycle and pedestrian facilities.

Noise - placement of noise-generating uses in vicinity of noise-sensitive uses, placement of noise-sensitive uses near existing noise sources, noise generated by construction activities, exposure of noise-sensitive uses to noise from airport.

Air Quality - air pollutant emissions from construction activities, emissions from land use
activities and associated traffic, impacts related to climate change.
Geology and Soils - expansive soil hazards, hazards related to earthquakes, soil erosion.

Hazardous Materials transport, use and storage of hazardous materials; hazardous material contamination sites; hazards associated with asbestos, lead and PCBs.

Hydrology and Water Quality contamination of surface waters and groundwater, flooding hazards, availability of groundwater during dry years.

Colusa General Plan City of Colusa
Draft Master Environmental Impact Report July 2007
2.0-2

2.0 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Biological Resources - impacts on special-status plant and animal species, wetlands and
riparian habitat

Historic and Cultural Resources - previously unknown cultural or paleontological resources uncovered during construction, impacts on existing historic buildings and
neighborhoods.

Visual Resources/Light and Glare - loss or lack of trees in proposed Planning Area, obstruction of scenic vistas, and increased giare and night lighting.
Community Services increased demand for fire and police protection services. increased student population in schools, increased demand for park and recreation
facilities.

Public Services and Utilities increased demand for water and sewer services, increased need for storm water drainage facilities, increased generation of solid waste, increased demand for electricity and other energy.

Climate Change increased greenhouse gas emissions and analysis of the effects of
climate change.

Section 1.0, Introduction, provides a summary of comments regarding the proposed General Plan update during the NOP review period. Sections 5.1 through 5.3 evaluate the potential environmental impacts of the Colusa Riverbend, Colusa Crossings and Brookins Ranch development projects.

2.4 PROJECT ALTERNATIVES

CEQA Guidelines Section 15126.6 requires that an EIR describe a range of reasonable alternatives to the project, which could feasibly attain the basic objectives of the project and avoid and/or lessen the environmental effects of the project. The alternatives analysis provides a comparative analysis between the project and the selected alternatives. This Draft MEIR
evaluates the following land use alternatives:

• Aiternative 1 - No Update/No Development Projects (No Project Alternative). The adopted General Plan Land Use Map designations would remain in effect for locations
within the existing Sphere of Influence and development in the remainder of the
proposed Planning Area would occur in accordance with Colusa County General Plan
land use designations.
Alternative 2 - No Update/Development Projects. Alternative 2 is similar to Alternative 1 in that the proposed Colusa General Plan and its associated Land Use Policy Map would not be adopted. The adopted General Plan and its Land Use Map would guide future development within the City limits. However, under Alternative 2, the three specific projects (Colusa Riverbend, Colusa Crossings, Brookins Ranch) would be developed.
Alternative 3 - Increased Density of Development. Alternative 3 would have a similar buildout scenario to that under the proposed General Plan, in terms of population and number of dwelling units. However, this alternative would designate more acreage for
medium-density and high-density residential development. The result would accommodate the same anticipated population at buildout of the proposed General Plan, but on less land.

City of Colusa Colusa General Plan
July 2007 Draft Master Environmental Impact Report
2.0-3

2.0 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Alternative 4 - Revised Circulation. Alternative 4 would: 1) revise Implementing Action CIR-1.1.a to establish LOS D as the minimum acceptable LOS for City streets and intersections and 2) provide for an alternative circulation pattern that would include the development of an arterial street within the existing boundaries of the old railroad right- of-way located along the southern boundary of the City.
Alternatives considered but not selected are discussed in Section 7.0, Project Alternatives.
Based on an evaluation of potential environmental impacts, Alternative 1 was selected as the environmentally superior alternative. CEQA requires the selection of another environmentally superior alternative if a No Project alternative is considered environmentally superior. For this project, Alternative 2 is considered the environmentally superior alternative.

2.5 OTHER SECTIONS REQUIRED BY CEQA

Public Resources Code Sections 21100(b) (2) and 21100.1(a) require that EIRs prepared for the
adoption of plan, policy, or ordinance of a public agency must include a discussion of significant irreversible environmental changes of project implementation. Implementation of the proposed City of Colusa General Plan would result in the conversion of undeveloped open space and agricultural lands to residential, commercial, industrial, office, public and recreational uses. It is unlikely that circumstances would arise that would return the developed
land to its original undeveloped condition. Development of the City would irretrievably commit
building materials and energy to the construction and maintenance of buildings and
infrastructure proposed. In addition, implementation of development under the updated
General Plan would result in an increased demand for energy, and would generate greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change.
The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) requires that an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) contain an assessment of the cumulative impacts that could be associated with the
proposed project. According to CEQA Guidelines Section 15130(a), "an EIR shall discuss
cumulative impacts of a project when the project's incremental effect is cumulatively considerable." Sections 4.1 through 5.3 describe potential cumulative impacts of the updated General Plan and the proposed development projects, and Section 5.2 summarizes these impacts. Significant cumulative impacts would occur as a result of agricultural land conversion, air pollutant emissions, and loss of biological resources.

CEQA Guidelines Section 15126.2(b) requires an EIR to discuss unavoidable significant environmental effects, including those that can be mitigated but not reduced to a level of insignificance. Sections 4.1 to 5.3 describe potential significant and unavoidable impacts of the updated General Plan and the proposed development projects, and Section 5.3 summarizes these impacts. Significant and unavoidable impacts would result from agricultural land conversion and loss of scenic agricultural lands, population and housing growth, increased air pollutant emissions, decreased roadway and intersection levels of service, and loss of biological resource habitat.

CEQA Guidelines Section 15126.2(d) requires an EIR to discuss the growth-inducing impacts of a proposed project. Specifically, the EIR must discuss the ways in which the proposed project could foster economic or population growth or construction of additional housing, either directly
or indirectly, on the surrounding environment. Section 5.4 provides a description of potential growth-inducing impacts. The General Plan would indirectly induce growth through its designation of land uses, encouragement of population and job growth, and proposed infrastructure improvements.

Draft Master Environmental Impact Report July 2007
2.0-4

2.0 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Climate change has become an issue of concern in California. The State of California has initiated actions to reduce the state's contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. Under Executive Order S-3-05, California will reduce greenhouse gas emissions to year 2000 levels by 2010, to 1990 levels by 2020, and to 80% below 1990 levels by 2050. Assembly Bill (AB) 32 requires ARB to adopt regulations that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. Implementation of the proposed General Plan would result in an increased population and substantial new development, which would generate greater emissions of greenhouse gases. The primary source of these greater emissions would be increased vehicle traffic, with industrial operations and power plants making substantial contributions. Section 4.13 discusses climate change issues in detail, and recommends measures to mitigate the impacts of General Plan implementation on climate change.

2.6 SUMMARY OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS

Table 2-1 displays a summary of impacts for the proposed General Plan Update, City of Colusa General Plan policies and programs that would reduce or eliminate these potential impacts, and additional mitigation measures as necessary. In the table, the level of significance of each identified environmental impact both before and after the implementation of each mitigation measure is indicated. Level of significance before mitigation assumes proposed General Plan policies and implementing actions related to the impact have been applied. For detailed. discussions of these impacts and mitigation measures, refer to Sections 4.1 through 4.12 of this
MEIR.

Table 2-2 displays a summary of impacts associated with the proposed three development projects listed in Section 2.1. The table format is similar to that of Table 2-1. For detailed discussion of these impacts and mitigation measures, refer to the appropriate section of the
MEIR.

3.0 PROJECT DESCRIPTION

3.0 PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This section of the MEIR is the Project Description of the proposed City of Colusa General Plan Update (project or General Plan Update) and identifies with anticipated subsequent development projects. The purpose of the Project Description is to describe the project in a way that will be meaningful to the public, reviewing agencies and decision-makers. As described in Section 15124 of the State CEQA Guidelines, a complete project description must contain the following information but is not required to supply extensive detail beyond that needed for evaluation and review of the environmental impact:

The location and boundaries of the proposed project on a regional and detail map;
A statement of objectives sought by the proposed project;
A general description of the project's technical, economic and environmental characteristics; and,

A statement briefly describing the intended uses of the MEIR.

For a complete discussion of the CEQA requirements for a project description, please refer to State CEQA Guidelines Section 15124.

3.1 PROJECT LOCATION
The City of Colusa is a largely agricultural community located in the Sacramento Valley, approximately 75 miles north of Sacramento (Figure 3-1). Located along the Sacramento River, Colusa is approximately 24 miles west of Yuba City and ten miles east of Williams. Major roadways in Colusa include State Route (SR) 20 and SR 45. The proposed City of Colusa Planning Area includes the existing City Limits and Sphere of Influence, as well as lands proposed for inclusion in the Sphere of Influence in the General Plan Update. The proposed Sphere of Influence boundaries are coterminous with the boundaries of the proposed Planning Area (Figure 3-2). The proposed Planning Area consists of approximately 5.95 square miles (3,805
acres).

3.2 PROJECT SETTING

Incorporated as a general law city in 1868, the City is the County seat of Colusa County. Colusa operates under the council/manager form of government. It is a full-service City, providing police, fire, streets and drainage, water, sewer, garbage, parks, buildings and grounds, recreation and swimming pool, and general administrative services. According to the California Department of Finance, the estimated population of Colusa as of January 1, 2006 was 5,698.
The City of Colusa is a rural community with a relatively quiet character. The predominant natural feature in the proposed Planning Area is the Sacramento River, which forms the approximate northern boundary of the City. The City has tree-lined streets, as well as riparian woodland along the Sacramento River and scattered trees in undeveloped areas. Urban land uses in the proposed Planning Area generally consist of residential, commercial, office,
recreational and public uses within and adjacent to the City of Colusa. Non-urban land uses
consist of agriculture and open space.

Commercial activities are concentrated in the downtown area, which generally includes the area from Main Street to Jay Street between First and Tenth Streets. Another commercial center is located in the vicinity of the intersection of Bridge Street and Carson Street. Industrial activities are located in the western portion of the City and in the vicinity of Colusa County Airport outside

3.0 PROJECT DESCRIPTION

the City limits. The County's main medical facility, the Colusa Regional Medical Center, is located in Colusa.

The City has several parks, which provide open space, recreation, and social opportunities. The Colusa Sacramento River State Park is located along the Sacramento River just outside the northern City limits. The City also has two elementary schools, one middle school and one high school. City government buildings, including City Hall, the fire station and the police station, are located in the approximate center of the City.

Most of the land surrounding the City is agricultural, but some riparian vegetation is located along the Sacramento River. Please refer to Section 4.8, Biological Resources, for more information regarding natural features in the proposed Planning Area. Agricultural lands surrounding the City are primarily orchards and field crops. The Colusa National Wildlife Refuge is located southwest of the proposed Planning Area. Commercial buildings are located along SR 20 southwest of the City. South of the current City limits is the Walnut Ranch residential subdivision. Scattered residences are located throughout the unincorporated portion of the proposed Planning Area. Approximately three miles north of the City is the Colusa Casino Resort, a visitor attraction and a major source of employment and entertainment.
The existing City of Colusa General Plan, adopted in 1994, and the City's Zoning and Subdivision Ordinances currently guide land use development within the Colusa City limits. For lands within the proposed Planning Area but outside the City limits, development is regulated by the Colusa County General Plan and the County's zoning and subdivision codes. The reader is referred to Section 4.1, Land Use, for a description of land uses and applicable land use plans.

3.3 GENERAL PLAN BACKGROUND

GENERAL PLAN REQUIREMENTS

State law requires each city and county to adopt a general plan "for the physical development of the county or city, and any land outside its boundaries which bears relation to its planning" (California Government Code Section 65300). The California Supreme Court has called the general plan the "constitution for future development." The Colusa General Plan expresses the community's development goals and embodies public policy relative to the distribution of future land uses, both public and private. The general plan may be amended up to four times per year, and should be updated as necessary to reflect changes in community conditions and
goals.

Each general plan has seven mandatory elements: land use, circulation, housing, conservation, open space, noise and safety. All the mandatory elements have equal legal status, and all elements must be both internally consistent and consistent with the other elements. State law allows the combining of mandatory elements, as the local jurisdiction determines appropriate, to eliminate redundancies and to facilitate the required consistency between elements. A combined element must have all required contents of the individual elements that are
combined. A local jurisdiction may add optional elements that are not required under State
law. These optional elements, as part of the adopted general plan, have the same legai authority as the mandatory elements and must meet the same consistency requirements. The existing Colusa General Plan has six elements, as the Conservation and Open Space Elements were combined into one element, but includes all the required contents of the seven mandatory elements. The existing General Plan has no optional elements.

Colusa General Plan City of Colusa
Draft Master Environmental Impact Report July 2007
3.0-2

3.0 PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The policies of a general plan are intended to underlie most land use decisions. Pursuant to State
law, subdivisions, capital improvements, development agreements and many other land use
actions must be consistent with the adopted general plan. In counties and general law cities,
such as the City of Colusa, zoning and specific plans are also required to conform to the general plan. Implementation of general plan goals, policies and programs occurs through a variety of mechanisms, including but not limited to zoning ordinance, subdivision ordinance, building codes, specific plans, and funding programs such as the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program.

COLUSA GENERAL PLAN HISTORY

The most recent comprehensive revision to the Colusa General Plan occurred in 1994. All the mandatory elements were updated and adopted at that time except for the Housing Element, which had been adopted in 1993. In March 2004, Colusa adopted an update of the Housing Element component of its General Plan, in accordance with a schedule set forth in State law.
No other significant revisions have been made to the General Plan.

3.4 PROPOSED GENERAL PLAN UPDATE CHARACTERISTICS

GENERAL PLAN UPDATE PURPOSES AND OBJECTIVES

The proposed General Plan Update states its intent as serving as a policy guide for the physical and economic growth and environmental sustainability of the City of Colusa and the proposed Planning Area through the year 2025. It would be used to inform citizens, developers, agencies, interest groups and others of the ground rules that will guide development-related decisions in the community. The proposed General Plan Update would provide the long-term vision for the community and indicate how that vision would be achieved over time, through its goals, policies and implementing actions. The proposed General Plan has four fundamental purposes:
To enable the Planning Commission and the City Council to make informed land use decisions that affect the City's quality of life.
To inform the public of the City's policy approaches and to serve as a vehicle to invite public participation in the City's decision-making process.
To provide a basis for evaluating whether private and public development proposals and public programs are in harmony with Colusa's short-term objectives and long-term
vision.

To provide private developers and public agencies with clear expectations of new development proposals to ensure their consistency with Colusa's development priorities.

The objectives of the proposed General Plan Update are as follows:
Establish a compact and contiguous growth pattern that reinforces past development patterns and limits the encroachment of urban development on the agricuitural
economy and environmental resources outside the proposed sphere of influence.

• Provide long-range planning direction for large development projects-particularly for the following Special Planning Areas as described in the General Plan: SPA 2 (Brookins Ranch); SPA 3 (Colusa Crossings); and SPA 4 (Colusa Riverbend).

City of Colusa Colusa General Plan
July 2007 Draft Master Environmental Impact Report
3.0-3

3.0 PROJECT DESCRIPTION

Establish multiple connections, as part of all new development projects, to adjacent neighborhoods and within the project.
Ensure new developments use a street pattern, building and parking siting arrangement, scale and landscape character that builds on and extends Colusa's traditional street grid and character.

Ensure adequate public services, facilities and recreational opportunities will be provided
or are available before new development projects proceed.
Preclude new projects within the Urban Reserve area from "preempting" the market by developing prematurely at urban densities.
Provide commercial, office-professional, light industrial and industrial lands in sufficient acreages to allow for a balance of job and housing growth.
Respect environmental resources and characteristics that define the community such as the riverfront, drainage ways/swales, and views of the Sutter Buttes and Coast Range, which are significant and visible landmarks. Ensure new development will respect and preserve these features in a way that maintains their current function and visible characteristics.

Improve the quality of the built environment with every new building or development project.

PROPOSED GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS

The proposed General Plan Update contains the seven mandatory elements required by State law, as well as two optional elements: Community Character and Design, and Municipal Facilities and Services. One of the mandatory elements, Housing, was adopted in June 2004 by the City Council, and is not part of the comprehensive update. Nevertheless, the Housing Element must be consistent with the remaining elements of the proposed General Plan Update. The elements in the General Plan update and analyzed by the MEIR are briefly described below.

Land Use

The Land Use Element would include a variety of goals and policies regarding residential, commercial, industrial and public land uses. California Government Code Section 65302(a) requires that the General Plan include a land use element, which addresses:
"The proposed general distribution and general location and extent of the uses of the land for housing, business, industry, open space, including agriculture, natural resources, recreation, and enjoyment of scenic beauty, education, public buildings and grounds, solid and liquid waste disposal facilities, and other categories of public and private uses of land. The land use element shall include a statement of the standards of population density and building intensity recommended for the various districts and other territory covered by the plan..."
The goals of the Land Use Element in the proposed Generai Plan Update are as follows:
LU-1: To maintain well-defined boundaries at the edge of urban development.

Colusa General Plan City of Colusa
Draft Master Environmental Impact Report July 2007
3.0-4

3.0 PROJECT DESCRIPTION

LU-2: To ensure public health and safety by maintaining adequate buffers between agricultural land and urbanized areas.

LU-3: To maintain land as Urban Reserve for consideration for future development.
LU-4: To retain agricultural land uses beyond the City's urban growth boundary.
L.U-5: To ensure growth occurs in an orderly, compact and efficient manner, so that municipal services and infrastructure can be extended at the least possible cost.

LU-6: To provide a comprehensive, logical land use planning process rather than an
incremental, piecemeal approach.

LU-7: To create an economically vibrant Riverfront District that reflects the cultural and historical significance of the area.
LU-8: To provide a variety of high-quality residential developments and neighborhoods for all income groups.

LU-9: To encourage infill development that will achieve a more livable, sustainable
community.

LU-10: To promote an expanding and increasingly diversified local economy that will meet the employment needs of local residents and strengthen the local tax base.

The Land Use Element includes a proposed General Plan Land Use Diagram, a detailed land Use plan for the City of Colusa and its proposed Planning Area (Figure 3-3). This diagram assigns land use designations to all lands within the proposed Planning Area. Land use designations
under the proposed Land Use Diagram include:
Urban Reserve - rural land to be held for future development. Estate Residential - allows 1-3 housing units per acre. Low-Density Residential - allows 4-8 housing units per acre. Medium-Density Residential - allows 9-12 housing units per acre. High Density Residential - allows 13-20 housing units per acre.
Commercial/Professional
Office Professional/Light Industrial
Industrial
Parks/Recreation/Open Space Public Facility - e.g., City buildings, schools.
Mixed Use - designation allowing more than one type of land use in a specific area.
In many cases, designations in the proposed Land Use Diagram would differ from those in the current General Plan. Three of the proposed designations would be new: Urban Reserve, Office Professional/ Light Industrial, and Mixed Use. The existing Rural Residential would become Estate Residential. The existing Residential designation, which covers both medium-density and high- density housing, would be spiit into Medium-Density Residential and High-Density Residential. The existing Open Space/Public Facility designation would be divided into two separate designations: Public Facility and Parks/Recreation/Open Space. All other designations in the current General Plan would remain the same in the proposed General Plan.

In evaluating the environmental impacts of the proposed General Plan, assumptions were made concerning buildout of the proposed Planning Area, based on the proposed land use designation in the Land Use Diagram. Table 4.0-4 in Section 4.0 identifies projected buildout assumptions of residential and non-residential areas.

Community Character and Design
The Community Character and Design Element would be one of the two optional elements in the guidelines and standards for new development and redevelopment. Policies and implementing actions would address design of new residential and non-residential development, entryways and community landmarks, streets and streetscapes, mixed-use development, lighting and signage, rehabilitation and remodeling, and special districts such as
the Downtown and Riverfront area.

The goals of the Community Character and Design Element in the proposed General Plan Update are as follows:

CCD-1: To ensure the preservation and enhancement of Colusa's unique community character and vitality within its neighborhoods and business districts.

CCD-2: To ensure that new development respects the natural environment.

CCD-3: To create safe, attractive streets that serve to interconnect the entire community.

CCD-4: To retain and strengthen the role of the historic Downtown as the central focus of
community gatherings.

CCD-5: To capitalize on the Riverfront District's proximity to the Sacramento River to become a unique public gathering area appealing to residents and visitors alike.

CCD-16: To create attractive, well-designed office professional and light industrial centers as desirable places of employment.
CCD-17: To ensure that the distinctive qualities and character of a building and its environment are not destroyed.

Circulation

California Government Code Section 65302(b) requires that the General Plan include a
circulation element that describes plans and measures to provide for the City's transportation and circulation system as follows:

"The circulation element consists of the general location and extent of existing and proposed major thoroughfares, transportation routes, terminals, any military airports and ports, and other local public utilities and facilities, all correlated with the land use
element of the plan."

The Circulation Element would encourage building and maintaining a safe and efficient local street and highway system. It also would emphasize the use of alternate modes of transportation, such as public transit, bicycles and pedestrian travel. Policies and implementing actions would address needs in the overall transportation system and discuss methods by which
these needs would be met.

CIR-7: To improve access for the physically disabled throughout the community.
CIR-8: To ensure Colusa residents' continued access to a viable public airport.
CIR-9: To reestablish Colusa's waterfront as a regional destination for both recreational and commercial water transportation activities.

Safety

California Government Code Section 65302(g) requires that the General Plan include a safety element. A safety element is to protect the community from any unreasonable risks associated with the following:

"Effects of seismically induced surface rupture, ground shaking, ground failure, tsunami, seiche, and dam failure; slope instability leading to mudslides and landslides; subsidence, liquefaction and other seismic hazards identified pursuant to Chapter 7.8 (commencing with Section 2690) of the Public Resources Code, and other geologic hazards known to the legislative body; flooding; and wild land and urban fires. The safety element shall include mapping of known seismic and other geologic hazards. It shali also address evacuation routes, military installations, peak load water supply requirements, and minimum road widths and clearances around structures, as those items relate to identified fire and geologic hazards."
The Safety Element contains goals, policies and implementing programs designed to promote public safety in times of natural disasters, including earthquakes and floods. also considers hazards more manmade in character, such as fires, hazardous material incidents and airport safety. This element discusses emergency response services and plans. Services such as fire and
police protection are discussed in the proposed Municipal Facilities and Services Element.
The Goals of the Safety Element in the proposed General Plan Update are as follows:
SAF-1: To minimize injury and property damage due to seismic and geologic hazards.

Parks, Recreation and Resource Conservation
The proposed General Plan Update would combine two state-required elements-open space and conservation-into a single Parks, Recreation and Resource Conservation element. An optional parks component also is included in this element. California Government Code Section 65302(e) requires that the General Plan include an open space element that describes plans and measures for preserving open space for the following:

Natural resources;
Managed production of resources;
Outdoor recreation;
Protect public health and safety;
Support military uses, and Protect identified places, features, and objects.
California Government Code Section 65302(d) requires that the General Plan include a conservation element for the conservation, development, and utilization of natural resources. The parks, recreation and resource conservation element provides for:
"the conservation, development, and use of natural resources; details, plans and measures for the preservation of open space; and provides for outdoor recreation
facilities. The overall goal of the element is to preserve a comprehensive interconnected system of open space, encompassing preservation and enhancement of natural habitat areas, for the use and enjoyment of the community. The element also integrates related land use, transportation and circulation, transit, and energy issues.'
The Parks, Recreation and Resource Conservation Element focuses on goals that preserve, protect, and enhance an interconnected system of parks and open space areas, including sensitive local resource areas such as wetlands, agricultural lands, and lands adjacent to the
Sacramento River. Its policies would address natural habitat protection, park dedication and development standards, and recreational facilities. This element also would provide guidance for environmental issues such as air quality, water quality, soils and solid waste.
The goals of the Parks, Recreation and Resource Conservation Element in the proposed General Plan Update are as follows:

Noise

California Government Code Section 65302 (f) requires that the General Plan include a noise element to be used as a guide for establishing a pattern of land uses that minimizes the exposure of community residents to excessive noise. The noise element:

"shall identify and appraise noise problems in the community. The noise element will recognize the guidelines established by the Office of Noise Control in the State Department of Health Services and shall analyze and quantify, to the extent practicable, as determined by the legislative body, current and projected noise leveis for all of the following sources:

Highways and freeways.

Primary arterials and major local streets.
Passenger and freight on-line railroad operations and ground rapid transit systems.
Commercial, general aviation, heliport, helistop, and military airport operations, aircraft over flights, jet engine test stands, all other ground facilities and maintenance functions related to airport operation.

Colusa General Plan City of Colusa
Draft Master Environmental Impact Report July 2007
3.0-10

3.0 PROJECT DESCRIPTION

• Local industrial plants, including, but not limited to, railroad classification yards.
Other ground stationary noise sources, including, but not limited to, military installations, identified by local agencies as contributing to the community noise environment.
Noise contours shall be shown for all of these sources and stated in terms of community noise equivalent level (CNEL) or day-night average level (Ldn)."
The main intent of the Noise Element would be to protect noise-sensitive land uses from new noise-generating uses that would be incompatible with such sensitive receptors. Its policies and implementing actions would address issues of noise mitigation in project design, the use of noise barriers such as sound walls, and proper site planning that addresses noise issues, i.e., building orientation, setbacks, landscaping, and building construction practices.
The goals of the Noise Element in the proposed General Plan Update are as follows:

N-1: To protect noise-sensitive land uses from new noise-generating uses that would be
incompatible with such sensitive receptors.

N-2: To minimize noise generated by construction activities.

Municipal Facilities and Services
The Municipal Facilities and Services Element would be the other optional element in the City's General Plan. The element discusses civic and community facilities, including administration, public works, police, fire, and solid waste disposal; facilities provided by other public agencies, including library, schools, and airport facilities; services provided by the private sector, including electric, gas, and communication utilities; and water, wastewater, and stormwater drainage systems. Goals and policies emphasize the timing of facilities construction and services provision in relation to new development approvals and recognize the need for fair-share contribution from new development toward the provision of these facilities and services.
The goals of the Municipal Facilities and Services Element in the proposed General Plan Update are as follows:

MFS-1: To provide civic, community and maintenance facilities for both new development and existing residents and businesses at a level that will maintain and improve the standard of living for the entire community.
MFS-2: To provide and maintain acceptable police protection facilities.
MFS-3: To provide and maintain acceptable tire protection facilities for public safety.
MFS-4: To ensure the provision of library services and facilities to serve the community.

In addition to addressing the required elements, a General Plan must also have the following a functions:

Long-Range Scope: The General Plan must have a long-term perspective, establishing durable policies upon which daily decisions can be made for a period of many years. Although the Housing Element requires an update every five years, goals and objectives for other sections may consider community values or needs over a period of 15 to 20 years. The proposed General Plan would establish goals, policies, and implementation measures for a period from 2005-2025.

Geographical Comprehensiveness: The General Plan must consider all areas within the City Limits, as well as "any land outside its boundaries which in the planning agency's judgment bears relation to its planning" (California Government Code Section 65300). This area includes the City's Sphere of Influence and any adjacent lands that may be affected by implementation of the General Plan. Figure 3-3, the proposed Land Use Diagram, illustrates the Planning Area of the proposed General Pian.
Topical Comprehensiveness: The General Plan must cover a broad range of issues relevant to
the planning area. Land use designations in the City's proposed General Plan consider impacts
on environmental, social, and economic concerns.

Internal Consistency: Government Code Section 65300.5 requires that the General Plan be internally consistent through all of its elements. In other words, no policy conflicts may exist within the document. The requirement for internal consistency is reflected in five ways:
Equal status among elements: policies of one element are not legally superior to policies of any other element.
Consistency between elements: every element of the General Plan must be consistent with all other elements.

Consistency within elements: each element's analysis and goals, policies, and
implementation measures must be consistent and complementary.
Area plan consistency: all goals, policies, and implementation measures in an area plan must be consistent with the General Plan.

Text and diagram consistency: figures and tables must be consistent with the text
supporting them.
The City has drafted the proposed General Plan Update pursuant to the provisions of Government Code Section 65300.5 regarding internal consistency.

3.0 PROJECT DESCRIPTION

Special Planning Areas
The proposed General Plan would designate Special Planning Areas (SPAs) of the City (Figure 3- 4). SPAs are recognized as unique planning areas that will provide substantial new growth and redevelopment opportunities for the City. At the same time, these areas present challenges that would require a comprehensive planning approach in conjunction with the City's efforts 1o improve infrastructure and services citywide. It is the intent of this General Plan that these Special Planning Areas would be planned, annexed and ultimately developed through the Use of specific plans or planned developments, as specified in the Zoning Ordinance, which will be updated upon adoption of the proposed General Plan.
The Special Planning Areas identified in the proposed General Plan are as follows:
Colusa Rivertront District - Colusa's Riverfront District is bounded by the Sacramento River to the north, 13th Street to the west, Oak Street to the south, and Bridge Street to the east. This Special Planning Area is one portion of the City that would be given special attention with regard to architectural design, orientation, and land uses.
Brookins Ranch Estates - The Brookins Ranch Estates property consists of a 161.4- acre vacant site and is located on unincorporated land adjacent to the southwest of Colusa. It is bounded on the west by Will S. Green Avenue, on the north by Colusa High School, on the east by Tennant Estates subdivision, and on the south by the old railroad right-of- way. The City's intent for this planning area is that it be annexed to the it City with a land use designation of low-density residential. A description of the proposed Brookins Ranch development is provided later in this section.

Colusa Crossings (Vann Property) - This 310-acre site is located adjacent to the western boundary of the city. The site is bounded by State Route 20 to the east and south and by agricultural land to the west and north. The proposed General Plan identifies Colusa
Crossings as an area for a master-planned community that could offer a range of uses to serve the entire community. A description of development is provided later in this section. the proposed Colusa Crossings

Colusa Riverbend Specific Plan Area - The Colusa Riverbend Specific Plan encompasses a total of approximately 442 acres in the northeast and eastern portion of Colusa's proposed Planning Area/SOl. The aggregate of land is roughly bounded by the Sacramento River to the north and east, Highway 20/45 to the west and Moon Bend Road to the south. The City's intent for this planning area is that it be annexed to the City to be developed with low- and medium-density residential development. A description of the proposed Colusa Riverbend development is provided later in this section.
Colusa Industrial Park - Colusa Industrial Park, located adjacent to and south of Colusa's city limits, comprises approximately 137.5 acres of the 1,049-acre Colusa Industrial Properties (CIP) complex. The site is roughly bounded by State Route 20/45 to the east, Colusa Golf Club to the north, Wescott Road to the west, and CIP's agricultural lands to the south. Existing businesses and an agricultural service complex are located on the northern portion of the site, while approximately 127 acres are presently vacant. The City's intent for this planning area is that it be annexed to the City with a mix of land uses
including low-density residential on the western portion of the site; commercial professional along the SR 20/45 corridor; and Parks, Recreation and Open Space within the airport overflight zone.

City of Colusa Colusa General Plan
July 2007 Draft Master Environmental Impact Report
3.0-13

3.0 PROJECT DESCRIPTION

Airport Overflight Zone - Large areas of land within the City's Sphere of Influence lie within the boundaries of the Colusa County Airport Comprehensive Land Use Plan (CLUP). A portion of this land, including some of the Colusa Industrial Park site, is situated within the Airport Overflight Zone, as designated in the CLUP. This zone generally coincides with the area overflown by aircraft during normal traffic patterns procedures. Most of the proposed Planning Area within the airport overflight zone is designated on the proposed Land Use Diagram as Parks/Recreation/Open Space, but some is designated Low-Density Residential. Whether proposed for annexation or not, the City would review all project proposals within the CLUP Airport Overflight Zone to ensure compliance with the CLUP.

Infill Areas

The proposed General Plan Update would encourage infill development to create a more compact downtown center with a diverse mix of land uses, increase connectivity between neighborhoods and uses, and provide a greater range of community amenities. The City would promote infill projects on lands contiguous to existing development and infrastructure to prevent the premature conversion of agricultural lands to urban uses, and minimize the cost of infrastructure and services to non-infill developments. Infill development would continue on vacant land within the City limits, primarily to include parcels surrounded by existing development with available infrastructure. This would include parcels in the downtown core area, residential land along Wescott Road and parcels in the vicinity of the commercial center at the intersection of Bridge and Carson Streets. Infill development could include rehabilitation of existing structures, demolition and new construction. Redevelopment of aging residential complexes in areas designated for medium-to-high residential development would be acceptable in infill areas if the project results in the retention or increase of the number of rental units, consistent with the Housing Element.

3.5 ANTICIPATED SUBSEQUENT PROJECTS AND ACTIONS
Certification of a MEIR streamlines the analysis of subsequent projects that are within the scope of the MEIR. The mitigation measures identified in the MEIR, in conjunction with the policies and implementing actions of the Colusa General Pian, would be applied to those subsequent projects as conditions of approval. To be considered for streamlined environmental review, "anticipated subsequent projects" must be identified in the MEIR. There are three anticipated large development projects and 15 types of potential City actions considered subsequent projects within the scope of the MEIR, as defined in California Public Resources Code Section 21157.1. Unless otherwise described, the City of Colusa would be the Lead Agency for each of these subsequent projects. In addition, the MEIR may be used in the decision-making processes for approvals or permits by local, regional, State and federal agencies.
At such time as they are considered, these subsequent projects would be subject to the preparation of an Initial Study that will determine to what extent they are evaluated within the scope of the MEIR and whether a Mitigated Negative Declaration or some type of EIR must be prepared.

ANTICIPATED DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS

Should the Colusa City Council adopt the proposed General Plan Update, all subsequent activities and development within the City will be subject to its policies and programs. Some of the activities include residential developments that would be subject to tentative map approval. All commercial, office, and industrial uses would be subject to tentative map and/or

G

3.0 PROJECT DESCRIPTION

use permit approval. Other public activities, such as roadway and infrastructure improvements including drainage, sewer, and water, would need to be consistent with the policies set forth in the General Plan as adopted.

Within the proposed Planning Area, there are three major development projects currently anticipated for annexation and development upon adoption of the proposed General Plan Update; each of these developments is designated a SPA by the proposed General Plan Update (see Figure 3-4):
1) Colusa Riverbend - The Colusa Riverbend project proposes development of 442 acres in the northeastern and eastern portions of the proposed Planning Area. The City's intent for this area is that the entire area be annexed and be master-planned for LDR and MDR development of up to 2,530 units. 80 acres of the project site are within the existing City limits, but most of it is in unincorporated area. The Colusa Riverbend project proposes 372.5 acres for Low Density Residential and 29.5 acres for Medium Density Residential that would result in approximately 2,530 residential units. The project also proposes an elementary school site near the center of the site. Approximately 25 acres of the site would be dedicated to a system of parks and open space, with paseos connecting neighborhood parks to a larger community park and open space area. Section 5.1 of provides a more detailed description of the Colusa Riverbend project.
2) Colusa Crossings -Colusa Crossings is a 310-acre area anticipated for development outside the existing City limits, northwest of SR 20 and across from the Colusa County Fairgrounds. The General Plan Update intends for this area to be developed with a mix of land uses including LDR, MDR, HDR, CP, PF, and P/OS and allow up to 1,550 residential
units and Up to 402,930 square feet of commercial space. The Colusa Crossing project proposes up to 1,280 residential uses. Commercial/professional uses are proposed for 25 acres. The remaining acreage would be designated for an elementary school, parks and recreational facilities, and open space areas. Section 5.2 of the MEIR provides a more detailed description of the Colusa Crossings project.
3) Brookins Ranch - Brookins Ranch is a 161-acre area anticipated for development outside the existing City limits, south of Colusa High School and east of Will S. Green Avenue. The General Plan Update intends this area to be annexed to the City as LDR and developed with approximately 600 units. The Brookins Ranch project proposes primarily up to 600 units with the LDR designation, along with parks, other open space areas and a fire station. An existing single-family residence and auxiliary buildings would be retained in a separate parcel. Section 5.3 provides a more detailed description of the Brookins Ranch
project.

OTHER ANTICIPATED PROJECTS AND ACTIONS

City of Colusa
The City of Colusa General Plan Update will be presented to the City of Colusa Planning Commission for comment, review and recommendations. The City of Colusa City Council, as the City's legislative body, is the approving authority for the City of Colusa General Plan Update. As part of the General Plan's approval, the City Council would take the following actions:
• Certification of the City of Colusa General Plan MEIR.

City of Colusa Colusa General Plan July 2007 Draft Master Environmental Impact Report
3.0-15

3.0 PROJECT DESCRIPTION

Adoption of required findings for the above action, including required findings under CEQA Guidelines Sections 15090, 15091 and Section 15093,

Adoption of the City of Colusa General Plan Update.
Adoption of a Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program (MMRP).
This MEIR, after its certification, may be used for the following projects the City may undertake:
1) Sphere of Influence Amendment
The City's sphere of influence includes both incorporated and unincorporated areas that represent the probable service area of the City. It is established by the Colusa County Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCo) pursuant to California Government Code Section 56425. In determining the sphere of influence, LAFCo must consider the present
and planned land uses in the area, the present and probable need for public facilities and services in the area, the present capacity of public facilities and adequacy of public services the City provides or is authorized to provide, and the existence of any social or economic communities of interest. The proposed Planning Area covers an area larger than the City limits and its current sphere of influence. To annex lands currently outside its sphere of influence, the City must apply to LAFCo for amendments to its sphere of influence. Upon annexation to the City, development would occur as outlined in the adopted General Plan.

2) Annexation
Annexation is the inclusion, attachment or addition of territory to a city (Government Code Section 56017). Annexation to the City of Colusa brings the affected land under the land use regulations of the City, as well as into the City's service area. Annexation may be initiated by the City or by a petition of property owners, and must be approved by LAFCo in accordance with its policies and State law governing annexations. It is anticipated the City would pursue the eventual annexation of all the lands within the proposed Planning Areas currently not within the City limits. This course of action would involve making annexation requests to LAFCo.
3) Zoning

The Zoning Ordinance of the City of Colusa (Ordinance No. 403) regulates the uses of property within the City limits and the structures upon the property. It does sO by establishing zoning districts, each of which specifies allowed land uses. It also prescribes development standards for structures within each zoning district, such as minimum lot sizes and minimum yard requirements. Zoning is one of the regulatory mechanisms by which the City implements the policies of the General Plan. Government Code Section 65860 requires municipalities to maintain consistency between their Zoning Ordinance and their adopted General Plan. Adoption of the proposed General Plan would require amendments to the City's Zoning Ordinance to ensure consistency with the General Plan.

4) Specific Plans

A specific plan is a document that provides development guidance for a specified area in a jurisdiction. Specific plans must contain the distribution, location and extent of land

Colusa General Plan City of Colusa
Draft Master Environmental Impact Report July 2007
3.0-16

3.0 PROJECT DESCRIPTION

uses within the area covered by the plan, as well as of essential facilities needed to support the land uses. It also must contain standards and criteria by which development will proceed; standards for the conservation, development and utilization of natural
resources where applicable; and a program of implementation measures that include
regulations, public works projects, and financing measures (Government Code Section 65451). Pursuant to Government Code Section 65454, no specific plan may be adopted or amended unless the proposed plan or amendment is consistent with the General Plan. The City anticipates the preparation of a specific plan for the Colusa Riverbend development project site.
5) Subdivisions

The division of land for sale, lease or financing is governed by the Subdivision Map Act (Government Code Section 66410 et seq.), as administered by the City's subdivision regulations. The creation of four or fewer lots is a minor subdivision, requiring a parcel map. The creation of five or more lots is a major subdivision, which is generally subject to more intensive development standards. Subdivision regulations are another mechanism for implementing the General Plan. Subdivisions cannot be approved unless they are consistent with the adopted General Plan. The City anticipates receiving applications for subdivisions throughout the planning period of the proposed General Plan.
6) Planned Developments
A Planned Development (PD) may accomplish objectives similar to those of a specific plan within special planning areas. The purpose of a planned development is to allow diversification in the relationships of various residential building types, complementary structures (e.g., club houses, community facilities, etc.), and open spaces through flexibility in setbacks, height requirements, street standards, and density distribution, while ensuring substantial compliance with the city's General Plan and the provisions of the Colusa Municipal Code.
Planned Developments are intended for both large-scale residential developments and on smaller parcels, such as infil sites, where special characteristics of the site merit and would benefit from flexible zoning considerations.

7) Development Agreements
A development agreement is a contract between the City and a developer that establishes vested rights to develop property in a particular manner, under the land use rules and regulations in existence at the time the agreement is approved. Government Code Section 65865 et seq. establishes the rules for development agreements. Development agreements usually are valid from 10 to 20 years. A development agreement must be consistent with the General Plan. Development agreements may be considered in association with larger development projects.

8) Miscellaneous Land Use Permits

The City processes a variety of permits that facilitate development. Examples include, but are not limited to, the following:
Conditional Use Permits. These are discretionary permits through which the City considers whether or not to approve a particular use of land and what conditions to

City of Colusa Colusa General Plan
July 2007 Draft Master Environmental Impact Report
3.0-17

3.0 PROJECT DESCRIPTION

place on an approval. The range of conditional uses is established under the Zoning Ordinance, as well as the requirements for public notice and hearing. The City anticipates receiving applications for conditional use permits in the future.
Variances. A variance is a limited exception from the standards normally applicable under the Zoning Ordinance for which special circumstances exist such that the affected property does not enjoy the same benefits as nearby properties in the same zone. The Zoning Ordinance establishes the standards by which the validity of a variance request is judged, as well as the requirements for public notice and hearing. The City anticipates receiving variance requests during the General Plan planning period.

Building Permits. A building permit must be obtained from the. City before any construction may begin. The permit establishes that construction is taking place in accordance with adopted building codes. Building permits are issued routinely and require no public notice or hearing.

9) Airport Comprehensive Land Use Plan
The Colusa County Airport Land Use Commission is authorized under California Public Utilities Code Section 21670 to adopt comprehensive airport land use plans for general use airports in the county "that will provide for the orderly growth of each public airport and the area surrounding each public airport." The airport land use plan may establish height restrictions on buildings, specify compatible land uses, and determine building standards within the airport planning area. General plans must be consistent with any applicable airport land use plan. In 1995, the County Airport Land Use Commission adopted a Comprehensive Land Use Plan (CLUP) for the Colusa County Airport. The CLUP may be amended on occasion and may require related amendments to the General Plan if inconsistencies arise.

10) Capital Improvement Program
The Capital Improvement Program sets forth a program for the construction of public facilities, such as water and wastewater systems, streets, drainage systems, and fire and police stations. It includes a schedule for construction and a financing program to pay for facility improvements. Changes in the General Plan may require changes in the Capital Improvement Program so that planned improvements are consistent with the location and type of development allowed by the General Plan.
11) Wastewater Facilities Plan/Wastewater Master Plan

The City. has adopted a Wastewater Facilities Plan, which was amended in 2004. This plan identifies specific improvements to the wastewater treatment and collection system. The City anticipates that implementation of the proposed General Plan would
require expansion of the City's wastewater system. Therefore, the Wastewater Facilities Plan would need to be changed to incorporate additional improvements, as well as potential changes to the wastewater treatment and discharge processes to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements. The General Plan proposes preparation of a Wastewater Master Plan to provide a framework for identifying and funding improvements and expansion of the City's wastewater collection and treatment system.

Colusa General Plan City of Colusa
Draft Master Environmental Impact Report July 2007
3.0-18

3.0 PROJECT DESCRIPTION

12) Water Master Plan

The General Plan proposes the preparation of a Water Master Plan to provide a framework for the improvement and expansion of the City's water delivery system. The Water Master Plan would identify and establish funding sources beyond monthly service charges to finance improvements related to water quality, supply, recycling, distribution, conservation and other water issues. It would evaluate the potential capacity of the local aquifer to accommodate future growth of the City and make determinations on the need for additional water sources. The City currently has no Water Master Plan.

13) Streets and Roadways Master Plan
The General Plan proposes the preparation of a Streets and Roadways Masler Plan to provide a framework for the improvement and expansion of the City's street system. It would establish a minimum level of service standard for City streets and roadways. As part of the update process for this plan, the City would review its roadway functional classifications and update roadway design standards as required pursuant to Caltrans' Traffic Manual and Highway Design Manual. The Streets and Roadways Master Plan would be consistent with the land use patterns and densities/intensities specified in the General Plan. The City currently has no Streets and Roadways Master Plan.
14) Storm Drainage Master Plan
The General Plan proposes the preparation of a Storm Drainage Master Plan. This plan would identify drainage facilities for construction that would eliminate drainage problems in the City, and describe means to finance these improvements. The plan should be consistent with the City's Capital Improvements Program, and should address Regional Water Quality Control Board water quality standards. The City currently has no Storm Drainage Master Plan.

15) Parks and Recreation Master Plan

The General Plan proposes the preparation of a Parks and Recreation Master Plan. Components of the Parks Master Plan generally would include an assessment of parks and recreation needs, identification of park sites, and identification of general facility and siting standards. The Parks Master Pian would provide a framework in which the City and developers can work to provide park and recreation facilities. The City currently has no Parks and Recreation Master Plan.
16) Urban Water Management Plan
The Urban Water Management Act (1983 and as subsequently amended) requires urban water suppliers to prepare an Urban Water Management Plan. The contents of the plan generally include a description of existing and planned sources of water, an assessment of water supply reliability and vulnerability to shortages, a quantification of past and projected water use, a description of water demand management measures, and a description of all water supply projects and programs that may be undertaken to meet total projected water use. Urban water suppliers providing water for municipal purposes, either directly or indirectly, to more than 3,000 customers or supplying more than 3,000 acre-feet of water annually must prepare an Urban Water Management Plan. The City of Colusa, which is the main water supplier, currently does not meet the thresholds

City of Colusa Colusa General Plan July 2007 Draft Master Environmental Impact Report 3.0-19

3.0 PROJECT DESCRIPTION

requiring plan preparation. However, future growth under the proposed General Plan would likely add sufficient customers to place the City over the customer threshold.
Other Governmental Agency Approvals
This MEIR may be used by local, regional, State and federal agencies in their decision-making processes for approvals and permits related to implementation of the proposed General Plan. Additional subsequent approvals and permits that may be required include, but are not limited to, the following:
Colusa County approval of mutual aid agreements, memoranda of understanding regarding land use issues, and other matters involving unincorporated lands.

• Colusa County Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) approval of the proposed Sphere of influence and any subsequent annexations.

Colusa County Air Pollution Control District approval of dust control plans and other permits for subsequent projects.
Colusa County Transportation Commission approval of transportation improvement projects.

California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) approval of improvements and/or funding for future improvements on State Routes 20 and 45, and encroachment permits for any project work within the right-of-way of these roadways.
California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) approval of potential future streambed alteration agreements, pursuant to the Fish and Game Code, and approval of any take of wildlife and plant species listed under the California Endangered Species Act.
Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB), Central Valley Region approvals and permits for any activity impacting proposed Planning Area water features and water quality, pursuant to the Clean Water Act and RWQCB standards.
State Reclamation Board approvals and permits for projects that potentially impact flood control levees.

U.S Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) approval of wetland fill activities subject to the provisions of the federal Clean Water Act.

U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) permits for any take of wildlife and plant species and their habitats listed under the federal Endangered Species Act (ESA).
Cachil Dehe Band of Wintun approval of agreements supporting any proposed projects or programs involving the tribe, and consultation on projects potentially involving impacts on Native American cultural resources.

Colusa County Airport Land Use Commission approvals associated with consistency of projects with the Colusa County Airport Comprehensive Land Use Plan.

3.6 GENERAL PLAN UPDATE SCHEDULING AND IMPLEMENTATION DEVICES

CEQA Guidelines Section 15176(d), requires that an MEIR include a capital outlay or capital improvement program, or other scheduling or implementing device that governs the submission and approval of subsequent projects, or an explanation as to why practical planning considerations render it impractical to identify any such program or scheduling or other device at the time of preparing the Master EIR. Devices to process and implement the specific projects addressed in this MEIR along with how the City will ensure the provision of necessary infrastructure and facilities to serve these specific projects are described below.
PROCESSING AND IMPLEMENTATION FOR SPECIFIC PROJECTS
The General Plan Update anticipates the phasing of future development of the proposed Planning Area through the adoption of individual Specific Plans or Planned Developments. Each of the three specific projects addressed as part of the MEIR would be required to prepare a Specific Plan or Planned Development document and implementing device, as required by Implementing Actions LU-6.1a.
implementing Action LU-6.1.a: Specific Plans/Planned Developments All properties within Special Pianning Areas will carry a SP/PD designation and will require preparation of a specific plan or will be processed as a planned development. Properties within these designated areas must conform to all requirements of the specific pian or planned development. The City will ensure that specific plans and planned developments are consistent with the goals and policies of the General Plan, and with California Government Code §65451 (Specific Plans). Specific plans will incorporate development standards and Design Guidelines, a phasing plan for public facilities and services, and financing measures.

PROVISION OF NECESSARY INFRASTRUCTURE AND FACILITIES
A capital improvement program has not yet been prepared as it would be a subsequent plan to be prepared to implement the General Plan Update. Until the City Council has approved the General Plan Update and, more specifically, adopted the Land Use Map, it is premature to adopt or complete a capital improvement program to implement that proposed document. Rather, the General Plan Update sets forth the process under which capital improvements necessary to provide services and facilities for new development would be identified and funded.

Policy MFS-1.1 of the General Plan Update requires the City to ensure that new development does not exceed the capacity of the City to provide adequate municipal facilities and does not disproportionately impact the capacity of existing service levels and also indicates that new growth shall pay its fair-share cost of facilities and services without creating an additional burden
to existing residents. Funding and implementation of infrastructure necessary to serve development accommodated under the General Plan Update will be addressed through two primary mechanisms, the Capital Improvement Program (CIP) and the Development Impact Fee Program, and at the City-wide level, as set forth in Implementing Actions MFS-1.1a through MFS-1.1c.

Implementing Action MFS-1.1.a: Capital Improvement Program The City of Colusa will establish a Capital Improvement Program (CIP), which will guide the development of municipal facilities and infrastructure improvements over a five-year period. The program, which is to be updated on an annual or biannuai basis, schedules by fiscal year the proposed capital construction phases and related expenditure and financing needs expected to occur during the five-year
City of Colusa Colusa General Plan July 2007 Draft Master Environmental Impact Report 3.0-21

3.0 PROJECT DESCRIPTION

period. The Program will identify priorities, funding sources, and timing for design, construction, and operation, to be developed in conjunction with the City's budget.
Implementing Action MFS-1.1.b: Development Impact Fees The City will update its Development Impact Fee Program. As new development occurs, projects will be charged their fair-share of development impact fees to offset the cost of needed improvements to the City's municipal facilities. The City will review and update the development impact fee schedule on an annual basis.

Implementing Action MFS-1.1.c: Assembly Bill (AB) 1600 Analysis - In accordance with Government Code §66000 et seq., as amended, the City will conduct a thorough analysis of the City's development impact fee structure (commonly referred to as the AB 1600 Analysis) to ensure that fees are (1) adequate to fund capital projects and facilities, (2) based on expansion or provision of new facilities required by growth, and (3) meet all requirements of State law. The AB 1600 analysis will be initiated at the same time as the first Capital Improvement Program, and fees will be adjusted annually to keep up with inflation and construction costs. The project applicant will be responsible for the cost of this analysis. The City may require a particulor project to fund the master study, with reimbursement to be made for areas not affected by the particular project through credits against developer fees when building permits are issued. Until the AB 1600 city-wide master analysis is completed, the share of facilities costs and impacts on the community should be determined on a project-by-project basis.
In addition to scheduling and funding necessary infrastructure and facilities to serve development within the City through the CIP and Development Impact Fee Program, the City will prepare four master plans to identify capital improvements and funding necessary to provide water, wastewater, storm drainage services, and park facilities described under Implementing Actions LU-6.3e through LU-6.3g and PRC-2.2.g.
Implementing Action LU-6.3.e: Water Master Plan - The City will adopt and implement a Water Master Plan. Development projects will be evaluated for consistency with this plan. The pian will provide a framework for timed capital improvements and facility expansion projects and will aid the City in identifying and establishing funding sources beyond monthly service charges to finance improvements related to water quaity, supply, recycling, distribution, and water conservation. Municipal water is discussed in detail in the Municipal Facilities and Services Element.

Implementing Action LU-6.3.f: Wastewater Master Pian - The City will adopt and implement a Wastewater Master Plan. Development projects will be evaluated for consistency with this plan. The plan will provide the framework for timed capital improvements and facility expansion projects and will identify funding sources beyond monthly service charges to finance improvements related to expansion and upgrades to wastewater capacity, flow, treatment, and reclamation. The City will refer to this plan when constructing improvements and upgrades †o the Wastewater Treatment Plant as needed to accommodate existing customers and any approved development. Wastewater is discussed in detail in the Municipal Facilities and Services
Element.

implementing Action LU-6.3.g: Storm Drainage Master Plan - The City will adopt and implement a Storm Drainage Master Plan. Development projects will be evaluated for consistency with this plan. The pian will identify drainage facilities that will be constructed to eliminate drainage problems in the City and will describe the means for financing the improvements. The Storm Drainage Master Pian will address Regional Water Quality Control Board water quality standards,

including Best Management Practices for storm drainage management. Storm drainage is discussed in detail in the Municipal Facilities and Services Element.

Implementing Action PRC-2.2.a: Parks and Recreation Master Plan The City will adopt and implement a Parks and Recreation Master Plan prior to or concurrent with project approvals associated with large development projects. With this plan, park sites will be identified, and the City will work with developers to identify desired neighborhood park sites well in advance of subdivision development.

4.0 INTRODUCTION TO THE GENERAL PLAN ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS AND ASSUMPTIONS USED

The following is an introduction to the General Plan Update environmental analysis, cumulative analysis and general assumptions used in the environmental analysis. The reader is referred to the individual technical sections of the MDEIR regarding specific assumptions and methodology and significance criteria used in the analysis.

4.0.1 ANALYSIS ASSUMPTIONS GENERALLY USED TO EVALUATE THE IMPACTS OF THE PROPOSED
GENERAL PLAN UPDATE

BASELINE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS ASSUMED IN THE DRAFT MEIR

Section 15125(a) of the CEQA Guidelines requires that an EIR a include a description of the physical environmental conditions in the vicinity of a project, as they exist at the time the Notice of Preparation (NOP) is published and the environmental analysis is commenced. The CEQA Guidelines also specify that this description of the physical environmental conditions is to normally serve as the baseline physical conditions by which a lead agency determines whether impacts of a project are considered significant.
The environmental setting conditions of the proposed Planning Area will be described in detail in the technical sections of the Draft MEIR. In general, these setting discussions describe the setting conditions of the City of Colusa and the surrounding area as they existed when the NOP for the project was initially released on July 27, 2005 and environmental review began.
Table 4.0-1 presents the status of large-scale development projects in the proposed Planning Area and in nearby jurisdictions.

4.0 INTRODUCTION TO THE GENERAL PLAN ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS AND ASSUMPTIONS USED

Existing Development
Table 4.0-2 illustrates existing land use designations within the Colusa City limits as of 2006. As indicated in Table 4.0-2, residential uses are the predominant land use within the City, accounting for approximately haif of the total City acreage. According to the City's 2004 Housing Element, there were approximately 2,000 housing units within the City of Colusa. Approximately 79 percent were single-family homes and 21 percent were multi-family units and
mobile homes.

Existing General Plan Buildout Conditions

Buildout under the adopted 1994 General Plan, combined with land that has been annexed since 1994, could yield a total of 3,725 potential dwelling units and result in a buildout population of slightly less than 10,500 residents. If full buildout were to occur during the 20-year timeframe of the existing General Plan, this would represent an annual growth rate of approximately 3.5 percent, a figure considerably higher than the actual growth rate, which has averaged 0.95 percent since 1990. Buildout of the adopted General Plan would result in development as shown in Table 4.0-3.

Between 1997 and 2001, the City approved seven General Plan amendments (GPAs), resulting in the annexation and change in land use designations/zoning of approximately 88 acres. These annexations added the potential for construction of 282 housing units based on 4 units per acre after a 20 percent deduction for roadway infrastructure. These annexations also allowed for construction of 1.56 acres of general commercial development. The majority of housing units approved as part of the GPAs were in the low-density category - 84 acres at low density (approximately 336 single-family homes); and 2.2 acres at high density (estimated 30-40 apartment units), for a total of up to 376 dwelling units.

STRUCTURE OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ANALYSIS

Sections 4.1 through 4.12 of this MEIR contain a detailed description of current setting conditions (including applicable regulatory setting), an evaluation of the direct and indirect environmental
effects resulting from the implementation of the proposed project, identification of proposed project policies, actions items, and code sections that mitigate the environmental effect, additional feasible mitigation measures, and identification of whether significant environmental effects of the project would remain after application of proposed policies and action items, and feasible mitigation measures. The individual technical sections of the Draft EIR follow the
following format.

Existing Setting

This sub-section includes a description of the physical setting conditions associated with the technical area of discussion, consistent with State CEQA Guidelines Section 15125. As previously identified, the existing setting is based on conditions as they existed when the NOP for the
project was initially released on July 27, 2005 and environmental review commenced.

4.0 INTRODUCTION TO THE GENERAL PLAN ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS AND ASSUMPTIONS USED

Regulatory Framework

This sub-section consists of the identification of applicable federal, state, regional and local plans, policies, laws and regulations that apply to the technical area of discussion.

Consideration of Project Impacts

The proposed General Plan Update project would result in a variety of impacts associated with increasing the potential for development within the City of Colusa. Impacts resulting from the project are examined on a programmatic level relative to land use/agricuitural resources, population/housing/employment, geology/soils/human health/hazards, transportation/
circulation, noise, air quality, hydrology/water quality, biological/natural resources, cultural resources, community services, public services/utilities, and aesthetics/visual resources/light and glare. No development is directly proposed as part of this stage of the General Plan Update project. However, upon adoption of the project it is anticipated that future development requests will continue to be entertained by the City and that the City will consider the specific projects identified in Section 3.0, in conformance with the General Plan and implemented by the Development Code. Sections 5.0 through 5.3 address environmental impacts associated
with the specific subsequent projects. This EIR will be used to evaluate subsequent projects and activities under the proposed General Plan Update. Additional environmental review under CEQA may be required and would generally be based on the subsequent project's consistency with the General Plan Update and the analysis in this EIR, as required under CEQA.
Buildout Assumptions for the Proposed General Plan Update
Buildout assumptions for the General Plan Update are shown in Table 4.0-4 and provide the basis for the environmental analysis in this DMEIR. Based on historic and maximum residential development densities and consideration of development of net acreage in the City, it is anticipated that buildout of the proposed General Plan would result in approximately 9,386 housing units and a population of approximately 26,750 within the proposed Planning Area. It should be noted that these dwelling units and population estimates do not constitute a housing
unit or population cap for the proposed Planning Area.

The following assumptions were made for the discussion of future growth and formulation of
policy:

• The annual growth rate assumption used to anticipate when buildout will occur under
this General Plan is 6.45 percent.

Buildout of the General Plan is a based on a mid-range density and intensity for all land use
types.

26,750 will be accepted as the target buildout population for purposes of planning and analysis. 2025 is accepted as the end of this planning period or the "buildout" year.
Evaluating and establishing policies for managing growth beyond the 20-year horizon will be the task of future General Plan updates.
Minor adjustments to the SOI may occur during the timeframe of this General Plan, but they would not be expected to significantly alter land use designations within the planning area.

4.0 INTRODUCTION TO THE GENERAL PLAN ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS AND ASSUMPTIONS USED

The City's designation for land uses within the planning area but outside the City's SOI will be consistent with the Colusa County General Plan (e.g., designations for agriculture and related uses).
General Assumptions Utilized for Evaluating Construction, Phasing, and Operational Impacts from the Implementation of the General Plan

The environmental analysis in this DMEIR does consider environmental effects associated with construction and operation of land uses under the proposed General Plan Update. Current estimated rates of future development of the City are provided in Section 4.2, Population, Housing and Employment. The City currently does not operate under a growth control ordinance or other similar mechanism that restricts the rate of growth in a given year, and the proposed General Plan does not include such a program. It is anticipated that the rate of
development will be driven by market conditions.

4.0 INTRODUCTION TO THE GENERAL PLAN ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS AND ASSUMPTIONS USED

Impacts and Mitigation Measures

The Impacts and Mitigation Measures sub-section identifies direct and indirect environmental effects associated with implementation of the proposed project and identifies those proposed Project impacts based on the increase in development that would occur with implementation of the General Plan Update.
Standards of significance are identified and utilized to determine whether identified environmental effects are considered "significant" and require the application of mitigation measures. Each environmental impact analysis is identified numerically (e.g., Impact 4.1.1 Division of Established Communities) and is supported by substantial evidence included in the discussion. Proposed General Plan policies and implementing actions are identified that mitigate the environmental effect.

Mitigation measures for the proposed project were developed through a thorough review of the environmental effects of the project. After identification of proposed policies and action items that mitigate the environmental impact being discussed, any additional feasible mitigation measures that could minimize significant adverse impacts are discussed, after which, the impact discussion notes whether the impact has been mitigated to a less than significant level or remains significant and unavoidable.
The timing and implementation is specified for each mitigation measure identified in Sections 4.1 through 4.12 for the General Plan Update. The City of Colusa is the enforcement and monitoring agency for each of the identified mitigation measures.

APPROACH TO SPECIFIC PROJECT ANALYSIS

This MEIR includes analysis of three specific projects, as identified in Section 3.0, Project Description. These projects are designated Special Planning Areas by the General Plan Update and the General Plan Update envisions specific land uses for these areas, as described in Section 3.0, Project Description. As these projects are part of the development envisioned by the General Plan Update as a whole, these projects are included in the overall impact analysis provided in Sections 4.1 through 4.12. These projects would contribute to the cumulative impacts described in Section 6.0.

Project Description

A description of the development proposal for each specific development project is provided in Sections 5.1 through 5.3. Section 5.1 addresses Colusa Riverbend, Section 5.2 addresses Colusa
Crossings, and Section 5.3 addresses Brookins Ranch.

Relationship to the General Plan Update and MEIR
Section 5.0, Specific Projects, describes the relationship of the specific projects to the General Plan Update as a whole. If the City of Colusa determines that an anticipated subsequent project is within the scope of the MEIR, that project may be subject to limited environmental review, as described in Chapter 1.0, Introduction. Each subsequent project would be subject to an Initial Study. If the Initial Study finds that no new or additional mitigation measures or alternatives are required, the City would make a written finding that the is project is within the scope of the MEIR and no further environmental review would be required. If additional
mitigation measures or alternatives are required, the subsequent project may be required to prepare a Mitigated Negative Declaration or some type of EIR.

4.0 INTRODUCTION TO THE GENERAL PLAN ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS AND ASSUMPTIONS USED

Regulatory Framework

The Regulatory Framework for each environmental issue associated with the General Plan
Update is described in each technical section (Sections 4.1 through 4.12). In addition to the
agencies and regulations discussed in those sections, additional regulations would apply to these specitic development projects. This additional regulatory framework is described in Section 5.0, Specific Projects.
Project Impacts and Mitigation Measures

Areas of Insufficient Information

CEQA Guidelines Section 15176 discusses the required contents of a Master EIR. Section 15176(c) requires that a description of potential impacts of anticipated projects for which there is not sufficient information reasonably available to support a full assessment of potential impacts be disclosed in an MEIR. Due to the preliminary nature of aspects of the specific projects, areas of insufficient information do exist which would require further analysis to determine the potential for specific environmental impacts of the project. Potential impacts not addressed in the MEIR and associated areas of insufficient information for each project are specifically identified in
Sections 5.1 through 5.3.

Impacts and Mitigation Measures

Sections 5.1 through 5.3 describe oject impacts and mitigation measures for each of the specific projects, where adequate information is available to assess the impact and identify appropriate, feasible mitigation. Each impact discussion is presented in a format similar to the
related impact discussion in the relevant environmental issue section (Sections 4.1 through 4.12).
While impacts associated with the General Plan Update are addressed at a programmatic analysis and often are mitigated by applicable policies and implementation measures that require additional technical analysis and identification of appropriate mitigation measures during the development review process, impacts associated with each specific subsequent project are addressed at the project level. As a result, some impacts that are considered less than significant for the General Plan Update are now subject to the development review process as an individual development project and are considered potentially significant and require project-specific mitigation.

APPROACH TO THE CUMULATIVE IMPACT ANALYSIS

Definition of Cumulative Setting
CEQA Guidelines Section 15130 requires that EIRs include an analysis of the cumulative impacts of a project when the project's effect is considered cumulatively considerable. In general, the cumulative setting conditions considered in this MEIR are based on the existing land use plans in Colusa County, as well as consideration of the anticipated subsequent projects described in Section 3.0, Project Description. For this MEIR, the anticipated subsequent projects include the General Plan Update and the three proposed development projects described in Section 3.5. However, for particular environmental issues, the cumulative impact setting may expand beyond the proposed Planning Area. For example, the cumulative impact setting for groundwater includes the Colusa Subbasin, which extends over three counties (refer to Chapter 4.7, Hydrology and Water Quality).

Colusa General Plan City of Colusa
Draft Master Environmental Impact Report July 2007
4.0-8

4.0 INTRODUCTION TO THE GENERAL PLAN ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS AND ASSUMPTIONS USED

Consideration of Cumulative Impacts
Section 6.0, Cumulative Impacts, describes cumulative impacts for each environmental issue area. This section includes a description of the cumulative setting in which the cumulative impacts of the General Plan Update are evaluated for each environmental issue area. This is
based on the characteristics of the environmental issue under consideration, as set forth in Section 15130(b) of the CEQA Guidelines. For instance, the setting for discussion of cumulative air quality impacts would include the air basin within which the City of Colusa is located, while cumulative noise impacts would generally be confined to the proposed Planning Area.
The analysis for each environmental issue area considers whether the effect of General Plan Update implementation on an environmental issue is cumulatively considerable (i.e., a significant effect). Each technical section in the DMEIR considers whether the project's effect on anticipated cumulative setting conditions is cumulatively considerable (i.e., a significant effect). "Cumulatively considerable" means that the incremental effects of an individual project are significant when viewed in connection with the effects of past projects, the effects of other current projects, and the effects of probable future projects (CEQA Guidelines, Section 15065(a)(3)). The determination of whether the project's impact on cumulative conditions is considerable is based on a number of factors including: consideration of applicable public agency standards, consultation with public agencies and expert opinion. Section 6.0 (Cumulative Impacts) discusses the cumulative impacts associated with the General Plan
Update.
Cumulative impacts are based on the project's contribution to development at buildout (see Table 4.0-4) compared with the baseline conditions (see Table 4.0-2).
Project Contribution to Cumulative Impacts
For the purposes of the environmental analysis, it is assumed that the proposed General Plan Update would result in the build out of the proposed Planning Area (see Table 4.0-4) compared to existing baseline conditions which include the existing City of Jackson General Plan and
surrounding areas. The analysis considers the project's contribution to cumulative impacts under
cumulative conditions.

4.0.2 TERMINOLOGY USED IN THE DRAFT EIR

This MDEIR uses the following terminology to describe environmental effects of the proposed project:

Less Than Significant Impact: A less than significant impact would cause no substantial change in the physical condition of the environment (no mitigation would be required for project effects found to be less than significant).
Potentially Significant and Significant Impact: A significant impact would, unless mitigated, cause (or would potentially cause) a substantial adverse change in the physical conditions of the environment. Significant impacts are identified by the evaluation of project effects using specified standards of significance provided in each technical section of the EIR. Identified
"significant" impacts are those where the project would result in an impact that can be measured or quantified, while identified "potentially significant" impacts are those impacts
where an exact measurement of the project's effect cannot be made but substantial evidence
indicates that the impact would exceed standards of significance.

City of Colusa Colusa General Plan
July 2007 Draft Master Environmental Impact Report
4.0-9

4.0 INTRODUCTION TO THE GENERAL PLAN ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS AND ASSUMPTIONS USED

A potentially significant impact may also be an impact that may or may not occur and where a definite determination cannot be foreseen. Mitigation measures and/or project alternatives are identified to avoid or reduce to a less than significant level project effects to the environment.

Significant and Unavoidable Impact: A significant and unavoidable impact would result in a substantial change in the environment that cannot be avoided or mitigated to a less than significant level if the project is implemented.
Cumulatively Considerable: A cumulative significant impact would result when the project would contribute considerably to a significant physical impact on the environment expected under cumulative conditions.

Standards of Signiticance: A set of significance criteria used by the CEQA lead agency (City of Colusa) as well as by other public agencies with regulatory jurisdiction over the project to determine at what level or "threshold" an impact would be considered significant. Significance criteria used in this EIR include the State CEQA Guidelines; factual or scientitic information;
regulatory performance standards of local, State, and Federal agencies; and, City goals, objectives, and policies (e.g., City of Colusa General Plan). Specified significance criteria are identified at the beginning of the impact analyses of each technical section of the EIR.

4.1 LAND USE

4.1 LAND USE AND AGRICULTURAL RESOURCES

This section describes the existing land uses in the proposed Planning Area, characterizes surrounding land uses, and discusses adopted plans and policies pertinent to the area. It also addresses agricultural
lands and the potential impacts of the proposed
General Plan Update on these lands. Key issues
addressed in this section include conflicts with land
use plans/policies, incompatibilities between land
uses (including loss of community character and conflicts between urban and agricultural uses), loss
of agricultural land, and consistency with LAFCO
policies (including orderly development).

4.1.1. EXISTING SETTING

The proposed Planning Area is located entirely within Colusa County, which is located in the west central
portion of the Sacramento Valley in northern
California (see Figure 3-1 in Section 3.0, Project
Description). Glenn County is to the north, Yolo
County is to the south, Lake County is to the west, and Butte and Sutter Counties are to the east. Colusa County encompasses approximately 1,153 square miles of land. The Sacramento River forms the approximate eastern boundary of the County, while the Coast Range forms its western boundary.

The proposed Planning Area is located in the eastern portion of Colusa County (see Figure 3-3). It covers approximately 3,805 acres, or 5.95 square miles. Land use in this portion of the County is primarily residential and agricultural, with commercial and industrial activities concentrated
around the City of Colusa. The proposed Planning Area is adjacent to the Sacramento River, which forms much of its northern and eastern boundaries. The southern boundary generally follows a right-of-way for a former railroad line, and includes the Colusa County Airport. The
western boundary generally follows a straight line formed by Wilson Avenue and McCoy Road.

The Colusa National Wildlife Refuge is adjacent to and west of the Colusa Wastewater Treatment Plant site. It contains 4,626 acres of seasonal marshes, permanent ponds, and upland
habitats located approximately two miles west of Colusa. The refuge supports more than 200,000
ducks and 100,000 geese, along with several threatened or endangered species including the giant garter snake. An auto tour route and hiking trail accommodate more than 20,000 visitors annually. Waterfowl and pheasant hunting account for an additional 3,800 visits per year.

EXISTING LAND USES

The proposed Planning Area centers on the City of Colusa, which is the County seat of Colusa County. The City of Colusa was originally the site of a Native American village of the Wintun Indian tribe. Euroamerican settlers occupied the area in the mid-1800s, as the Gold Rush
stimulated settlement. Agriculture becar the significant local economic activity, with wheat and later rice being major crops. Section 4.9, Historic and Cultural Resources, describes the history of Colusa and the proposed Planning Area in more detail.
The City of Colusa is one of only two incorporated cities in Colusa County, the other is the City of
Williams to the west. The City of Colusa is approximately 1.83 square miles in area, and is the most populous community in the County. According to estimates from the California

indicates that major employment sectors are agriculture, retail trade, and educational, health and social services. Section 4.2, Population and Housing, discusses more fully the population and employment characteristics of Colusa residents.
Today, the City of Colusa has a wide range of land uses. The City has a mixture of residential land uses comprised of a number of distinct neighborhoods, including low-density residential development, as well as historic residential housing in the downtown area. Commercial development is an important economic factor for the City. Offices, parks, schools and industrial uses also exist in and near the City. The General Plan update proposes an expansion of the existing Planning Area by approximately 963 acres.
Land uses in the proposed Planning Area include:

Residential

Residential land uses comprise the largest developed uses in the existing Planning Area. Most residential land uses are located west of Bridge Street, south of Oak Street and east of 13th Street. Residential development that is more recent has occurred in the southern portion of the City south of Sioc Street.

Approximately 79 percent of all residential development in the City of Colusa is single-family residences. Approximately 18 percent of residential units are in multifamily developments from duplexes to apartment complexes and the remaining 3 percent consists of mobile homes. Residential development outside the unincorporated boundaries, but within the City's Sphere of Influence, is limited primarily to single-family rural residences. Walnut Ranch Estates, consisting of a 101-unit large-lot residential subdivision, is situated south of the City and borders the southern portion of the Tennant Estates projects. Much of the unincorporated land west of 13th Street and north of Lurline Avenue are also developed with small-, medium-, and large-lot single-family residences. Section 4.2, Population and Housing, provides a more detailed description of
residential housing in the existing Planning Area.

Commercial/Professional

Commercial/professional land uses in the existing Planning Area include retail stores, medical
and professional offices, service stations, automobile dealerships, restaurants, hotels and motels,
and other providers of goods and services. A concentration of these activities occurs in the
Downtown and the Riverfront districts, which are approximately bounded by the Sacramento River, 1st Street, Oak Street and 10th Street. Another commercial/professional area is along Bridge Street between Market Street and Wescott Road, which includes the Town and Country
shopping center.

Industrial

Industrial uses comprise the second largest share of designated acreage in the existing Planning Area. Most of this land is around the Colusa County Airport and in the southwestern portion of
Colusa near the high school and the fairgrounds. Much of this industrial land has yet to be
developed. A few industrial activities are located in northwestern and western Colusa. Activities include food processing, petroleum supply, and nonferrous rolling and drawing. Major employers of City residents in the area include the County of Colusa, City of Colusa, Colusa Casino Resort, Colusa Unified School District, Colusa Regional Medical Center, Colusa Industrial Properties, and Sunsweet Dryers.

4.1 LAND USE AND AGRICULTURAL RESOURCES

Mixed Use

"Mixed use" refers to a type of development in which different land use activities co-exist on one site. For example, a building could have retail stores and other commercial activities on its bottom floor and residential units on its upper floors. Also, a site development may contain residential units, office space and a retail center. In Colusa, mixed uses areas are mainly in the Downtown and Riverfront districts, where a mix of residential and commercial/professional uses exists.

Parks/Recreation/Open Space
Parks, recreation and open space uses constitute most of the Public Use designations. These uses include City of Colusa parks and recreation facilities. It also includes the Colusa
Sacramento River State Recreation Area, the Colusa County Fairgrounds, the golf course near
the Colusa County Airport, and the riparian area along the Sacramento River.

Public Facilities

Public facilities include government buildings, schools, cemeteries and other institutions supporting by public funding. In Colusa, these include the Colusa City Hall, the Colusa Community Hospital and various Colusa County government offices and facilities. They also include the Holy Cross Cemetery and all facilities of the Colusa Unified School District. Outside the City limits, the Colusa County Airport is the major public facility. Section 4.3, Transportation and Circulation, provides more information on the airport.
Agricultural Land

The City of Colusa is within a major agricultural region, and agriculture has a significant role in the City's economy and community identity. The proposed Planning Area contains lands currently in agricultural production. Most of the land proposed to be included in the expanded Planning Area is used for agriculture. This subsection describes existing agricultural land uses in the proposed Planning Area, including the identification of prime agricultural lands.

Economics of Agriculture

Agriculture has a key role in the economy of California, the Central Valley and the Sacramento Valley, According to a 2000
University of California study, agriculture accounts for 6.60 percent of total California income, 5.94 percent of the state's value added (sales minus cost of inputs), and 7.37 percent of jobs in California. In the
Sacramento Valley, where the City of Colusa
is located, agricultural impacts are more
significant: 8.17 percent of total income, 7.34 percent of value added, and 8.61 percent of the number of jobs.
According to The Measure of California Agriculture, published after 2003, a $1 billion increase in the value added results in a total of $1.9 billion of gross state product. Also, for every $1 billion increase in farm sales, there are 17,900 jobs created in California. Of these jobs created, 10,900

are in the farm sector, and the remaining 7,000 are in other industries. Since the Sacramento Valley is more dependent on agriculture than California as a whole, changes in agricultural production and sales would have greater economic impact. It also means that the
conversion of agricultural lands to other uses would a have a greater impact on the economy in the Sacramento Valley (including Colusa) than in California overall.
Existing Agricultural Operations
The proposed Planning Area contains lands with agricultural uses, including row crops, field crops, and orchards. Most of the agricultural lands are outside the City limits. Within the City limits of Colusa, agricultural lands are located in the eastern portion of the City, east of D Street
and north of Crommer Avenue. There are also small agricultural lands in the southern portion of
the City, along Wescott Road.
Of the 58 counties in California, Colusa County ranked 22nd in agricultural production in 2005. Gross revenues from the sales of agricultural commodities that year were approximately
$392,677,000, The leading farm commodities included rice, almond meats, processing tomatoes, cattle and calves, and English walnuts (Table 4.1-1). Colusa County leads all
California counties in the production of rice and vegetable/vinecrop seeds, and iS among the top five counties in the production of processing tomatoes (National Agricultural Statistics Service, 2006).

According to the 2002 Census of Agricuiture, conducted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Colusa County agricultural operations employed 3,684 workers. There were 8,480 total wage and salary employees in the County in 2002, according to the California Employment Development Department (EDD). Therefore, agriculture employment accounted for
approximately 43.4 percent of total employment in Colusa County in 2002. Approximately 39.4 percent of agricultural workers (1,451) were employed for 150 days or more.

Important Farmlands

The California Department of Conservation, as part of its Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Program, prepares Important Farmland Maps indicating the potential value of land for agricultural production. The Important Farmland Maps identify five agriculture-related
categories:

Prime Farmland. Prime farmland is land with the best combination of physical and chemical features able to sustain the long-term production of agricultural crops. These
lands have the soil quality, growing season, and moisture supply needed to produce

Draft Master Environmental Impact Report July 2007
4.1-4

4.1 LAND USE AND AGRICULTURAL RESOURCES

sustained high yields. Prime farmland must be used for production of irrigated crops at some time during the two updated cycles prior to the mapping date of 2002 (or since
1998).

Farmland of Statewide Importance. Farmland of statewide importance is land similar to
prime farmland, but with minor shortcomings, such as greater slopes or with less ability to hold and store moisture. The land must have been used for the production of irrigated crops at some time during the two update cycles prior to the mapping date of 2002 (or since 1998).
Unique Farmland. Unique farmland is land of lesser quality soils used for the production of
the State's leading agricultural crops. This land is usually irrigated, but may include non-
irrigated orchards or vineyards, as found in some climatic zones in California, The land must have been cultivated at some time during the two update cycles prior to the mapping date of 2002 (or since 1998).
Farmland of Local Importance. Farmland of local importance is land of importance to
the local agricultural economy, as determined by each County's Board of Supervisors
and a local advisory committee. Farmland of local importance in Colusa County includes lands which do not qualify as Prime, Statewide, or Unique farmland, but are currently irrigated crops or pasture or non-irrigated crops; lands that would meet the
Prime or Statewide designation and have been improved for irrigation, but are now idle; and lands that currently support confined livestock, poultry operations and aquaculture.
Grazing Land. Grazing land is land on which the existing vegetation, whether grown naturally or through management, is suited to the grazing of livestock. The minimum
mapping unit for this category is 40 acres.
The Important Farmland Map for Colusa County designates the majority of the proposed Planning Area outside existing urban development as "Prime Farmland". Figure 4.1-1 depicts Prime Farmland locations. Approximately 1,645 acres is classified as "Prime Farmland" within the Planning Area. There are also smaller areas of Farmland of Local Importance (270 acres), Grazing Land (130 acres), and Unique Farmland (27 acres) within the Planning Area, Approximately 1,550 acres of land within the Planning Area has the designation "Urban and Built-up Land," and therefore is not considered agricultural land. It should be noted that the first Important Farmland Map for Colusa County was prepared in 2002.
The urbanized core of Colusa is surrounded by Prime Farmland, as shown in Figure 4.1-1. Government Code Section 56064 broadly defines land as "prime agricultural land" if it meets any of the foliowing criteria:
a. Land, that if irrigated, qualifies for rating as class I or class II in the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service land use capability classification.
b. Land that qualifies for rating 8 through 100 Storie Index Rating

C. Land that supports livestock used for the production of food and fiver that has an annual carrying capacity equivalent to at least one animal unit per acre
d. Land planted with fruit or nut-bearing trees, vines, bushes, or crops that have a nonbearing period of less than five years and that will return not less than $400 per acre from the production of unprocessed agricultural plant production on an annual basis.

4.1 LAND USE AND AGRICULTURAL RESOURCES

Agriculture is the County's leading industry and accounts for most of the City's economic base as well. The crops grown in this area rice tomatoes, almonds, prunes, and wheat - account for a large part of Colusa County's total revenue each year.

Farmland Conversion

An issue of concern in California is the conversion of farmland, especially prime farmland, to non-agricultural land uses. The primary concern is the conversion of farmland to urban uses, such as residential development. Once farmland is used for urban development, it is essentially is lost as an agricultural resource. Farmland also may be converted for uses such as open space and habitat conservation.

One of the underlying premises of agricultural conversion is that the proximity of agricultural land to urban uses increases the market value of the agricultural land. This occurs either directly through formal purchase offers, or indirectly through recent sales in the vicinity. It also occurs through the extension of utilities and other urban infrastructure into productive agricultural areas. Higher land values often encourage farmers to sell their land to developers, particularly as some agricultural operations become less viable economically.

Table 4.1-2 shows changes in the acreages of Important Farmland in Colusa County from 1998 to 2004. As shown in the table, there has been an increase in the acreage of Farmland of
Statewide Importance. This increase is due mainly to the inclusion of land in the northwestern corner of Colusa County that previously had not been mapped, as well as incorporation of data from an updated soil survey. However, other categories of Important Farmland, as well as the total amount within the County, decreased from 1998 to 2004. This decrease equates to an average loss of approximately 639 acres of Important Farmlands annually, which includes land both in and out of production.

4.1.2 REGULATORY FRAMEWORK

STATE

Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Program
The Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Program (FMMP) was established in 1982 to continue the farmland mapping efforts begun in 1975 by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS, formerly the Soil Conservation Service). The intent of the NRCS was to produce agricultural resource maps based on soil quality and land use across the nation. As part of the nationwide agricultural land use mapping effort, the NRCS developed criteria that classified the suitability of land for agricultural production. Suitability included both the physical and chemical characteristics of soils and the actual land use.
Since 1980, the State of California has assisted the NRCS with completing its mapping in the state. The FMMP was created within the California Department of Conservation to carry on the
mapping activity on a continuing basis, and with a greater level of detail. California utilizes the NRCS and Storie Index Rating criteria, but also considers physical conditions such as a dependable water supply for agricultural production, soil temperature range, depth of the ground water table, flooding potential, rock fragment content, and rooting depth. Important Farmland Maps for California are compiled using the modified criteria and current land use
information.

Williamson Act
The California Land Conservation Act, also known as the Williamson Act, was adopted in 1965 to
encourage the preservation of the state's agricultural lands and prevent their premature conversion to urban uses. The Williamson Act established an agricultural preserve contract procedure by which any county or city taxes landowners based on the actual use of the land for agricultural purposes, as opposed to its unrestricted market value. This results in a lower property tax assessment. In return, the owners guarantee that these properties will remain under agricultural production for a ten-year period. The contract is renewed automatically on an annual basis, unless the owner files a notice a of non-renewal.
in 1998, the Williamson Act program was changed to include another option called a Farmland Security Zone. As with the regular Williamson Act program, the Farmland Security Zone employs agricultural preserve contract procedure. Under the Farmland Security Zone program, property is taxed at the lower of 65 percent of its Williamson Act valuation or its Proposition 13 valuation. In return, landowners agree to restrict their properties to agricultural or open space uses for a minimum of 20 years. As with the regular Williamson Act program, the contract is renewed
automatically on an annual basis unless a notice of non-renewal is filed.
Currently, approximately 70 percent of the state's prime agricultural land is protected under this Act. Colusa County has numerous properties under Williamson Act contract. No Wiliamson Act properties are located within the proposed Planning Area. Land south of and adjacent to the Colusa County Airport, outside the southeastern tip of the proposed Planning Area, is enrolled in the Williamson Act program; see Figure 4.1-2.

4.1 LAND USE AND AGRICULTURAL RESOURCES

LOCAL

Colusa General Plan
The adopted City of Colusa General Plan currently is used as the "blueprint" to guide future development within the City limits, and to a limited extent in unincorporated portions of the existing Planning Area. The overall purpose of the General Plan is to guide land development in the City of Colusa and the proposed General Plan Update would replace the existing policies and land use map in the City's adopted General Plan. Refer to Section 4.0, (Introduction to the Environmental Analysis and Assumptions Used), for a discussion of land use designations and buildout projections under the adopted General Plan. Specific proposed policies and implementing actions associated with land use and agricultural resources are discussed in the impact analyses below.
Housing Element
The adopted Housing Element would not be updated or revised as part of the proposed General Plan Update project. The Housing Element sets for policies and actions necessary to meet the housing needs of the existing and projected population of the City. The Housing Element identifies an allocation of 65 very low, 49 low, 55 moderate and 121 above moderate income units and indicates that there are adequate sites to accommodate these units. The proposed General Plan Update identifies 13 acres for high density uses that would accommodate an additional 172 units, which would provide adequate land for the 114 very low and low income units allocated to the City. The moderate units could be met by the remaining high density land or by the 118 acres allocated for medium density uses. Sites appropriate for above moderate uses would exceed the minimum amount necessary to meet the City's allocation of 121 units. The proposed General Plan Update would not interfere with the implementation of policies and implementing actions identified in the Housing Element. The proposed General Plan Update would enhance Housing Element goals for the provision of adequate housing by designating additional lands for residential uses. As required by State law, the General Plan must be internally consistent and the policies identified in the proposed General Plan Update are consistent with those in the Housing Element.
City Ordinances/Regulations
Under State law, City ordinances would be required to be updated and brought into would be brought into consistency with the proposed General Plan Update and no long-term inconsistency between the General Plan and City ordinances would occur. As part of the implementation of the Generali Plan Update, the City would subsequently update relevant ordinances, including the Zoning Ordinance, and would adopt a Grading and Erosion Controi Ordinance. The proposed General Plan Update does not remove or conflict with policies intended for environmental protection identified in the adopted General Plan. Rather, the proposed General Plan Update would build upon existing policies intended to provide environmental protection, as discussed in each environmental issue area in this MEIR.
City of Colusa Zoning Ordinance
The City of Colusa Zoning Ordinance implements the goals and policies of the City's General Plan. It establishes zoning districts that guide the development and use of land within the City by setting allowable land uses within each district. The Zoning Ordinance provides development standards such as land use limitations, building setbacks, height limits, and sign standards among others. By State law, the Zoning Ordinance must be consistent with the adopted General Plan.
City of Colusa Colusa General Plan
Draft Master Environmental Impact Report July 2007
4.1-8

4.1 LAND USE AND AGRICULTURAL RESOURCES

Therefore, should it adopt the proposed General Plan, the City would need to update its Zoning Ordinance accordingly.

Colusa County General Plan
Colusa County adopted its General Plan in 1989. It contains policies related to development of lands under County jurisdiction, which are all areas within Colusa County except for the cities of Colusa and Williams. The Plan includes a Community Plan for each of the eight communities within the County, including Colusa. The Colusa Community Plan describes land uses recommended for those unincorporated areas outside the Colusa city limits.
As shown on Figure 4.1-3, the Colusa County General Plan Land Use Plan for the Colusa Vicinity designates all land within and surrounding the Colusa City Limits and Primary Sphere of Influence. The land use designations for the Colusa area include Commercial (C), Industrial (I), Public/Semi-Public Services (P-S), Parks and Recreation (R-R), Urban Residential (UR), Rural Residential (RR), Agriculture-Transition (A-T), Agriculture-General (A-G), and Designated
Fioodway (D-F).
Colusa County Airport Comprehensive Land Use Plan
The Colusa County Airport is located along State Route 20/45, approximately 1.5 miles southeast
of the City of Colusa. The Colusa County Airport Land Use Commission adopted a Comprehensive Land Use Plan (CLUP) for the airport in 1995. The CLUP regulates land use in three major areas: safely zones, noise zones, and height restrictions. It provides land use compatibility guidelines for lands near the airport, to avert potential safety probiems and to ensure unhampered airport operations. The CLUP establishes three safety zones that are linked to land use compatibility: clear, approach/departure and overflight. The clear zone is near each end of the runway and is the most restrictive in The
approach/departure zone allowing land uses. is located under the takeoff and landing slopes, and is less restrictive. The overflight zone is the area under the airport's traffic pattern, and is even less restrictive (Colusa County ALUC, 1995). Figure 4.1-4 depicts the airport safety zones. Under California Government Code Section 65302.3(a), general plans must be consistent with any airport land use plan adopted pursuant to Public Utilities Code Section 21675. The Colusa County Airport Land Use Commission (ALUC) monitors compliance with CLUP provisions.
The CLUP provides guidelines for airport noise standards using Community Noise Equivalency Level (CNEL) based on the compatibility of the land use. The following is a summary of these ailowable noise standards within the described land use categories: residential uses are compatible between 0 to 55 CNEL, manufacturing and wholesale trade is allowable in is all CNEL areas, transportation, communications & utilities is allowable in all CNEL areas except some uses that exceed 80 to 85 CNEL, retail trade and business & personal services is allowed in areas up to 75 to 80 CNEL, public and quasi-public services are allowable up to 65-70 CNEL with the exception of child care and nursing facilities which are allowable up to 60-65 CNEL, recreation is allowable up 70 CNEL for most uses, agricultural and mining is aliowable in all CNEL areas except for intensive livestock and poultry operations that are allowable up to 75 CNEL. These allowable land uses in the ranges above the range of 60 to 70 CNEL are marked with the provision that measures must be taken to achieve an interior noise level of 50 CNEL where the public is received and where people work or congregate, and 45 CNEL for churches and areas intended for indoor entertainment events. the purpose of sleep, libraries,

The CLUP contains the following policie: and implementation measures regarding future land
uses:

4.1 LAND USE AND AGRICULTURAL RESOURCES

Implementation b: Upon adoption of this plan (the CLUP), existing incompatible land uses may continue; however, no incompatible land use may be changed to another incompatible land
use.

Implementation c: Upon completion of this pian (the CLUP), no incompatible land use, building, or structure may be expanded, except the following:
Single-family detached residences

Implementation e: Prior to the amendment of the general plan or specific plan, or the adoption or approval of a zoning ordinance or building regulation that would affect land that lies within the airport area of influence; the proposal must be submitted to the ALUC for review and determination of compatibility, Affected cities and counties are responsible for submitting the proposal to the ALUC.
Local Agency Formation Commission of Colusa County
In 1963, the State Legislature created a local agency formation commission (LAFCo) for each county, with the authority to regulate local agency boundary changes. Subsequently, the State has expanded the authority of a LAFCO, most recently with the Cortese-Knox-Hertzberg Local Government Reorganization Act of 2000. Among the goals of the LAFCo, in accordance with State law, are to preserve agricultural and open space land resources and to provide for efficient delivery of services.

The Colusa County LAFCo has authority over land use decisions in Colusa County affecting local agency boundaries. Its authority extends to the incorporated cities within the County. Specifically, LAFCo has the authority to review and approve or disapprove the following:
Annexations to or detachments from cities or districts,

Formation or dissolution of districts.

Incorporation or disincorporation of cities.

Consolidation or reorganization of cities or districts.

Establishment of subsidiary districts.

Development of, and amendments to, Spheres of Influence. The Sphere of Influence is the probable physical boundary and service area of each local government agency. This may extend beyond the current service area of the agency.
Extensions of service beyond an agency's jurisdictional boundaries.
Provision of new or different services by districts.
Proposals that extend service into previously unserved territory in unincorporated areas.
In addition, the Colusa County LAFCo can initiate and conduct a Municipal Service Review (MSR) for services within its jurisdiction. An MSR typically includes a review of existing municipal services provided by a local agency and its infrastructure needs and deficiencies. It also evaluates financing constraints and opportunities, management efficiencies, opportunities for rate restructuring and shared facilities, local accountability and governance, and other issues.

4.1.3. IMPACTS AND MITIGATION MEASURES

STANDARDS OF SIGNIFICANCE

Based on Appendix G of the CEQA Guidelines, land use and agricultural resource impacts are considered to be significant if the following could result from the implementation of the General
Plan update:
Physical division of an established community.
Conflict with any applicable land use plan, policy or regulation of an agency with jurisdiction over the project (including, but not limited to, the general plan, specific plan, or zoning ordinance) adopted for the purpose of avoiding or mitigating an environmental effect.

Conflict with any applicable habitat conservation plan or natural community
conservation plan.

Conversion of Prime Farmland, Unique Farmland, or Farmland of Statewide Importance, as shown on the maps prepared pursuant to the Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Program of the California Resources Agency, to non-agricultural use.

Conflict with existing zoning for agricultural use, or a Williamson Act contract.
in Changes in the existing environment which, due to their location or nature, could result in conversion of Farmiand to non-agricultural use.

METHODOLOGY

Evaluation of potential land use impacts within the City of Colusa by implementation of the
proposed General Plan Update was based on a review of planning documents pertaining to the
City of Colusa, including the proposed City of Colusa General Plan, City of Colusa Zoning
Ordinance, a field review of the City and surrounding areas, and consultation with appropriate agencies. Potential impacts to the proposed Planning Area outside the City limits were based on a review of planning documents relevant to those areas, including the Colusa County General Plan, the Comprehensive Land Use Plan for the Colusa County Airport, consultation with appropriate agencies, and field review. The analysis contained herein is based on buildout conditions for the proposed General Plan Update, as described in Section 4.0.
The agricultural analysis utilized information from various sources. These included the California Department of Conservation Farmiand Conversion Report 1998-2000, the California Department of Conservation important Farmland Map of Colusa County, the Soil Survey of Colusa County prepared by the NRCS in 2002, and the Summary of County Agricuitural Commissioners' Reports, 2003-2004 by the National Agricultural Statistics Service. Based on this information, the analysis assessed the potential value of agricultural lands in the proposed Planning Area, and utilized the proposed Land Use Diagram to determine potential impacts.
The focus of this land use analysis is on land use impacts that would result from the new General Plan policy document and land use map. Specific impacts and General Plan consistency issues

associated with biological resources, visual resources, noise, traffic, public services/utilities, hydrology, and/or geology are addressed in each technical section of this MEIR. The reader should refer to these other MEIR sections for detailed analysis of other relevant environmental effects resulting from development under the proposed General Plan Update.
IMPACTS AND MITIGATION MEASURES FOR THE GENERAL PLAN UPDATE

Division of Existing Communities

Impact 4.1.1 Implementation of the proposed General Plan Update would include new
development and redevelopment of existing urbanized areas in vacant portions of the proposed Planning Area potentially dividing existing communities. This is considered a less than signiticant impact.
Future development and associated public improvements allowed under the proposed City of Colusa General Plan would result in additional residential, commercial, industrial, mixed use and other development. The proposed General Plan Land Use Map, see Figure 3-3, identifies land uses that would be developed under the General Plan Update. These land uses are intended to be complementary to existing land uses, to the extent practicable. This development would result in the growth of the City of Colusa, but would not result in division of existing communities. The General Plan Update does not propose barriers that would divide existing communities, such as large roadway projects that would reduce access within a community.
The proposed Planning Area is characterized by primarily residential and agricultural, with commercial and industrial activities concentrated around the City of Colusa. Most of the residential land uses are located west of Bridge Street, south of Oak Street and east of 13lh Street. Residential development that is more recent has occurred in the southern portion of the
City south of Sioc Street. Agricultural lands are generally located outside the City core, proposed to be included in the expanded Planning Area. Commercial land uses are concentrated in the Downtown and Riverfront Districts, which are approximately bounded by the Sacramento River, 1st Street, Oak Street, and 10th Street, as well as a commercial center between Market Street and Wescott Road. Industrial uses are generally located in the southern portion of the City, as well as a few industrial activities located in northwestern and western Colusa. Much of the industrial land has yet to be developed. Vacant lands in and around the City present opportunities for new commercial and residential development. The Downtown and Riverfront districts provide redevelopment opportunities for a mix of uses.
There are 6 Special Planning Areas (SPAs) identified in the proposed General Plan Update. These Special Planning Areas are incorporated in order to plan for expected increase in demand for new residential opportunities, revitalization and redevelopment. These Planning Areas have been identified by the City as well as private landowners to ensure that development is consistent with the City's vision for the area.

Proposed improvements and land uses include new residential, mixed use and commercial land use designations, which will provide additional housing and employment opportunities that currently don't exist in the Planning Area. Residential and mixed use designations will provide additional housing and employment opportunities that create a more compact downtown center as well as increasing commercial vitality and creating affordable live-work housing opportunities. Therefore, implementation of the proposed General Plan Update would improve the viability of this area and would not divide the existing community. While some of the properties discussed above are infill and revitalization of exiting developed areas, a large portion of the areas proposed for development are rural residential, agricultural, or vacant.

Discussion about the impacts to the conversion of agricultural land to other uses is further discussed in Impact 4.1.4, Loss of Agricuitural Land. The development proposed for the Special Planning Areas in the proposed General Plan Update would allow for an extension of existing urban development and not substantially change the character of these communities. Additionally, the goals, policies, and objectives proposed under the proposed General Plan Update seek to enhance and improve these areas; therefore, would not result in the division of
existing communities and less than significant impacts would result.

Additional Mitigation Measures

None required.

Conflicts with Comprehensive Land Use Plan

Impact 4.1.2 Implementation of the proposed General Plan Update could lead to inconsistency with other land use plans, particularly the Comprehensive Land Use Plan for the Colusa County Airport. This is considered a potentially significant impact.

While City ordinances and regulations would be updated to be consistent with the General Plan
Udate, as discussed under Regulatory Framework, and thus would not conflict with the General Plan, the General Plan Update has the potential to conflict with the Comprehensive Land Use Plan (CLUP) for the Colusa County Airport. The CLUP defines compatible land uses for parcels near the airport. See Figure 4.1-3 for an overlay of the airports safety zones over the proposed General Pian land uses.

The Colusa County Airport CLUP allows very few land uses within the clear zone: open space and natural areas, row and field crops, and pasture and grazing. The Land Use Diagram for the proposed General Plan Update designates the area within the clear zone for parks/recreation/open space (P/OS) and industrial (IND) uses within the clear zone. The airport and existing industrial park are located within the industrial designation. While parks and recreation facilities attracting more than 10 persons per acre would not be compatible within
the clear zone, the parks/recreation/open space land use designation includes lands suitable
for a range of uses including park development, bike paths, greenbelts, nature preserves, and
other uses allowing indoor and outdoor recreation opportunities.

The approach/departure zone extends beyond the clear zone for approximately 2,000 feet. Within the approach/departure zone, the Land Use Diagram indicates parks/recreation/open space and industrial uses. As with the clear zone. parks and recreation facilities are compatible under restricted conditions. Riding stables and golf courses are permitted under certain conditions, as are particular industrial, commercial and utility land uses. An area north of the airport designated for commercial/professional uses by the proposed General Plan Update is within a portion of the approach/departure zone. The CLUP identifies a range of retail, manufacturing and services uses that are acceptable within the approach/departure zone.
The over flight zone covers an extensive portion of the southeastern area of the proposed Land Use Diagram. It includes the golf course and land to its east and west. The Land Use Diagram proposes low-density residential, industrial, parks/recreation/open space and commercial/professional land uses within the overflight zone. Industrial, parks/recreation/open space and commercial/professional designations all include a range of uses identified as compatible within the overflight zone. However, the CLUP states that single-family residential is a compatible land use only if the density is five acres or more per residence. The Low Density

4.1 LAND USE AND AGRICULTURAL RESOURCES

Residential designation of the proposed General Plan Update would allow from four to eight units per acre, exceeding the density identified as compatible by the CLUP. This incompatibility is a potentially significant impact.
Proposed General Plan Policies and Implementing Actions that Mitigate Potential Impacts

Land Use Element

Implementing Action LU-2.1.c: Interagency Coordination
The City's efforts to achieve managed growth that preserves agriculture at the edge of the City's urban growth boundary while allowing development to occur will require intergovernmental coordination. The City will work with State and local agencies, including LAFCO, Colusa County, the Airport Land Use Commission, Colusa Unified School District,
Caltrans, and other affected agencies, particularly during planning and development review of proposed development projects. As part of the General Plan adoption process, the City will inform affected agencies of the City's change in its planning area boundary (SOI), the newly adopted land use districts, and City policies regarding land use in proximity to agricultural areas.

Safety Element

Policy SAF-5.1 The City shall equire development projects within the overflight zone of the Colusa County Airport to consider all applicable safety policies, City standards, and land use compatibility guidelines.
Implementing Action SAF-5.1.a: Development review
The City will refer all development projects within the overflight zone of the Colusa County Airport to the Colusa County Airport Land Use Commission for its review and comment. As part of the development review process for projects within the overflight zone of the Airport, the City should apply airport/land use safety compatibility criteria to site design review TO ensure compatibility between the airport operations and proposed land uses.
Implementing Action SAF-5.1.b: Interagency coordination
The City shall work with the Colusa County Airport Land Use Commission to periodically assess and update the airport's Comprehensive Land Use Pian.
Implementing Action LU-2.1.c would require the City to coordinate with appropriate agencies regarding land use issues in areas currently not within City limits, but within the
City's proposed Planning Area. More explicitly, Policy SAF-5.1 and Implementing Actions SAF-5.1.a would require the City to consult with the Airport Land Use Commission on development projects within the overflight zone. As Policy SAF-5.1 requires development projects within the overflight zone of the Colusa County Airport to consider all applicable safety policies, City standards, and land use compatibility guidelines, it is anticipated that future development in the parks/recreation/open space, industrial, and commercial/professional designations within the clear, approach/departure, and overflight zones would be consistent with the airports land use and safety restrictions. All land use designations within these zones would support a range of uses that would be consistent with the CLUP.

4.1 LAND USE AND AGRICULTURAL RESOURCES

Additional Mitigation Measures

As stated previously, industrial, parks/recreation/open space and commercial/professional designations all include a range of a uses identified as compatible within the overflight zone. However, Low Density Residential is not compatible with the land uses identified in the CLUP. The proposed General Plan Update does not have a residential designation with a density of one unit per five or more acres and therefore all General Plan Update residential land uses would be
incompatible with the CLUP. The only mitigation measure would be to change the proposed land use to one that is compatible with the Colusa County Airport CLUP, such ais industrial, parks/recreation/open space and commercial/professional designations. However, such a
mitigation measure would be inconsistent with the project as proposed.
considered signiticant and unavoidable. This impact is

Incompatibilities between Land Uses

Impact 4.1.3 Implementation of the proposed General Plan Update could create conflicts between land uses within the proposed Planning Area and with land uses adjacent to the proposed Planning Area. This is considered a potentially significant impact.

One of the purposes of updating the General Plan is to is avoid the placement of land uses that would be incompatible with each other. For example, a manufacturing plant that emits odors
should not be placed next to a residential neighborhood. In Colusa, there are some areas where land uses considered incompatible currently exist. In the unincorporated area along 14th Street, residences exist alongside industrial uses. These residences were built before zoning was enacted prohibiting such land uses.
The proposed General Plan Update seeks to avoid the placement of incompatible land uses. The proposed Planning Area has few places where proposed designations could lead to such incompatibility. One potential example is near the Colusa County Airport, where low density
residential uses are proposed adjacent to industrial uses. Depending on the type of industrial
activity located around the airport, future residential development in that area couid face
potential noise, odor and traffic problems. These issues are addressed in the relevant sections of
this MEIR.

Under the proposed General Plan Update, urban development would be allowed to expand west, east and south of the current City limits. As more urban development occurs outside the existing City limits, individual projects may be placed adjacent to Williamson Act lands, lands designated for agricultural use, or agricultural operations, which could create conflicts between these land uses, both within the Planning Area and with agricultural uses adjacent to the Planning Area. Generally, residential Uses generate the most conflicts with agricultural operations. Agriculture/urban conflicts vary depending on the type of agricultural use, but
generally include, although are not limited to, the following:
Inconveniences or discomforts associated with dust, smoke, noise, and odor from agricultural operations.
Restrictions on agricultural operations (such as pesticide application) along interfaces
with urban uses.

Conflicts with farm equipment and vehicles using roadways.
Trespassing and vandalism on active farmlands.

4.1 LAND USE AND AGRICULTURAL RESOURCES

Increased pressure to convert adjacent agricultural land to urban uses as a result of above-mentioned conflicts and increases in property values.
Proposed General Plan Policies and Implementing Actions that Mitigate Potential Impacts

Land Use Element

Implementing Action LU-1.1.a: Land Use Map

The proposed Land Use Map is shown as Figure 2.3 (in the General Plan]. This map will serve as the basis for determining appropriate uses of land within the planning area.

Policy LU-2.1 Development projects shall be reviewed on a case-by case basis to ensure that adequate buffers are maintained between urban and agricultural lands, while giving developers flexibility in design at the urban edge.

Implementing Action LU-2.1.a: Development Review

Impacts of proposed new development will be evaluated with each proposai. Mitigation of significant impacts to the agricuiture/urban interface will be required as conditions of approval of site plans and subdivision maps.

Agricultural buffers will be determined on a case-by-case basis, depending on adjacent agricutturai uses. Potential mitigation measures may include disciosure to potential buyers of properties adjacent to agricuitural uses, agreements between developers and adjacent agricuttural landowners, agricultural easements, and/or land transfers.

Implementing Action LU-2.1.b: Development Agreements

As appropriate, the City will use the development agreement process established under State law and the Zoning Ordinance. This process provides for specific requirements of the developers of major projects to ensure compliance with the policies of this General Plan and provides for other benefits to the City in exchange for land use entitlement certainty for developers and property owners.
Implementing Action LU-2.1.c: Interagency Coordination
The City's efforts to achieve managed growth that preserves agriculture at the edge of the City's urban growth boundary while allowing development to occur will require intergovernmental coordination. The City will work with State and local agencies, including LAFCO, Colusa County, the Airport Land Use Commission, Colusa Unified School District, Caltrans, and other affected agencies, particularly during planning and development review of proposed development projects. As part of the General Pian adoption process, the City will inform affected agencies of the City's change in its planning area boundary (SOI), the newly adopted land use districts, and City policies regarding land use in proximity to agricuitural areas.

4.1 LAND USE AND AGRICULTURAL RESOURCES

Parks, Recreation and Resource Conservation Element

Policy PRC-8.1 The City shall require an evaluation of the potential for adverse impacts on agricultural production and economic value from exposure to urban
development for all new projects adjacent to rural lands. It is the intent of this policy to minimize the creation of conditions that will impair any present farm operations to a degree that threatens the long-term viability of the use of that land for continued agricultural purposes.
Implementing Action PRC-8.1.a: Development Review
Through the development review process, projects will be evaluated to ensure that impacts to existing farming or other agricuttural operations will not be adversely affected or restricted by adjacent urban uses. The City will require that developers of residential projects, which are within general proximity to agricultural operations in the County, provide notification to new
homeowners within their deeds, of the County's right-to-farm ordinance.

Implementing Action LU-1.1.a would implement the proposed Land Use Diagram, which seeks to avoid the placement of incompatible land uses. Implementing Action LU-2.1.b provides a process by which the City would review development applications for compatibility with adjacent land uses, and modify or reject applications if potential incompatibilities arise. Implementing Action LU-7.1.e would implement provisions of the General Plan that promote compatible land uses by encoding them in the appropriate ordinances and regulations. Policy PRC-8.1 would require the City to evaluate the impacts of a development project on agricultural operations, specifically projects adjacent to agricultural lands and to take measures to reduce conflicts with those lands. This would be implemented through the development review process described in Implementing Actions LU-2.1.b and PRC-8.1.a, including provision of a buffer between new development and agricultural uses and notification of the County's right-to-farm ordinance. While these policies and implementing actions would reduce pressure on adjoining lands to convert to non-agricultural uses, implementation of the proposed General Plan policies and implementing actions would minimize or avoid potential conflicts between land uses within the proposed Planning Area. Implementation of the above-identified General Plan policies and actions would ensure that impacts associated with land use incompatibilities would be less than significant.

Mitigation Measures

None required.

Habitat Conservation Plan Conflicts

Impact 4.1.4 The proposed General Plan does not conflict with any habitat conservation plan or natural community conservation plan in the area. This is considered to
have no impact.
There are currently no adopted habitat conservation plans or natural community conservation plans in the General Plan Planning Area. Biological resource issues associated with implementation of the proposed General Plan and habitats and special status species are addressed in Section 4.8 Biological Resources of this document.

The development proposed in association with the proposed General Plan will not have an impact on any habitat conservation plans or natural community conservation plans in the area.

4.1 LAND USE AND AGRICULTURAL RESOURCES

Mitigation Measures

None required.

Loss of Agricultural Land

Impact 4.1.5 Implementation of the proposed General Plan Update would result in the loss of Prime Farmland and Farmland of Local Importance, as designated under the Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Program. This is considered a
signiticant impact.

Future development and associated public improvements allowed under the proposed City of Colusa General Plan would result in the conversion of important farmland. According to the Colusa County Important Farmland Map (2002), the proposed Planning Area contains approximately 1,645 acres of Prime Farmland and 270 acres of Farmiand of Local Importance. The Planning Area also contains approximately 130 acres of Grazing Land and 27 acres of Unique Farmland. Prime Farmland is of particular importance, as this type of farmland requires the least amount of preparation to be a productive agricultural resource (e.g., requires less fertilizer). Most of this land is located east, south, and west of the City. The General Plan update would permit residential and other development in these areas. Once these agricultural lands are developed, they essentially are lost as an agricultural resource. Farmland of Local Importance is considered an important agricuitural resource at the local level. Development under the proposed General Plan Update would result in the loss of this farmland as well.
General Plan Planning Area - Areas outside of Existing City Boundaries
The majority of the Prime farmland and Farmland of Local Importance is located in the Planning Areas located to the east, south, and west outside of existing City limits. These areas are located within the Special Planning Areas (SPA) of Brookins Ranch Estates SPA 2, Colusa Crossings SPA 3 and Colusa Riverbend SPA 4. Proposed land uses within all three of these SPA include residential neighborhoods, mixed-use commercial, proposed school sites and a fire station, as well as parks and open space. Of the total 913 acres developed in these locations, approximately 92.5 to 112.5 acres will be parks, open space, greenways, and detention areas. None of the land uses proposed for these developments include areas reserved for agricultural lands.

Therefore, implementation of the General Plan Land Use Map would result in the conversion of an approximate total of 913 acres of Prime Farmland. Loss of this farmland is considered a
significant impact.
General Plan Planning Area - Areas within Existing City Boundaries
Within the City's current boundaries, there are pockets of Prime farmland and Farmland of Local Importance located within the proposed Colusa Riverbend SPA 4, along the north side of Clay Street east from Highway 20 to the Sacramento River. There is an area of Prime Farmland located west of Westcott Road in the southern-most portion of the City. There are some smaller pockets of Prime Farmland located in the City; one area is in the southwest corner of the City located south of Wilson Avenue, west of Baber Drive, and south of Sioc Street. Another small pocket is located south of Sioc Street, between 5th Street and 3rd Street. These areas have been
historically and are currently under passive or active agricultural production. The proposed General Plan Update does not propose any further development of areas within the majority of the City's boundaries. However, proposed land uses within the Colusa Riverbend SPA 4 include

(

4.1 LAND USE AND AGRICULTURAL RESOURCES

low and medium density residential uses in the area that is currently within City limits (the majority of SPA 4 is outside City limits, but within the Planning Area). Agricultural land is not anticipated to be included as a land use designation when the Planning Area land uses are finalized.
Agricultural land is not identified as a use in the proposed General Plan Update and implementation of the General Plan Update is therefore assumed to result in a loss of approximately 1,942 acres (1,645 acres of Prime Farmland, 270 acres of Farmland of Local
Importance, and 27 acres of Unique Farmland) as these lands will be designated for other uses. Therefore, implementation of the proposed General Plan Update would result in the conversion
of farmland and this impact is considered significant.
Proposed General Plan Policies and Implementing Actions that Mitigate Potential Impacts

Land Use Element

Implementing Action LU-2.1.a: Development Review (see Impact 4.1.3)

Policy LU-4.1 The City shall support efforts to preserve existing agricultural land uses in areas outside the City's sphere of influence.
Implementing Action LU-4.1.b: Public/Private Partnerships
The City will work with Colusa County, nonprofit organizations and landowners to establish policies that will protect prime agricuttural areas around the sphere of influence, inciuding a process to implement techniques such as transfer of development rights, agriculturai easements and farmland trusts.

The City will also work with Colusa County to establish mutually reinforcing goals of city-centered development in order to prevent the intrusion of residential development into agriculturai lands.

Parks, Recreation and Resource Conservation Element

Policy PRC-8.1 (see Impact 4.1.3)
Implementing Action PRC-8.1.a: Development Review (see Impact 4.1.3)
Policy LU-4.1 states the City's support of preserving agricultural lands outside its Sphere of Influence, while Implementing Action LU-4.1.b commits the City to work with various agencies to develop policies and programs to preserve such lands. Policy PRC-8.1 would require the City to evaluate the impacts of a development project on agricultural operations, specifically projects adjacent to agricultural lands and to take measures to reduce conflicts with those lands. This would be implemented through the development review process described in Implementing Actions LU-2.1.b and PRC-8.1.a.

While these policies and implementing actions would reduce pressure on adjoining lands to convert to non-agricultural uses, these policies do not avoid or mitigate the direct conversion of agricultural lands to urban uses that would occur with development under the General Plan Update, and the subsequent loss of the agricultural uses of these lands. Therefore, this impact is considered potentially significant after implementation of the General Plan policies and actions
and additional mitigation is necessary.

4.1 LAND USE AND AGRICULTURAL. RESOURCES

Additional Mitigation Measures

MM 4.1.5 As part of the Development Review process associated with Implementing Action LU-2.1.a, the City shall review development projects to mitigate for loss of Prime Farmland, Farmland of Statewide Importance or Farmland of Local Importance by: (1) granting a farmland conservation easement to or for the benefit of the City and/or a qualifying entity approved by the City, at a 1:1 ratio for each acre developed, (2) if the City adopts a farmland conservation program, by payment of an in lieu fee as established by the farmland conservation program, which shall be reviewed and adjusted periodically to ensure that the fee is adequate to offset the cost of purchasing farmland conservation easements at 1:1 ratio, or (3) other form of compensation at a 1:1 ratio, such as improvements to existing agricultural land, that is acceptable to the City and conserves the farmland in perpetuity. The City shall prepare guidelines identifying requirements for conservation easements, including timing of conservation easements, location of land to be preserved, land mitigation ratio and quality, and minimum standards for conservation easements.

General Plan policies and implementing actions listed previously would not reduce the loss of agricultural land to a less than significant level and therefore mitigation is required is and is presented in MM 4.1.5. Implementation of MM 4.1.5 would reduce the impact of the loss of important farmland by compensating for any loss due to development by protecting regional farmlands from conversion to non-agricultural uses. However, because projects will remove
Prime Farmland and Farmland of Local Importance from existing agricultural production resulting
in a reduction in farmlands, even with the conservation of other farmland that would occur with
MM 4.1.5, the General Plan Update would still result in the direct loss of agricultural land, specifically Prime Farmland and Farmland of Local Importance. Therefore, this impact is considered significant and unavoidable.
Consistency with LAFCo Policies

Impact 4.1.6 Implementation of the proposed General Plan Update could lead to inconsistency with the policies of the Colusa County LAFCo regarding agricultural preservation. This considered a potentially signiticant impact.
As previously noted, the Colusa County Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCo) governs annexations of property into cities. In deciding on an application for annexation, LAFCo seeks to ensure that the proposed expansion of a city is a logical one, and does not encourage "leapfrog" development occurring beyond existing City boundaries. One of the goals of a LAFCo is to preserve agricultural and open space land resources.

The boundaries of the proposed Planning Area for the General Plan Update are concurrent with
the boundaries of the City's proposed Sphere of Influence. The Colusa County LAFCO is responsible for approving the proposed Sphere of Influence for Colusa. In its decision-making process, the LAFCo weighs its goals with the City's need to accommodate future growth.
Development allowed under the proposed General Plan Update would lead to the conversion of land currently used for agriculture to urban uses, resulting in a loss of farmland, as well as the conversion of open space, which includes agriculture and other undeveloped lands, to urban uses. Impacts associated with loss of agricultural lands are discussed under Impact 4.1.5. The General Plan Update anticipates annexation of lands within the Planning Area, see Figures 3-2 and 3-3, which could result in "leapfrog" development or disorderly growth.

4.1 LAND USE AND AGRICULTURAL RESOURCES

In its approval of the Sphere of Influence, the LAFCo will evaluate the expansion of the proposed Sphere of Influence and its compatibility with the goals and objectives of LAFCo. However, LAFCo will still review all annexation applications for their consistency with these goals and objectives.

In addition, during the development review process of annexation proposals, the City will review the projects to ensure that:

The project site can feasibly be served by the City within the General Plan time frame.

The project site meets LAFCO criteria for annexation as required under the Cortese-Knox- Hertzberg Reorganization Act of 2000.
The proposed annexation and development are consistent with General Plan goals and policies.

The proposed use would fulfill a market need and would create public benefits that could not reasonably be accomplished without the annexation.

Policy LU-5.1 Development patterns shall tier off of existing development and avoid leap-frogging, including areas intended for annexation that outside the city limits. are presently

Policy LU-5.2 Development patterns shall extend primarily from Highways 20 and 45. To the extent feasible, initial phases of new developments shall begin as close as possible to existing urban areas.

Policy LU-5.3 The City shall limit annexations and future urban development to land within the sphere of influence for this General Plan through the year 2025.

Policy LU-5.4 The availability of infrastructure and public services shall be established
before annexation can occur.

Implementing Action LU-5.4.a: Annexation Phasing Plan
The City will prepare and adopt an Annexation Phasing Plan to ensure a logicai progression of a annexations that meet the City's economic and pianning needs and do not strain City services, resources, and infrastructure. This plan is a statement and analysis of the City's growth plans, focusing in particular on the timing of growth and the annexations needed to support that growth. The purpose of the plan is to give the Colusa County Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) a context for evaluating the likelihood of significant growth. Within this context, LAFCO can compare a proposed annexation to projected demand for growth and the existing supply of vacant land within the City.

4.1 LAND USE AND AGRICULTURAL RESOURCES

The plan will include criteria, consistent with the Cortese-Knox-Hertzberg Reorganization Act of 2000, that promote the preservation of open space and agricultural lands; benefits the local economy; and include ensures a development pattern that is complementary and contiguous to existing development; includes adequate infrastructure and services; and will enhance the City economy.

Policies LU-5.1 through LU-5.4 are designed to be consistent with LAFCo policies and requirements related to proposed expansion of incorporated areas. These include preservation of agricultural lands, adequate provision of services, and logical expansion of urban development. Implementing Action LU-5.4.a sets forth guidance for the logical expansion of City development and services. The development review process specified in Implementing Action LU-2.1.b would ensure that future annexation proposals would meet LAFCo requirements. Implementing Action LU-2.1.d would encourage the City to coordinate with LAFCo on annexation issues and proposals.
Implementation of the proposed General Plan Update policies and implementing actions would minimize conflicts between General Plan implementation and LAFCo policies. However, development under the proposed General Plan Update would conflict with LAFCO's goals of preservation of farmland and open space and the impact remains potentially significant.
Additional Mitigation Measures

Implementation of MM 4.1.5 would result in the preservation of agricuitural lands, which also have open space value, and would reduce impacts associated with loss of farmland and space. Impacts after implementation would be less than significant. open

Williamson Act Contracts

Impact 4.1.7 Implementation of the proposed General Plan Update could result in a conflict with existing Williamson Act contracts. This is considered a potentially significant impact.

Pursuant to Government Code Section 51243, the City is required to provide for the exclusion of uses other than agricultural, and other than those compatible with agricuitural uses, for the duration of a Williamson Act contract. If a city annexes land under Williamson Act contract, the city must succeed to all rights, duties and powers of the county unless conditions in Government Code Section 512343.5 apply to give the city the option to not succeed the contract. However, these stipulations do not apply to those lands within the General Plan Planning Area because all lands under Williamson Act contract were contracted prior to city incorporation. Therefore the City must allow agricultural uses to continue on lands under Williamson Act contracts until those contracts are removed.

As previously discussed and indicated in Figure 4.1-2, no Williamson Act contracts are located within the General Plan Planning Area. However, adjacent to the Planning Area are Williamson Act - Security Zone land and Williamson Act - Non-Prime Agricultural land.
As discussed under Impact 4.1.5, all agricultural lands within the General Plan Planning Area would be converted to urban uses under the proposed General Plan. As the General Plan does not identify agricultural land use designations, it is assumed that these lands will be converted to urban uses. This urban development may impede the ability for the adjacent landowner to farm his or her land according to the Williamson Act contract and therefore be in violation of that

4.2 POPULATION AND HOUSING

4.2 POPULATION AND HOUSING

This section analyzes the potential population and housing impacts of the proposed General Plan. Within this section are discussions on the population and housing characteristics within the proposed Planning Area. Key issues addressed in this section include: population and housing growth and jobs-housing balance. Information for this section came from public databases and documents, particularly the City of Colusa Housing Element.

4.2.1 EXISTING SETTING

REGIONAL SETTING/LOCAL SETTING

The proposed Planning Area consists of approximately 5.95 square miles (3,805 acres) of land in the eastern portion of Colusa County. Urban land uses in the proposed Planning Area generally consist of residentiai, commercial, office, recreational and public uses within and adjacent to the City of Colusa. Residential, industrial and agricultural Uses occur outside of the City of Colusa. The existing City of Colusa General Plan and Zoning Code currently guide the land uses in the City, while the Colusa County General Plan and Zoning Ordinance apply to areas outside the City limits. Refer to Section 4.1 (Land Use) for a more detailed description of land uses and applicable land use plans in the proposed Planning Area. Refer to Section 4.0, (Introduction to the Environmental Analysis and Assumptions Used), for a discussion of buildout projections under the adopted General Plan.

DEMOGRAPHICS

Population

Table 4.2-1 shows population trends in the City of Colusa. The City experienced substantial growth between the 1980 and 1990 U.S. Census. Between 1990 and 2000, the population in Colusa increased from 4,934 to 5,402, although the growth rate during that period was less than that for the state overall (13.8 percent). As of January 1, 2006, the California Department of Finance estimated the City's population at 5,698.

Household Trends and Demographics

According to the 2000 Census, 2,097 households were established in the City of Colusa. As of
2006, the average household size for Colusa is 2.845 persons per household, versus 3.083 persons per household for Colusa County and 2.936 for California. Table 4.2-2 displays the household size, number of households and percentage of each household size within the City of Colusa.
Almost half of the households in the City (47.3 percent) have one or two persons, which is less

Household Income

Household incomes for Colusa are slightly higher compared to those for Colusa County. According to the 2000 U.S. Census, the household median income for Colusa was $35,250. By comparison, the median income in Colusa County was $35,062. Both median household incomes were lower than that for the state overall, which was $47.493. Data from the 2000 U.S. Census indicate that approximately 22.7 percent of the City's population lived below the poverty level.

HOUSING

Housing Units
Table 4.2-3 shows the number of housing units in Colusa. When compared to the population figures in Table 4.2-1, changes in housing stock appear to precede changes in population growth. According to the 2000 U.S. Census, approximately 23.8 percent of the City's housing
stock up to 2000 was built after 1980. Slightly over half (50.5 percent) of the City's stock was built
prior to 1960.

4.2 POPULATION AND HOUSING

Table 4.2-4 shows the type of housing units in Colusa as of 2006. Most of the housing in Colusa is single-family detached residences. By comparison, only 57.3 percent of housing in California overall is single-family detached. Approximately 17.8 percent of City housing units are multifamily units, compared with 31 percent of units in California. Multifamily units typically are a more affordable housing option for lower-income households, along with mobile homes. Only 2.5 percent of housing units in the City are mobile homes, compared with 4.5 percent statewide.

Tenure

Tenure describes the ownership pattern of households whether households are renters or owners. As is shown in Table 4.2-5, the majority of households in Colusa are owner occupied (67.1 percent). The renter rate in Colusa, 32.9 percent, is less than in Colusa County as a whole, in which 36.8 percent of households rent. Both are lower than for the state overall, which is 43.1
percent. Generally, higher rates of ownership are considered desirable by cities, as owners are considered more likely to maintain their residences and more likely to be actively engaged in their communities.

Housing Vacancies

Vacancy trends in housing are analyzed using a "vacancy rate," which establishes the relationship between housing supply and demand. For example, if the demand for housing is greater than the supply, then the vacancy rate is low and the price of housing will most likely increase. According to Raising the Roof, California Housing Development Projections and Constraints, 1997-2020, published by the California Department of Housing and Community Development, the desirable vacancy rate in a community is considered to be 5 percent. Generally, when the vacancy rate drops below 5 percent, the demand for housing exceeds the
City of Colusa
July 2007 Colusa Generaf Plan
Draft Master Environmental Impact Report
4.2-3

4.2 POPULATION AND HOUSING

supply of housing. Subsequently, prospective buyers and renters may experience an increase in housing costs.
The City of Colusa Housing Element states that, according to the 2000 U.S. Census, the vacancy rate for Colusa was 5.9 percent. This percentage is based on the total number of vacant housing units related to total housing units. Vacant housing units counted by the U.S. Census include second or vacation homes that are seasonally occupied, migrant worker housing and other units not generally available on the housing market. Therefore, the U.S. Census vacancy rate is not the same as housing market vacancy rates, which are more applicable in determining housing availability. More specifically, the U.S. Census indicated that vacancy rates in 2000 were 1.6 percent for owner lousing units and 3.8 percent for rental housing units. Both these vacancy rates are lower than the desired 5 percent, indicating a tight housing market.

EMPLOYMENT

Data from the California Employment Development Department indicate that the City of Colusa had a labor force of 3,100 people in 2005, of which 2,800 were employed. The unemployment rate in the City was 8.2 percent in 2005. This was higher than the statewide unemployment rate of 5.4 percent, but lower than the 12.4 percent unemployment rate in Colusa County.
According to the 2000 U.S. Census, the largest single employment sector in the City of Colusa was agriculture, forestry and mining (Table 4.2-6). This reflects the historically important role of agriculture in the local economy. Educational, health and social services accounted for 15.3 percent of employed persons, the second largest share. Retail trade was next at 12.5 percent.

4.2.2 REGULATORY FRAMEWORK

CITY OF COLUSA GENERAL PLAN

The adopted City of Colusa General Plan currently is used as the "blueprint" to guide future development within the City limits, and to a limited extent in unincorporated portions of the existing Planning Area. The overall purpose of the General Plan to guide land development in the City of Colusa. Refer to Section 4.0, (Introduction to the Environmental Analysis and Assumptions Used), for a discussion of land use designations and buildout projections under the adopted General Plan. The proposed General Plan Update does not propose revisions to the Housing Element.

Housing Element

The City of Colusa Housing Element, adopted in June 2004, and is one of the seven required General Plan Element of the Colusa General Plan. State housing element law requires a housing element update every five years and, as such, on a different update schedule than the other General Plan elements. As the Colusa Housing Element is not required to be updated until 2008 and the existing Housing Element was recently adopted by the City, an update for this Element was not a part of the proposed General Plan update project.
Part of the Housing Element update process includes compliance with the Regional Housing Needs Plan (RHNP). State housing element law (Section 65583 of the Government Code) requires that the housing element of each jurisdiction include an estimate of its "fair share" of the regional housing needs, which is part of the RHNP. In the case of the Cily of Colusa, the regional allocation is developed by the California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) and distributed through the Tri-County Area Planning Council. While the City is not required to actually construct new housing units, it is required to make available through changes in the land use diagram and zoning, if necessary, adequate sites to allow the development of these units. The Regional Housing Need Allocation (RHNA) for the City was determined to be 290 new housing units by 2008. It was determined, through the Housing Element update process, that the City had adequate sites to meet its RHNA goal of 290 units. For further information on the RHNP and adequate sites, the reader is referred to the City of Colusa 2003-2008 Housing Element.
The Housing Element is used as the "blueprint" to guide future housing development in the City. Under state law, the Housing Element and all other elements in the General Plan must be consistent with each other. The proposed General Plan update does not conflict with goals and policies identified in the 2003-2008 Housing Element but, in fact, enhances Housing Element goals for the provision of adequate housing by providing more areas of residential lands through the redesignation of lands to residential uses.

4.2.3 IMPACTS AND MITIGATION MEASURES

STANDARDS OF SIGNIFICANCE

Based on Appendix G of the CEQA Guidelines, population and housing impacts are considered to be significant if the following could result from the implementation of the proposed General Plan Update:

City of Colusa Colusa General Plan July 2007 Draft Master Environmental Impact Report 4.2-5

4.2 POPULATION AND HOUSING

Substantial growth or concentration of population in an area either directly or indirectly (e.g., through projects in an undeveloped area or extension of major infrastructure) that results in a physical effect on the environment.
Displacement of substantial numbers of existing housing, necessitating the construction of replacement housing elsewhere.
Displacement of substantial numbers of people, necessitating the construction of replacement housing elsewhere.

METHODOLOGY

City staff conducted research on demographic and housing conditions, utilizing existing documents and other information sources. Information was obtained from governmental agencies through their websites. Among these agencies were the U.S. Bureau of the Census, the California Department of Finance, and the California Employment Development Department. The recently adopted City of Colusa Housing Element was an additional source of information on housing and socioeconomic conditions as well as housing policies.
Growth-inducing impacts are addressed in Section 5.0, Other Sections Required by CEQA.
IMPACTS AND MITIGATION MEASURES

Population and Housing Growth

Impact 4.2.1 Implementation of the proposed General Plan Update could result in a substantial increase in population and the number of housing units. This is a potentially significant impact.
Holding capacity is expressed as the total number of people that would be accommodated within a planning area if the land within that area were developed to the maximum potential allowed by land Use designations in the general plan. Once potential buildout and dwelling units are projected, potential population can be determined. The proposed City of Colusa General Plan is anticipated to have a buildout capacity of 9,386 housing units. Based on current household size of approximately 2.85 persons per household', the proposed Planning Area would have an estimated holding capacity of approximately 26,750 people.
Approximately 73.8 percent of the total housing units would be in Low-Density Residential, Estate Residential or Urban Reserve areas. Such units are typically single-family detached residences, although some second units could be constructed as well. Single-family residences use more land to house a given population than higher-density housing such as duplexes and apartments. This housing development, regardless of density, would have physical impacts on the local environment.

Implementation of the proposed General Plan Update would directly induce growth, and require the extension of infrastructure, roads, water, sewer and fire protection as new development occurs.

4.2 POPULATION AND HOUSING

Proposed General Plan Policies and Implementing Actions that Mitigate Potential Impacts
The adopted Colusa Housing Element contains policies and programs related to housing development. The Regulatory Framework subsection above lists relevant policies.
The proposed General Plan contains policies and implementing actions related to land use, circulation, open space and conservation, municipal services, noise, satety, and community design. All the policies in the proposed General Plan are intended to accommodate the anticipated population and housing growth in a manner that reduces its impacts - to the extent feasible - on the local environment. Applicable policies and programs in the proposed General Plan include the following:

Land Use Element

Policy LU-5.3 The City shall limit annexations and future urban development to land within the sphere of influence for this General Plan through the year 2025.
Policy LU-6.4 The City shall accommodate projected population and employment growth in areas where the appropriate level of public infrastructure and services are planned or will be made available concurrent with development.
The Land Use Element policies and implementing actions and Land Use Map seek to direct housing development in a manner that provides sufficient housing for the anticipated population, while reducing some of the adverse environmental impacts such as conflicts with agricultural operations, inadequate service systems, and loss or alteration of historic homes and areas. Nevertheless, even with implementation of these policies and implementing actions, significant environmental impacts related to population and housing growth would still occur.
Additional Mitigation Measures
The MEIR contains mitigation measures where appropriate to reduce or eliminate potentially significant impacts associated with specific environmental issues associated with population growth and related development, such as increased demand for water supply and wastewater, loss and loss of agricultural land, in the relevant sections of this DMEIR. Refer to Sections 4.1 and 4.3 through 4.12 for a discussion of environmental effects associated with population growth and related development allowed under the proposed General Plan Update and mitigation measures, where necessary and feasible. However, even with implementation of General Plan policies and mitigation measures, as noted in Section 8.0, implementation of the General Plan and its associated growth is expected to result in several significant and avoidable effects to the environment. Therefore, this impact is considered significant and unavoidable.
Jobs-Housing Balance

Impact 4.2.2 The increase in the number of employed persons versus the increase in housing units may result in a jobs-housing imbalance. This is considered a less than significant impact.
The concept of a balance between jobs and housing is used to examine if an area has an appropriate mix of housing supply and employment base. The "jobs-housing" balance is typically expressed as a ratio of the number of employees to the number of dwelling units. Ratios of 1.0 to 1.5 generally represent a balanced community, allowing for vacancies and two- worker households (County of Yuba, 1993). A ratio less than 1.0 could indicate that residents in a

City of Colusa
July 2007 Colusa General Plan
Draft Master Environmental Impact Report 4.2-7

4,2 POPULATION AND HOUSING

given area are traveling out of the area to places of employment, as there are fewer jobs than residents. A ratio greater than 1.5 could indicate a surplus of jobs, and employees are driving into an area. In both cases, the resultant commuting could have significant environmental impacts on issues such as transportation, air quality and noise.
However, dividing the number of employed residents by the number of housing units provides a rough approximation of the jobs-housing balance. Using 2005 figures of number of employed residents (2,800 - see Existing Setting above) and the California Department of Finance 2005 estimate of housing units (2,047), the jobs-housing balance in Colusa is 1.37. This is within the is acceptable range.

The Land Use Map of the proposed General Plan Update designates various portions of the proposed Planning Area for uses that generate employment. Based on commonly used factors ,relating number of employees to square footage of commercial and industrial uses, an estimate of the number of employees in the proposed Planning Area at buildout can be developed. Table 4.2-7 provides an estimate.

Source: PMC

As previously mentioned, the estimated number of housing units in the proposed Planning Area at buildout would be 9,386. Dividing this number into the number of employees presented in Table 4.2-7 above, the jobs-housing balance at buildout would range from 1.13 to 1.46. These ratios are within the acceptable range of jobs-housing balance ratios. Therefore, impacts of the proposed General Plan on the jobs-housing balance are considered less than significant.
Additional Mitigation Measures

None required.

4.2 POPULATION AND HOUSING

Displacement of a Substantial Number of Persons or Housing
Impact 4.2.3 Implementation of the proposed General Plan Update may result in the displacement of housing and/or persons due to the construction of infrastructure necessary to serve new development or revitalization efforts. This is considered a less than significant impact.
While implementation of the proposed General Plan Update does not, in and of itself, provide for the construction of any new development, it would change land use designations in areas thereby allowing future growth that may require additional and/or enlargement of infrastructure such as improved and new roadways. This includes several areas identified in the proposed General Plan Update that designate Special Planning Areas of the City. Special Planning Areas are recognized as unique planning areas that would provide substantial new growth and redevelopment opportunities for the City. These Special Planning Areas include Colusa Riverfront District, Brookins Ranch Estates, Colusa Crossings (Vann Property), Colusa Riverbend Specific Plan Area Colusa Industrial Park, and Airport Overflight Zone. These Special Planning Areas would be planned, annexed and ultimately developed through the use of specific plans or planned developments.

Implementation of the General Plan would not, in and of itself, displace substantial numbers of housing units or people. It is anticipated that most residences that will be removed will be sold to the developers prior to the development of the site and the residents would move elsewhere and thus would not be placed by the project, but rather would opt to sell their home and land and move as a result. While residences may be removed as a result of development allowed under the General Plan, buildout under the General Plan would result in an increase in the total number of residences and provide housing opportunities for persons that may be displaced as a result of development. This provision of replacement "housing opportunities" is essentially a self- mitigating aspect as a result of implementation of the General Plan Update., Therefore, impacts of the proposed General Plan on the displacement of people or housing are considered less than significant.

Mitigation Measures

None required.

4.3 TRANSPORTATION AND CIRCULATION

4.3 TRANSPORTATION AND CIRCULATION

This section describes the existing transportation system in the proposed Planning Area, and analyzes the potential impacts associated with the land uses designated in the proposed
General Plan Update. Aspects of the transportation system evaluated in this section include streets and roadways, and also include public transit, bicycle and pedestrian transportation, and other modes of transportation. Key issues addressed in this section include: increased traffic volumes on local roadways, intersections and state highways, roadway safety, parking, transit, and bicycle and pedestrian facilities. The evaluation is based on a traffic impact study prepared by kdAnderson Transportation Consultants. The study is provided in Appendix B of this
document.

4.3.1 EXISTING SETTING

Roadways are the primary existing transportation facilities within the proposed Planning Area. The existing roadway network consists of highways, thoroughfares, arterials, collectors, and local streets. Existing bicycle, pedestrian and transit facilities are also present in the proposed Planning Area, although these facilities are currently limited. A description of the major transportation facilities, major roadway segments, current traffic volumes, and alternative transportation modes are discussed below.

ROADWAY SYSTEM

Major roadways in the proposed Planning Area are identified below. Figure 4.3-1, the proposed Circulation Diagram for the General Plan, shows the existing roadway network along with proposed improvements.
State Route (SR) 20 is an east-west arterial linking the coastal areas of northern California with the
Sierra foothill counties. SR 20 intersects Interstate
just north of the City of Williams and continues
eastward, entering Colusa from the southwest.
Once inside the City limits, SR 20 travels north,
east and south before exiting Colusa at its
southeastern corner. SR 20 then continues in an
eastward direction out of Colusa County towards
Yuba City in Sutter County. SR 20 is primarily a two-lane roadway through the proposed Planning Area, except for a four-lane segment where it becomes Market Street (see below).
SR 45 is a north-south arterial that generally follows the Sacramento River. It begins at Knights Landing in Yolo County and follows the Sacramento River on its western side. Approximately seven miles southeast of Colusa, SR 45 merges with SR 20 and subsequently enters Colusa from
the southeast, traveling north and then west. At the intersection of Market Street and Tenth
Street, SR 45 separates from SR 20 and continues in a northerly direction toward the Colusa Casino and the community of Princeton. It is a two-lane roadway, except where it becomes part of Market Street (see below).

Market Street is an east-west arterial that passes through the downtown commercial area of Colusa. It acts as a "main street" for the City. From Tenth Street to Bridge Street, Market Street is part of SR 20/45. From Tenth Street to Thirteenth Street, Market Street is a part of SR 45. Market Street is a four-lane street from First Street to Tenth Street, and a two-lane street outside this
segment.

City of Colusa Colusa General Plan July 2007 Draft Master Environmental Impact Report

4.3 TRANSPORTATION AND CIRCULATION

Bridge Street is a north-south, two-lane arterial located in eastern Colusa. This street passes through the newer commercial development in the City. From Wescott Road to Market Street, Bridge Street is a part of SR 20/45, Beyond Market Street, Bridge Street crosses over the Sacramento River into the portion of Colusa County east of the river.
Wescott Road is a north-south, two-lane collector that extends south from Bridge Street (SR 45). It serves the residential area located in southeastern Colusa, as well as the Walnut Ranch development outside the Cily limits. Beyond the Walnut Ranch development, Wescott Road becomes a rural roadway.
Tenth Street is a north-south, two-lane arterial in western Colusa. It begins at Harris Street and extends into the Colusa Sacramento River State Recreation Area. From Harris Street to Market Street, Tenth Street is part of Highway 20.
Fremont Street is an east-west, two-lane collector that extends from 13th Street to Bridge Street. It passes by the primary and middle schools for Colusa, as well as by the Community Center for the Performing Arts building (formerly Colusa High School).
Main Street is an east-west two-lane collector that extends from Thirteenth Street to D Street. Formerly the main street in the days when Colusa was a steamboat stop, it still serves some commercial activities as well as residences.

Third Street is a north-south, two-lane collector that extends from Main Street to the residential area in southeastern Colusa.

In addition to the above roadways, Colusa is approximately ten miles east of Interstate 5, the major north-south interregional freeway on the West Coast. It is also approximately 24 miles west of SR 99, a major north-south highway in California extending approximately from Red Bluff to Bakersfield.

Existing Traffic Volumes and Operating Conditions
Level of Service Thresholds / Standards
To describe traffic conditions, traffic volumes are compared to Level of Service (LOS) thresholds. LOS is a qualitative measure of traific operating conditions whereby a letter grade, "A" through "F", corresponding to progressively worsening traffic operating conditions, is assigned to an intersection or roadway segment.

Intersections

LOS can be determined for highways, streets and intersections. Published methodologies for determining Level of Service are predicated on hourly traffic volumes on these facilities. For the proposed General Pian Update, information regarding intersection LOS has been developed using the procedures contained in the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM). Table 4.3-1 presents the general characteristics of each level of service grade at intersections.

Roadways

For planning level traffic analysis, such as for the proposed General Plan Update, it is appropriate to describe Levels of Service based on the average daily traffic volumes occurring on roadways. Use of daily volumes permits relatively quick assessment of circulation system needs.

Level of Service thresholds for streets and highways in Colusa were developed based on review of several sources. Because there is no uniform national standard to equate daily traffic volumes on urban streets to specific Levels of Service, the City of Colusa General Plan EIR and its background references and Caltrans guidelines were considered. As Caltrans has no recommendations in this area, kdAnderson determined that general thresholds originally developed by the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) are most applicable to the proposed General Plan Update. The Level of Service thresholds developed by FDOT have been used by many California agencies.
Level of Service thresholds were developed in a manner that accounted for the presence of features that affect urban traffic flow. These thresholds account for the effects of traffic signals on overall traffic flow, as well as signal spacing. The FDOT guidelines suggest that the presence of a raised median could increase Level of Service thresholds by about 5 percent. However, while the presence of wider shoulders and or bicycle lanes will promote overall safety, the general capacity of the street may not be affected by this extra width. Resulting LOS thresholds are presented in Table 4.3-3. These thresholds are employed to identify the number of through travel lanes that would typically be expected on each street. It is noted that while these LOS thresholds are based on ADT, these thresholds do not represent L.OS anticipated to be experienced throughout the day but rather reflect anticipated peak-hour (worst-case) conditions.

Streets and Roadways

Table 4.3-1 presents current daily traffic volumes and resulting Levels of Service (LOS) on the streets and highways that serve Colusa. Traffic count data for state highways are available from two sources: annual average daily traific (AADT) volumes reported by Caltrans for the year 2005, and traffic counts conducted in October 2005 as part of a traffic impact study by kdAnderson Transportation Consultants. A comparison of the data reveals these counts are appreciably different through downtown Colusa. Caltrans AADT are in the range of 20,000 to 25,000 on Market Street, while counts conducted for the traffic impact study were in the range of 9,000 to 10,000 vehicles per day in the same locations. However, Caltrans AADT and new counts are similar at locations on the edge of Colusa.
As shown in Table 4.3-4, all study roadways currently carry traffic volumes that are indicative of LOS C or better conditions, with the exception of Bridge Street between Carson Street and Fremont Street, which operates at LOS D. This data suggest satisfactory operations under proposed General Plan policy, which requires roadways to operate at LOS C or better. However, Caltrans AADT are higher in some instances and are indicative of worse LOS conditions, as indicated by bolded text in Table 4.3-4.

Intersections

Current evening peak hour LOS at key intersections in Colusa are presented in Table 4.3-5. These values are based on intersection traffic counts made in October 2005 between 4:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. The analysis focuses on conditions occurring during the evening peak traffic hour, as it represents the "worst case" period with regard to residential trip generation and background traffic on city streets. At signalized intersections and at locations controlled by all-way stops, these values represent the average condition for all motorists passing through the intersection. At intersections controlled by side street stop signs, the values present are representative of the delays occurred by motorists waiting to turn onto the main street (i.e. "worst case"). As shown in Table 4.3-5 the poorest current LOS occur at the SR 20/Wescott evening peak hour motorists waiting to turn onto SR Road intersection. During the 20 experience delays that are indicative of LOS F conditions. The LOS at all other intersection is LOS C or better. C

The extent to which any location is already a candidate for a traffic signal was also evaluated using the peak hour volume warrants established by Caltrans. These warrants can consider both urban and rural (high speed) conditions. Assuming that the higher volume urban warrants are applicable within Colusa, none of the intersections satisfies warrants.

TRANSIT SYSTEM

Colusa County Transit provides bus services Monday through Friday from 7:30 am to 5:00 pm. The transit system operates on a "dial-a-ride" system on all four of its routes, which all originate in Colusa. Bus service is provided regularly from Colusa to Williams, Arbuckle and Grimes. Buses go a to Maxwell and Princeton twice a week, and to Stonyford about three times a month. Ridership on Colusa County Transit has averaged about 4,500 per month over the past year (Barbara Salazar, Colusa County Transit, pers. comm.). The average is higher during the summer months, when more migrant farmworkers use the system. Average ridership is lowest during the winter months (November-January), when agricultural employment is at its lowest.
A supplemental taxi service that provided after-hours transit service ended last year, with the retirement of the provider. Colusa County Transit has sought to find another provider of this service, but lack of funds to subsidize potential providers has been an impediment. Colusa County Transit has taken over the medical escort service previously provided by the taxi company. This escort service takes riders to Yuba City, Woodland, Chico and Sacramento. Other destinations for this service are being considered.

4.3 TRANSPORTATION AND CIRCULATION

BICYCLE SYSTEM

Bicycles are considered a significant alternative mode of transportation to motor vehicles. Bicycle systems typically include bikeways specifically designated for bicycle travel. There are three categories of bikeways:
Class | - Bike Paths provide a completely separated right-of-way for the exclusive use of bicycles and pedestrian with cross-flow minimized.
Class !/ - Bike Lanes are striped lanes for one-way bike travel on a street or highway.
Class II1 - Bike Routes provide for shared use with pedestrians or motor vehicle traffic.

Bicycle facilities are currently limited within the proposed Planning Area. The City of Colusa has designated only a Class IlI route on Wescott Road. A paved path on top of the levee adjacent to downtown Colusa is used by bicycle as well as pedestrian traific, but it is not a specifically designated bikeway. Most streets and roadways in the City can accommodate bicycle traffic. There are no designated bikeways outside the City limits.
In 1992, Colusa County prepared a Bicycle Plan. The Bicycle Plan outlines general design criteria for bicycle facilities and designates bikeways for the County and its incorporated cities, including Colusa. According to information from the Bicycle Plan, Class IlI bicycle routes are proposed within the City of Colusa along Highways 20 and 45, including Market Street and Tenth Street. Class III routes are also proposed along Wescott Road (since established) and Wilson Avenue. The Bicycle Plan has not been updated, so no new bikeways or changes to previously designated routes have been proposed.

PEDESTRIAN SYSTEM

Pedestrian facilities are somewhat more
extensive, particularly within the Colusa City limits. Pedestrian movement through the City occurs via
a series of sidewalks on major streets and connectivity to most areas in Colusa.

RAIL SERVICE

There are no railroad facilities in the City of Colusa. A California Northern railroad line runs in a north-south direction down the middle of Colusa County, passing through the communities of Maxwell, Williams and Arbuckle. This line is used for freight travel. There is no passenger rail service in Colusa or in Colusa County. Amtrak operates a rail route along the eastern portion of the Sacramento Valley. The nearest Amtrak train stations to Colusa are located in Chico and Sacramento.

WATER TRANSPORTATION

The Sacramento River has been a major transportation route historically. Steamboats utilized the river in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Colusa was an active steamboat stop for both cargo and passengers. Steamboat service ceased by the 1930s, and cargo ships now go no farther Colusa General Plan

north than Sacramento. The Sacramento River in the Colusa area is now used mainly for recreational boating. A boat launch ramp is available at Colusa Sacramento River State Recreation Area, at the northern edge of the City. No other ramps or marinas are located within the proposed Planning Area.

AIRPORT

The Colusa County Airport is located approximately two miles southeast of Colusa. It is under the jurisdiction of and operated by the County of Colusa. The airport provides general aviation services for the general public. The airport has a single paved runway, along with 22 airport- 5 owned hangars, 5 privately owned hangars and two agricultural operation hangars. Tie down parking and fuel service are available. The most recent estimate of annual operations is 28,000 (Harry Krug, Director of Airport Operations, pers. comm.). According to data from AirNav.com, approximately 77 percent of airport operations are for transient general aviation, while the remainder is mostly local general aviation. The airport does not provide scheduled commercial passenger service. The nearest airport with this service is Sacramento International Airport.
Airport-related hazards are generally associated with aircraft accidents, particularly during takeoffs and landings. Airport operation hazards include incompatible land uses, power transmission lines, wildlife hazards (e.g., bird strikes), and tall structures that penetrate the imaginary surfaces surrounding an airport. The Comprehensive Land Use Plan (CLUP) for the Colusa County Airport delineates flight safety zones. The safety zones are generally confined to the immediate area north and south of the main runway. However, the CLUP also delineates an overflight zone that encompasses a portion of southeastern Colusa, as well as most of the southeastern proposed Planning Area. Section 4.1, Land Use and Agricultural Resources, discusses potential land use compatibility issues in the overflight zone.

PRIVATE TRANSPORTATION SERVICES

Private bus service is not available in Colusa. Greyhound previously had a bus stop in the City of Williams, approximately ten miles west. However, this bus stop was discontinued in April 2005. The nearest Greyhound bus stop is located in Marysville in Yuba County. Colusa County Cab Company, based in Colusa, provides taxi service for residents in Colusa and surrounding areas.
4.3.2 REGULATORY FRAMEWORK

FEDERAL

Federal Aviation Administration

The mission of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is to provide leadership in planning and developing a safe and efficient national airport system to satisfy the needs of aviation interests of the United States, with due consideration for economics, environmental compatibility, local proprietary rights, and safeguarding the public investment. Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR)
City of Colusa
July 2007 Colusa General Plan Draft Master Environmental Impact Report 4.3-9

4.3 TRANSPORTATION AND CIRCULATION

Part 77 establishes standards and notification requirements for objects affecting navigable airspace. This notification serves as the basis for:

Evaluating the effect of the construction or alteration on operating procedures.
Determining the potential hazardous effect of the proposed construction on air navigation.

• Identifying mitigating measures to enhance safe air navigation.

• Charting of new objects.
FAR Part 77 notification allows the FAA to identify potential aeronautical hazards in advance thus preventing or minimizing the adverse impacts to the safe and efficient use of navigable airspace. The regulations identify three-dimensional imaginary surfaces on and around airports through which no object should penetrate. All development projects under the proposed General Plan would be subject to review associated with Part 77, if obstruction into the navigable airspace is anticipated.

STATE

California Department of Transportation (Caltrans)
is Caltrans is responsible for planning, designing, building, operating and maintaining the State's highway system. SR 20 and SR 45, which traverse the City of Colusa, are part of the State highway system maintained by Caltrans. The City is located within Caltrans District 3, with offices in Marysville. Caltrans' Transportation Planning Division is responsible for developing statewide, long-range plans for transportation improvements, while the Transportation Programming Division sets priorities for various State and federal transportation funding programs.
California Division of Aeronautics

The California Division of Aeronautics is a division of Caltrans. Its purpose is to foster and promote the development of a safe, efficient, dependable, and environmentally compatible air transportation system. The Division issues permits for and annually inspects hospital heliports and public-use airports. It also administers noise regulation and land use planning laws that foster compatible land uses around airports, and encourages environmental mitigation measures to lessen noise, air pollution, and other impacts caused by aviation. For example, the Division makes recommendations regarding proposed school sites within two miles of an airport runway.
California Transportation Commission
The California Transportation Commission was established in 1978 out of a growing concern for a single, unified California transportation policy. The Commission is responsible for the programming and allocating of funds for the construction of highway, passenger rail and transit improvements throughout California. The fund programming and allocation is done primarily through the State Transportation Improvement Program (STIP) process. The Commission also advises and assists the Secretary of Business, Transportation and Housing Agency and the State Legislature in formulating and evaluating state policies and plans for California's transportation programs.

LOCAL

Colusa General Plan

The adopted City of Colusa General Plan is currenily used as the "blueprint" to guide future development within the City limits and in unincorporated portions of the existing Planning Area. The adopted General Plan does not identify LOS criteria for City roadways or intersections. The proposed General Plan Update would establish policies and implementing actions associated with transportation and circulation. Specitic proposed policies and implementing actions are discussed in the impact analyses below.
Colusa County General Plan
The County of Colusa has jurisdiction over the unincorporated areas of Colusa County. The Colusa County General Plan Circulation Element sets forth policies regarding County circulation issues. The following policy establishes the County LOS for unincorporated areas surrounding the City of Colusa:

CIRC-2 Existing transportation facilities should be utilized fully (Level of Service "C", as defined in Table CIRC-3 [of the County Circulation Element]) before making major new capital improvements.
Colusa County Local Transportation Commission
The Colusa County Local Transportation Commission develops transportation plans for Colusa County. It identifies transportation improvement projects in the County, which may include roadways, bridges, public transportation, and bicycle and pedestrian facilities. The Commission sets priorities for these projects and identifies sources of funding.
In 2004, the Commission prepared the Colusa County Regional Transportation Plan (RTP). The 2004 RTP assessed current and future transportation needs in Colusa County and the cities of Colusa and Williams. It included a prioritized list of short-term and long-term projects, and the funding for those projects. Current programmed road projects in the City of Colusa are road rehabilitation projects on Seventh Street from Webster to Parkhill Street, Parkhill Street from Tenth to Eleventh Street, and Wescott Road from Louis Lane to Country Club Drive. There are also programmed improvements for State Routes 20 and 45 in and near Colusa. The RTP lists projects for new and continued transit service in Colusa and for bicycle transportation improvements, and improvement projects at the Colusa County Airport.
Colusa County Airport Comprehensive Land Use Plan
In 1995, the Colusa County Airport Land Use Commission (ALUC) adopted the Comprehensive Land Use Plan (CLUP) for the Colusa County Airport, southeast of the City. The purposes of the CLUP are twofold. One is to protect public health, safety, and welfare through the adoption of land use standards that minimize the public's exposure to safety hazards and excessive levels of noise associated with airport operations. The other is to prevent the encroachment of incompatible land uses around public-use airports, thereby preserving their utility and ensuring unhampered operations. The CLUP regulates land use in three major areas: safety zones, noise zones, and height restrictions. It provides land use compatibility guidelines for lands near the airport, determining acceptable land uses within the established zones. The CLUP establish planning boundaries around the airport for height, noise, and safety.

City of Colusa Colusa General Plan July 2007 Draft Master Environmental Impact Report 4.3-11

4.3 TRANSPORTATION AND CIRCULATION

California Government Code Section 65302.3 requires all local jurisdictions affected by a CLUP ensure that their land use regulations are consistent with the provisions of the CLUP. Following the incorporation of the CLUP's provisions into its land use regulations, certain types of projects must be referred to the ALUC by local jurisdictions for a review of consistency with CLUP standards. These include General Plan or specific plan amendments, amendments to or adoption of new zoning ordinances, and building regulations affecting land within the plan area. Usually, projects referred to the ALUC consist of specific development proposals within the CLUP plan area that are seeking discretionary approvals or permits from the local jurisdiction.

4.3.3. IMPACTS AND MITIGATION MEASURES

STANDARDS OF SIGNIFICANCE

Based on Appendix G of the CEQA Guidelines, transportation and circulation impacts are considered 1O be significant if the foilowing could result from the implementation of the proposed General Plan Update:
1. Increase in traffic that is substantial in relation to the existing traffic load and capacity of the street system (i.e., result in a substantial increase in either the number of vehicle trips, the volume-to-capacity ratio on roads, or congestion at intersections).
2. Exceedance, either individually or cumulatively, of a level of service standard established by the county congestion management agency for designated roads or highways. For Caltrans roads, the minimum level of service standard is D.
3. Changes in air traffic patterns, including either an increase in traffic levels or a change in location that results in substantial safety risks.
4. Substantial increase in hazards due to a design feature (e.g., sharp curves or dangerous intersections) or incompatible uses (e.g., farm equipment).
5. Inadequate emergency access.

6. Inadequate parking capacity.
7. Conflicts with adopted policies, plans or programs supporting alternative transportation (e.g., bus turnouts, bicycle racks).

8. For a project located within an airport land use plan, or within two miles of a public airport or public use aîrport where such a plan has not been adopted, a safety hazard for people residing or working in the project area.
9. For a project within the vicinity of a private airstrip, a a safety hazard for people residing or working in the project area.
As the City has no established LOS standard, the standard of LOS C identified in the proposed General Plan Update is used to determine impacts on City roadways.

METHODOLOGY

kdAnderson Transportation Consultants prepared an analysis of traffic conditions associated with implementation of the proposed General Plan Update. It is available in Appendix B of this

4.3 TRANSPORTATION AND CIRCULATION

document. The analysis included an evaluation of LOS on various roadways within the proposed Planning Area. Refer to the Existing Setting subsection for a description of LOS.
Land Use/Trip Generation Assumptions
The amount of new development anticipated under build out of the proposed General Plan Update has been quantified for use in this analysis. These land use forecasts include development in "reserve" areas under current Colusa County designations. As noted in Table 4.3-6, under "mid-range" assumptions for density implementing the General Plan could result in more than 7,000 new dwelling units in Colusa. Another 5.9 million square feet of non-residential development is also anticipated. The trip generation associated with this new development is estimated in Table 4.3-6. As shown, new residences could generate more than 67,000 new daily trips. Non-residential uses could generate slightly fewer than 78,000 daily trips.

Trip Distribution Assumptions
The trips generated by new development under the proposed General Plan Update would have origins / destinations both within the community and throughout the region. For example, a portion of the trips made to new commercial / professional uses will be made by new residents, while other trips would be made by existing residents and some trips would be external to Colusa. Table 4.3-7 identifies the assumptions made to allocate new trips generated by residential and non-residential uses as a precursor to local assignment onto Colusa streets. As noted, approximately 15 percent of the new residential generated trips will be external to Colusa. Approximately 19 percent of the trips generated by non-residential uses (excluding the Colusa Casino expansion), would be external. Because an appreciable portion of the trips would be "matched" between new uses, the actual traffic increase would be less then the sum of raw trip generation. This approximates 96,000 new trips would be made on Colusa streets.

In addition to quantifying the overall internal/external distribution of new trips generated by growth in Colusa, it is necessary to identify the directional distribution of external trips. This was accomplished by considering the relationship between Colusa and neighboring communities such as Williams and Yuba City, as well as the city's location in the region relative to the Interstate 5 corridor. Table 4.3-8 identifies the percentile directional distribution of external trips, exclusive of the trips generated by the Colusa Casino expansion.

Through traffic on SR 20 would continue to increase over the life of the Colusa General Plan as traffic between Interstate 5 and SR 99 without origin or destination in Colusa can be expected to continue. Because no regional traffic model encompassing Colusa County is available, assumptions as to the magnitude of through traffic have been made based on consideration of the volume of traffic occurring today on SR 20 west and west of the City. On a daily basis, the current "through" traffic volume can be no larger than the lowest volume occurring at the lowest volume locations east or west on the city.
The lowest daily volume on SR 20 west of Colusa was 6,800 ADT at the SR 20 / Husted Road intersection east of Williams at the time of the kdAnderson traffic study. East of Colusa, the lowest volume was 9,700 ADT just west of the eastern SR 45 junction. For this analysis, it has been assumed that ½ of the volume observed west of Colusa is "through" traffic or 3,400 ADT.

4.3 TRANSPORTATION AND CIRCULATION

The extent to which this through traffic would increase in the future can be estimated based on the continuation of general growth rates. Assuming a regional growth rate of 2.5 percent annually, through traffic could be expected to increase by 81 percent over the 24 years until the year 2030 horizon assumed in this study. This increase would represent another 2,750 ADT through Colusa.

Various routes are used by through traffic today, and these routes will be supplemented by the new Railroad Collector- Farinon Road Collector. This analysis assumes that ¼ of the traffic increase would use each of Market Street, Fremont Street, Sioc Street and the new collector, or approximately 700 ADT on each route.

Proposed General Plan Update Traffic Volumes
Future evening (p.m.) peak hour traffic volumes were developed for study intersections in a manner similar to the methodology employed to create daily traffic volumes. However, because the directionality of p.m. peak hour trips generated by residential and non-residential land uses may differ, inbound/outbound trips between these uses were balanced separately. Projected traffic volumes at study intersections are included in the LOS calculation worksheets in the traffic study (see Appendix B).
The traffic study includes new roadways or extension of existing roadways indicated in the Land Use Diagram for the proposed General Plan (see Figure 4.3.1). The following road improvements are anticipated to occur with implementation of the proposed General Plan Update:
Farinon-Railroad Collector. The General Plan Circulation diagram indicates that the Farinon Road - Railroad - Collector will generally follow the alignment of the abandon railroad right of way from an intersection on SR 20 west of Will S Green Street to Westcott Road. The eastern portion of the route will follow Farinon Avenue as it links Westcott Road and SR 20 in eastern Colusa

East Side Collector. New development east of SR 20 will be served by a new collector that will extend north from the SR 20 / Sunrise Ave intersection to the extension of Market Street.

Will S Green Street extension. West side development will be served by creating a collector that links Wilson Avenue with SR 20 at the Will S Green intersection.
3rd Street, 5th Street and 8th Street Extensions. The existing downtown grid street system will be extended south into new growth areas.
Colus Avenue Extension. Colus Avenue will be extended easterly from Will S Green Street to 3rd Street.

Tenant Drive. Tenant Drive will be extended westerly from Wescott Road to Will S Green Street to serve new south Colusa development.
These proposed improvements would need to be included in a transportation program 1o attract funding. Funding may come from State and federal transportation funds, as well as development impact fees should the City choose to impose them. Since many of these improvements would occur within State Highways, the Calitornia Department of Transportation (Caltrans) would need to be involved.

4.3 TRANSPORTATION AND CIRCULATION

2030 Intersection Levels of Service

Future p.m. peak hour traffic volumes were developed for study intersections in a manner that is similar to methodology employed to create daily traffic volumes. However, because the directionality of p.m. peak hour trips generated by residential and non-residential land uses may differ, inbound / outbound trips between these uses were balanced separately. Projected traffic volumes at study intersections are included in the LOS calculation worksheets in the appendix. The traffic study assumed no improvements are made to existing intersections, except in the case of locations where new roadway extensions will be made. Where new roadways are added to intersections on SR 20, it is assumed that new mainline left turn and right turn lanes will be included.

IMPACTS AND MITIGATION MEASURES FOR THE PROPOSED GENERAL PLAN UPDATE
Increased Traffic Volumes on Local Roadways

Impact 4.3.1 Implementation of the proposed General Plan would result in increased traffic volumes and a decrease in LOS on area roadways. This is considered a significant impact.
Table 4.3-9 identifies Year 2030 (proposed General Plan buildout) daily traffic volumes on Colusa streets and resulting LOS, assuming implementation of the General Plan Circulation Diagram roadway extensions and new roadways, but no improvements to existing streets.

While the proposed General Plan would result in acceptable LOS on Lurline Avenue, Main Street, Market Street (SR 20) from the East Collector to 10th Street, Clay Street, Fremont Street from 10th Street to 11th Street, Wilson Avenue, Moonbend Road, Sunrise Avenue, Colus Avenue from Will S Green Avenue to 8ih Street, Tenant Drive, Railroad Collector, Will S Green Avenue from Colus Avenue to the Railroad Collector, 3rd Street, 5th Street, 8th Street, 13th Street from Clay Street to Fremmond Street, and the East Collector from Market Street to Fremont Street, certain roadway segments would exceed the LOS C threshold as identified below. Please note that impacts to State highways are discussed under Impact 4.3.2 below.

Proposed East Collector: Traffic volumes projected under proposed General Plan Update buildout conditions are indicative of LOS D conditions on the southern half of the new East Collector.

As described above, buildout of the proposed General Plan Update would result in increased traffic and unacceptable LOS on roadway segments throughout the area. It should be noted that these traffic conditions assume the buildout scenario set forth in the proposed General Plan Land Use Diagram would occur.
Proposed General Plan Policies and Implementation Programs that Mitigate Potential Impacts
Circulation Element

The Circulation Diagram in the Circulation Element designates areas of new roadways and improvements to existing roadways. In addition, the following policies and implementing actions would apply.

Policy CIR-1.1 The City shall ensure the maintenance of acceptable Levels of Service (LOS) on City streets and intersections when considering new development within Colusa.

Implementing Action CIR-1.1.a: Circulation/Streets Master Plan
The City will prepare, adopt and periodically update a Streets and Roadways Master Plan that establishes LOS C as the minimum acceptable LOS for City streets and intersections. If conditions of LOS D or worse are already present, future proposed projects may not cause roadway volumes to increase by five percent or more and shail be accompanied by other mitigation measures intended to reduce trip generation.
Implementing Action CIR-1.1.b: Development review
The City will conduct a review of each proposed development for potential traffic impacts. If the City determines that a development proposal requires a traffic impact study, the analysis

City of Colusa Colusa General Plan July 2007 Draft Master Environmental Impact Report 4.3-19

4.3 TRANSPORTATION AND CIRCULATION

shall be prepared consistent with the assumptions and methodology used for traffic projections made in this General Plan, consistent with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) process.

Policy CIR-1.3 The City shall maintain and upgrade existing streets to meet the needs of City residents, as well as construct new streets.
Implementing Action CIR-1.3a: Capital Improvement Program
The City will emphasize ongoing maintenance and upgrading of existing streets through its Capitai Improvements Program (CIP.) The City will adopt a CIP that includes the street and intersection improvements required to maintain safe streets consistent with the LOS standards set forth in the Circulation Element.

implementing Action CIR-1.3b: Development Impact Fees
The City will update Development Impact Fee Program. As new development occurs, projects will be charged their fair-share of development impact fees to offset the cost of needed roadway improvements to the City's circulation system.

Policy CIR-1.5 The City shall apply appropriate functional classifications and modern design standards in the construction of new roadways, and reconstruction of existing roadways in the City.
Implementing Action CIR-1.3.c: Development Review
The City's review of development proposals will determine the extent to which construction of roadway and intersection improvements will be required. During this process, related traffic studies, environmental review, and conformance with the Streets and Roadways Master Plan and the City's CIP will ensure that appropriate improvements to the City's roadway system are made.

Implementing Action CIR-1.5.a: Streets and Roadways Master Plan
As part of the Streets and Roadways Master Plan update process, the City will conduct a review of the City's roadway functional classifications and, as required, update roadway design standards pursuant to Caitrans' Traffic Manual and Highway Design Manua; as applicable develop streetscape design standards consistent with the Community Character and Design Element, and incorporate the standards into the City's supporting Public Works Improvement Standards.

Policies CIR-1.1 and CIR-1.5 commit the City to standards of service and design for its streets and roadways. Implementing Actions CIR-l.la and CIR-1.5.a ensure implementation of these standards through a Streets and Roadways Master Plan. Policy CIR-1.3 emphasizes the maintenance and upgrade of existing roadways to meet circulation needs. implementing Actions CIR-1.3.a and CIR-1.3.b provide mechanisms to implement such improvements, including impact fees to finance improvements. The development review process specified in Implementing Actions CIR-1.1.b and CI-1.3c would identify potential needs for street improvements resulting from projects, which can be subsequently incorporated in conditions of approval or as mitigation measures in environmental review documents. As part of the Development Review process under Implementing Action CIR-1.1b, the City would review development projects for conformance with the Circulation Map (see Figure 4.3-1) and condition projects to dedicate adequate right-of-way for the circulation system envisioned in Colusa General Plan City of Colusa Draft Master Environmental Impact Report July 2007 4.3-20

4.3 TRANSPORTATION AND CIRCULATION

the General Plan. However, these policies and implementing actions do not explicitly address potential LOS problems identified in the traffic impact study nor do they ensure that impacts associated with development projects processed prior to completion of the Streets and Roadways Master Plan, CIP, and development impact fee program will be addressed. This impact is potentially significant.
Additional Mitigation Measures

MM 4.3.1a Project applications considered prior to adoption of the Streets and Roadways Master Plan, the Capital Improvement Program update, and the Development Impact Fee Program update, shall provide for the necessary infrastructure improvements, as determined to be feasible by the City, necessary to mitigate their fair-share of significant traffic impacts identified in this MEIR. This shall occur either through payment of a fair-share percentage of the total cost for the necessary improvement as approved by the City or through construction of the necessary improvement, whichever approach is determined to be appropriate by the City. Fair-share calculation shall be determined based on the amount of traffic associated with an individual project on an impacted facility a percentage of the total new traffic projected over the time horizon anticipated for the Capital Improvement Program, or other time horizon acceptable to the City.
Implementation of the above mitigation measure would ensure that subsequent projects mitigate their fair-share of identified traffic impacts, to the extent feasible, during the time period when the Streets and Roadways Master Plan, the Capital Improvement Program update, and the Development Impact Fee Program update have not yet been adopted.
Fremont Street

MM 4.3.1b Transportation improvements considered as part of the Capital Improvement Program required under Implementing Action CIR-1.3a: Capital Improvement Program shall include measures to provide acceptable LOS- on Fremont Street. These measures may include, but are not limited to the following:
Widen Fremont Street to a four-lane facility from 10th Street to Bridge Street

Modify the Circulation Diagram to promote other east-west routes such as Sunrise Boulevard and the Railroad Collector
Create a one-way couplet of Fremont Street and Sioc Street
To deliver LOS C on Fremont Street, it would be necessary to prohibit on-street parking and stripe the street as a four lane facility. Alternatively development of additional east - west capacity, such as through a modified railroad Collector or the extension of Sunrise Boulevard west to Wescott Road could reduce the volume on Fremont Street. Because both Fremont Street and Sioc Street are affected by future traffic, creation of a one-way couplet would increase the capacity of each street and deliver LOS C while retaining two lanes of travel and on-street parking on Fremont Street.

4.3 TRANSPORTATION AND CIRCULATION

Sioc Street

MM 4.3.1c Transportation improvements considered as part of the Capital Improvement Program required under Implementing Action CIR-1.3a: Capital Improvement Program shall include measures to provide acceptable LOS on Sioc Street. These measures may include, but are not limited to the following:
Widen Sioc Street to a four-lane facility from 10th Street to Bridge Street
Modify the Circulation Diagram to promote other east-west routes such as Sunrise Boulevard and the Railroad Collector

Create a one-way couplet of Fremont Street and Sioc Street
To deliver LOS C on Sioc Street, it would be necessary to prohibit on-street parking and stripe the street as a four lane facility. Alternatively, development of additional east - west capacity, such as through a modified railroad Collector or the extension of Sunrise Boulevard west to Wescott Road could reduce the volume on Sioc Street. Because both Fremont Street and Sioc Street are both affected by future traffic, creation of a one-way couplet would increase the capacity of each street while retaining two lanes of travel and on-street parking on Fremont Street.
Colus Avenue

MM 4.3.1d Transportation improvements considered as part of the Capital Improvement Program required under Implementing Action CIR-1.3a: Capital Improvement Program shall include measures to provide acceptable LOS on Colus Avenue. These measures may include, but are not limited to the following:

• Configure Colus Avenue without on-street parking and stripe turn lanes
Modify the Circulation Diagram to promote other east-west routes such as Sunrise Boulevard and the Railroad Collector
The volume of traffic expected on this segment of Colus Avenue will exceed the LOS C threshold for a collector street. To deliver LOS C it would be necessary to prohibit on-street parking and stripe the street with left turn lanes at major intersection. Alternatively, the volume on Colus Avenue could be reduced by development of additional east-west capacity elsewhere. Changing the alignment of the Railroad Collector or extending Sunrise Boulevard to Wescott Road would incrementally alter travels patterns in this area.

Farinon Road Extension

MM 4.3.1e Transportation improvements considered as part of the Capital Improvement Program required under Implementing Action CIR-1.3a: Capital Improvement Program shall include measures to provide acceptable LOS on the Farinon Road Extension. These measures may include, but are not limited to the following:

Widen Farinon Road to a four-lane arterial street

d Modify the GPU Circulation Diagram to promote other east-west streets, such as Sunrise Boulevard

Colusa General Plan City of Colusa Draft Master Environmental Impact Report July 2007 4.3-22

4.3 TRANSPORTATION AND CIRCULATION

To deliver LOS C on Farinon Road, it would be necessary to widen the roadway to 4 lanes. Alternatively, modifying the circulation plan to extend Sunrise Boulevard west to Wescott Road could reduce the volume on Farinon Road to a level that may be accommodated by a collector street, although the effect on Wescott Road traffic is undetermined.
Wescott Road between Cynthia Avenue and the Railroad Collector

MM 4.3.1f Transportation improvements considered as part of the Capital Improvement Program required under Implementing Action CIR-1.3a: Capital Improvement Program shall include measures to provide acceptable LOS on Wescott Road between the Cynthia Avenue and the Railroad Collector. These measures may include, but are not limited to the following:
Re-designate Wescott Road as a two-lane arterial street in this area and re-construct accordingly.
Modify Circulation Diagram to reduce traffic volume on Wescott Road by extending Sunrise Boulevard to Wescott Road and prohibiting northbound traffic on Wescott at Tenant Drive.
Improving Wescott Road between Cynthia Avenue and the Railroad Collector to a two-lane areterial street would deliver LOS C. This would require acquisition of right-of-way through single-family and multifamily residential area and may not be economically feasible. Implementation of the proposed General Plan policies and action items would ensure that potential impacts of future projects are identified, but would not require that adequate improvements be made to roadways to achieve the LOS C standard.
Will S Green Avenue

MM 4.3.1g Transportation improvements considered as part of the Capital Improvement Program required under Implementing Action CIR-1.3a: Capital Improvement Program shall include measures to provide acceptable LOS on Will Green Avenue. These measures may include, but are not limited to the following:
Add auxiliary lanes to the segments of Will S Green Avenue north and south of SR 20 and to the SR 20/Will S Green intersection to include separate right turn, through, and left turn lanes approaching SR 20.
Re-designate the portion of Will S Green immediately north and south of SR 20 as a four lane arterial street.
The addition of auxiliary lanes on Will S Green Avenue in the area between Colus Avenue and the SR 20 Will S Green Avenue intersection and to the northern leg of the intersection (i.e., separate right turn, through, and left turn lanes approaching SR 20) would deliver LOS C. Alternatively, this portion of the road could be re-designated as a four-lane arterial in the Circulation Element.

Proposed East Collector

MM 4.3.1h Transportation improvements considered as part of the Capital Improvement Program required under Implementing Action CIR-1.3a: Capital Improvement Program shall include measures to provide acceptable LOS on the Proposed
City of Colusa Colusa General Plan July 2007 Draft Master Environmental Impact Report 4.3-23

4.3 TRANSPORTATION AND CIRCULATION

East Collector. These measures may include, but are not limited to the following:

Re-designate the East Collector as an arterial street and construct accordingly as development occurs.
Designation of the proposed East Collector as a two-lane arterial and improvement of the road to arterial standards would deliver LOS C.
Implementation of mitigation measure MM 4.3.1a would reduce potential impacts associated with development considered prior to adoption of the Street and Roadways Master Plan and prior to the updates to the CIP and development impact fee programs. However, due to right- of-way constraints for some improvements, such as portions of Wescott Road, some improvements may be determined to not be feasible by the City. While implementation of the improvements identified in mitigation measures MM 4.3.1b through MM 4.3.1i would result in acceptable LOS as identified above, the timing of the adoption of the Capital Improvement Program is unknown, no funding has been identified for these improvements and the schedule for these improvements is unknown. Individual development projects would mitigate specitic impacts associated with the project as required under proposed Implementing Action CIR-1.1.b: Development review. However, the lack of a Capital Improvement Program and development impact fee program to address traffic impacts associated with buildout of the General Plan, which may be less than significant for individual development projects but result in significant impacts when buildout of the General Plan is considered, would result in residual significant impacts. Therefore, impacts to roadways would be considered significant and unavoidable.
State Highways

Impact 4.3.2 Implementation of the proposed General Plan would result in increased traffic volumes and a decrease in LOS on state highways (SR 20 and SR 45). This is considered a significant impact.
Table 4.3-9 identifies Year 2030 daily traffic volumes on the state highways traversing the proposed Plannina Area and resulting LOS, assuming implementation of the General Plan Circulation Diagram but no improvements to existing streets. Key impacts identified from this data are summarized below:

SR 20 segments within the proposed Planning Area: Traffic volumes projected under proposed General Plan Update buildout conditions on SR 20 within the Planning Area are indicative of LOS in excess of minimum thresholds. The volume of traffic forecast for SR 20 through Colusa would exceed the LOS D threshold for a two-lane arterial. In addition, the volume of traffic forecast on western SR 20 through the new commercial area would approach or exceed the LOS D threshold for a four-lane facility. Depending on the existing basis employed for the analysis (either Caltrans or traffic impact study figures), the volume of traffic on Market Street (SR 20) from Bridge Street to 5ih Street could exceed the LOS D threshold. If current Caltrans AADT is assumed, then LOS E conditions would be expected in this area.

0 SR 45 north of Market Street: Traffic volumes projected under proposed General Plan Update buildout conditions on SR 45 north of Market Street are indicative of LOS F.
SR 20 east and west of the proposed Planning Area: Traffic volumes projected under proposed General Plan Update buildout conditions on SR 20 east and west of the

Green Avenue intersection, and to potentially redesign the Bridge Street/Market Street intersection. In addition, the City will cooperate with Colusa County and Caltrans in the redesign of the SR 45/Thirteenth Street and Lurline Avenue/SR 45 intersections, and any other intersections or roadway segments where improvements are necessary to ensure public safety.
As previously discussed under Impact 4.3.1, Policies CIR-1.1 and CIR-1.5 commit the City to standards of service and design for its streets and roadways. Implementing Actions CIR-1.1a and CIR-1.5.a ensure implementation of these standards through a Streets and Roadways Master Plan. Policy CIR-1.3 emphasizes the maintenance and upgrade of existing to meet circulation needs. Implementing Actions CIR-1.3.a and CIR-1.3.b provide mechanisms to implement such improvements, including impact fees to finance improvements. The development review process specified in Implementing Actions CIR-1.1.b and Cl-1.3c would identify potential needs for street improvements resulting from projects, which can be subsequently incorporated in conditions of approval or as mitigation measures in environmental review documents. Since the streets in this impact discussion are part of the State Highway system maintained by Caltrans, the City would need to work with Caltrans on improvements. Policy CIR-4.1 and Implementing Action CIR-1.4.a would require the City to cooperate with Caltrans in making any necessary improvements on streets that are part of SR 20 and SR 45. Implementing Action CIR-1.1.b would identify impacts of development projects on State highways, and provide an avenue for Caltrans to suggest mitigation measures for any adverse impacts on its facilities. However, these policies and implementing actions do not explicitly address potential LOS problems identified in the traffic impact study nor do they ensure that impacts associated with development projects

Additional Mitigation Measures

SR 20 Segments within the Proposed Planning Area

MM 4.3.2a Transportation improvements considered as part of the Capital Improvement Program required under Implementing Action CIR-1.3a: Capital Improvement Program shall include measures to provide acceptable LOS on SR 20 segments to the extent feasible. These measures may include, but are not limited to the following:
Widen SR 20 to a four-lane facility on 10th Street, Market Street and Bridge Street

Widen SR 20 to a six-lane facility through the new eastern commercial area.

Modify the Rairoad Collector alignment to draw more traffic away from SR 20 through Wheatland
Develop an access management plan for SR 20 that denotes the tocations of auxiliary lanes.

MM 4.3.2b The City shall investigate mechanisms for future development to participate in a "fair share" in the costs of improving roads outside the City limits, specifically segments of SR 20 and SR 45 that would be impacted by development under the proposed General Plan. Also, the City shall coordinate coordination with Caltrans, and other interested agencies such as Colusa County and the City of Williams, to evelop a fair-share mechanism to address impacts of new development to the State highway system.
Improving SR 20 to a four-lane facility would deliver LOS D, except in the commercial area where in traffic volumes are anticipated to approach or exceed the LOS D threshold. Improving SR 20 to six-lane facility in the new commercial area would deliver LOS D. Widening SR 20 to a four lane facility should be possible in new growth areas. However, existing development may constrain the widening of SR 20 to a four-lane facility along the 10th Street corridor from Market Street south to the fairgrounds and on the Bridge Street corridor from Market Street south to Wescott Avenue. While creating a six-lane section through the new commercial areas would theoretically deliver LOS D or better conditions, this level of improvement may not be feasible due to the cost of the improvement. This impact may be better mitigated by adding auxiliary turn lanes at major intersections. In order to determine specific improvements and prioritize those improvements, an SR 20 access management plan would provide a long-term plan coordinated between the appropriate agencies to ensure impacts are mitigated to the extent feasible.

SR 45

MM 4.3.2c Transportation improvements considered as part of the Capital Improvement Program required under Implementing Action CIR-1.3a: Capital Improvement Program shall include measures to provide acceptable LOS on SR 45 to the extent feasible. These measures may include, but are not limited to the following:

Re-designate SR 45 north of Market Street as a four-lane arterial and widen SR 45 north of Market Street to four lanes.
Widening SR 45 north of Market Street to four lanes would deliver LOS C. Implementation of mitigation measure MM 4.3.2b

SR 20 Segments East and West of the Proposed Planning Area
Implementation of mitigation measure MM 4.3.2b would assist in mitigating the City's fair-share of impacts to SR 20 outside the City of Colusa.
Given the status of the improvement projects identified by Caltrans and the information available at this time, the is City has concluded that there is currently insufficient information and certainty on which to base a feasible and viable mitigation measure to fully address the General Plan Update's impact on SR 20 and SR 45. The necessary improvements are not approved nor are they funded. There is no fee or other funding mechanism currently in place for future funding. Subsequent development projects would be reviewed consistent with CEQA requirements and appropriate mitigation determined for each project. At this time, the City cannot determine the specific improvements that would be implemented nor the cost of the necessary improvements and thus cannot determine fair-share contributions for future development projects that would satisfy the legal requirements for fee-based mitigation under both CEQA (see CEQA GUidelines 15126.4) and constitutional principles that call for a nexus and rough proportionality between a project's impacts and the fee-based mitigation measure.
Implementation of mitigation measures MM 4.3.2a and 4.3.2c would assist in reducing impacts to segments of SR 20 and SR 45 within the City. Mitigation measure MM 4.3.2b commits the City to coordinate with Caltrans to develop an SR 20 access management plan and to consult with Caltrans regarding appropriate fair-share contributions for subsequent development projects. However, as the CIP has not yet been developed, specific improvements to be included in the CIP and funding sources for necessary improvements are unknown. Improvements to be undertaken by Caltrans for SR 20 and SR 45 are unknown. Therefore, while these mitigation measures would assist in reducing the impacts to SR 20 and SR 45, the impacts would not be reduced to less than significant.
Finally, the prospects of the proposed state route improvements ever being constructed remains uncertain due to funding priorities and on-going policy developments that may favor other approaches to addressing state route congestion. Consequently, the City has been unable to identify any feasible mitigation measures imposable on this project that could reduce or avoid the impact of the Project on the SR 20 and SR 45 to a less than significant level. The California Environmental Quality Act (Pub. Resources Code, §21000 et seq.) defines "feasibie" for these purposes as capable of being accomplished in a successful manner within a reasonable period of time, taking into account economic, environmental, social, and technological factors (Pub.

Resources Code, § 21061.1). Therefore, the impacts of the proposed General Plan Update on SR 20 and SR 45 facilities would remain a significant and unavoidable impact.

Intersections

Impact 4.3.3 Implementation of the proposed General Plan would result in increased traffic volumes and a decrease in LOS at street and roadway intersections. This is considered a signific ant impact.
An increase in traffic volumes may degrade LOS at intersections, due to longer delays in passing through them. Table 4.3-10 presents evening peak hour LOS at study intersections (compare with Table 4.3-5). These results assume that no improvements are made to existing intersections. Where new roadways are added to intersections on SR 20, it is assumed that new mainline left turn and right turn lanes will be included.

Implementing Action CIRC-l.1a would identify the level of improvements occurring at these locations, potential improvements that may deliver LOS C are noted.
SR 20/Sunrise Boulevard: Under proposed General Plan Update buildout conditions, this intersection is projected to operate at LOS F. Projected conditions at this intersection would exceed the minimum LOS standard and traffic signal warrants would be met.
SR 20/Wescoft Road: Under proposed General Plan Update buildout conditions, this intersection is projected to operate at LOS F. Projected conditions at this intersection would exceed the minimum LOS standard and traffic signal warrants would be met.
SR 20/Sioc Street: Under proposed General Plan Update buildout conditions, this intersection is projected to operate at LOS F. Projected conditions at this intersection would exceed the minimum LOS standard.

Bridge Street (SR 20)/Market Street: Under proposed General Plan Update buildout conditions, this intersection is projected to operate at LOS F. Projected conditions at this intersection would exceed the minimum LOS standard and traffic signal warrants would be met.

Market Street/5th Street: Under proposed General Plan Update buildout conditions, this intersection is projected to operate at LOS D. Projected conditions at this intersection would exceed the minimum LOS standard and traffic signal warrants would be met.
Lurline Avenue/13th Street and 13th Street/Market Street: Under proposed General Plan Update buildout conditions, these intersections are projected to operate at LOS E-F. Projected conditions at these intersections would exceed the minimum standard.
10th Street/Market Street intersection: Under proposed General Plan Update buildout conditions, this intersection is projected to operate at LOS F. Projected conditions at this intersection would exceed the minimum LOS standard, and traffic signal warrants would be met.

10th Street (SR 20)/Fremont Street Intersection: Under proposed General Plan Update buildout conditions, this intersection is projected to operate at LOS F. Projected conditions at this intersection would exceed the minimum LOS standard and traffic signal warrants would be met.

SR 20/Will S. Green Avenue: Under proposed General Plan Update buildout conditions, this intersection is projected to operate at LOS F. Projected conditions at this intersection would exceed the minimum LOS standard and a traffic signal would be warranted.
The evaluation of key intersections has noted several locations where traffic signals would be needed in order to deliver LOS C conditions. It is also possible signalization of additional intersections may be needed based on the daily traffic volume warrant thresholds contained in the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices. However, specific information for future development projects, such as access points, is not known at this time. As described below, traffic impacts, including identification of the need for signalization and intersection improvements, specific to individual development projects would be determined as part of the Development Review process identified in Implementing Action CIR-1.1b below.

Policy CIR-1.4 (see Impact 4.3.2)
Implementing Action CIR-1.4.a: Interagency cooperation (see Impact 4.3.2)
Policies CIR-1.1 and CIR-1.5 commit the City to standards of service and design for its streets and roadways. Implementing Actions CIR-1.1a and CIR-1.5.a ensure implementation of these standards through a Streets and Roadways Master Plan. Policy CIR-1.3 emphasizes the maintenance and upgrade of existing roadways to meet circulation needs. Implementing Actions CIR-1.3.a and CIR-1.3.b provide mechanisms to implement such improvements, including impact fees to finance improvements. The development review process specified in Implementing Actions CIR-1.1.b and CI-1.3c would identify potential needs for intersection improvements resulting from projects, which can be subsequently incorporated in conditions of approval or as mitigation measures in environmental review documents. Policy CIR-4.1 and Implementing Action CIR-1.4.a would require the City to cooperate with Caltrans in making any necessary improvements on intersections that are part of SR 20 and SR 45. Implementing Action CIR-1.1.b would identify impacts of development projects on intersections, which can be subsequently incorporated in conditions of approval or as mitigation measures in environmental review documents. This action also would provide an avenue for Caltrans to suggest mitigation measures for any adverse impacts on its facilities. However, these policies and implementing actions do not explicitly address potential LOS problems identified in the traffic impact study nor do they ensure that impacts associated with development projects processed prior to completion of the Streets and Roadways Master Plan, CIP, and development impact fee program will be addressed. This impact is potentially significant.

Signalization of the SR 20/Wescott Road intersection along with widening of SR 20 to a four-lane section and providing separate left turn lanes would result in LOS C discussion under Impact 4.3.1, widening of SR 20 north of operations. As noted in the
this intersection may not be feasible. If this is not feasible, signalization of the intersection along with creation of a northbound left turn lane and a separate southbound right turn lane (with overlap) on SR 20, and separate left turn and right turn lanes on the Wescott Road approach, would resuit in acceptable operations at this intersection. Alternatively, installation of a roundabout at this intersection would yield acceptable operations.

Therefore, impacts to intersections would be considered significant and unavoidable.
Roadway Safety

Impact 4.3.4 Implementation of the proposed General Plan would result in an increase in traffic volumes, which likely would increase potential safety hazards. This impact is considered significant.
While implementation of the proposed General Plan would increase the amount of vehicle traffic and the number of potential safety and emergency access conflicts, implementation of the proposed roadway system under the General Plan would provide for multiple roadway connections that offer more escape route and emergency access options, as well as new north- south and east-west evacuation/emergency routes throughout the Planning Area. Implementation of the proposed roadway system within the General Plan would improve city roadway connectivity, allowing for better emergency vehicle access to residences as well as evacuation routes for area residents, thus this impact is considered less than significant. In addition, modern construction design standards would also result in the provision of facilities without unacceptable safety conflicts.

Implementation of the proposed General Plan would increase the amount of land developed for residences, thereby increasing the local population and vehicle traffic. Also, the proposed General Plan would accommodate an increase in commercial and industrial development. All of these factors would increase the demand for parking. Of particular concern is parking availability in the downtown area. According to the existing General Plan, utilization of parking spaces in the downtown area was near capacity. Since the existing General Plan was adopted in 1994, the parking situation in downtown may have become worse. Currently, the City is working on a parking study to determine current conditions, but that study is not yet complete.

4.3 TRANSPORTATION AND CIRCULATION

As part of the Public Works Improvement Standards update, the City will incorporate sidewalk design criteria to increase pedestrian safety, use and aesthetics, including the following principles:

Maintain ample sidewaik widths in residential areas and in commercial areas as identified in the City's Public Works Improvement Standards.
Consider use of decorative concrete, stamps and other aesthetic treatments for sidewalks in commercial locations or areas used for public gathering.
Include streetscape amenities with sidewalks, such as street trees, landscape planters, and benches.

Provide adequate and aesthetically pleasing lighting of sidewalks to improve safety and encourage evening use by City residents.
impiementing Action CIR-5.1.b: Capital Improvement Program
The City will identify needed sidewalk improvements in the CIP, along with potential funding sources, to ensure pedestrian access is maintained. This would include curb cuts to improve access for disable persons.
Implementing Action CIR-5.1.c: Development Review
As part of the development review process, future subdivision design will be required to provide pedestrian circulation and connectivity into established areas of the City by providing sidewalks and pedestrian pathways, as appropriate, in accordance with City standards.

4.3 TRANSPORTATION AND CIRCULATION

Policy CCD-3.11 As existing areas redevelop and change over time, improved connections for vehicular, bicycle and pedestrian access shall be considered as part of the overall street design.
Policy CCD-3.12 Neighborhoods shall be designed so that daily shopping errands can generally be completed within easy walking or biking distance to businesses and services.

Policy CCD-3.13 Schools shall be geographically sited to maximize the number of students that can walk or travel by bicycle.
Policy CCD-16.3 New employment centers shall be designed to provide safe and convenient pedestrian and bicycle access.
Policies CIR-4.1 and CIR-4.3 intend to encourage bicycle transportation through the provision of additional facilities, including bike lanes and parking. Provisions would be made through Implementing Actions CIR-4.1.a and CIR-4.3.a, which require a Bike Master Plan that guides future development of the City's bicycle system and identifies funding sources. Implementing Action CIR-4.1.b would allow the City to require project applicants to install bike facilities, if legitimate connection can be made between project impacts and the need for such facilities. Policies CCD-3.5, CCD-3.6, CCD-3.11 and CCD-3.16 also encourage the provision of bike facilities. Policy CIR-4.2, with its accompanying implementing actions, encourages bike transportation mainly through making bike trips safer, and therefore more appealing to potential bicyclists, as does CCD-3.13. Policy CIR-5.1 and its accompanying implementing actions encourage pedestrian circulation through the provision of new facilities. Policies CCD-3.3, CCD- 3.4, CCD-3.6, CCD-3.7, CCD-3.11 and CCD-16.3 have a similar objective of promoting pedestrian circulation through providing sidewalks, pedestrian connectivity between areas, and designing development in a manner that promotes pedestrian and bicyclist activities. Policies CCD-3.8, CCD-3.12 and CCD-3.13 encourage pedestrian travel by attempting to make such travel more convenient. Implementation of the above General Plan policies and implementing actions would provide adequate facilities for bicyclists and pedestrians, thereby reducing potential impacts of the additional demand on bicycle and pedestrian facilities. Impacts would be less than significant.
Additional Mitigation Measures

None required.
Colusa County Airport

Impact 4.3.8 implementation of the proposed General Plan Update may result in potential conflicts with operations at Colusa County Airport, and potential exposure to hazards associated with airport operations. This is considered a less than significant impact.
The Colusa County Airport could experience an increase in air traffic as a result of General Plan implementation. This may result from increased economic activity due to industrial development and more private aircraft. However, it is not expected that growth resulting from the proposed General Plan Update would provide an adequate market for scheduled passenger air service, which would be a major source of air traffic. Substantial expansion of the airport or its operations is not anticipated.

portions of the proposed Planning Area, some of which are designated for residential development. Residential development within a CLUP is subject to a potential accident hazard from arriving or departing aircraft. As discussed in Section 4.1, Land Use and Agricultural Resources, the proposed Land Use Diagram designates residential creas within the zone, and future development may not meet the compatibility criteria set forth in overflight
the airport's CLUP. Moreover, adjacent residential development may hinder airport operations, as residents may complain about noise from air traffic.

Policy CIR-8.1 The City shall work cooperatively with Colusa County and the Airport Land Use Commission to ensure continued airport operations in a safe and cost- effective manner, consistent with the public's needs and Federal Aviation Authority regulations.
implementing Action CIR-8.1.a: Interagency Coordination
The City will continue to provide notice to the Colusa County Planning Department and the Airport Land Use Commission for all projects falling within the airport influence area as defined by the Airport Land Use Plan. The City will also provide input into the Comprehensive Airport Land Use Plan Update project through active participation in future planning efforts. In addition, the City will work with Coiusa County and the Airport Land Use Commission to establish a formai tiaison and communication methodology for all communications with the Committee.
Policy CIR-8.2 The City shall work with Colusa County and the Airport Land Use Commission TO ensure that new development within the Colusa County Airport Safety Zone is compatible with existing airport operations, and that any changes or improvements to the airport facility or operations are compatible with land uses within this zone.

Implementing Action CIR-8.2.a: Interagency Coordination
The City will integrate the standards and operational thresholds of the airport into future design review criteria to address concerns regarding noise, safety and hazards.
Policies CIR-8.1 and CIR-8.2 intend to keep operations at the Colusa County Airport viable and potentially allow for expansion of these services. This would be accomplished by ensuring the compatibility of adjacent land uses with airport operations, as sought by Implementing Actions CIR-8.1.a and CIR-8.2.a. Compatibility, as defined by the Airport Land Use Plan, would consider factors such as noise exposure and potential safety hazards associated with aircraft takeoffs and landings. By only allowing compatible land uses near the airport, the City can ensure that there would be relatively little pressure for restriction or closure of airport operations. Implementation of the above General Plan policies and implementing actions would reduce potential impacts on airport transportation and facilities to a less than signiticant level.
Additional Mitigation Measures

None required.

4.4 NOISE

This section discusses potential impacts of implementation of the proposed General Plan Update associated with noise. It analyzes the ambient noise characteristics of the proposed Planning Area, including the identification of major noise sources. Key issues addressed in this section include: exposure of noise-sensitive land uses to excessive noise levels, construction noise exposure, airport noise exposure, and increases in traffic noise. The information provided in this section is based a noise analysis performed by Bollard Acoustical Consultants, Inc. Noise model output is provided Appendix C of this document.
4.4.1 EXISTING SETTING

BACKGROUND AND TERMINOLOGY

Noise is often described as unwanted sound. Sound is defined as any pressure variation in air that the human ear can detect. If the pressure variations occur frequently enough, they can be heard and hence are called sound. The number of pressure variations per second is called the frequency of sound, and is expressed as cycles per second, called Hertz (Hz).
Measuring sound directly in terms of pressure would require a very large and awkward range of numbers. To avoid this, the decibel (dB) scale was devised. The decibel scale uses the hearing threshold (20 micropascals of pressure), as a point of reference, defined as 0 dB. Other sound pressures are then compared to the reference pressure, and the logarithm is taken to keep the numbers is a practical range. Another useful aspect of the decibel scale is that changes in decibel levels correspond closely to human perception of relative loudness. Table 4.4-1 shows examples of noise levels for several common noise sources and environments.

4.4 NOISE

The perceived loudness of sounds is dependent upon many factors, including sound pressure level and frequency content. However, within the usual range of environmental noise levels, perception of loudness is relatively predictable, and can be approximated by weighing the frequency response of a sound level meter by means of the standardized A-weighing network. There is a strong correlation between A-weighted sound levels (expressed as dBA) and community response to noise. For this reason, the A-weighted sound level has become the standard tool of environmental noise assessment. All noise levels reported in this section are in terms of A-weighted levels in decibels. Table 4.4-1 illustrates noise levels in A-weighted decibels.
is Community noise is commonly described in terms of the "ambient" noise level, which is defined as the all-encompassing noise level associated with a given noise environment. A common statistical tool to measure the ambient noise level is the average, or equivalent, sound level (Leq) over a given time period, usually one hour. The Leq the foundation of the Day-Night Average Level noise descriptor (Ldn) and shows very good correlation with community response to noise. The Day-Night Average Level is based upon the average noise level over a 24-hour day, with a +10 decibel weighting applied to noise occurring during nighttime hours (10:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.). The nighttime penalty is based upon the assumption that people react to nighttime noise exposures as though they were twice as loud as daytime exposures. Because Ldn represents a 24-hour average, it tends to disguise short-term variations in the noise environment.
EFFECTS OF NOISE ON PEOPLE
Noise in the community has been cited as being a health problem, not in terms of actual physiological damages such as hearing impairment, but in terms of inhibiting general well-being and contributing to undue stress and annoyance. The health arise from interference with human activities such effects of noise in the community as sleep, speech, recreation and tasks demanding concentration or coordination. When community noise interferes with human activities or contributes to stress, public annoyance with the noise source increases, and the acceptability of the environment for people decreases. This decrease in acceptability and the threat to public well-being are the bases for policies preventing exposures to excessive community noise levels.
To controi noise from fixed sources which have developed from processes other than zoning or land use planning, many jurisdictions have adopted community noise control ordinances. Such ordinances are intended to abate noise nuisances and to control noise from existing sources. They may also be used as performance standards to judge the creation of a potential nuisance, or potential encroachment of sensitive uses upon noise-producing facilities. Community noise control ordinances are generally designed to resolve noise problems on a short-term basis (usually by means of hourly noise level criteria), rather than on the basis of 24-hour or annual cumulative noise exposures.
In addition to the A-weighted noise level, other factors should be considered in establishing criteria for noise sensitive land uses. Sounds with noticeable tonal content may be more annoying than the A-weighted sound level alone suggests. Examples include whistles, horns, droning or high-pitched sounds. Many noise standards apply a penalty, or correction, or 5 dBA 5 to such sounds. The effects of unusual tonal content are generally more of a concern at nighttime, when residents may notice the sound in contrast to low levels of background noise.
Because many rural residential areas experience very low noise levels, residents may express concern about the loss of *peace and quiet" due to the introduction of a sound which was not audible previously. In very quiet environments, the introduction of virtually any change in local activities will cause an increase in noise levels. A change in noise level and the loss of "peace and quiet" is the inevitable result of land use or activity changes in such areas. Audibility of a

new noise source and/or increases in noise levels within recognized acceptable limits are not usually considered to be significant noise impacts, but these concerns should be addressed and considered in the planning and environmental review processes.
EXISTING CONDITIONS IN THE PROPOSED PLANNING AREA
The major noise sources in the proposed Planning Area consist of State Routes 20 and 45 and local traffic on streets, commercial and industrial uses, airport operations, active recreation of parks and outdoor play areas of schools. Each of these noise sources is discussed is individually below.

Transportation Noise Sources
Table 4.4-2 shows existing traffic volumes and noise levels for the major roadways located within City of Colusa. The distances from the centerlines of the major roadways to the 60 and 65 dB Ldn noise contours are also summarized in Table 4.4-2. It is recognized that vehicle speeds vary on the highways in the Cily, and the modeling effort attempted to account for such variationi. The contour distances should also be considered conservative in that they do not account for local topographic shielding.

Airport

Aircraft noise affecting the City is produced by operations occurring at the Colusa County Airport. The Colusa County Airport is located on SR 20, south of the City of Colusa and within the City of Colusa Planning Area. It is recognized that the airport is a noise generator by virtue of airport activity, as well as agricultural and airport-related businesses. The greatest potential for sound intrusion occurs when aircraft land, take off or run up their engines while on the ground. The sounds associated with general aviation propeller aircraft are propellers and secondarily from the engine and exhaust. produced primarily by the

The most recent noise contours for the Colusa County Airport were prepared as part of the 1995 Airport Land Use Plan (ALUP) produced by the Colusa County Airport Land Use Commission. This report identifies the various types of land uses and their compatibility with airport noise. Residential uses, such as single family homes, duplexes, multifamily units, group quarters and rooming houses and mobile home parks are considered to be incompatible with airport land Uses within the 55 dB CNEL and above noise contours according to the ALUP. While the ALUP defines residential uses incompatible in areas at or above 55 dB CNEL, it does not indicate where this noise contour line exists within the City. However, the 2015 Noise Exposure Map produced by the Colusa County Airport establishes a 55 dB CNEL noise contour. The southern portion of the proposed Planning Area, which includes residential land uses, is within the airport 55 dB CNEL noise contour. Figure 4.4-1 identifies the Colusa County Airport noise contours as they relate to the proposed Planning Area. These contours represent an average of all noise levels expected during a normal 24-hour day, adjusted to an equivalent level that accounts for the greater intrusiveness of evening and nighttime noise.
Non-Transportation Noise Sources
The production of noise is a result of many processes and activities, even when best available noise control technology is applied. Noise exposures within industrial facilities are controlled by Federal and State employee health and safety regulations, but exterior noise levels may exceed locally acceptable standards. Commercial, recreational and public service facility activities can also produce noise which affects adjacent sensitive land uses.

4.4 NOISE

From a land use planning perspective, fixed-source noise control issues focus upon two goals: to prevent the introduction of new noise-producing uses in noise-sensitive areas, and to prevent encroachment of noise-sensitive land uses upon existing noise facilities. The first goal can be achieved by applying noise performance standards to proposed new noise-producing uses. The second goal can be met by requiring that new noise-sensitive uses in proximity to noise- producing facilities include mitigation measures to ensure compliance with those noise performance standards.

Industrial Uses

Various industrial uses are located within the proposed Planning Area. These uses consist primarily of processing and storage of agricultural products and production of building materials. The majority of the industrial uses are located at the Colusa County Industrial Park, located west of the Colusa County Airport. Noise generation from these uses varies greatly depending on the time of year and level of activity of these uses. Industrial equipment in the industrial park was measured to generate noise levels of 73 a dB at a distance of 250 feet at one of the industrial uses. Figure 4.4-1 shows the estimated 45 dB Leq noise contour for the Colusa County Industrial Park. The estimated noise contour should only be used for planning purposes to require a noise study for encroaching uses.
General Service Commercial and Light Industrial Uses
Noise sources associated with service commercial uses are found at various locations within the City of Colusa. Such uses include automotive repair facilities, wrecking yards, tire installation centers, car washes, and loading docks among others. The noise emissions of these service commercial uses are dependent on many factors, and are therefore difficult to quantify precisely. Nonetheless, noise generated by these uses contributes to the ambient noise environment in the immediate vicinity of these uses. They should be considered whenever new noise-sensitive uses are proposed nearby, or whenever similar uses are proposed in existing residential areas.

Parks and School Playing Fields
There are several park and school land uses that are spread throughout the City. Noise generated by these uses depends on the age and number of people utilizing the respective facility at a given time, and the types of activities they are engaged in. School playing field activities tend to generate more noise than those of neighborhood parks, as the intensity of school playground usage tends to be higher. At a distance of 100 feet from an elementary school playground being used by 100 students, average and maximum noise levels of 60 and 75 dB, respectively, can be expected. At organized events such as high school football games, with large crowds and public address systems, the noise generation is often significantly higher. Noise levels from high school football games have been measured to be in the range of 60-65 dB Leq at a distance of 500 feet from the center of the football stadium. As with service commercial uses, the noise generation of parks and school playing fields is variable.

4.4 NOISE

COMMUNITY NOISE SURVEY
To quantify existing noise levels in and around the proposed Planning Area, a community noise survey was performed at 10 locations (Figure 4.4-2). The results of the community noise survey are provided in Table 4.4-3. The results of the ambient noise survey vary greatly, depending on proximity to the major arterial roadways and proximity to industrial uses. The following is a brief summary of the noise measurement results for each of the sites.

• Sites 1-3 and 5-6 are typical of rural areas with little or no significant noise exposure.
Site 4 indicated elevated noise levels resulting from close proximity to a major industrial Use.

Site 7 is typical of a small town commercial area with moderate levels of traffic and commercial activity,
Sites 8-10 are typical of residential noise exposure adjacent to major arterial roadways. The ambient measurements indicate that most unshielded backyards adjacent to SR 20 and SR 45 are likely exposed to traffic noise levels exceeding 60 dB Ldn.

4.4.2 REGULATORY FRAMEWORK

LOCAL

Colusa General Plan

The adopted City of Colusa General Plan is currently used as the "blueprint" to guide future development within the City limits and in unincorporated portions of the existing Planning Area. The proposed General Plan Update would establish policies and implementing actions associated with noise. Specitic proposed policies and implementing actions are discussed in the impact analyses below.
Colusa City Code Chapter 11A - Noise Regulations
Chapter 11A of the Colusa City Code includes standards regulating noise under a number circumstances including, but not limited to, the construction of or repairing of buildings, the use of pile drivers, hammers, etc., and tools such as power saws and hammers. This regulations limits the time period when such activities can occur limiting them to between 7:00 am and 10:00 Monday through Saturday and 9:00 am to 10:00 pm on Sunday. pm

Colusa County Airport Comprehensive Land Use Plan (CLUP)
As noted in Section 4.1, Land Use and Agricultural Resources, the CLUP for the Colusa County Airport defines land uses that are incompatible with airport operations. The Colusa County Airport Land Use Commission (ALUC) monitors compliance with CLUP provisions. The CLUP contains the following policies and implementation measures regarding noise:
Policy c: As development is proposed in the area between the 50 and 55 dB CNEL noise contours, affected cities and counties should evaluate the development and consider impact of aircraft noise on proposed
buyer-renter notification. requiring noise reduction measures, aviation noise easement and

Implementation f: Before a proposed project deemed incompatible because it would exceed ALUC adopted noise guidelines can be approved, the City or County must take action to override the ALUC. The action to override, including the required findings, is

governed by the ALUC Law, Chapter 4, and Article 3.5 of the California Public Utilities
Code.

Implementation g: Cities and counties are responsible for ensuring that an acoustical study is completed for residential projects, other than single family detached, having an airport caused noise impact greater than 55 dB CNEL that shows the structures are designed to meet the interior noise level of 45 dB CNEL.

4.4.3 IMPACTS AND MITIGATION MEASURES

STANDARDS OF SIGNIFICANCE

Based on Appendix G of the CEQA Guidelines, noise impacts are considered to be significant if the following could result from the implementation of the proposed General Plan Update:
1. Exposure of persons to, or generation of, noise levels in excess of standards established in the local plans or ordinances.

2. Exposure of persons to, or generation of, excessive groundborne vibration or
groundborne noise levels.
3. A substantial permanent increase in ambient noise levels in the project vicinity above levels without the project.

4. A substantial temporary or periodic increase in ambient noise levels in the project vicinity above levels existing without the project.
5. For a project located within an airport land use plan, or within two miles of a public airport or public use airport if such a plan has not been adopted, exposure of people residing or working in the area to excessive noise levels.
6. For a project within the vicinity of a private airstrip, exposure of people residing or working in the project area to excessive noise levels.

METHODOLOGY

The Federal Highway Administration Highway Traffic Noise Prediction Model (FHWA-RD-77-108), with the Calveno vehicle noise emission curves, was used to predict existing and cumulative traffic noise levels within the City of Colusa. Although the FHWA Model has been updated by a more sophisticated traffic noise prediction model, the use of RD-77-108 is still considered acceptable for the development of General Plan traffic noise predictions. The FHWA Model was used with traffic data obtained from published Caltrans 2005 average daily traffic (ADT) counts and traffic data reported by kdAnderson and Associates, Inc., for this project to develop Ldn contours for the major highways within the City of Colusa, as well as local roadways. As noted by kDAnderson in the traffic assessment for this project, there were considerable differences between the 2005 Caltrans ADT counts and the October 2005 counts conducted by kdAnderson for certain roadway segments that were assessed. Therefore, predicted traffic noise levels and distances to contours were computed for both sets of traffic count data. The FHWA Model input data are provided in Table 4.4-2.
As previously mentioned, a community noise survey was performed at 10 locations to quantify existing noise levels in and around the proposed Planning Area. Three of the survey locations were conducted on a continuous basis for a period of 24 hours. The other locations were

monitored for short-term periods at various times, including both day and night. The results of the ambient noise survey vary greatly, depending on proximity to the major arterial roadways and proximity to industrial uses.
IMPACTS AND MITIGATION MEASURES FOR THE PROPOSED GENERAL PLAN UPDATE

Noise-Sensitive Land Uses within Noise-Impacted Areas

Impact 4.4.1 Implementation of the proposed General Plan Update could result in the creation of new noise-sensitive land uses within noise-impacted areas. This is considered a less than signitic ant impact.
The implementation of the proposed General Plan Update would result in the creation of new land use designations and could result in new noise-sensitive land uses within areas that are or would be impacted by noise. Potential noise sources include existing noise-generating uses, such as commercial areas, schools and streets with high traffic volumes. Future noise sources include development associated with commercial, industrial and light industrial designations as well as traffic noise levels anticipated at build-out. The proposed Mixed Use designation for the downtown area would place residential units in a commercial area. Residents in these units
could be exposed to elevated noise levels from traffic and commercial activities.
The proposed General Plan Land Use Diagram indicates that some residences may be placed near noise-generating sources. For example, residential development in the southeastern and western portions of the proposed Planning Area would be placed near State Routes 20 and 45. Traffic on these highways is a major noise source. Some residential units also may be placed near the Colusa County Airport. Impact 4.4.4 discusses potential noise impacts related to the airport.
Proposed General Plan Policies and Implementing Actions that Mitigate Potential Impacts

Noise Element

Policy N-1.1 The City shall implement the noise standards in Table 7.3 [see Table 4.4-4] for new uses affected by traffic and airport (mobile) noise and in Table 7.4 [see Table 4.4- 5] for new uses affected by non-transportation (stationary) noise sources.

Notes:
1. in For traffic noise in the City of Colusa, Ltn and peak-hour Leq values are estimated to be approximately similar. Interior noise level standards are applied in noise-sensitive areas of the various land uses, with windows and doors in the closed positions.
2. Outdoor activity areas for single-family residential uses are defined as back yards. For large parcels or residences with no clearly defined outdoor activity area, the standard shall be applicable within: 100-foot radius of the residence. 3. For multi-family residential uses, the exterior noise level standard shall be applied at the common outdoor recreation area, such as at pools, play areas, or tennis courts. Where such areas are not provided in multi-family residential uses, the standards shall be applied at individual patios and balconies of the development.
4. Where it is not possible to reduce noise in outdoor activity areas to 60 dB Lcn or less using practical application of the best available noise recuction measures, an exterior noise level of up to 65 dB Len may be allowed--provided that available exterior noise level reduction measures have been implemented and interior noise levels are in compliance with this table.
5.
6. Outdoor activity areas of transient lodging facilities include swimming pool and picnic areas. Hospitals are often noise-generating uses. The exterior noise level standards for hospitals are applicable only at clearly identified areas designated for outdoor relaxation by either hospital staff or patients.
7. Only the exterior spaces of these uses designated for employee or customer relaxation are considered sensitive.
Implementing Action N-1.1.a: Development Review

The City will implement its development review process in accordance with the requirements contained in documents such as, but not limited to, the City of Colusa Zoning Ordinance, the Uniform Building Code (UBC), State Noise Insulation Standards (Title 24), Specific Pians, the City's design guidelines, the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), and Colusa County environmental health regulations.
Because noise considerations are an integral part of the community planning and design process, the City will require noise information from the project applicant to adequately evaluate the effects of project noise on the community. Conditions of approvai will be developed, along with environmental mitigation measures, to ensure that the goals and policies of this Noise Element are met. For projects that are subject to design review, this process will be used to determine ways in which project design may reduce noise to acceptable levels: site planning, traffic planning, architectural layout, construction modifications, landscaped berms and, as a last resort, sound wall barriers.

Notes:
Outdoor activity areas for single-family residential uses are defined as backyards. For large parcels or residences with no clearly defined outdoor activity area, the standard shall be applicable within a 100-foot radius of the residence. For multi-family residential uses, the exterior noise level standard shall be applied at the common outdoor recreation area, such as at pools, play areas or tennis courts. Where such areas are not provided, the standards shail be applied at individual patios and balconies of the development. Outdoor activity areas of transient lodging facilities include swimming pool and picnic areas, which are not commonly used during nighttime hours. Hospitals are often noise-generating uses. The exterior noise level standards for hospitals are applicable only at clearly identified areas designated for outdoor relaxation by either hospital staff or patients.
Only the exterior spaces of these uses designated for employee or customer relaxation have any degree of sensitivity to noise. The outdoor activity areas of office, commercial and park uses are not typically utilized during nighttime hours. it may not be possible to achieve compliance with this standard at residential uses located immediately adjacent to loading dock areas of commercial uses while trucks are unloading. The daylime and nighttime noise level standards applicable to loading docks shall be 55 and 50 dB Leu, respectively. General: The Table 7.4 standards shall be reduced by 5 dB for sounds consisting primarily of speech or music, and for recurring impulsive sounds. If the existing ambient noise level exceeds the standards of Table 7.4, then the noise level standards shall be increased at 5 dB increments to encompass the ambient.

Implementing Action N-1.1.b: Noise Performance Standards

The noise performance standards shown in Table 7.3 and Table 7.4 of this Noise Element will be adopted with the General Plan update. The City will apply these standards to the review of new development of noise-sensitive uses exposed to existing fixed noise sources. These standards will also be used TO evaluate the potential impacts of proposed new fixed noise sources in proximity to existing noise-sensitive land uses. Where a noise sensitive land use is proposed near a fixed a noise source, such as an industrial facility or the airport, noise measurements will be performed to determine whether existing and/or future noise leveis from that source will exceed the City's noise performance standards at the property line of the proposed use. Similarly where a fixed noise-producing uses such as an industrial facility is proposed near an existing or future noise sensitive use, a noise analysis will be prepared to ensure that the noise produced by the proposed project will not exceed the City's noise performance standards at the property line of the noise sensitive use. The acoustical analysis will be the responsibility of the project applicant and follow the guidelines in Table 7.5.

Implementing Action N-1.1.c: Noise Level Contour Map
The noise level contour map shown in Figure 7.1 of this Noise Element will be adopted with the General Plan update. To evaluate the potential for noise conflicts associated with new developments and projects in the City limits around the airport, the City will refer to this contour map. The map shows generalized locations of noise contours associated with the various noise sources. The contour map can be used as a tool to evaluate the potential for exposure of a noise-sensitive land use to noise levels that may exceed the City's noise standards. Because

4.4 NOISE

topography, vegetation, or intervening structures may significantly affect noise exposures at a particular location, the noise contours should be considered generalized and not site-specific.
Implementing Action N-1.1.d: Airport Comprehensive Land Use Pian

The City will ensure that projects located within the Area of Influence of the Colusa County Airport are routed to the Airport Land Use Commission for review and comment.

Implementing Action N-1.1.e: Ordinance and Regulations Review and Update
The City will review and update its zoning ordinance, subdivision ordinance, environmental review ordinance (new), and development and site plan review processes to ensure compliance with the goals, policies, and standards contained in the Airport Comprehensive Land Use Plan and California Civil Code.

Policy N-1.2: The City shall require appropriate noise attenuation measures to be included in the project design for proposed noise-sensitive uses in proximity to existing noise-producing uses, as needed, and shall be in compliance with the noise standards in Table 7.3 and Table 7.4.

Impiementing Action N-1.2.a: Ordinance Review and Update
The City will review and update its zoning ordinance, subdivision ordinance, environmentai review ordinance (new), and development and site plan review processes to ensure compliance with the goals, policies, and standards contained in the Noise Element. The updates will reference noise standards contained in this General Pian and will be administered as part of the regular pianning, zoning and building permit application processes. The applicant will be responsible for preparing a noise analysis and ensuring project compliance with the standards.

Policy N-1.3 Where noise attenuation is required to meet the standards of this Element, an emphasis shall be placed on site planning and project design, including, but not limited to, building orientation, setbacks, landscaping and building construction practices.

Policy N-1.4 The use of sound walls shall be considered as a last resort to achieve the noise standards, after other practical design-related noise mitigation measures have been fully integrated into the project.

Policy N-1.5 The City shall require any necessary noise analyses to assess compliance with the City's Noise Element standard and Environmental Review Ordinance. Noise analyses shall be prepared in accordance with the requirements in
Table 7.5.

Policy N-1.6 The City shall apply the noise standards in Table 7.3 and Table 7.4 to both new noise-sensitive land uses and new noise-generating land uses, with the responsibility for noise mitigation placed on the new use.
Policy N-1.1 would establish noise standards with which all future development must comply, while Policy N-1.2 would require the inclusion of noise attenuation measures in the design of noise-sensitive uses near existing noise-producing uses. Implementing Actions N-1.1.a, N-1.1.b and N-1.2.a would require the City to apply these standards and measures to future

4.4 NOISE

development applications, and mitigate for potential noise impacts identified during the development review process. Policies N-1.3 and N-1.4 refine Policy N-1.2 by emphasizing the Use of site planning and project design, rather than the construction of sound walls. Policy N-1.5 further defines the noise analysis provisions of Policy N-1.1. Policy N-1.6 applies the proposed new noise standards to both new noise-sensitive land uses and new noise-generating uses. Implementation of these proposed General Plan policies and action items would reduce potential exposure of new noise-sensitive uses to unacceptable noise levels to less than signific ant.

Additional Mitigation Measures

None required.

Noise-Producing Uses near Existing Noise-Sensitive Areas

Impact 4.4.2 Implementation of the proposed General Plan could result in the creation of new noise producing land uses near existing or proposed noise-sensitive c areas. This is considered a less than significant impact.
Implementation of the proposed General Plan Update could place new noise producing land uses such as industrial, near noise-sensitive land uses such as residential, For example, light industrial uses are proposed along 14th Street next to a residential area. Development of light industrial, industrial and commercial uses may involve noise-generating activities, including traffic and loading docks that could disturb nearby residents and other noise-sensitive uses, particularly if operations occur at nighttime.

4.4 NOISE

As previously discussed under Impact 4.4.1, Policy N-1.1 would establish noise standards with which all future development must comply, while Policy N-1.2 would require the inclusion of noise attenuation measures in the design of noise-sensitive uses near existing noise-producing uses. Implementing Actions N-1.1.a, N-1.1.b and N-1.2.a would apply those policies. Policies N- 1.3, N-1.4 and N-1.5 further define Policies N-1.1 and N-1.2. Policy N-1.6 applies the proposed new noise standards to both new noise-sensitive land uses and new noise-generating uses, requiring that the new use mitigate potential impacts. Implementation of these General Plan policies and action items would reduce impacts to less than significant.
Additional Mitigation Measures

None required.

Construction Noise Levels

Impact 4.4.3 Demolition of existing structures and construction activities associated with development under the proposed General Plan Update would temporarily increase noise levels at existing noise-sensitive receivers. This is considered a
potentially significant impact.

Activities associated with development accommodated under the proposed General Plan Update would include construction and grading, and may involve demolition or renovation of buildings. Such activities would require the use of construction equipment and vehicles, which would generate noise. Activities involved in construction would generate maximum noise levels, as indicated in Table 4.4-6, ranging from 85 to 90 dB at a distance of 50 feet. While pile-driving is not a typical construction activity, pile-drive construction could occur in the Planning Area that can generate similar noise levels as well as excessive groundborne vibration.

TABLE 4.4-6
CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT NOISE

ype of Equipment Maximum Level, dB at 50:

Some development activity would occur away from existing noise-sensitive uses, such as residences, schools and medical facilities. However, some development work would occur close to these uses, which would expose them to elevated noise levels from construction activities. These elevated noise levels would be temporary, and would cease once construction work is completed. Nevertheless, these noise levels could disturb residents and other occupants of noise-sensitive facilities.

4.4 NOISE

Policy N-2.1 The City shall regulate and control the noise associated with construction activities to reduce impacts on adjacent uses, consistent with the noise regulations set forth in the Zoning Ordinance.
Implementing Action N-2.1.a: Noise Ordinance Update
The City will update its Noise Ordinance to include provisions that are specific to temporary construction noise:

Construction, as well as landscaping and park activities, shall be limited to the hours stipulated in the Chapter 11A Noise Regulations of the City of Colusa Code, unless an exemption is first obtained from the City in response to speciai circumstances.
All internal combustion engines used in conjunction with construction and landscaping shall be muffled according to the equipment manufacturer's requirements.
Policy N-2.1 explicitly addresses construction noise by requiring its regulation and control. Implementing Action N-2.1.a would include such regulations and controls in City ordinances. Implementing Action N-1.1.a would allow the City to apply more specific measures to mitigate the construction noise impacts of projects. Implementation of the above General Plan policies and implementing actions would reduce construction-related noise impacts on nearby noise- sensitive land uses, mainly noise from engines. However, it remains possible that noise-sensitive uses would be exposed to elevated noise levels from construction activities, particularly as Implementing Action N-2.1.a would exempt such activities from proposed noise standards and the timing of the Noise Ordinance update under this action is unknown.
Additional Mitigation Mea

MM 4.4.3 Prior to adoption of the updated Noise Ordinance, the City shall condition development projects to mitigate construction noise to the maximum extent feasible. Construction noise mitigation measures include:
Construction, as well as landscaping and park activities shall be limited to the hours stipulated in the Chapter 11A Noise Regulations of the City of Colusa Code.

All internal combustion engines used in conjunction with construction and landscaping shall be muffled according to the equipment manufacturer's requirements.

Construction staging areas shall not be proximate to residential areas.
While implementation of the proposed General Plan policies and action items along with mitigation measure MM 4.4.3 would reduce construction noise impacts, the potential for short- term exposure of noise-sensitive uses to excessive noise levels associated with construction activities would remain. Therefore, while construction noise would be a temporary occurrence, noise levels would result in substantial temporary and periodic exceedance of standards and impacts are considered significant and unavoidable.

4.4 NOISE

Airport Noise

Impact 4.4.4 Implementation of the proposed General Plan Update could place new noise-sensitive land uses near the Colusa County Airport. This is considered a is significant impact.
The General Plan Land Use Diagram indicates that some residential areas may be placed near the Colusa County Airport. As indicated in Figure 4.4-1, areas near the airport may be exposed to noise levels of at least 55 dB CNEL. These noise levels could have an adverse impact on residents in the vicinity, mainly those in the residential area to the northeast of the airport. In addition, noise complaints from these residents could lead to restrictions on airport activities, which would hamper airport operations. As discussed in Section 4.1, Land Use and Agricultural Resources, some areas designated residential on the proposed Land Use Diagram are within the airport's overflight zone, and potential future development may not meet the compatibility criteria of the Colusa County Airport CLUP. The CLUP criteria are intend to ensure that nearby land uses are compatible with airport operations.

Implementing Action N-1.2.a: Ordinance Review and Update (see impact 4.4.1)
Policy N-1.3 (see Impact 4.4.1)
As described in previous impact discussions, Policies N-1.1, N-1.2 and N-1.3, along with Implementing Actions N-1.1.a, N-1.1.b and N-1.2.a, would apply noise standards to development projects and require mitigation for any adverse noise impacts. Implementing Actions N-1.1.c, N- 1.1.d and N-1.1.e explicitly apply to noise associated with airport operations. These actions seek to incorporate the provisions of the Colusa County Airport CLUP into City plans and ordinances as they apply to noise exposure. These provisions are designed to reduce the exposure of noise- sensitive land uses to elevated levels of airport noise. Implementation of the proposed General Plan policies and implementing actions would minimize airport-related noise impacts on nearby residential land use. However, the City may approve uses inconsistent with the CLUP, as allowed under State law, which could result in excessive noise exposure. While mitigation measures may reduce noise levels, it is not anticipated that aircraft noise levels would be mitigated to a less than significant level through implementation of mitigation measures through the Design Review

Additional Mitigation Measures

Increased Traffic Noise

Impact 4.4.5 Implementation of the General Plan, in combination with existing, approved, proposed, and reasonably foreseeable development, would contribute to a cumulative increase in traffic noise. This is considered a
potentially significant impact.
While it is difficult to project exactly how the ambient noise conditions within the City would change following buildout of the Planning Area, it is known that traffic noise levels would increase on a city-wide basis due to the additional traffic generated by buildout of various land use designations which have yet to be developed. Specifically, Table 4.4-7 shows the projected traffic noise levels at a reference distance of 100 feet from the various roadway centerlines for the cumulative buildout of the City with the proposed General Plan land use designations. I1 should be noted that the table is intended to illustrate relative changes in noise levels. The presence of sound walls or other shielding affects reduces absolute traffic noise levels at the shielded areas of noise-sensitive uses. However, the relative changes in traffic noise levels identified in Table 4.4-7 would not be affected by existing sound walls or other shielding affects. Implementation of the proposed General Plan would cause traffic noise level increases ranging from to 15 dB Ldn over existing traffic noise levels. Because a traffic noise level increase of 3 dB is considered the threshold of significance for the identification of noise impacts, such impacts are expected to occur on 43 of the 68 roadways segments analyzed in Table 4.4-7.

Policy N-1.4 (See Impact 4.4.1)

Policy N-1.5 (See Impact 4.4.1)

Policy N-1.6 (See Impact 4.4.1)
Policy N-1.1 would establish noise standards with which all future development must comply, while Policy N-1.2 would require the inclusion of noise attenuation measures in the design of noise-sensitive uses near existing noise-producing uses. Implementing Actions N-1.1.a, N-1.1.b and N-1.2.a would require the City to apply these standards and measures to future development applications, and mitigate for potential noise impacts identified during the development review process. Policies N-1.3 and N-1.4 refine Policy N-1.2 by emphasizing the use of site planning and project design, rather than the construction of sound walls. Policy N-1.5 further defines the noise analysis provisions of Policy N-1.1. Policy N-1.6 applies the proposed new noise standards to both new noise-sensitive land uses and new noise-generating uses.
Implementation of the proposed General Plan policies and implementing actions would result in a reduction of traffic noise levels at affected sensitive receptor locations. However, despite the implementation of these measures, it would be infeasible to ensure that all existing residential uses will not be exposed to future traffic noise levels in excess of the City's noise standards. As a result, this impact is considered signiticant and unavoidable.

4.5 AIR QUALITY

4.5 AIR QUALITY

This section evaluates the potential impacts of the General Plan Update on air quality. It examines the climatic influences that affect air quality of the proposed Planning Area and also describes available data on measured contaminant levels. In addition, it outlines the regulatory and planning agencies and programs relevant to the proposed Planning Area. Key issues addressed in this section include: emission of criteria pollutants associated with new development, including construction, operational and related traffic, exposure to toxic air
contaminants, and increased carbon monoxide levels at intersections. Information for this
section was provided primarily from an analysis conducted by Donald Ballanti, a certified consulting meteorologist. Results of the air quality modeling are available in Appendix D of this document.

4.5.1 EXISTING SETTING

AIR BASIN CHARACTERISTICS

The proposed Planning Area lies in the central portion of the Sacramento Valley, a broad, flat valley bounded by the Coast Ranges to the west and the Sierra Nevada to the east. The entire air basin is about 200 miles long in a north-south direction, and has maximum width of about
150 miles, although the valley floor averages only about 50 miles in width.
The climate of the project area is characterized by hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters. During the summer months form mid-April to mid-October, signiticant precipitation is unlikely and temperatures range from daily maxima approaching 100 degrees Fahrenheit to evening lows in high 50s and low 60s. Winter conditions are characterized by occasional rainstorms interspersed with stagnant and sometimes foggy weather. Winter daytime temperatures average in the low 50s and nighttime temperatures average in the upper 30s.
Wind direction is primarily up- and down-valley due to the channeling effect of the mountains to either side of the valley. During the summer months surface air movement is from the south, particularly during the afternoon hours. During the winter months wind direction is more variable. is

In addition to prevailing wind patterns that control the rate of dispersion of local poliutant emissions, Colusa County experiences two types of inversion layers that atfect the air quality. The first type of inversion layer contributes to photochemical smog problems by confining poliution to a shallow layer near the ground. This occurs in the summer, when sinking air forms a "lid" over the region. The second type of inversion occurs when the air near the ground cools while the air aloft remains warm. These inversions occur during winter nights and can cause localized air pollution "hot spots" near emission sources because of poor dispersion.
The proposed Planning Area is part of the Northern Sacramento Valley Air Basin (NSVAB). The NSVAB consists of Shasta, Tehama, Glenn, Butte, Colusa, Yuba and Sutter counties. This air basin
is predominantly rural, with few major urban areas.

AMBIENT AIR QUALITY STANDARDS
Both the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the California Air Resources Board (ARB) have established ambient air quality standards for common pollutants. These ambient air quality standards are levels of contaminants that represent safe levels that avoid specific adverse health effects associated with each pollutant. The ambient air quality standards cover what are called "criteria" pollutants because the health and other effects of each pollutant are described in criteria documents. The EPA criteria pollutants include ozone, carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2 a form of NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2 - a form of SOx), particulate

4.5 AIR QUALITY

matter both 10 microns and 2.5 microns in size and smaller (PMio and PM2.5), and lead. The ARB has established state standards for the EPA's criteria pollutants, as well as for other poilutants.
Table 4.5-1 summarizes the federal and California ambient air quality standards for important pollutants. The federal and state ambient standards were developed independently with differing purposes and methods, although both processes attempted to avoid health-related effects. As a result, the federal and state standards differ in some cases. In general, the California standards are more stringent. This is particularly true for ozone and particulate matter.

In accordance with federal and state ambient air quality standards, counties in California receive a designation that indicates if air quality within the county is meeting these standards. Counties achieving state and/or federal standards receive an "attainment" designation, while those that do a not receive a "nonattainment" designation. In some cases, counties receive an "unclassified" status, indicating data did not support a designation of attainment or nonattainment. Colusa County is currently in attainment or unclassified status for all national criteria pollutant standards. Colusa County is a nonattainment area for state standards for PM1o. The County has a "nonattainment-transitional" status for state standards for ozone, which means that the County had been in nonattainment status, but has not had more than three days of state ozone standards exceedance during the previous calendar year.

AIR POLLUTANTS OF CONCERN AND HEALTH EFFECTS

The most problematic pollutants in Colusa are ozone and particulate matter. The health effects and major sources of these pollutants are described below. Toxic air pollutants are a separate class of pollutants and are discussed later in this section.

Colusa General Plan City of Colusa Draft Master Environmental Impact Report July 2007
4.5-2

4.5 AIR QUALITY

Ozone

Ground-level ozone, commonly referred to as smog, is greatest on warm, windless, sunny days. is Ozone is not emitted directly into the air. Rather, it forms through a complex series of chemical reactions between reactive organic gases (ROG) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), known as "ozone precursors." These reactions occur over time in the presence of heat and sunlight. The principal sources of the ozone precursors are the combustion of fuels, primarily from motor vehicles, and
the evaporation of solvents, paints and fuels.

Ground-level ozone formation can occur in a matter of hours under ideal conditions. The time
required for ozone formation allows the reacting compounds to spread over a large area, producing a regional pollution concern. Once formed, ozone can remain in the atmosphere for
one or two days,

Ozone is a public health concern because it is a respiratory irritant that increases susceptibility to respiratory infections and diseases, and at high concentrations can harm lung tissue. In
addition, ozone can cause substantial damage to leaf tissues of crops and natural vegetation
and can damage many natural and manmade materials by acting as an oxidizing agent.

Particulate Matter

Both federal and state standards
differentiate between two types of particulate matter. Coarse particles (PM10) are between 2.5 and 10 microns in diameter
and arise primarily from natural processes,
such as wind-blown dust or soil. Fine
particles (PM2.s) are less than 2.5 microns in diameter and are produced mostly from
combustion, or burning activities. Fuel
burned in cars and trucks, power plants, factories, fireplaces and wood stoves produces fine particles.

The level of fine particulate matter in the air
is a public health concern because it can
bypass the body's natural filtration system more easily than larger particles, and can lodge deeply in the lungs. The health effects vary depending on a variety of factors, including the type and size of particles. Research has demonstrated a correlation between high PM concentrations and increased mortality rates. Elevated PM concentrations can also aggravate chronic respiratory ilinesses such as bronchitis and asthma.

Toxic Air Contaminants

In addition to the criteria pollutants discussed above, toxic air contaminants (TACs) are another group of pollutants of concern. Unlike criteria pollutants, no safe levels of exposure to TACs have been established. There are many different types of TACs, with varying degrees of toxicity. Sources of TACs include industrial processes such as petroleum refining and chrome plating operations, commercial operations such as gasoline stations and dry cleaners, and motor vehicle exhaust. Public exposure to TACs can result from emissions from normal operations, as well as accidental releases of hazardous materials during upset conditions. The health effects of TACS include cancer, birth defects, neurological damage and death.

City of Colusa Colusa General Plan July 2007 Draft Master Environmental Impact Report
4.5-3

4.5 AIR QUALITY

In 1998, after a 10-year scientific assessment process, the ARB identified particulate matter from diesel-fueled engines as a toxic air contaminant. The exhaust from diesel engines contains hundreds of different gaseous and particulate components, many of which are toxic. Many of
these compounds adhere to the particles, and because diesel particles are so small, they penetrate deep into the lungs. Diesel engine particulate has been identified as a human carcinogen. Mobile sources, such as trucks, buses, automobiles, trains, ships and farm equipment are by far the largest source of diesel emissions. Studies show that diesel particulate matter concentrations are much higher near heavily traveled highways and intersections.
AMBIENT AIR QUALITY
Colusa County has an air quality monitoring site on Sunrise Boulevard north of the Colusa County Airport. The Colusa monitoring site collects data for two pollutants: ozone and particulate matter. Table 4.5-2 shows historical occurrences of pollutant levels exceeding the state and/or federal ambient air quality standards for the past three years. The Colusa area meets all federal ambient air quality standards. The monitoring site recorded exceedances of state ambient standards for PM10, but not for ozone or for other pollutants.

POLLUTION SOURCES

The inventory of stationary sources of criteria pollutants and toxic emissions, maintained by the ARB, shows 60 air pollutant sources in Colusa County. Of these, approximately 17 are in or near the proposed Planning Area. These sources include rice milis, food processing plants, petroleum storage facilities and a compressor station. None of these sources emits toxic pollutants at a level that threatens the health of residents. While not included in the ARB inventory, traffic on State Routes 20 and 45 is another source of air pollution in the proposed Planning Area.
SENSITIVE RECEPTORS

Sensitive receptors are facilities where population groups sensitive to air pollutant changes (e.g., children, the elderly, the acutely and the chronically ill) are likely to be located. These land uses include schools, retirement homes, convalescent homes, hospitals and medical clinics. The major sensitive receptors in Colusa are schools, residences and medical centers.

4.5 AIR QUALITY

EMERGING AIR QUALITY ISSUES

The following is a discussion of emerging air quality issues that would not normally have been addressed by general plan policies and programs.

TAC/Land Use Issues

The California Air Resources Board recently published an air quality/land use handbook (ARB, 2005). The handbook, which is advisory and not regulatory, was developed in response to recent studies that have demonstrated a link between exposure to poor air quality and respiratory illnesses, both cancer and non-cancer related. The ARB handbook recommends that planning agencies strongly consider proximity to these sources when finding new locations for "sensitive" land uses such as homes, medical facilities, daycare centers, schools and playgrounds. Air pollution sources of concern include freeways, rail yards, ports, refineries, distribution centers, chrome plating facilities, dry cleaners and large gasoline service stations.

Key recommendations in the handbook include taking steps to avoid siting new, sensitive land uses in the following areas:
Within 500 feet of a freeway, urban roads with 100,000 vehicles/day, or rural roads with 50,000 vehicles/day;

Within 1,000 feet of a major service and maintenance rail yard;
Immediately downwind of ports (in the most heavily impacted zones) and petroleum
refineries;

Within 300 feet of any dry cleaning operation (for operations with two or more machines, provide 500 feet);
Within 300 feet of a large gasoline dispensing facility.

Wood Smoke

Wood smoke has long been identified as a significant source of pollutants in urban and suburban areas. Wood smoke contributes to particulate matter and carbon monoxide concentrations, reduces visibility and contains numerous toxic air contaminants. Present controls on this source include the adoption of emission standards for wood stoves and fireplace inserts. Interest in wood smoke is likely to increase with the recent adoption of a PM2.5 national standard.

4.5.2 REGULATORY FRAMEWORK

FEDERAL

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is responsible for enforcing the federal Clean Air Act and its amendments, and the national ambient air quality standards that it establishes. These standards identify levels of air quality for six "criteria" pollutants, which are considered the maximum levels of background air poliutants that would not adversely affect public health and welfare, with an adequate margin of safety. The EPA also has regulatory and enforcement jurisdiction over emission sources beyond state waters, and sources that are under the exclusive authority of the federal government, such as aircraft, locomotives, and interstate trucking, Table 4.5-1 provides the federal standards for criteria pollutants.

City of Colusa Colusa General Plan July 2007 Draft Master Environmental Impact Report 4.5-5

4.5 AIR QUALITY

STATE

The California Air Resources Board, a department of the California Environmental Protection
Agency (CalEPA), oversees air quality planning and control throughout California. It is primarily responsible for ensuring implementation of the 1989 amendments to the California Clean Air Act, responding to the federal Clean Air Act requirements, and for regulating emissions from motor vehicles and consumer products within the State. The ARB has established emission standards for vehicles sold in California and for various types of equipment available commercially. It also sets fuel specifications to further reduce vehicular emissions.
The amendments to the California Clean Air Act establish ambient air quality standards for the state (state standards) and a legal mandate to achieve these standards by the earliest practical date. Table 4.5-1 provides the State standards for criteria pollutants. These standards apply to the same six criteria pollutants as the federal Clean Air Act, and also include sulfate, visibility, hydrogen sulfide, and vinyl chloride. They are more stringent than the federal standards and, in the case of PM1o and SO2, far more stringent.

LOCAL

Colusa County Air Pollution Control District
The Colusa County Air Pollution Control District (APCD) implements the rules and regulations regarding air quality in Colusa County. A five-member Board of Directors governs the APCD. All five members are County supervisors. The Air Pollution Control Officer, appointed by the Board of Directors, oversees the functions of the APCD. In addition, the Board of Directors appoints an Air District Advisory Board to advise the Board on general air quality programs and issues, and a Hearing Board that considers appeals for rule variances and similar matters.
The APCD enforces state and local rules and regulations related to air quality, It issues permits such as an Authority to Construct and a Permit to Operate for stationary sources of emissions. It monitors all pollutant levels through its monitoring site on Sunrise Boulevard near Colusa. The
APCD also engages in long-range planning, education and public information activities.
The Colusa County APCD is part of the NSVAB. The air districts of the NSVAB have jointly prepared and adopted a uniform air quality attainment plan addressing ozone and PMio. An update of this plan was adopted by the participating air districts in 2004. The attainment pian establishes standard mitigation measures to reduce air quality impacts.

Colusa General Plan

The adopted City of Colusa General Plan currently is used as the "blueprint" to guide future development within the City limits and in unincorporated portions of the existing Planning Area. The existing General Plan has no policies applicable to air quality issues. The proposed General Plan Update would establish. policies and implementing actions associated with air quality. Specific proposed policies and implementing actions are discussed in the impact analyses below.

Based on Appendix G of the CEQA Guidelines, air quality impacts are considered to be significant if the following could result from the implementation of the General Plan Update:
1. Conflict with or obstruct implementation of any applicable air quality plan.

2. Violate any air quality standard or contribute substantially to an existing or projected air quality violation.
3. Result in a cumulatively considerable net increase of any criteria pollutant for which the project region is non-attainment under an applicable federal or state ambient air quality standard (including releasing emissions which exceed quantitative thresholds for ozone precursors).

4. Expose sensitive receplors to substantial pollutant concentrations.

5. Create objectionable odors affecting a substantial number of people.
Cumulative air quality impacts are discussed in Section 7.0, Cumulative Impact Analysis.

METHODOLOGY

Estimates of regional emissions generated by project traffic and other sources were made using a program called URBEMIS-2002 (Jones and Stokes, 2003). URBEMIS-2002 is a program that estimates the emissions that result from various land use development projects. Land use projects can include residential uses such as single-family dwelling units, apartments and condominiums, and nonresidential uses such as shopping centers, office buildings, and industrial parks. URBEMIS-2002 contains default values for much of the information needed to calculate
emissions. However, project-specific, user-supplied information can also be used when it is
available.

When modeling large areas or large projects the URBEMIS-2002 program, which is land-use driven, will over-predict travel by double counting trips (for example, a home-to-shop trip generated by a residence will also be counted as a non-home-based shopping trip). To accurately model project trips, the double-counting correction function of the URBEMIS-2002 program was used.

IMPACTS AND MITIGATION MEASURES FOR THE GENERAL PLAN UPDATE

Construction-Related Emissions

Impact 4.5.1 Implementation of the proposed General Plan would result in period exhaust emissions and fugitive dust from construction activities that would affect local air is quality. This is considered a significant impact.
Emissions associated with construction activities generally are short-term or temporary in duration. However, they still have the potential to significantly impact air quality. The main contributors are fugitive dust emissions (PMo) and ozone-forming gases.

4.5-7

4.5 AIR QUALITY

As previously noted, Colusa County is in nonattainment status for state PMio standards. Fugitive
dust emissions are generally associated with grading, movement of soil and other site preparation activities. Construction activities associated with buildout under the proposed General Plan would include grading, building demolition, building construction, and paving. Wind erosion and disturbance to exposed areas would also be sources of dust emissions. The construction of residential and non-residential buildings and the supporting infrastructure would generate emissions of PMio.

The County currently is in "nonattainment-transitional" status for state ozone standards. Ozone precursor (ROG and NOx) emissions are associated primarily with gas and diesel equipment exhaust and the application of various exterior building coatings. In addition, motor vehicle exhaust associated with construction equipment use, employee vehicle trips, and material transport and delivery would contribute to the generation of ROG and NOx, as well as PM10.
Emissions from individual development construction sites would be short-term and temporary, but would occur through buildout of the General Plan. At any given times, several construction projects may be under way, which may result in substantial construction-related emissions. Intensification of individual development projects would account for most development, and consequently most construction-related emissions.

The Colusa County APCD uses the same thresholds of significance for air quality impacts as other air quality districts in the NSVAB. These thresholds of significance are contained in the indirect
Source Review Guidelines, prepared by the Butte County Air Quality Management District in conjunction with the NSVAB. The Indirect Source Review Guidelines also describes a list of mitigation measures applicable to projects to reduce air quality emissions, based on type of project and potential severity of impacts. This list includes mitigation measures designed to reduce dust emissions generated by construction activities. The Indirect Source Review Guidelines are available in Appendix D of this document.
Proposed General Plan Policies and Implementing Actions that Mitigate Potential Impacts

Policy PRC-5.1 The City shall require that site preparation and construction activities incorporate effective measures to minimize dust and pollutant emissions from motorized construction equipment and vehicles.
Implementing Action PRC-5.1.a: Development Review
Projects will be evaluated for their potential impacts to air quality as part of the development review process, applying the California Environmental Act (CEQA) Guidelines and in consultation with Colusa County Air Pollution Control District (APCD).
Implementing Action PRC-5.1.b: Best Management Practices
The City will require that developers use best management practices (BMPs) as recommended by the U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and Colusa County APCD. Approaches to design, construction, and maintenance techniques should ensure that
development would not cause or worsen air quality.
Policy PRC-5.1 would require the incorporation of measures to mitigate adverse air quality impacts of development projects. The City would require the inclusion of Best Management Practices for the reduction of construction air emissions, if necessary, during the development review process as identified in Implementing Action PRC-5.1.b. Incorporation of the above listed

policies and implementing actions would reduce construction related air emissions to a less than significant level.

Mitigation Measures

None required.

Operations-Related Emissions

Impact 4.5.2 Implementation of the proposed General Plan Update would increase air pollutant emissions from land use activities within the City. This is considered a
significant impact.

Implementation of the proposed General Plan Update would accommodate additional residential, commercial, industrial and other urban development that would result in increased population, employment growth, and vehicle trips. This would introduce additional mobile and stationary sources of emissions, which would adversely affect air quality in the proposed Planning Area. Emissions of ROG, NOx, and PMio would increase due to additional vehicie trips, increased natural gas consumption for heating and cooking, greater use of maintenance equipment, and the increased use of various consumer products.
Increases in operational air impacts with implementation of the proposed General Plan would generally consist of two sources: stationary and mobile.
A stationary source of air pollution refers to an emission source that does not move (e.g., utilities and chemical and manufacturing facilities). Often, stationary sources are defined as large emitters that release relatively consistent qualities and quantities of pollutants. The term "area source" is used to describe the many smaller stationary sources located together whose individual emissions may be low, but whose collective emissions can be significant. Typically, area sources are those that emit less than 25 tons per year of any combination of hazardous air pollutants, or less than 10 tons per year of any single hazardous air pollutant.
A mobile source of air pollution refers to a source that is capable of moving under its own power. In general, mobile sources imply on-road transportation, but there is also a non-road or off-road category that includes gas-powered lawn tools and mowers, farm and construction equipment, recreational vehicles, boats, planes, and trains.
New emissions associated with the proposed General Plan Update build-out are shown in Table 4.5-3. The estimated emissions are for summer months, when the greatest amounts of pollutant emissions occur, assuming build out of the General Plan by 2030. Also shown are the current county-wide emissions (2005) for the entire Colusa County for all inventoried sources, for comparison purposes. Emissions from anticipated growth in the proposed Planning Area represent a substantial increase over existing emissions, ranging from a 1.5 percent increase for NOx to a 7.9 percent increase for ROG when compared to county-wide emissions.

Substantial emissions of particulate matter and ozone precursors (ROG and NOx) have been linked to adverse human health effects, especially to sensitive receptors such as elderly persons or children. Ozone is a public health concern because it is a respiratory irritant that increases susceptibility to respiratory infections and diseases, and at high concentrations can harm lung tissue. PMi0 can bypass the body's natural filtration system more easily than larger particles, and can lodge deeply in the lungs. Research has demonstrated a correlation between high PM concentrations and increased mortality rates. Elevated PM concentrations can also aggravate chronic respiratory illnesses such as bronchitis and asthma. Future development, as a result of implementation of the proposed General Plan, will increase the daily emissions of ROG, NOx and PM10 as illustrated in Table 4.5.3. This has the potential to cause adverse human health affects.

4.5 AIR QUALITY

The City will periodically consult with the Colusa County Air Poilution Control District and Colusa County to ensure compliance with federal and state ambient air quality standards. This may include limiting the use of wood-burning devices, new construction methods, and conversion to
natural gas fireplaces in remodeling projects.

Policy PRC-5.4 The City shall ensure that existing trees and vegetation are retained and incorporated into the project design wherever feasible.

Implementing Action PRC-5.4.a: Development Review
Through the development review process, a landscaping plan will be prepared and reviewed for each project to ensure maximum retention and addition of mature trees and other
vegetation that will contribute to absorption of carbon emissions.

Policy PRC-5.5 The City shall encourage the use of public transportation as an alternative to the automobile.

Implementation Action PRC 5.5.a: Public Awareness and Education

The City will provide public information describing how well-integrated land use and transportation planning, combined with greater use of public transit, can reduce vehicle miles of travel and motor vehicle emissions that contribute to air poilution, thereby improving the community's air quality.
Policy PRC-5.1 would require the incorporation of measures to mitigate adverse air quality impacts of development projects. The City would require the inclusion of Best Management Practices for the reduction of construction air emissions, if necessary, during the development review process as identified in Implementing Action PRC-5.2.b. Policy PRC-5.2, along with Implementing Action PRC-5.2.a, would encourage land use planning that reduces motor vehicle use, and thereby air pollution, by placing employees and job centers more closely together. Policy PRC-5.5 and its associated implementing actions would reduce air pollutant emissions from motor vehicles by encouraging the use of alternative transportation modes.
The proposed General Plan policies and implementing actions would reduce the emissions generated by land use activities at buildout. Proposed new development would be required to incorporate air quality mitigation measures such as Best Management Practices from the Colusa County APCD. However, build-out of the City as proposed in the General Plan Update would still contribute high levels of criteria pollutants, specifically ozone precursors and PM10, for which the City is in non-attainment status. These emissions could contribute substantiaily to an existing and projected air quality violation. Therefore, impacts after mitigation would be significant and unavoidable.

Toxic Air Contaminants

Impact 4.5.3 Implementation of the proposed General Plan Update would include sources of criteria pollutants, toxic air contaminants that may affect surrounding land uses. Sensitive land uses may also be located near existing sources of criteria pollutants, toxic air contaminants. This impact is considered potentially significant.

Implementation of the proposed General Plan Update would include land uses that are potential sources of TACs. The type and level of TACs depend on the nature of the land use, individual facilities, and the methods and operations of particular facilities. Table 4.5-4 displays City of Colusa Colusa General Plan July 2007 Draft Master Environmental Impact Report
4.5-11

4.5 AIR QUALITY

potential sources of TAC emissions for various land uses allowed under the General Plan. Diesel exhaust particulate was recently added to the ARB list of TACs. Activities involving long-term use of diesel-powered equipment and heavy-duty trucks would contribute significantly to TAC levels.
Future development in the City may include projects that use in their operation TACs. Unlike criteria pollutants, no safe levels of exposure to TACs have been established. There are many different types of TACs, with varying degrees of toxicity. Sources of TACs include industrial processes such as petroleum refining and chrome plating operations, commercial operations such as gasoline stations and dry cleaners, and motor vehicle exhaust. Public exposure to TACS can result from emissions from normal operations, as well as accidental releases of hazardous materials during upset conditions. The health effects of TACs include cancer, birth defects,
neurological damage and death.

The Colusa County APCD has statutory authority over stationary sources of emissions. The APCD issues permits to ensure that all equipment and processes comply with federal and state laws and regulations, as well as APCD rules. Permits are, in effect, a contract between the APCD and stationary sources that sets limits on emissions and requires compliance with all District, state and federal regulations in order to protect public health. These regulations include the identification and quantification of emissions of TACs and, if warranted, estimation of cancer and non-cancer risk associated with any source. The issuance of permits, compliance with all District, state and federal regulations regarding stationary and TACs, the use of Best Available Control Technology (BACT), and the purchase of emission off-sets for industrial sources would reduce potential toxic air emissions.

Implementing Action PRC-5.3.b: Interagency Coordination (see Impact 4.5.2)
As previously described, Policy PRC-5.1 would require the incorporation of measures to mitigate adverse air quality impacts of development projects. These measures, if necessary, would be incorporated during the development review process identified in Implementing Actions PRC- 5.1.a and PRC 5.1.b. Implementation of General Plan policies and implementing actions as well as Colusa County APCD Rule R2-10 would reduce potential emissions of TACs from stationary sources, as well as reduce potential exposure of residents to TAC. Impacts after implementation would be less than significant.

Additional Mitigation Measures

None required.

Carbon Monoxide Emissions from Traffic

Impact 4.5.4 implementation of the proposed General Plan Update would increase traffic volumes that would potentially increase concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO) along streets and near intersections. This impact is considered significant.

Development accommodated under the proposed General Plan Update would increase traffic volumes on streets throughout the proposed Planning Area, and therefore would increase local carbon monoxide concentrations. Concentrations of this pollutant are related to the levels of traffic and congestion along streets and at intersections.
Concentrations of this pollutant approaching the ambient air quality standards can only be expected where background levels and traffic volumes and congestion levels are quite high. The state-wide carbon monoxide protocol document identifies signalized intersections operating at Level of Service (LOS) or F as having potential to result in localized exceedances of the state/federal ambient air quality standards (Garza et al, 1997). Colusa can be expected to have very low concentrations of this pollutant, and signalized intersections affected by project traffic currently operate at good levels of service. However, there are several intersections projected to operate at LOS E or F under future conditions (see Section 4.3). While mitigation measures are incorporated in the MEIR that would improve the LOS at these intersections, the timing of the improvements (as well as feasibility for the SR 20 intersections) is unknown. As such, it must be assumed that improvements to these intersections may not be available and therefore a reduction in CO cannot be assured. The only realistic mitigation for the reduction of CO emission is a state mandated reduction in vehicle emissions. No other feasible mitigation measures are available on a City level. Therefore, this impact would be significant and unavoidable.

Additional Mitigation Measures

Odors

Impact 4.5.5 Implementation of the proposed General Plan Update would include sources of odors that may affect surrounding land uses. Sensitive land uses may also be located near existing sources of odors. This impact is considered potentially significant.

Implementation of the proposed General Plan Update would allow for the development of uses that have the potential to produce odorous emissions either during the construction or operation of the development. Additionally, implementation of the General Plan may allow for the construction of sensitive land uses (i.e. residential development, schools, parks, offices, etc.) near existing or future sources of odorous emissions.

Future construction activities could result in odorous emissions from diesel exhaust associated
with construction equipment. However, because of the temporary nature of these emissions and the highly diffusive properties of diesel exhaust, exposure to this emission by sensitive receptors would be limited.

Typically odors are regarded as an annoyance rather than a health hazard. However, manifestations of a person's reaction to foul odors can range from psychological (e.g., irritation, anger, or anxiety) to physiological (e.g., circulatory and respiratory effects, nausea, vomiting, and headache).
With respect to odors, the human nose is the sole sensing device. The ability to detect odors varies considerably among the population and overall is quite subjective. Some individuals have the ability to smell minute quantities of specific substances; others may not have the same sensitivity but may have sensitivities to odors of other substances. In addition, people may have different reactions to the same odor; in fact, an odor that is offensive to one person (e.g., from a fast-food restaurant) may be perfectly acceptable to another. It is also important to note that an unfamiliar odor is more easily detected and is more likely to cause complaints than a familiar one. is This is because of the phenomenon known as odor fatigue, a in which a person can become desensitized to almost any odor and recognition only occurs with an alteration in the intensity. Quality and intensity are two properties present in any odor. The quality of an odor indicates the nature of the smell experience. For instance, if a person describes an odor as flowery or sweet, then the person is describing the quality of the odor. Intensity refers to the strength of the odor. For example, a person may use the word "strong" to describe the intensity of an odor. Odor intensity depends on the odorant concentration in the air. When an odorous sample is progressively diluted, the odorant concentration decreases. As this occurs, the odor intensity weakens and eventually becomes so low thai the detection or recognition of the odor is quite difficult. At some point during dilution, the concentration of the odorant reaches a detection threshold. An odorant concentration below the detection threshold means that the concentration in the air is not detectable by the average human.
The Regulations and Rules of the Colusa County Air Poliution Control District handbook identifies certain uses which produce air emissions that are prohibited in the District. Regulations |l - Prohibitions includes a nuisance rule a that addresses odor exposure. Rule R2-10 states that no person shall discharge from any source whatsoever such quantities of air contaminants or other

material that cause injury, detriment, nuisance, or annoyance to any considerable number of persons, or to the public, or that endanger the comfort, repose, health, or safety of any such persons, or the public, or that cause to have a natural tendency to cause injury or damage to business or property. The provisions of Rule R2-10 do not apply to odors emanating from agricultural operations necessary for the growing of crops or raising of fowl or animals.

Implementation of General Plan policies and implementing actions as well as Colusa County APCD Rule R2-10 would reduce potential exposure of residents to odorous emissions.

This section evaluates potential impacts of implementing the proposed General Plan as they relate to geology and soils. Key issues addressed in this section include: potential geologic and seismic hazards, soils disturbance and increased erosion, hazards associated with expansive soils, and exposure to hazardous materials, including transport, storage, use, and existing contamination. Section 4.5, Air Quality, contains information regarding air quality hazards. Section 4.7, Hydrology and Water Quality, discusses impacts associated with water quality and flooding. Hazards associated with transportation facilities, including potential hazards associated with Colusa County Airport operations, are described in Section 4.3, Transportation and Circulation. Section 4.11, Community Services, provides information on potential wildfire hazards.

4.6.1 EXISTING SETTING

TOPOGRAPHY AND LOCAL GEOLOGY

The proposed Planning Area contains approximately 5.95 square miles of land area in eastern Colusa County, including the City of Colusa. The topography of the proposed Planning Area is generally flat, with no significant elevated features outside of the levees along the Sacramento River.

The proposed Planning Area is located within
the Great Valley geomorphic province, which is primarily described as a relatively flat
alluvial plain, about 50 miles wide and 400 miles long, with thick sequences of sedimentary deposits of Jurassic through Holocene age. Boundaries of the Great
Valley geomorphic province are the Klamath and Cascade mountain ranges on the north, the Sierra Nevada mountain range on the
east, and the Coast Ranges on the west.

The geologic history of the Colusa area includes a mixture of ancient marine and alluvial deposits. Up to 155 million years ago, periods of volcanic activity and uplifting were followed by periods of uplifting and folding, which formed the Coast Ranges. The Sacramento Valley floor, on which the City of Colusa is located, is a structural trough formed by the uplift of the mountains surrounding it. This trough has been filled in by sequences of marine and alluvial sediments ranging in age from 135 million years ago to the present.

SOILS

The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), a division of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and formerly the Soil Conservation Service, recently completed a soil survey of Colusa County. This soil survey is currently unpublished, but information from the survey is available on the NRCS website at www.ca.nrcs.usda.gov/mlra02/colusa.html. According to the Colusa County Soil Survey, there are three soil types, with sub-variations, that comprise the primary soils found in the proposed Planning Area: the Colusa Series, Sycamore Series, and Marvin Series.

City of Colusa Colusa General Plan
July 2007 Draft Master Environmental Impact Report
4.6-1

4.6 GEOLOGY, SEISMICITY, SOILS AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS

Colusa Series: Colusa Series soils are derived from mixed river sediments, which contain a predominance of micaceous granite material. Colusa subsoil structure has no definition, but includes distinct horizontal characteristics. Variations in this series include deep subsoil, which may be stratified and underlain at various depths by a moderately dense clay substratum that resembles Marvin Series soil material. Alkali content varies in amount and consists of sodium
carbonate alkali. Topography found with these soils is flat with many shallow drainage channels.
Drainage is poor, but the annual water table is high.

Sycamore Series: The Sycamore Series is composed of a group of alluvial soils formed from transported materials that are dominantly granite in character. This series also contains some basic and sedimentary alluvium. Surface textures range from fine sandy loam to clay loams. Most of the loams have been inherited from ground water reaching the lower profile during the rainy season. Parent materials are generally non-calcareous, but the subsoils are calcareous. The topography of is these soils is generally flat, with gently sloping flood plain relief. The soil type is generally well drained with little to no erosion.
Marvin Series: The Marvin Series consists of soil derived from transported alluvium of mixed origin with a predominance of granite material. These soils occupy the older and imperfectly drained portions of the flood plain and/or occur near the flat basin area of a river channel. The subsoils
are moderately compacted with accumulations of lime. Surface and subsoil drainage tends to
be poor.

The Soil Survey of Colusa County also provides a more detailed classification of soils. Figure 4.6-1 identifies each soil type relative to their location throughout the proposed Planning Area. Generally, four types of soils are found:

Moonbend Silt Loam

Moonbend silt loam, composed primarily of alluvium, is generally found within the floodplain of the Sacramento River. It is a moderately well-drained soil with very little slope (0-2 percent), so runoff potential is very low. Its major use is for irrigated crops. Building limitations on this soil are considered severe due to a moderate shrink-swell potential (expansion and contraction of soil with moisture). The soil strength for roads and streets is ranked as low, posing another limitation.

Colusa Loam

Colusa loam, also composed primarily of alluvium, is generally found south of the City of Colusa. lt is a somewhat poorly drained soil with very little slope (0-2 percent). Runoff potential is very low. Its major use is for irrigated crops. Building limitations on this soil are considered severe due to moderate shrink-swell potential and wetness 2.5-6 feet below ground surface. The soil strength for roads and streets is ranked as moderate, posing a moderate limitation.

Grandbend Loam

Grandbend loam is composed primarily of alluvium. It is generally found along the Sacramento River. It is a somewhat poorly drained soil with very little slope (0-2 percent). Runoff potential is very low. Its major use is for irrigated crops. Building limitations on this soil are considered severe due to moderate shrink-swell potential and wetness approximately 2.5 feet below ground surface. The soil strength is considered adequate for roads and streets.

4.6 GEOLOGY, SEISMICITY, SOILS AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS

Vina Loam

As with the other major soils in the proposed Planning Area, Vina loam is composed primarily of alluvium. It is generally found in small areas along the Sacramento River. It is a well-drained soil with very little slope (0-2 percent), so runoff potential is very low. Its major use is for irrigated crops. The only building limitation identified with this soll is flooding, as is the case with the other soils given their location within the Sacramento River floodplain. Section 4.7, Hydrology and Water Quality, discusses potential flooding hazards.

MINERAL RESOURCES

Mining has been a significant part of Colusa County's economy throughout its history. Most mining activily has occurred in the western portion of the County. In the past, the City of Colusa extracted sand and gravel resources. Currently, there is no mining activity occurring within the proposed Planning Area.
The California Geological Survey, formerly the Division of Mines and Geology, has a project a that assists in the protection and development of mineral resources through the land-use planning process. The Surface Mining and Reclamation Act of 1975 (SMARA) requires this project. The primary products of this project are mineral land classification maps and reports, which designate Mineral Resource Zones. Lands are classified by the presence of mineral resources and their potential value. Local agencies are required to use the classification information when
developing land use plans and when making land use decisions. The proposed Planning Area does not have any Mineral Resource Zones designated within its boundaries. Neither the City's existing General Plan nor the County's General Plan identifies any mineral resources in the
proposed Planning Area.

GEOLOGIC HAZARDS

Earthquakes

There are no known active faults within Colusa County. However, the possibility of an earthquake affecting the City of Colusa cannot be ruled out. Colusa County is vulnerable to moderate ground shaking from earthquakes centered outside of the County. Four minor quakes on an unknown fault in the foothills occurred in 1985.

The severity of an earthquake can be expressed in terms of both magnitude and intensity. Magnitude is a measure of the strength of an earthquake, commonly presented in terms of the Richter scale. The intensity of an earthquake describes the impacts on people and structures, presented in terms of the Modified Mercalli scale. Table 4.6-1 compares magnitudes and intensities. Earthquakes of a maximum magnitude of 5.7 on the Richter scale could occur at the nearest known fault at the Sutter Buttes. This could cause ground shaking in Colusa County at intensities from Vl to VII on the Modified Mercalli scale. The effects of earthquakes of these intensities on structures are described as minor to moderate, with damage occurring primarily to chimneys and architectural ornaments. According to the Safety Element of the proposed General Plan, the best geologic evidence indicates that Colusa would experience only low- intensity shaking from faults outside the County.

Ground Shaking
In populated areas, the greatest potential for loss of life and property damage is a result of ground shaking from a nearby earthquake. The degree of damage depends on many interrelated factors. Among these factors are the Richter magnitude, focal depth, distance from the causative fault, source mechanism, duration of shaking, high rock accelerations, type of surface deposits or bedrock, degree of consolidation of surface deposits, presence of high ground water, topography, and design, type, and quality of building construction.
As previously noted, no active or potentially active faults underlie the City of Colusa, based on published geologic maps. Surface evidence of faulting has not been observed. However,
Colusa County may experience ground shaking from earthquakes outside the County. The Sa Andreas Fault, Hayward Fault, Cleveland Hills Fault and other active faults are within 150 miles of
the City. These faults are capable of generating earthquakes that could be felt in the proposed Planning Area. However, these earthquakes are not expected to cause any major catastrophes in the proposed Planning Area.

4.6 GEOLOGY, SEISMICITY, SOILS AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS

Liquefaction

Liquefaction is the loss of soil strength due to seismic forces generating various types of ground failure. The potential for liquefaction must account for soil types and density, the groundwater
table, and the duration and intensity of ground shaking. Based upon known soil, groundwater, and ground shaking conditions, the potential for liquefaction within the proposed Planning Area iS considered low. The potential for ground lurching, differential settlement or lateral spreading occurring during or after seismic events in the proposed Planning Area is also considered low.
Expansive Soils
Soils that contain relatively high clay content have the potential to shrink and swell with changing moisture conditions. As noted previously, several of the soils identified within the
proposed Planning Area have a moderate shrink-swell potential. These include the Moonbend silt loam, the Colusa loam and the Grandbend loam. The expansion and contraction of these soils can cause damage to building foundations, streets and other infrastructure. Proper engineering and construction techniques can eliminate expansive soil problems.

Subsidence

Subsidence is the gradual settling or sinking of the earth's surface with little or no horizontal motion. There are five potential causes of subsidence - compaction by heavy structures, compaction of unconsolidated soils by earthquake shaking, erosion of peat soils, peat oxidation, and withdrawal from underground deposits. Underground deposits include groundwater, oil
and natural gas. The City of Colusa is in an area of known low subsidence, primarily due to
groundwater pumping. However, groundwater levels have remained relatively steady, preventing subsidence from occurring (Department of Water Resources, 2003). In normal years, the eastern Colusa groundwater sub-basin, which includes the proposed Planning Area, has a water table that is stabilized or at its upper limits (Jenkins, 1992).

Other Potential Hazards

There is no potential in the proposed Planning Area for landslides to occur, since the topography is flat. There are no oceans or large bodies of water in the Planning Area, so there is little or no possibility for seiches or tsunamis to occur. The nearest volcano to Colusa that could be potentially active is Lassen Peak, approximately 93 miles to the northeast. Depending on its strength and direction, and on weather conditions, a Lassen Peak eruption conceivably could deposit ash on the proposed Planning Area. However, significant damage from an eruption is unlikely.

HAZARDOUS MATERIALS

A material is considered hazardous if it appears on a list of hazardous materials prepared by a federal, State, or local agency, or if it has characteristics defined as hazardous by such an agency. A hazardous material is defined in Title 22 of the California Code of Regulations (CCR)
as:

A substance or combination of substances which, because of its quantity, concentration, or physical, chemical or infectious characteristics, may either (1) cause, or significantly contribute to, an increase in mortality or an increase in serious irreversible, or incapacitating reversible, illness; or a (2) pose a substantial present or potential hazard to human health or environment

City of Colusa Colusa General Plan
July 2007 Draft Master Environmental Impact Report
4.6-5

4.6 GEOLOGY, SEISMICITY, SOILS AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS

when improperly treated, stored, transported or disposed of or otherwise managed (California Code of Regulations, Tifle 22, Section 66260.10).
Chemical and physical properties that cause a substance to be considered hazardous, including the properties of toxicity, ignitability, corrosivity, and reactivity, are defined in the CCR, Title 22, Sections 66261.20 - 66261.24. Factors that influence the health effects of exposure to hazardous material include the dose to which the person is exposed, the frequency of exposure, the exposure pathway, and individual susceptibility.

Hazardous Materials Sites

The State of California Hazardous Waste and Substances Site List (also known as the "Cortese List") is a planning document used by state and local agencies to comply with CEQA requirements to provide information about the location of hazardous materials sites. Government Code Section 65962.5 requires the California Environmental Protection Agency (Cal-EPA) to annually update the Cortese List. The California Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) is responsible for preparing a portion of the information that comprises the Cortese List. Other state and local government agencies are required to provide additional hazardous material release information that is part of the complete List. A search of the Cortese List for Colusa County showed one potential hazardous material site: the PG&E Manufactured
Gas Plant site on the block bound by First, Second, Main and Market Streets. Currently used as a PG&E service center, this has been identified as having soil contaminated by arsenic and aromatic hydrocarbons. The State and PG&E have entered into an agreement for cleanup of the site. A Remedial Action Plan and accompanying CEQA environmental documentation is currently in process, with cleanup activities scheduled for completion in 2010. The DTSC also maintains the Envirostor database of hazardous material sites, accessible through the agency's website (www.dtsc.ca.gov/SiteCleanup). This database identified an additional site: the Colusa County Fairgrounds. This site was identified as having potential soil contamination from gasoline in an underground storage tank. This tank has been removed, along with surrounding soil, and the site is currently undergoing post-remediation monitoring by the Regional Water Quality Control Board (see also Table 4.6-2 below).
In addition, the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) maintains a list of leaking underground storage tank sites. These sites are potential areas of soil and/or water contamination. Table 4.6-2 lists the leaking underground storage tank sites on the most recent RWQCB list. Most cases are closed, as many of the sites have replaced their old underground storage tanks with those in compliance with newer State regulations, with remediation of identified contamination occurring concurrently with the replacement.

Transportation of Hazardous Materials
The transportation of hazardous materials within the proposed Planning Area is subject to various federal, State, and local regulations. The following provisions in the California Vehicle Code pertain to the transportation of hazardous materials.
The California Highway Patrol designates the routes in California which are to be used for the transportation of explosives (Section 31616).
The California Vehicle Code applies when the explosives are transported as a delivery service for hire, or in quantities in excess of 1,000 pounds. The transportation of explosives in quantities of 1,000 pounds a or less, or other than on a public highway, is subject to the California Health and Safety Code (Section 31601 (a)).
It is iliegal to transport explosives or inhalation hazards on any public highway not designated for that purpose, unless the use of the highway is required to permit delivery of, or the loading of, such materials (Section 31602(b) and Section 32104(a)).
When transporting explosives through or into a city for which a route has not been designated by the Highway Patrol, drivers must follow routes as may be prescribed or established by local authorities (Section 31614(a)).
Inhalation hazards and poison gases are subject to additional safeguards. These
materials are highly toxic, spread rapidly, and require rapid and widespread evacuation if there is loss of containment or a fire. The Highway Patrol designates through routes to
City of Colusa Colusa General Plan July 2007 Draft Master Environmental Impact Report
4.6-7

4.6 GEOLOGY, SEISMICITY, SOILS AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS

be used for the transportation of inhalation hazards. It may also designate separate through routes for the transportation of inhalation hazards composed of any chemical rocket propellant (Section 32100 and Section 32102(b)).
According to information from the Williams office of the California Highway Patrol, the main highway within the proposed Planning Area for the transport of hazardous materials is State
Route 20. Explosives require a permit for transportation by either a federal or State authority. Federal and State registries keep track of transport of other hazardous materials (Lt. Gary Teragawa, pers. comm., 2005). On local roads, vehicles may transport smaller quantities of materials classified as hazardous, such as fertilizers, nitrates and chlorine. While the materials are transported in quantities too small to cause widespread environmental damage, they are
nonetheless subject to strict regulations on their transport.

Major Hazardous Material Handling Facilities

There is one major industrial facility that potentially poses an offsite safety hazard within the proposed Planning Area: the Davies Oil Company, Inc. facility, which is located at the intersection of 14th Street and Lurline Avenue. This facility is just outside the Colusa City limits. It contains six aboveground storage tanks. Residences are located just to the north and south of the facility. Other uses within one-quarter mile of the facility include commercial, light industrial and governmental.
Another facility of concern is the California Department of Transportation's Colusa Maintenance Station, which is located adjacent to the Colusa County Fairgrounds and near Colusa High School. This facility has one 10,000 gallon aboveground storage tank containing diesel #2 fuel (http://www.documents.dgs.ca.gov/pd/contracts/fuelrates/bulkrates/PricingPages/Colusa.htm)

SPECIFIC POTENTIAL HAZARDOUS MATERIALS

Asbestos

Asbestos is a a general name for a group of naturally occurring minerals composed of small fibers. Most of these minerals are ultramafic, which contain 90 percent or more of the dark-colored iron-magnesium-silicate minerals olivine, augite, hypersthene and (less commonly) homblende. Another asbestos mineral is serpentine, found in the foothill regions of California. Based on information in a California Geological Survey report, it is unlikely that any naturally occurring asbestos minerals are located within the proposed Planning Area (California Geological Survey, 2000).

Asbestos has been commonly used in many building materials, which may include but are not limited to floor coverings, drywall joint compounds, acoustic-ceiling tiles, piping insulation, electrical insulation and fireproofing materials. Structures constructed or remodeled between 1930 and 1981 have the potential to contain building materials with asbestos. Various diseases have been associated with exposure to asbestos fibers, and the extensive use of asbestos in building materials has raised some concern about exposure in non-industrial settings. Health hazards associated with asbestos include increased risks of cancer and respiratory illnesses and diseases.

The presence of asbestos in a building does not mean that the health of building occupants is endangered. As long as asbestos-containing materials remain in good condition and are not disturbed or damaged, exposure is unlikely. However, damaged, deteriorated or disturbed asbestos-containing materials can lead to fiber release and exposure. Unauthorized removal or
Colusa General Plan City of Colusa Draft Master Environmental Impact Report July 2007
4.6-8

4.6 GEOLOGY, SEISMICITY, SOILS AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS

disturbance of asbestos materials also could result in adverse health effects. There are
numerous buildings and structures within the proposed Planning Area that were constructed between 1930 and 1981. The potential safety hazards resulting from asbestos are greatest during demolition activities, but rehabilitation of older buildings also poses a potential hazard.
Lead-Based Materials

Lead is a highly toxic metal used for many years in products found in and around homes. Lead may cause a range of adverse health effects, from behavioral problems and learning disabilities to seizures and death. Children six years old and under are most at risk. Research suggests that the primary sources of lead exposure for most children are deteriorating lead-based paint, lead- contaminated dust, and lead-contaminated residential soil. Exposure to lead from older vintage paint is possible when the paint is in poor condition or during paint removal. In construction settings, workers can be exposed to airborne lead during renovation, maintenance or removal work.

Lead-based paints were phased out of production in the early 1970s. Many in of the buildings and structures within the proposed Planning Area were constructed prior to the ban on lead-based paints. Therefore, it is possible that lead-based paints and materials are present in some structures. Proper handling and disposal of lead-based materials significantly reduces potential risks to human health and to the environment.

PCB Transformers

Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are a group of organic chemicals which can be odorless or mildly aromatic solids or oily liquids. They were formerly used as hydraulic fluids, lubricants, and fire retardants among other uses, as well as in heat transfer systems. In 1978, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) banned the manufacture of PCBs and regulated their use and disposal. PCBs have been identified as potential cancer-causing agents, and have been associated with other adverse health effects.
Despite the ban, certain sources of PCBs still exist. These include fluorescent light ballasts and electric transformers. Both of these potential PCB-containing sources potentially exist within the proposed Planning Area, particularly within older structures or with older power poles. The Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) provides electric service to the entire proposed Planning Area and is responsible for the operation, maintenance and repair of transformers and electrical facilities. Under a PCB reduction program, PG&E has removed from service more than 99 percent of the PCBs that existed in its electric distribution system, including PCBs in large • capacitors and network transformers (U.S. EPA and Environment Canada, 2004).
Residual Agricultural Chemicals

The proposed Planning Area is associated with a variety of agricultural uses. Currently, the main agricultural uses include row crops, field crops, orchards and cattle grazing lands. Most of the proposed Planning Area's agricultural land is outside the existing Colusa City limits. However, some parcels in the northeastern portior of the City are currently being farmed.
Residual chemicals associated with current and past agricuitural activities may be present at differing levels in the proposed Planning Area. Irrigated pasture, dry-farmed crops and natural grasses typically require little to no applications of environmentally persistent pesticides. Although irrigated row crops may have been subject to applications of restricted agricultural chemicals, restricted compounds are not necessarily persistent compounds. An example of a

City of Colusa Colusa General Plan
July 2007 Draft Master Environmental Impact Report
4.6-9

4.6 GEOLOGY, SEISMICITY, SOILS AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS

restricted but not persistent group of agricultural chemicals would be the triazine herbicides, which are often applied to corn crops. Over-the-counter insecticides and herbicides may have been used in the proposed Planning Area; however, these chemicals generally do not persist in soils for greater than one year from application. Orchards and orchard-cultivated soils may have been contaminated through repeated application of chemicals to fruit or nut trees. Specifically, lead-arsenates and organochlorine pesticides, "family" of compounds that
includes the banned DDT, may have been applied to the orchards.

Environmental Protection Agency
The EPA provides leadership in the nation's environmental science, research, education and
assessment efforts. The EPA works closely with other federal agencies, state and local governments, and Indian tribes to develop and enforce regulations under existing environmental laws. EPA is responsible for researching and setting national standards for a variety of environmental programs and delegates to states and tribes responsibility for issuing permits, and monitoring and enforcing compliance.

Other Federal Agencies

Other Federal agencies that regulate hazardous materials include the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the Department of Transportation (DOT), and the National Institute of Health (NIH). The following federal laws and guidelines govern hazardous materials.

Federal Water Pollution Control Act
Clean Air Act
Occupational Safety and Health Act Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) Guidelines for Carcinogens and Biohazards Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act Title III (SARA) I11 Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Safe Drinking Water Act
Toxic Substances Control Act

Prior to August 1992, the principal agency at the federal level regulating the generation, transport and disposal of hazardous waste was the EPA, under the authority of RCRA. As of August 1, 1992, the California Department of Toxic Substance Controi (DTSC) was authorized to implement the State's hazardous waste management program for the EPA. The EPA continues to regulate hazardous substances under CERCLA.

Clean Water Act

The Clean Water Act, first enacted in 1972, is the key legislation regulating surface water quality in the United States. The goal of the Clean Water Act is to restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the nation's waters. The statute employs a variety of regulatory and non-regulatory tools to sharply reduce direct pollutant discharges into waterways, finance municipal wastewater treatment facilities, and manage polluted runoff. The Clean Water Act does not deal directly with groundwater or with water quantity issues. While the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) establishes water quality regulations under the Clean Water Act, it delegates the actual implementation of many of these regulations to the states. In California, the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) and the local Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) carry out Clean Water Act regulations. Colusa County is
within the jurisdiction of the Central Valley RWQCB.
The SWRCB has issued a statewide General Construction Permit (Water Quality Order No. 99-08- DWQ) for construction activities within the state. The RWQCBs implement and enforce this construction permit, which applies to construction activities that disturb one acre or more of land. A condition of this permit is the preparation and implementation of a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) that identifies Best Management Practices (BMPs) to minimize pollutants from discharging from the construction site. The SWRCB currently is in the is process of

City of Colusa Colusa General Plan July 2007 Draft Master Environmental Impact Report
4.6-11

4.6 GEOLOGY, SEISMICITY, SOILS AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS

reissuing the statewide General Construction Permit with some modifications. The modifications would achieve three primary goals: create a "risk-based" permit that appropriately allocates responsibilities and requirements to projects based on their relative risk 1o water quality, obtain better measures of performance from projects, and establish a standard for new and redevelopment projects that address impacts related to hydromodification (alteration of stream channel due to changes in sediment load).
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)
The EPA has established the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program to control pollutants discharged by various activities, including industrial operations, wastewater systems and municipal storm water systems. In California, the RWQCBs implement the NPDES program. The NPDES program has a permitting process for construction work. Under the NPDES General Construction Permit (NPDES No. CAS000002, Order No. 99-08-DWQ) process, projects that disturb one or more acres of lands are required to obtain a permit before the start of construction work. Typically, the permit attaches conditions that include the preparation of a SWPPP. The SWPPP describes the best management practices {BMPs) that would be employed to prevent loosened soils carried by storm water runoff from entering local streams and other water bodies. The reader is referred to Section 4.6, Hydrology and Water Quality, for additional discussion of the NPDES program.

STATE

Alquist-Priolo Act
The Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act of 1972 (California Code of Regulations, Title 14, Section 3600) sets forth policies and criteria that prohibit the location of developments and structures for human occupancy across the trace of active faults. The policies and criteria are limited to potential hazards resulting from surface faulting or fault creep within Earthquake Fault Zones delineated on maps officially issued by the State Geologist.
"Sufficiently Active" and "Well Defined" are the two criteria used by the State to determine if a fault should be zoned under the Alquist-Priolo Act. A "sufficiently active fault" has evidence of Holocene surface displacement along one or more of its segments or branches. A "well-defined fault" is one whose trace clearly detectable by a trained geologist as a physical feature at a or just below the ground surface.

California Environmental Protection Agency
The California Environmental Protection Agency (Cal-EPA) establishes rules governing the use of hazardous materials and the management of hazardous waste. Applicable state and local laws include the following:

Public Safety/Fire Regulations/Building Codes
Hazardous Waste Control Law
Hazardous Substances Information and Training Act Air Toxics Hot Spots and Emissions Inventory Law Underground Storage of Hazardous Substances Act Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act
Subsequent development under the proposed General Plan may be subject to one or more of the above laws.

Colusa General Plan City of Colusa Draft Master Environmental Impact Report July 2007
4.6-12

4.6 GEOLOGY, SEISMICITY, SOILS AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS

Department of Toxic Substances Control

Within Cal-EPA, the Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) has primary regulatory responsibility, with delegation of enforcement to local jurisdictions that enter into agreements with the state agency, for the management of hazardous materials and the generation, transport and disposal of hazardous waste under the authority of the Hazardous Waste Control Law (HWCL),
Subdivision Map Act
The Subdivision Map Act (California Government Code Section 66410 et seq.) governs the subdivision of land in California. Government Code Section 66490 requires a preliminary soils report for every subdivision for which a final map is required. The soils report must be prepared by a civil engineer registered in California, and must be based on adequate test borings. The local jurisdiction may enact an ordinance requiring a preliminary soils report for other subdivisions. Government Code Section 66491 allows a local jurisdiction to enact an ordinance providing for a waiver a of a preliminary soils report if, based on its knowledge of the soils in the proposed subdivision, it determines no preliminary analysis is necessary, It also permits an ordinance that allows a jurisdiction to request additional information if soils problems are encountered or if the preliminary soils report is determined to be incomplete, inaccurate or unsatisfactory.

LOCAL

Colusa General Plan

The adopted City of Colusa General Plan is currently used as the "blueprint" to guide future development within the City limits and in unincorporated portions of the existing Planning Area. The proposed General Plan would replace the policies found in the adopted General Plan related to soils, geologic hazards, and hazardous materials.
California Building Code
The City of Colusa has adopted the 2001 California Code of Regulations, Title 24, also known as the California Building Standards Code or California Building Code. The California Building Code, based on the federal Uniform Building Codes, applies to building design and construction in the state of California, and provides minimum standards for building design. The California Building Code moditied Uniform Building Code regulations for specific conditions found in California and included a large number of more detailed and/or more restrictive regulations. For example, the California Building Code includes common engineering practices requiring special design and construction methods that reduce or eliminate potential expansive soil related impacts. It also requires structures to be built to withstand ground shaking in areas of high earthquake hazards, and the placement of strong motion instruments in larger buildings to monitor and record the response of the structure and the site of seismic activity.
City of Colusa Emergency Operations Plan
The City of Colusa Emergency Operations Plan addresses Colusa's planned response to extraordinary emergency situations associated with natural disasters, technological incidents, and nuclear defense operations. It provides operations concepts relating to the various emergency situations, identifies components of the Local Emergency Management Organization, and describes the overall responsibilities of the organization for protecting life and

property and assuring the overall well-being of the populations. The plan also identifies the sources of outside support which might be provided (through mutual aid and specific statutory authorities) by other jurisdictions, state and federal agencies, and the private sector.
4.6.3 IMPACTS AND MITIGATION MEASURES

STANDARDS OF SIGNIFICANCE

Based on Appendix G of the CEQA Guidelines, geology, soils and hazardous materials impacts are considered to be significant the following could result from the implementation of the General Plan update:
1) Exposure of people or structures to potential substantial adverse effects, including the risk of loss, injury or death, involving:

i) Rupture of a known earthquake fault, as delineated on the most recent Alquist- Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Map issued by the State Geologist for the area or based on other substantial evidence of a known fault;
ii) Strong seismic ground shaking;
ii) Seismic-related ground failure, including liquefaction;
iv) Landslides.
2) Substantial soil erosion or the loss of topsoil.
3) Location of development on a geologic unit or soil that is unstable, or that would become unstable as a result of development, and potentially result in on- or off-site landslide, lateral spreading, subsidence, liquefaction or collapse.

4) Location of development on expansive soil, as defined in Table 18-1-B of the Uniform Building Code (1994), creating substantial risks to life or property.
5) Location of development on soils incapable of adequately supporting the use of septic tanks or alternative wastewater disposal systems, where sewers are not avaiiable for the disposal of wastewater.

6) Creation of a significant hazard to the public or the environment through the roufine transport, use, or disposal of hazardous materiais.
7) Creation of a significant hazard to the public or the environment through reasonably foreseeable upset and accident conditions involving the release of hazardous materials into the environment.

8) Hazardous emissions or handling of hazardous or acutely hazardous materials, substances, or waste within one-quarter mile of an existing or proposed school.
9) Location of development on a site which is included on a list of hazardous materials sites compiled pursuant to Government Code Section 65962.5 and, as a result, would it create a significant hazard to the public or the environment.
10) Impairment of the implementation of, or physical interference with, an adopted emergency response plan or emergency evacuation plan.

4.6 GEOLOGY, SEISMICITY, SOILS AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS

METHODOLOGY

This analysis of hazards, human health and risk of upset included the review of existing documentation, field review of the proposed Planning Area and consultation with applicable local, state, and federal agencies. Documentation related to hazardous materials included a quarterly report on leaking underground storage tank sites by the Central Valley RWQCB, and a review of hazardous material site information on the website of the California Department of Toxic Substances Control. Also reviewed was a California Geological Survey report on naturally occurring asbestos and a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency/Environment Canada joint document on PCBs. Refer to Section 4.7, Hydrology and Water Quality, for a discussion of impacts associated with water quality and flooding. Hazards associated with transportation facilities, including potential hazards associated with Colusa County Airport operations, are described in Section 4.3, Transportation and Circulation. Section 4.11, Community Services, provides information on potential wildfire hazards.

As no mineral resources are identified within the proposed Planning Area, impacts to mineral resources are considered less than significant and will not be further analyzed.

IMPACTS AND MITIGATION MEASURES FOR THE GENERAL PLAN UPDATE

Soil Erosion

Impact 4.6.1 Construction and site preparation activities associated with increased development resulting from implementation of the proposed General Plan would disturtb soils, thereby increasing potential soil erosion from wind and water and siltation of local drainages during construction. This is considered a less than signific ant impact.
Most soils in the proposed Planning Area have low erosion potential, due to vegetation cover and lack of slopes. Implementation of the proposed General Plan may include infrastructure roadway improvements, substantial infrastructure, and development projects that may involve activities such as grading, trenching, excavation, cut and fill, and other activities that disturb the ground surface. Such activities loosen the soils directly and by removing vegetation. The exposed soils thereby become more likely to be eroded by storm water runoff and by wind. Erosion increases the amount of sediments carried by runoff into the Sacramento River, thereby decreasing its water quality (see Section 4.7, Hydrology and Water Quality). It also can clog the local storm water drainage system, reducing its capacity. Deposits of sediments on local streets can partially obstruct traffic flow and create a safety hazard. Wind erosion increases dust emissions, reducing air quality (see Section 4.5, Air Quality).
The Colusa County Air Pollution Control District has rules and regulations that reduce impacts of earth-disturbing activities (see Section 4.5, Air Quality). in addition, project applicants for construction activities involving clearing, grading or excavation that causes soil disturbance on one or more acres (or any project involving less than one acre that is part of a larger development plan) would be required to obtain a National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit from the Regional Water Quality Control Board (see Section 4.7, Hydrology and Water Quality).

Policy PRC-7.1 The City shall minimize soil erosion and sedimentation by maintaining compatible land uses, suitable building designs and appropriate construction techniques.

Implementing Action PRC-7.1.a: Best Management Practices

The City will require that developers use best management practices (BMPs) as recommended by the U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). Approaches to design, construction,
and maintenance techniques shouid ensure that development would not cause or worsen
erosion and sedimentation. Techniques will include erosion and sediment control practices,
such as hay bales, turbidity screens, temporary vegetation, and other management practices
during construction. The City will require that these measures be left in place until disturbed
areas are stabilized with permanent vegetation that will prevent the transport of sediment
offsite.

Implementing Action PRC-7.1.b: Deveiopment Review

Developments will be reviewed to ensure that sound soil conservation practices and
minimization of land alterations are incorporated into project design and construction.
Implementing Action PRC-7.1.c: Grading and Erosion Control Ordinance
The City will adopt and implement a grading and erosion control ordinance that includes specific standards for project construction and erosion control. This ordinance will address prompt revegetation of disturbed areas, avoidance of grading activities during wet weather, avoidance of drainage corridors and riverbanks, and other erosion control measures.
Policy PRC-7.1 would require measures such as compatible land uses, buiiding design and construction techniques to minimize the loss of soils from erosion or sedimentation. The associated implementing actions describe these proposed soil conservation measures in more detail. Implementing Action PRC-7.1.a would require development projects to employ best management practices to control erosion and to minimize adverse impacts on the quality of nearby waters. Implementing Action PRC-7.1.b would ensure the incorporation of soil conservation measures during the development review process for individual projects. Implementing Action PRC-7.1.c would require adoption of a grading and erosion control ordinance that establishes soil conservation standards that all development projects must meet. While the proposed policies and implementing actions would contribute to lessening the amount of soil erosion, Implementing Action PRC-7.1.c has not been drafted, so specific provisions related to erosion control are unknown and the timing of the adoption of the ordinance is unknown. However, use of BMPs as described in Implementing Action PRC-7.1.a would limit potential soil erosion impacts to a level that is less than significant.
Additional Mitigation Measures

None required.

Expansive Soils

Impact 4.6.2 Implementation of the proposed General Pian would lead to more development on soils with a shrink-swell potential. This is considered a less than significant impact.
As described previously, three predominant soil types within the proposed Planning Area contain at least a moderate shrink-swell potential: Moonbend silt loam, Colusa loam, and Grandbend loam. Expansion and contraction of these soils, due to moisture, can cause damage to building foundations. This would present a building safety hazard and would necessitate expensive repairs. Expansive soils could also cause damage to streets, pipelines and other infrastructure, creating potential health and safety hazards.
As previously noted, the City has adopted the 2001 California Building Code. The California Building Code includes common engineering practices requiring special design and construction methods that reduce or eliminate potential expansive soil related impacts. In addition, for subdivision projects requiring a final map, the Subdivision Map Act requires a preliminary soils report.
Proposed General Plan Policies and Implementing Actions that Mitigate Potential Impacts

Safety Element

Policy SAF-1.1 The City shall continue to mitigate the potential impacts of seismic and geologic hazards.
Implementing Action SAF-1.1.a: Development Review
The City will continue to refer all development proposals to the Fire and Building Department/Building Division, Public Works Department, and City Engineer to address potential seismic or geologic impacts. The City will require development applicants to provide specific data requirements pertaining to potentiai seismic and geologic hazards and, where necessary, require geotechnical reporting by a licensed soils or geotechnical engineer. In all development review, the City will continue to enforce the Uniform Building Code, inciuding seismic design provisions. These review requirements will apply to all public and private building construction.
Implementing Action SAF-1.1.b: Subdivision Ordinance Review
The City will review and revise its Subdivision Ordinance as needed to incorporate specific data and design requirements related to ground failure and other seismic and geological hazards that are contained in this General Plan update.
Policy SAF-1.1 would establish as City policy the mitigation of geologic impacis, including those associated with soils. Implementing Action SAF-1.1.a would require identification of potential geologic hazards, including expansive soils, during the development review process and require mitigation if necessary. Implementing Action SAF-1.1.b would amend the Subdivision Ordinance to include requirements related to geologic hazards such as expansive soils. However, implementation of implementing Action SAF-1.1a would ensure that potential geologic hazards, including expansive soils, are identified and mitigated during the development review process. Implementation of the proposed General Plan policies and implementing actions, along with compliance with the expansive soil provisions of the California Building Code, would eliminate potential expansive soil hazards. Impacts after implementation would be less than signiticant.

Seismic Hazards

Impact 4.6.3 Implementation of the proposed General Plan would expose new development to potential ground shaking hazards. This is considered a less
than signific ant impact.
As described previously, the City is not subject to many seismic hazards. However, ground shaking caused by an earthquake is a potential hazard to City residents and structures. While there are no identified active faults within the proposed Planning Area or in Colusa County, faults from outside the County may generate earthquakes of sufficient strength to be felt in the City, and possibly cause some damage. These faults include the Cleveland Hill Fault in Butte County, and the San Andreas, Hayward and other faults in the San Francisco Bay Area. Some of the older buildings in Colusa may suffer damage from ground shaking, particularly buildings with un-reinforced masonry. Employees and visitors within these buildings, as well as pedestrians outside, face a potential risk of injury and even death. Seismic activity may also induce liquefaction, although the probability this event would occur is low. Liquefaction could cause is damage to buildings and streets.
As previously noted, the City has adopted the 2001 California Building Code. It requires structures to be built to withstand ground shaking in areas of high earthquake hazards. Compliance with California Building Code regulations would ensure the adequate design and construction of building foundations to resist soil movement. All development projects associated with the proposed General Plan are subject to California Building Code standards, which require a seismic evaluation and particular seismic design criteria to reduce ground shaking effects.

Implementing Action SAF-1.1.c: Un-reinforced Masonry Plan
The City will consider a plan to identify older masonry structures that could be significantly impacted due to an earthquake. The plan may include, but may not be limited to, an inventory of un-reinforced masonry buildings and an assessment of their damage potential, a program to retrofit un-reinforced masonry buildings or to take other actions to reduce the potential risk, and funding sources for the adopted program.

Policy SAF-1.2 The City will continue to maintain current information on seismic hazards and take appropriate action if significant seismic hazards, including potentially active faults, are discovered within the City or the Planning Area.

Colusa General Plan City of Colusa Draft Master Environmental Impact Report July 2007

4.6 GEOLOGY, SEISMICITY, SOILS AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS

implementing Action SAF-1.2.a: Seismic Information Update

The City will monitor California Geological Survey studies for potentially active fauits in the vicinity of Colusa. Information on a previously unknown or inactive fault that is discovered or becomes active can be obtained by monitoring such studies. If any such fault in the region is discovered, the City will consider modifications to its development and building codes to reduce potential hazards. The City will periodically update its maps and information on seismic hazards for use in evaluating development proposals. As part of its annual review of the General Plan, the City will
update its information on seismic and geologic hazards.
AS described under Impact 4.6.2, Policy SAF-1.1 and Implementing Actions SAF-1.1.a and 1.1.b would address potential impacts of seismic and geologic hazards on structures. Policy SAF-1.2 and Implementing Actions SAF-1.1.c and SAF-1.2.a specifically address potential seismic hazards. Implementing Action SAF-1.1.c would reduce the hazard posed by un-reinforced masonry buildings, which can be easily damaged during an earthquake and threaten lives. Under Implementing Action SAF-1.2.a, the City would monitor reports for potentially active faults in the vicinity. Depending on the potential frequency and intensity of earthquakes that may occur on identified faults, the City would consider modifications to its development and building codes to account for the potential hazard. However, implementation of Implementing Action SAF-1.1a would ensure that potential seismic hazards, including those associated with new faults, are identified and mitigated during the development review process. Implementation of the proposed General Plan update policies and implementing actions, along with compliance with the seismic safety provisions of the California Building Code, would reduce or eliminate the potential damage caused by seismic events. Impacts after implementation would be less than
significant.

Additional Mitigation Measures

None required.

Hazardous Material Use, Storage and Transport

Impact 4.6.4 Implementation of the proposed General Plan would lead to the
establishment of more land use activities that would use and/or store
hazardous materials, and increase the amount of traffic carrying these is materials. This is considered a less than significant impact.
The General Plan update encourages development of a range of land uses. Many of these uses, particularly commercial and industrial, would involve the use, transport and/or storage of hazardous materials (e.g., gasoline fuels, demolition materials, asphalt, lubricants, toxic solvents, pesticides, and herbicides) during the construction and operation of such uses. Implementation of the proposed General Plan would likely increase the use of hazardous materials in the proposed Planning Area. This would increase the likelihood of local residents and employees coming into contact with such materials, as well as increase the potential risk of an accident that could cause serious injury or death. The Use, storage and transport of hazardous materials during the course of future development are required to be in compliance with local, state and federal regulations during project construction and operation.
Moreover, increased usage of hazardous materials would result in more such materials being transported to the Planning Area. Risks associated with the transport of hazardous material include accidents or spills that release these materials into the environment. The transportation

of hazardous materials on area roadways is regulated by the CHP, U.S. Department of Transportation, and Caltrans; the use of these materials is regulated by the DTSC.
Proposed General Plan Policies and Implementing Actions that Mitigate Potential Impacts

Safety Element

Policy SAF-4.1 The City shall require the disclosure of the use and storage of hazardous materials in existing and proposed industrial, commercial, and public-use activities, and the siting of hazardous waste disposal facilities, in
accordance with federal, state and local regulations.
Implementing Action SAF-4.1.a: California Health and Safety Code Chapter 6.95 and Title 40,
Code of Federal Regulations

The City will comply with and enforce, to the extent feasible, Chapter 6.95, Section 25503 of the California Health and Safety Code governing the storage of hazardous materials. Where appropriate, the City will also ensure compliance with Titie 40, Part 112, of the Code of Federa! Regulations, which requires preparation of a Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasures (SPCC) Plan, a plan similar, but more detailed, than the Hazardous Materials Business Pian required under the State Code, for businesses that store hazardous wastes in excess of standards
set in the statute. These statutes will apply to hazardous chemical storage at all City-owned and operated facilities.

implementing Action SAF-4.1.b: Development Review

The City will refer any development proposal that may be affected by, or affect, the storage, handling, disposal or transportation of hazardous materials to the Fire Department, the Colusa County Sheriff's Office, and other appropriate agencies for review. When required, a Hazardous
Material Business Plan will be prepared and submitted in accordance with County procedures. The Business Plan will contain all provisions required by Assembly Bill 2185, Department of
Transportation (DOT) and Cal-OSHA regulations for environmental controls of hazardous
materials, and other provisions that may be required by the County.

Policy SAF-4.2 The City shall it ensure that it maintains sufficient resources, contacts, and personnel to provide the public with emergency notification in the event of a hazardous materials spill or airborne release.

Implementing Action SAF-4.2.a: interagency Coordination
The City will utilize contacts with County agencies and special districts to deveiop coordinated plans to respond to hazardous material spills or releases. The City will also keep abreast of, and where appropriate implement, Office of Emergency Services hazardous spill prevention and planning programs.
Policy SAF-4.3 The City shall conduct education and outreach to City residents
regarding hazardous materials.

implementing Action SAF-4.3.a: Hazardous Materials Education
The City will continue its information programs regarding hazardous materials, including asbestos and lead-based paint. In addition, the City may expand its program by offering information on

4.6 GEOLOGY, SEISMICITY, SOILS AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS

less hazardous alternatives to household products that could present hazards to human heaith
and the environment.

Policy SAF-4.1 and Implementing Action SAF-4.1.a would require users of hazardous materials to comply with applicabie regulations related to the use and storage of hazardous materials, which are designed to reduce potential hazards. Implementing Action SAF-4.1.b would review projects that propose the use and/or storage of hazardous materials by agencies that deal with hazardous materials for their comments and recommend mitigation measures, if any. The action also requires the submittal of a Hazardous Materials Business Plan when development projects meet established criteria. Policy SAF-4.2 and Implementing Action SAF-4.2.a would ensure adequate resources and personnel would be available to contain a hazardous material incident in the proposed Planning Area. Policy SAF-4.3 and Implementing Action SAF-4.3.a would educate the public on hazardous materials, thereby making the public more aware of potential hazards and how to avoid them. Implementation of the proposed General Plan update policies and implementing actions would reduce or eliminate the potential hazards posed by the increased use, storage and transport of hazardous materials engendered by future development. Impacts after implementation would be less than signiticant.
Additional Mitigation Measures

None required.

Hazardous Materials Contamination

Impact 4.6.5 Implementation of the proposed General Plan may lead to development on or adjacent to hazardous material contamination sites. This is considered a significant impact.
As previously noted, lists kept by State agencies identified some sites within the proposed Planning Area as areas of potential hazardous material contamination or locations using hazardous materials. Sites using or storing hazardous materials during the course of future development are required to be in compliance with local, state and federal regulations regarding the handling and storage of such materials. Many of the sites with hazardous contamination, mostly with leaking underground storage tanks, have been remediated and no longer pose a hazard. a However, a few sites are in various stages of cleanup. These sites are mainly in developed areas, but contamination could reach adjacent sites. If not remediated, this contamination could have adverse impacts on public health.

The General Plan update proposes more development on land outside the currently developed area. Portions of these lands have been used historically for agricultural activities, such as row crops and orchards. Typically, such operations have used chemicals such as pesticides, herbicides and fertilizers. Over time, these substances may have accumulated in the soil of these agricultural sites to a level that may present a potential health hazard to construction
workers and to future residents or employees on these sites.

Implementing Action SAF-4.2.a: Interagency Coordination (see Impact 4.6.4)

Policy SAF-4.1 would require users of hazardous materials to comply with applicable regulations related to the use and storage of hazardous materials, which are designed to reduce potential hazards. Implementing Action SAF-4.1.b would review projects that propose the use and/or storage of hazardous materials by agencies that deal with hazardous materials for their comments and recommend mitigation measures, if any. The action also requires the submittal of a Hazardous Materials Business Plan when development projects meet established criteria. Policy SAF-4.2 and Implementing Action SAF-4.2.a would ensure adequate resources and personnel would be available to contain a hazardous material incident in the proposed Planning Area. While implementation of the proposed General Plan update policies and implementing actions would reduce or eliminate the potential hazards posed by use of hazardous materials, impacts could occur as a result of existing hazardous materials contamination that could affect future development.

Additional Mitigation Measures

MM 4.6.5 As part of its Development Review process, the City shall require project applicants to submit a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment for their project site if the City determines the project may be on or near a potentially contaminated site. The Phase Environmental Site Assessment shall identify the potential for asbestos, lead and PCBs TO occur on the project site. The City may require a more detailed site assessment if it concludes that site
conditions warrant further analysis. If contamination of a project site is identified, the City shall require actions that eliminate the hazard posed by the contamination, or reduce it to a level that is less than significant. Actions may include, but are not limited to, removal of the contamination or avoidance of use of contaminated ground water.
Implementation of the above mitigation measure would ensure that potential hazardous materials contamination is discovered and mitigated prior to development. This measure, along with the General Plan policies and implementing actions discussed above, would reduce potential impacts associated with exposure to existing hazardous materials to a less than
significant impact.

Asbestos/Lead/PCBs

Impact 4.6.6 Implementation of the proposed General Plan may contain the potential for the discovery of known and unknown hazardous material contamination in areas proposed for development under the General Plan. This is considered a less than significant impact.

As noted previously, until 1981, numerous types of building materials contained considerable amounts of asbestos. Many of the existing structures in the proposed Planning Area were built prior to 1981, and therefore may have friable asbestos-containing materials. Many of these buildings may be altered, rehabilitated, demolished and/or removed due to development associated with the proposed General Plan update. Activities disturbing these structures may result in the airborne release of asbestos from asbestos-containing materials. No minerals associated with naturally occurring asbestos have been identified in the proposed Planning

4.6 GEOLOGY, SEISMICITY, SOILS AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS

Area, so hazards associated with the disturbance of these minerals from construction and other
activities would not occur.

In 1978, the EPA enacted regulations prohibiting the use of lead in paints and other construction
materials. There are several buildings and structures located in the proposed Planning Area that
were constructed prior to 1978. Therefore, it is possible that many of these older structures contain lead-based paint materials. Implementation of the proposed General Plan may include the alteration, rehabilitation, demolition and/or removal of some of these structures. These activities could release lead dust into the air, or cause pieces of lead-containing materials to fall
to the ground.
In 1978, the EPA banned the manufacture of PCBs and regulated their use and disposal. Under a PCB reduction program, PG&E has removed from service more than 99 percent of the PCBs that existed in its electric distribution system. Nevertheless, as previously mentioned, some older buildings in the proposed Planning Area may contain fluorescent light ballasts and electric
transformers that contain PCBs.

4.7 HYDROLOGY AND WATER QUALITY

This section analyzes potential impacts of the proposed General Plan Update on hydrology and
water quality. Specifically, this section describes drainage features within the proposed Planning Area and addresses key issues associated with storm drainage and flooding (stormwater and river/levee), surface water quality, groundwater, and exposure of structures to flood hazards.
Information in this section was based on interpretations of regulations, available data, available reports and other information, information obtained from City staff and other governmental agencies, and a water supply assessment by Tully and Young.

4.7.1 EXISTING SETTING

REGIONAL HYDROLOGY

The City of Colusa is located in the lower Sacramento River Valley and is bordered on the north and east by the Sacramento River itself. The Sacramento River flows in a south/southeasterly direction through the Sacramento River Valley. Levees that fall under the jurisdiction of Reclamation District No. 108 contain the Sacramento River in the Colusa area,

To the west of the City is a drainage feature called the Colusa Basin, served by the Colusa Drain. The Colusa Basin drains approximately 230,000 acres along the west side of the Sacramento River, extending as far north as the
City of Willows and as far south as the City of
Woodland. The main channel for the Colusa
Drain is an excavated earthen channel. Within
Colusa County, the channel depth is approximately 10-15 feet below the original ground elevation, and the average top width of the excavated section is approximately 100
feet. The channel has levees on both sides for
the most part, and levee height varies to a maximum of approximately six feet. There are additional levees along tributary drains that connect to the Colusa Drain. The Colusa Drain
discharges into the Sacramento River at Knights Landing, northeast of the City of Woodland.
Topography within the General Plan area generally falls to the south and west, toward the Colusa Drain and away from the Sacramento River. Elevations range from approximately 60 feet above mean sea level in the northernmost portions of the General Plan area to
approximately 45 feet above mean sea level in the southernmost portions. The overall gradients are typically very flat, and usually about 0.1 percent or less.
Hot, dry summers and moderately cool, wet winters characterize the climate of the City of Colusa. Average annual rainfall in Colusa is approximately 16.34 inches. Colusa usually experiences the majority of storm events from early November through early April. Snowfall is infrequent, seldom lasting for more than 24 hours. Summer average high temperatures reach 95 degrees during the month of July and average low temperatures drop to 36.8 degrees during the month of December. Rainfall depth for a 100-year storm event is about 3.98 inches in a 24- hour period. Peak flows in the Colusa Drain result from winter rainstorms. Peak flows in the
Sacramento River result from winter rainstorms or winter and spring snowmelt.

4.7 HYDROLOGY AND WATER QUALITY

LOCAL SURFACE WATER FEATURES

The main surface water feature in the proposed Planning Area is the Sacramento River. The Sacramento River is also the most significant natural water feature in the area. Lurline Creek,
Freshwater Creek and Salt Creek are in the general area of the City and flow west to east from the Coast Range foothills to Colusa. However, the Colusa Drain intercepts these creeks approximately three miles west of the City limits and re-directs their flow southward. All other water channels in the proposed Planning Area are manmade. Section 4.12, Public Services and
Utilities, discusses manmade drainage features. The only significant bodies of water in the
proposed Planning Area are a natural pond in the eastern portion and the manmade
wastewater treatment plant ponds southwest of the City.

GROUNDWATER

Groundwater in the proposed Planning Area comes from the Colusa Subbasin, a portion of a the
Sacramento Valley groundwater basin, as shown in Figure 4.7-1. The portion of the Sacramento Valley within the Colusa Subbasin is bounded on the east by the Sacramento River, on the west by the Coast Range and foothills, on the south by Cache Creek, and on the north by Stony Creek. The Colusa Subbasin aquifer system is composed of continental deposits of late Tertiary to Quaternary age.

The storage capacity of the subbasin was estimated based on estimates of specific yield for the
Sacramento Valley as developed in DWR Bulletin 118 (California Department of Water
Resources, 1978). The estimated storag capacity to a depth of 200 feet is approximately 13,025,887 acre-feet. Estimates of groundwater extraction for the Colusa Subbasin are based on
surveys conducted by the California Department of Water Resources during 1993, 1994, and 1999. Surveys included land use and sources of water. Estimates of groundwater extraction for agricultural, municipal and industrial, and environmental wetland uses are 310,000, 14,000 and 22,000 acre-feet respectively. Deep percolation from applied water is estimated to be 64,000 acre-feet. The Department of Water Resources has not identified the Colusa Subbasin as overdrafted in its DWR Bulletin 118. Also, there has been no indication of any existing or
anticipated overdraft condition in studies prepared by other entities (Tully and Young, 2007).

Numerous agricultural water suppliers overlay the Colusa groundwater subbasin. One of these, Glenn-Colusa Irrigation District (GCID) is the largest irrigation district in Colusa County, consisting of approximately 175,000 acres. Other irrigation districts located near the City of Colusa include Maxwell Irrigation District (MID) and Reclamation District 108 (RD 108). As a result of agricultural and domestic groundwater use within the Colusa Subbasin, groundwater levels vary seasonally. Declines in groundwater levels within Colusa County between spring 2006 and summer 2006
ranged from five to fifteen feet (Tully and Young, 2007).

Despite seasonal variations, long-term groundwater levels in the Colusa County portion of the Colusa Subbasin have remained relatively constant. This condition is likely the result of a combination of recharge from the river and surrounding mountains, as well as deep percolation of applied irrigation water from agricultural practices and rainfall throughout the Colusa Subbasin. A review of hydrographs for long-term comparison of spring-spring groundwater levels indicated a slight decline in groundwater levels associated with the 1976-77 and 1987-94 droughts, followed by recovery to pre-drought conditions of the early 1970s and 1980s. Some in wells increased in levels beyond the pre-drought conditions of the 1970s during the wet season of the early 1980s. Generally, groundwater level data show an average seasonal fluctuation of approximately feet for normal and dry years. Overall, there does not appear to be any increasing or decreasing trends in groundwater levels.

4.7 HYDROLOGY AND WATER QUALITY

The City of Colusa currently extracts groundwater from five wells at various locations throughout
the northern part of the City. Each of the City's wells is drilled to a uniform depth of 150 feet,
extracting groundwater from the alluvial formation of the Colusa groundwater subbasin. The
Alluvial aquifer system is the uppermost groundwater bearing unit, reaching from ground surface
to maximum depth of about 200 feet. Many domestic wells draw water from this aquifer system.
In the northern Sacramento Valley, the alluvial aquifer system is comprised of the following four different subgroups, according to geologic material, location and age of the geologic material, and the different rates each of the subgroups yield groundwater: (1) Stream Channel Deposits; (2) Basin Deposits; (3) Modesto Formation; and (4) Riverbank Formation. (UC Extension Groundwater Flyer.)

Annual groundwater pumping by the City of Colusa for the past five years has ranged from 1,671 acre-feet in 2005 and 1,948 acre-feet in 2002, as shown in Table 4.7-1. Variations in climatic conditions can account for the difference in groundwater pumping, as little growth has occurred within the City's current limits.

FLOODING

From a local drainage standpoint, the City of Colusa has historically experienced drainage issues, particularly in the eastern portions of the City. Flooding occurs even during mild storms. This flooding creates circulation issues associated with street flooding and causes some property damage. However, this type of flooding is short-term in nature, and usuailly subsides within a few hours. Refer to Section 4.13, Public Services and Utilities, for a discussion of the City's storm water
drainage system.

From a broader perspective, the proposed Planning Area is subject to varying degrees of potential flooding from the Sacramento River and the Colusa Drain (Figure 4.7-2). According to Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in 2003, the majority of is the General Plan area is located in Zone X. Zone X designates areas that are subject to flooding during a 500-year storm event, or areas protected by levees
from flooding during a 100-year storm event.
The western portions of the General Plan area are in Zone AE, which outlines the 100-year floodplain. The Zone AE designation reflects FEMA's conclusion that the levee system along the Colusa Drain does not meet the standards set forth in its levee policy. Therefore, FEMA
computed the floodplain on the landward side of the Colusa Drain levee system under the assumption that the Colusa Drain levees do not act as an effective flow barrier. Base flood elevations for the 100-year flood, represented on the FIRMs for the western portion of the

proposed Planning Area, range from elevation 52 feet at the north portion of the impacted area to elevation 49 feet near the south portion of the impacted area.
The County of Colusa completed a Phase I levee project in 2001, referred to as the Powell Slough Levee Project. The Phase I levee has alleviated flooding hazards to businesses and rural residences on the west side of Colusa. The southwestern area of the City, including land in its
sphere of influence, is still subject to backwater flooding during 10- to 100-year storm events. Another County-proposed flood control project designed in 2003, Powell Slough Levee Phase Il, would address the backwater flooding. Construction of this project has not been adopted by the County or any other agency, and no initiatives to date are in place to complete the project.

DAM FAILURE

Five reservoirs, which retain water from the Sacramento River or its tributaries, could cause damage in the City of Colusa if their dams were to fail: Lake Oroville, Shasta Lake, Whiskeytown Lake, Black Butte Lake, and East Park Reservoir. The Governor's Office of Emergency Services (OES) maintains maps of inundation resulting from hypothetical severe dam failure, which may occur primarily due to earthquake activity or unusual weather conditions.
Following is the projected time floodwaters from particular reservoirs would reach the City:

Lake Oroville: 8 hours
Lake Shasta: 42 hours
Black Butte Lake: 35 hours
Whiskeytown Lake: 82 hours
East Park Reservoir: 35 hours

The information presented above is based on worst-case scenarios. The time factor appears to allow for safe evacuation out of the Colusa area. It should be noted that the probability of dam
failure at any given time is very remote. The Division of Safety of Dams, a division of the
California Department of Water Resources, inspects dams under state jurisdiction on a periodic
basis for structural integrity. Responsibility for the safety of dams under federal jurisdiction belongs to the agency constructing the dam. Federal agency programs to maintain dam safety are based on the Federal Guidelines for Dam Safety prepared by FEMA.

WATER QUALITY

Surface Water

In order to maintain the beneficial uses of the Sacramento River and other bodies of water,
federal and State laws have established standards for water quality. The objectives of these
standards are to protect human health and to reduce adverse impacts on the environment.
Under the federal Clean Water Act Section 303(d), states are required to designate "impaired water bodies" that are not attaining water quality standards. The recent Section 303(d) list for California includes the segment of Sacramento River from Red Bluff to Knights Landing. This segment flows past the City of Colusa. According to the 303(d) list, the Sacramento River segment is impaired by an "unknown toxicity" the source of which is not known. No other pollutants were identified within the river segment. The Colusa Drain also is on the 303(d) list, as several contaminants have been identified in its waters. These include azinphos-methyl, carbofuran/furadan, diazinon, malathion, methyl parathion, molinate/odram, and Group A

Colusa General Plan City of Colusa

4.7 HYDROLOGY AND WATER QUALITY

pesticides. All these substances are agricultural chemicals and originate from agricultural operations. The Colusa Drain also contains an unknown toxicity, with agriculture as its source.
within an urban area, storm water runoff may carry various types of contaminants: motor vehicle oils and fluids, lawn/garden fertilizers, heavy metals, household cleaning products and others.
Since most drainage systems discharge their contents into local streams, storm water runoff can contribute to the pollution of these streams. As previously noted, most City runoff enters the Colusa Drain, which eventually discharges in to the Sacramento River farther south.

Groundwater Quality

Within the Colusa Subbasin, calcium-magnesium bicarbonate and magnesium-calcium
bicarbonate are the predominant groundwater types. Within the area from Williams-Colusa
south to Grimes, the predominant groundwater type is sodium bicarbonate. Groundwater in the Sacramento Valley has generally lower dissolved solid concentrations than other sub-regions in the Central Valley. In general, dissolved solid concentrations increase as the depth increases in the aquifer system. Therefore, the deeper wells are likely to produce water with larger dissolved solid concentrations than the shallower wells in the aquifer system.

High total dissolved solids (TDS), adjusted sodium absorption ratio (ASAR), nitrate and manganese impairment occur in the groundwater near Colusa. Elevated levels of TDS, ASAR and manganese are mainly a concern for irrigation water, as use of such water could harm crops. However, high concentrations of nitrate are potentially harmful to infants and young children. The source of nitrate pollution can be attributed to effluent from waste-treatment
facilities, discharge from septic tanks, or leaching of nitrogen fertilizers.

4.7.2 REGULATORY FRAMEWORK

FEDERAL

Clean Water Act

The Clean Water Act, first enacted in 1972, is the key legislation regulating surface water qucality in the United States. The goal of the Clean Water Act is to restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the nation's waters. The statute employs a variety of regulatory and non-regulatory tools to sharply reduce direct pollutant discharges into waterways, finance municipal wastewater treatment facilities, and manage polluted runoff. The Clean Water Act does not deal directly with groundwater or with water quantity issues. While the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) establishes water quality regulations under the
Clean Water Act, it delegates the actual implementation of many of these regulations to the states. In California, the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) and the local Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) carry out Clean Water Act regulations. Colusa County is within the jurisdiction of the Central Valley RWQCB.
The SWRCB has issued a statewide General Construction Permit (Water Quality Order No. 99-08- DWQ) for construction activities within the state. The RWQCBs implement and enforce this construction permit, which applies to construction activities that disturb one acre or more of land. A condition of this permit is the preparation and implementation of a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) that identifies Best Management Practices (BMPs) to minimize
pollutants from discharging from the construction site. The SWRCB currently is in the process of
reissuing the statewide General Construction Permit with some modifications. The modifications
would achieve three primary goals: create a "risk-based" permit that appropriately allocates

City of Colusa Colusa General Plan
July 2007 Draft Master Environmental Impact Report
4.7-5

4.7 HYDROLOGY AND WATER QUALITY

responsibilities and requirements to projects based on their relative risk to water quality, obtain
better measures of performance from projects, and establish a standard for new and redevelopment projects that address impacts related to hydromodification (alteration of stream channel due to changes in sediment load).

Section 303(d)

Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act requires that states make a list of waters that are not attaining water quality standards after implementation of technology-based limits. For waters on this list, the states must develop total maximum daily loads (TMDLs) that account for all
sources of the pollutants that placed the water on the list. These include "nonpoint" sources,
which are sources of pollutants not connected to a specific discharger, such as an industrial plant or a wastewater treatment plant. TMDLs are established at the level necessary to implement the applicable water quality standards. The Clean Water Act does not expressly require the implementation of TMDLs. However, in California, the SWRCB has interpreted State law to require that implementation be addressed when TMDLs become part of Basin Plans.

As previously noted, the Sacramento River and the Colusa Basin Drain are on the Section 303(d)
list. The Sacramento River was listed for an unknown toxicity, and the Colusa Basin Drain was listed for agricultural chemicals and for an unknown toxicity. Neither of these waters have
TMDLS. The Section 303(d) list considers development of TMDLs for these waters a "Low" priority except for azinphos-methyl and diazinon within the Colusa Basin Drain, which have a "Medium"
priority.

National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES)

The EPA has established the National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program to
control pollutants discharged by various activities,
including industrial operations, wastewater
systems and municipal storm water systems. In
California, the RWQCBs implement the NPDES
NO DUMPING! program.
*DRAINS TO WATERWAY Under NPDES, a permit is required for discharges from municipal separate storm sewer systems (MS4s) and industrial operations into streams and other bodies of water. Phase II of the NPDES program, initiated in 1999, extended the permit requirement to include MS4s of any size within an urbanized area as defined by the U.S. Census. The City of Colusa currently is not within an urbanized area; therefore, its storm water drainage system currently does not require a NPDES permit.

Industrial activities in Colusa that discharge storm water are subject to a NPDES General Industrial Permit for such discharges (Water Quality Order No. 97-03-DWQ). This permit requires the implementation of management measures that will achieve the performance standard of best available technology (BAT) economically achievable and best conventional pollutant control technology (BCT). The General Industrial Permit also requires the preparation of a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP), a monitoring plan and an annual report.
The NPDES program has a permitting process for construction work. Under the NPDES General Construction Permit (NPDES No. CAS000002, Order No. 99-08-DWQ) process, projects that disturb

4.7 HYDROLOGY AND WATER QUALITY

one or more acres of lands are required to obtain a permit before the start of construction work. Typically, the permit attaches conditions that include the preparation of a SWPPP. The SWPPP describes the best management practices (BMPs) that would be employed to prevent loosened soils carried by storm water runoff from entering local streams and other water bodies.

Certain actions within the proposed Planning Area may need to conform to a General Permit for dewatering and other low threat discharges to surface waters, (Water Quality Order No. 5-00- 175). This General Permit allows such discharges provided that they do not contain significant quantities of pollutants and are either (1) four months or less in duration, or (2) the average dry weather discharge does not exceed 0.25 million gallons per day (mgd). Activities that may require the acquisition of this permit include well development water, construction dewatering, pump/well testing, pipeline/tank pressure testing, pipeline/tank flushing or dewatering, condensate discharges, water supply system discharges, and other miscellaneous dewatering/low threat discharges.

Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
The City of Colusa is a participant in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), a Federal program administered by FEMA. Participants in the NFIP must satisfy certain mandated floodplain management criteria. The National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 has adopted as a
desired level of protection, an expectation that developments should be protected from
floodwater damage of the Intermediate Regional Flood. The Intermediate Regional Flood is defined as a flood that has an average frequency of occurrence of once every 100 years, although such a flood may occur in any given year. The Department of Water Resources occasionally audits communities to ensure the proper implementation of FEMA floodplain
management regulations.

STATE

Porter-Cologne Water Quality Act
The Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act, passed in 1969, is the primary State law regarding water quality. It established the SWRCB and divided the state into nine regions, each overseen by a RWQCB. The SWRCB is the primary state agency responsible for protecting the quality of the state's surface and groundwater supplies, but much of its daily implementation authority is delegated to the nine RWQCBs.
The Porter-Cologne Act assigns responsibility for implementing provisions of the federal Clean Water Act to the SWRCB and RWQCBs. In addition, the Porter-Cologne Act provides for the development and periodic review of water quality control plans (Basin Plans). The Basin Plans designate beneficial uses of California's major rivers and groundwater basins, and they establish
narrative and numerical water quality objectives for those waters. The applicable Basin Plan for
the proposed Planning Area is the Water Quality Controi Pian for the Sacramento River and San
Joaquin River Basins (Basin Plan), most recently updated in 1998.

4.7.3 IMPACTS AND MITIGATION MEASURES

STANDARDS OF SIGNIFICANCE

Based on Appendix G of the CEQA Guidelines, hydrology and water quality impacts are considered to be significant if the following could result from the implementation of the
proposed General Plan Update:

1. Violation of any water quality or waste discharge requirements.
2. Substantial depletion of groundwater supplies or substantial interference with
groundwater recharge such that there would be a net deficit in aquifer volume or a lowering of the local groundwater table level (e.g., the production rate of pre-existing nearby wells would drop to a level which would not support existing land uses or planned uses for which permits have been granted).
3. Substantial alteration of the existing drainage pattern of the site or area, including through the alteration of the course of a stream or river, in a manner which would result
in substantial erosion or siltation on- or off-site.

4. Substantial alteration of the existing drainage pattern of the site or area, including through the alteration of the course of a stream or river, or substantially increase the rate
or amount of surface runoff in manner which would result in flooding on-or off-site.
5. Creation of, or contribution to, runoff water which would exceed the capacity of existing
or planned storm water drainage systems or provide substantial additional sources of
polluted runoff.
6. Otherwise substantial degradation of water quality.
7. Placement of housing within a 100-year flood hazard area as mapped on a Federal Flood Hazard Boundary or Flood insurance Rate Map or other flood hazard delineation
map.

8. Placement within a 100-year flood hazard area structures which would impede or redirect flood flows.

9. Exposure of people or structures to a significant risk of loss, injury or death involving flooding, including flooding as a result of the failure of a levee or dam.
10. Inundation by seiche, tsunami, or mudflow.

METHODOLOGY

This analysis is based on a review of City documents, including the City of Colusa Subdivision Standards Resolution, along with meetings and discussions with City staff. The analysis reviewed U.S. Geological Survey topographic maps and aerial photographs, and considered various comments from letters received in response to the Notice of Preparation for this MEIR.

Administration (NOAA) provided background information on the local climate. Information on flooding came from FEMA maps covering the proposed Planning Area and FEMA's Flood Insurance Study for Colusa County, California and Incorporated Areas.
Information also was obtained from the City of Colusa Water Supply Evaluation, prepared by Tully and Young. The report evaluated potential water demand as a result of General Plan buildout, and available water supply. Since groundwater is the source of water in the proposed
Planning Area, the report focused on available groundwater supply and potential impacts of groundwater usage resulting from development under the proposed General Plan.
In addition, the analysis used the following sources of information:
A report entitled "Alternate Studies (Storage Ponds) for the Preliminary Drainage Study for the Easterly Portions of the City of Colusa and Goads Extension" by Lux Engineering & Surveying, Inc.
SWRCB Order No. 99-08-DWQ pertaining to construction activities within the state, Order No. 5-00-175 pertaining to dewatering and other low threat discharges to surface waters, Order No. 97-03-DWQ pertaining to storm water discharges associated with industrial activities, and Order No. 2003-0005-DWQ pertaining to storm water discharges from small
municipal separate storm sewer systems (MS4).

IMPACT STATEMENTS AND MITIGATION MEASURES FOR THE GENERAL PLAN UPDATE

Surface Water Quality - Construction Impacts

Impact 4.7.1 Project-related vegetation removal, excavation, grading, and other
construction activities involving soil disturbance may increase the potential for
erosion and sedimentation, thereby affecting water quality. This is considered a potentially significant impact.
Construction associated with development under the proposed General Plan Update typically would consist of grading and vegetation removal activities. Such activities would result in the exposure of raw soil materials to wind and rain, thereby increasing soil erosion rates within the development. In rainy periods during the summer season, grading operations may impact the surface runoff by increasing the amount of silt and debris carried by runoff. Areas with uncontrolled concentrated flow would experience loss of material within the graded areas, which could potentially impact the water quality of downstream areas and the Sacramento
River. The proposed Land Use Diagram anticipates development of approximately the 3,805- acre proposed Planning Area which includes currently undeveloped land within the existing Sphere of Influence and City limits and lands within the extended Planning Area boundary. These lands potentially would be disturbed by construction activities.
Refueling and parking of construction equipment and other onsite vehicles during construction
may result in spills of oil, grease or related pollutants that may discharge into drainages.
Improper handling, storage, or disposal of fuels and materials or improper cleaning of machinery close to area waterways also could cause water quality degradation.
As previously noted, the SWRCB has issued a statewide General Permit (Water Quality Order 99- 08-DWQ) for construction activities within the state. This permit applies to construction activities
that disturb one acre or more of land. It requires the preparation and implementation of a Storm
Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) that identifies Best Management Practices (BMPs) to

City of Colusa Colusa General Plan

4.7-9

4.7 HYDROLOGY AND WATER QUALITY

minimize pollutant discharges from the construction site. The SWPPP can be modified as
construction activity progresses. The permit also requires inspections of construction sites before and after storm events, and every 24 hours during extended storm events. The purpose of the inspections is to identify maintenance requirements for the BMPs and to determine the effectiveness of the implemented BMPs.

Proposed General Plan Policies and Implementing Actions that Mitigate Potential Impacts

Parks, Recreation and Resource Conservation Element

Policy PRC-7.1 The City shall minimize soil erosion and sedimentation by maintaining compatible land uses, suitable buiiding designs and appropriate construction
techniques.

Implementing Action PRC-7.1.a: Best Management Practices
The City will require that developers use Best Management Practices (BMPs) as recommended by the U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). Approaches to design, construction, and maintenance techniques should ensure that development would not cause or worsen erosion and sedimentation. Techniques will include erosion and sediment controi practices,
such as hay bales, turbidity screens, temporary vegetation, and other management practices during construction. The City will require that these measures be left in place until disturbed areas are stabilized with permanent vegetation that will prevent the transport of sediment
offsite.

Impiementing Action PRC-7.1.b: Development Review
Developments will be reviewed to ensure that sound soil conservation practices and
minimization of land alterations are incorporated into project design and construction.

Implementing Action PRC-7.1.c: Grading and Erosion Control Ordinance

The City will adopt and implement grading and erosion control ordinance that includes
specific standards for project construction and erosion control. This ordinance will address prompt revegetation of disturbed areas, avoidance of grading activities during wet weather, avoidance of drainage corridors and riverbanks, and other erosion control measures.

Additional Mitigation Measures

MM 4.7.1 All development project applications submitted to the City prior to the adoption of the Grading and Erosion Control Ordinance shall be required to submit an Grading and Erosion Control Plan which addresses prompt revegetation of disturbed areas, avoidance of grading activities during wet weather, avoidance of drainage corridors and riverbanks, and other erosion
control measures to the satisfaction of the City of Colusa.

Policy PRC-7.1 and the associated implementing actions would reduce the amount of sediments that enter streams and other water bodies through the use of best management practices to control soil erosion and to trap sediments, the incorporation of other measures deemed necessary by the City to reduce generation of sediments, and enforcement of provisions of a grading and erosion control ordinance. Specifically, Implementing Action PRC-7.1.b would
review projects for potential soil erosion impacts and recommend mitigation measures, if any. if

4.7 HYDROLOGY AND WATER QUALITY

Implementation of the proposed General Plan Update policies and action items, MM 4.7.1, along with adherence to the provisions of the NPDES General Construction Permit requirements, when applicable, would reduce impacts associated with construction water quality impacts to a less than signiticant level.

Surface Water Quality - Development Impacts

Impact 4.7.2 New development within the proposed Planning Area would introduce
sediments and constituent pollutants typically associated with urban
development into storm water runoff, thereby degrading downstream storm
water quality. This is considered a less than significant impact.

New development under the proposed General Plan Update would introduce constituents into storm water that are typically associated with urban runoff. These constituents include sediments, petroleum hydrocarbons, pesticides, fertilizers, and heavy metals such as lead, zinc, and copper. These pollutants tend to build up during the dry months of the year. Precipitation during the early portion of the wet season (generally from November to April) washes away most of these pollutants, resulting in high pollutant concentrations in the initial wet weather runoff. This initial runoff is referred to as the "first flush" of storm events. Subsequent periods of rain would
result in less concentrated pollutant levels in the runoff.

The amount and type of runoff generated by the various projects would be greater than that under existing conditions, due to increases in impervious surfaces. There would be a corresponding increase in urban runoff pollutants and "first flush" roadway contaminants, as well as an increase in nutrients and other chemicals from landscaped areas. These constituents would result in water quality impacts to onsite and offsite drainage flows to area waterways. The Sacramento River is the one waterway within the proposed Planning Area included on the Section 303(d) list of impaired water bodies. Discharges of urban runoff into this river may contribute to the existing impairment.
At present, the City does not fall under the NPDES Phase II permit program Il for storm water discharges from Small Municipal Separate Storm Sewer Systems. However, at or about the time that the City's population exceeds 10,000 people, Phase Il requirements would apply. Communities subject to the NPDES Phase Il program must develop and implement a Storm Water Management Plan (SWMP) with the goal of reducing the discharge of pollutants to the maximum extent practicable. The SWMP must include the following six minimum control
measures:

Public Education and Outreach on Storm Water Impacts
Public Involvement/Participation
Illicit Discharge Detection and Elimination
Construction Site Storm Water Runoff Control

The City will adopt and implement a Storm Drainage Master Plan. Development projects will be
evaluated for consistency with this plan. The plan willi identify drainage facilities that will be constructed to eliminate drainage problems in the City and describe the means for financing the improvements. The Storm Drainage Master Plan will address Regional Water Quality Controi Board water quality standards, including Best Management Practices for storm drainage
management. Storm drainage is discussed in detail in the Municipal Facilities and Services
Eiement (Chapter 8).

Safety Element

Implementing Action SAF-2.2.a: Storm Drainage Master Pian

The City will adopt a Storm Drainage Master Pian for Colusa. The Master Plan should identify drainage facilities that will be constructed to eliminate or mitigate drainage problems in the City, and describe the means for financing the proposed improvements. The Storm Drainage Master Plan will be consistent with any Capital Improvements Plan prepared by the City and wili address Regional Water Quality Control Board water quality standards, including Best Management Practices for storm drainage.

Implementing Action SAF-2.2.b: Development Review
The City will require new development to ensure that the cumulative rate of peak runoff does not exceed pre-development levels. New development and redevelopment of existing sites
should provide storm water detention or retention facilities (on- or off-site), if necessary, to prevent flooding due to runoff or where existing storm drainage facilities are unable to accommodate increased storm water drainage.
Implementing Action SAF-2.2.c: Ordinance and Regulation Review and Update
The City will review and revise its Subdivision Ordinance as needed to incorporate specific data and design requirements related to storm water drainage that are contained in this General
Plan update.

Implementing Action SAF-2.2.a would require preparation of a Storm Drainage Master Plan that
identifies drainage facilities needed to reduce or eliminate drainage problems as well as require
the use of Best Management Practices that will eliminate or reduce the discharge of pollutants from construction sites to waters of the state and implement stormwater pollution prevention
plans that document the selection and implementation of Best Management Practices for a
particular construction project. Implementing Action SAF-2.2.b would set a City standard for future development related to storm water runoff - the cumulative rate of peak runoff must not exceed pre-development levels. This would limit the generation of higher peak runoff flows resulting from development, which could produce higher velocities for flow, which in turn increase erosion and sediment discharge. Best management practices, energy dissipation measures, stabilization measures, and onsite detention ponds can be applied to and incorporated into proposed development to limit the concentrations of these constituents in any
site runoff that is discharged into downstream facilities.

4.7 HYDROLOGY AND WATER QUALITY

Policy PRC-7.1 and Implementing Action PRC-7.1.a would reduce the amount of contaminants in storm water runoff through the implementation of Best Management Practices at project sites that would remove contaminants such as oil. Implementing Action PRC-7.1.b would review projects for potential soil erosion impacts and recommend mitigation measures, if any. Under Implementing Action LU-6.3.g, the City would adopt a Storm Drainage Master Plan that, among other objectives, would address water quality standards set forth by the RWQCB related to drainage. This would include the implementation of Best Management Practices related to stormwater drainage. Implementing Actions PRC-7.1.a and PRC-7.1.b require developers to use BMPs for storm drainage. These actions, along with mitigation measure MM 4.7.1 would ensure that development projects are reviewed for potential impacts to water quality and that adequate BMPs are in place to reduce those impact prior to the adoption of a Storm Drainage Master Plan as identified in Implementing Action LU-6.3.g. Therefore, operational water quality impacts would be less than significant.

Additional Mitigation Measures

None required.

Groundwater Quality

Impact 4.7.3 Implementation of the proposed General Plan Update could result in the
degradation of groundwater quality resulting from future land uses. This is
considered a potentially significant impact.

The City of Colusa relies on groundwater for its potable water. In its 2004 Consumer Confidence
Report, the most recent available, the City noted the detection of 13 contaminants in its water
supply. Three City wells had specific contaminants that exceeded maximum levels set by the State. Wells Nos. 3 and 4 exceeded the level for manganese, while Well No. 2 exceeded the levels for both manganese and iron. The source for both contaminants is erosion of natural deposits. The City noted that iron and manganese are on the State's secondary standards list of substances, which deals with aesthetic issues (e.g., appearance, odor) and not with health. The report further states that there is no associated health risk for the levels of manganese identified, and the State requested no further action at the time (City of Colusa, 2003).
Generally, pollutants associated with urban runoff do not infiltrate past the first few inches of finely grained soils, as they become attached to the soil particles as water infiltrates into the soil. The effectiveness of soil particles to act as a filtering mechanism for pollutants diminishes with soils having higher porosity and with direct interaction with or shallow separation from
groundwater.

As noted above, the proposed General Plan Update would allow for an increase in urban development, which would generate runoff containing various types of pollutants. Some of these pollutants may percolate into the groundwater. This impact is not likely to occur with
pollutants from most residential activities, as the quantities would be relatively small and filtered
by the ground before reaching an aquifer. However, certain activities such as gas stations and industrial uses are of greater concern. Such activities may leak or spill larger quantities of contaminants into the ground, which may reach and contaminate groundwater resources. State laws regarding underground and aboveground storage tanks would reduce the incidence of such occurrences. Nevertheless, leaks and spills may still occur.
New storm water detention facilities and vegetated swales would be excavated below natural
grades and would collect, store and convey runoff containing pollutant constituents normally

associated with urban runoff. Depths to groundwater in portions of the proposed Planning Area are relatively shallow, and the separation between the bottoms of the constructed facilities may be minimal or nonexistent. In instances where the underlying soils are well drained, the local impact on groundwater quality may be potentially significant.
Residences outside the existing City limits may utilize individual septic systems that could also contribute to groundwater contamination, specifically with nitrates. The City of Colusa has a sewer system that would likely expand as more development occurs. This sewer system serves the one major residential development outside the City - the Walnut Ranch subdivision.
However, some residential areas may remain outside the service area for the City's sewer system, and rely on septic systems instead.

encouragement of the use of less hazardous household products that could enter groundwater. Policy PRC-7.1 and Implementing Action PRC-7.1.a, along with mitigation measure MM 4.7.1 until the adoption of a Storm water Master plan, would reduce the amount of contaminants in storm water runoff through the implementation of Best Management Practices at project sites that would remove contaminants such as oil. Implementing Action PRC-7.1.b would review projects for potential water quality impacts and recommend mitigation measures, if any. Policy PRC-9.2 would require the City to monitor groundwater conditions. The City would accomplish the monitoring through Implementing Action PRC-9.2.a, which would require a bi-annual report on
groundwater resources and their condition. The monitoring would identify potential contamination and allow the City to take any necessary actions in a timely manner. Implementation of proposed General Plan policies and implementing actions wouid reduce impacts to groundwater quality to less than significant.

Additional Mitigation Measures

None required.

Flood Hazards

Impact 4.7.4 Implementation of the General Plan Update could expose development to potential flooding from the Sacramento River and Colusa Basin. This is
considered a potentially significant impact.

As previously noted, FEMA maps indicate the southwestern portion of the proposed Planning
Area is in Zone AE, which means this area is potentially vulnerable to flooding. This includes
much of the proposed Colusa Crossings and Brookins Ranch project sites. FEMA floodplain
regulations require that finished fioor elevations for structures (buildings) placed in a 100-year floodplain be elevated at or above the applicable base flood elevation. According to the City's Subdivision Standards Resolution, building finished floors are required to be set a minimum
of 1.0 foot above the FEMA base flood elevation. Hence, new buildings placed within this Zone
AE would be required to be elevated a minimum of one foot above the FEMA base flood
elevations.

According to FEMA maps, most of the proposed Planning Area is located is in shaded Zone X, which designates areas subject to flooding during a 500-year storm event or areas that are
protected by levees from flooding during a 100-year storm event. For the proposed Planning Area, FEMA concluded that Zone X areas are protected by levees constructed along the Sacramento River during a 100-year storm event. These levees need to be maintained to retain
their flood control integrity.

Proposed Policies and Implementing Actions that Mitigate Potential Impacts

Safety Element

Policy SAF-2.1 The City shall continue to regulate all uses and development in areas subject
to potential flooding through land use planning, zoning and other
appropriate actions.

Implementing Action SAF-2.1.a: Development Review
The City will refer all development proposals to the Fire and Building Department/Building Division, Public Works Department, and City Engineer to address potential flooding. Where

4.7 HYDROLOGY AND WATER QUALITY

necessary, the environmental review for projects will include a full inventory of flood concerns, and require the applicant to provide specific data pertaining to flooding hazards. Where necessary, the City will also require development projects in areas subject to flood hazards to
reduce or alleviate flood hazards conditions through hydrological studies and mitigation
measures.

Implementing Action SAF-2.1.b: Ordinance and Regulation Review and Update
The City will review and revise its Zoning and Subdivision Ordinances as needed to incorporate specific data and design requirements related to flooding hazards that are contained in this General Plan update and other future flood hazard studies.

Implementing Action SAF-2.1.c: Federal, State, and Locai Funding

The City will pursue mechanisms to finance flood prevention and storm maintenance programs, including local, state, and federal sources. If necessary, the City will consider alternative funding
sources, including development impact fees and the establishment of a drainage utility and assessment district.

Policy SAF-2.2 The City shall minimize the potential for flood damage to buildings and other structures, particularly from storm water runoff.

Implementing Action SAF-2.2.g: Storm Drainage Master Plan (see Impact 4.7.2)

Policy SAF-2.3 The City shall work to increase community awareness of flooding hazards, and to coordinate flood control activities with other interested agencies.

Implementing Action SAF-2.3.a: Interagency Coordination

The City will work with the community and other agencies to help identify flood hazards and to identify options for the mitigation of such hazard areas. The City will also participate in FEMA's
Cooperating Technical Partners Program to advance the update of the City's Flood insurance
Rate Maps as needed.

Policy SAF-2.1 and its associated implementing actions would reduce potential flood hazards through land use planning that intends to minimize potential flooding impacts on future development. Methods include development project review for flooding hazards and mitigation to address identified hazards, revision of appropriate ordinances to include provisions that reduce flooding hazards, and financing of flood prevention and storm maintenance programs. Policy SAF-2.3 and Implementing Action SAF-2.3.a would encourage the City to coordinate with other agencies on flood control issues, thereby keeping the City informed on flooding issues and allowing the City to address these issues as they arise.
Policy SAF-2.2 more specifically addresses potential flooding hazards due to increases in storm water runoff. Implementing Action SAF-2.2.a would require preparation of a Storm Drainage Master Plan that identifies drainage facilities needed to reduce or eliminate drainage problems. Implementing Action SAF-2.2.b would set a City standard for future development related to storm water runoff the cumulative rate of peak runoff must not exceed pre-development levels. This would limit the generation of higher peak runoff flows resulting from development, which would lead to a greater likelihood of flooding. Implementing Action SAF-2.2.c would revise appropriate ordinances to include storm water drainage provisions that address potential flooding problems. Implementation of these proposed General Plan policies and implementing actions would reduce impacts associated with flooding to less than significant.

Additional Mitigation Measures

None required.
Groundwater Supply

Impact 4.7.5 Implementation of the proposed General Plan would increase demand for
water, potentially requiring localized increases in groundwater production. This is considered a potentially significant impact.
Future development allowed by the proposed General Plan Update would place an increasing demand on the City's existing water supplies. The City currently provides its municipal water via wells. An increased demand would at the least require additional pumping from these wells, and possibly require more wells to be drilled. This would increase the amount of groundwater withdrawn from the local aquifer.

Table 4.7-2 provides an estimate of the additional water demand associated with the proposed General Plan Update. It also provides an estimate of water demand under existing conditions, which are current General Plan and current Sphere of Influence boundaries. As indicated by the table, water demand under the proposed General Plan Update would be less than under existing conditions. This is due primarily to the removal of land from agricultural uses, which tend to use more water than other land uses.

According to information from the Department of Water Resources, the Colusa Subbasin has a storage capacity of approximately 13,025,887 acre-feet. Groundwater extraction for agricultural, municipal/industrial and environmental uses total approximately 346,000 acre-feet. Deep percolation from applied water, which replaces some of the withdrawn groundwater, is estimated to be 64,000 acre-feet. On a subbasin level, the groundwater that would need to be withdrawn to satisfy development demands under the proposed General Plan would be minimal. As shown in Table 4.7-2, development under the proposed General Plan Update would result in a decrease in groundwater extraction as the developed uses are anticipated to use less water than the amount currently extracted to serve existing agricultural Uses.
However, at a local level, groundwater withdrawal could potentially lead to land subsidence if withdrawal rates significantly exceed replenishment rates. This condition could be exacerbated by additional development under the updated General Plan, as it wouid add more impervious surfaces and reduce the percolation area, thereby inhibiting groundwater recharge. Some of
this loss of discharge may be offset by the projected decrease in groundwater use as proposed General Plan development occurs. The Water Supply Assessment considers the effect of future General Plan development on groundwater recharge to be minor, since the Sacramento River is close by. The assessment identified the river as a major recharge source. Also, localized

4.7 HYDROLOGY AND WATER QUALITY

groundwater withdrawal could potentially interfere with other operating wells in the vicinity by drawing down water levels sufficiently to require more pumping or even deeper drilling. This impact would be limited to local well field areas associated with new development, as buildout of the proposed General Plan Update would result in an overall decrease in the amount of groundwater extracted.

Parks, Recreation and Resource Conservation Element

Policy PRC-9.2 (see Impact 4.7.3)

Implementing Action PRC-9.2.a: Water Resources Report (see Impact 4.7.3)

Policy PRC-9.3 The City shali maintain its ability to meet its water supply requirements.
Implementing Action PRC-9.3.a: Development Review

As part of the development review process, the City will evaluate the incorporation of water
conservation technologies in all new development.

implementing Action PRC-9.3.b: Development Impact Fees (same as Implementing Action MFS-
1.1.b in Municipal Facilities and Services Element)
The City will update its Development Impact Fee Program. As new development occurs, projects will be charged their fair-share of development impact fees to offset the cost of needed improvements to the City's municipal facilities. The City will review and update the development impact fee schedule on an annuai basis.

Policy PRC-9.4 The City shall encourage the use of treated wastewater and other non- potable water sources for irrigation and groundwater recharge.
Implementation Action PRC-9.4.a: Landscape Ordinance

The City will adopt and implement a landscape ordinance, which will establish standards for water-conserving landscaping in order to reduce water use in developed areas. Requirements will specify the use of reclaimed water, trees and other vegetation. This ordinance will be applied in the design and development of private and public development projects, and will be consistent with the provisions of the Generai Plan.

Implementation Action PRC-9.4.b: Interagency Coordination
In cooperation with the Colusa County Water District, the City will identify and develop opportunities for reuse of non-potable water, including reclaimed water, for non-domestic uses.

Municipal Facilities and Services Element

Implementing Action MFS-7.1.c: Water Master Pian
The City will prepare and implement a Water Master Plan to provide a framework for timed capital improvements and facility expansion projects. The pian should aid the City in identifying
and establishing funding sources beyond monthly service charges to finance improvements

related to water quality, supply, recycling, distribution, conservation, and other issue areas identified by the City and the plan. The plan should evaluate the depth, size, recharge rate, and capacity of the aquiter to accommodate the City's projected future growth. The pian will also make determinations regarding the need to develop additional water sources during the planning period of this General Plan.

Policy MFS-7.2 To minimize the need for the development of new water sources and facilities
and to minimize sewer treatment needs, the City will promote water
conservation in City operations and in private development. The City shall annually monitor water usage to assess the effectiveness of the water conservation program.

Implementing Action MFS-7.2.a: Water Master Plan

The City will implement a water conservation program, to be defined and incorporated in its Urban Water Management Plan, to be prepared with the Water System Master Pian. ff groundwater levels decline and/or if the "moderate" program does not achieve its intended
results, the City will implement the "aggressive" or "maximum" water conservation program as
defined in the Water Management Plan.

Policy MFS-7.3 The City shall, to the extent practical, require the use of drought-tolerant plant species and water efficient irrigation systems in the landscaping of new public and private open space areas, common areas, and parks.

implementing Action MFS-7.3.a: Development Review
Through review of development projects the City will condition development, where practical, on water conservation practices.

As previously noted, Policy PRC-9.2 and Implementing Action PRC-9.2.a would require the City to monitor its groundwater resources. Policy PRC-9.3 and its associated implementing actions would assist the City in maintaining its groundwater supply through impact fees to maintain its water supply infrastructure and ability to impose water conservation measures during its review of development application. Policies PRC-9.4, MFS-7.2 and MFS-7.3 would further the main objective of Policy PRC-9.3 by encouraging plans and practices that conserve water. These include a landscaping ordinance that establishes standards for water-conserving landscapes (Implementing Action PRC-9.4.a), a Water Master Plan that includes facilities for recycling and conserving water (Implementing Action MFS-7.2.a), a water conservation program that implements more aggressive measures if program goals are not achieved, and the use of treated wastewater and other non-potable water for irrigation and groundwater recharge (Implementing Action MFS-7.2.a). Implementing Action MFS-7.3.a, like Implementing Action PRC-9.3.a, would allow the City to impose water conservation measures on development
projects during its project review process.

Implementation of the General Plan policies and implementing actions listed above would reduce the potential environmental impacts of increased water demand, mainly through conservation of existing water supplies and possible use of recycled water. However, the potential for localized impacts would remain. This is a potentially significant impact.

Additional Mitigation Measures

MM 4.7.5a As part of the Development Review process associated with Implementing Action PRC-9.3.a: Development Review, development projects that would require new wells shall provide the City with documentation of the potential localized decrease in groundwater and whether this would require nearby wells to have to drill deeper to extract groundwater. If potential impacts to nearby wells are identified, the proposed project shall incorporate measures, such as moving the proposed well(s) needed to serve the project to a different location, to ensure that nearby wells would not go dry or experience reduced pumping capacity as a result of the project.

MM 4.7.5b All development project applications submitted to the City prior to the adoption of the Water System Master Plan shall be required to submit an
Water Usage Pian which addresses the project's water use and its impact on the local water system, available water sources and a commitment from the City of Colusa Public Works Department on
supplying water to the project, and water conservation measures of the project. This Water Usage Plan will be developed to the satisfaction of the City of Colusa.

Implementation of the above mitigation measures, along with proposed General Plan policies and implementing actions would reduce impacts to groundwater levels to less than significant.

4.8 BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES

This section summarizes the existing natural resources within the proposed Planning Area. It
includes a discussion of the special-status species potentially occurring and sensitive habitats present. Key issues addressed are: potential impacts to special-status plant and wildlife species, loss of sensitive habitat (riparian, wetlands and other waters of the U.S.), and loss of trees.
Information for this section primarily came from a biological resources survey by PMC, which included field reconnaissance and literature review.

4.8.1 EXISTING SETTING

Colusa County is primarily rural, and most of the land is in agricultural use. Topography varies from flat lands in the eastern portion of the County to rolling hills in the west. Snow Mountain, at approximately 7,000 feet, is the highest point in the County and is located along the western border of the Mendocino National Forest. The Sacramento River generally lies along the eastern border of the County. Plant communities predominant in this region include agricultural croplands, fallow agricultural lands, horticultural/landscaped, oak woodland, annual grassland,
freshwater marsh, open water (e.g., rivers, creeks, sloughs), riparian, and seasonal wetland.

The proposed Planning Area is located within the Colusa and Meridian United States Geological
Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute quadrangles. Elevations range from approximately 50 to 60 feet above
mean sea level. Land uses throughout the proposed Planning Area include agricultural,
commercial and residential. Much of the land area outside the City limits is devoted to
agriculture.

The City of Colusa is located on a generally flat, agricultural plain. The Sacramento River forms the natural northern border of the City. The 63-acre Colusa-Sacramento River State Recreation
Area is located just north of the City's boundaries. Common wildlife in the area includes deer, raccoons, opossums, foxes, skunks and muskrats. Birds observed in the area include ring-necked pheasants, California quail, mallard ducks, Canada geese, western meadowlarks, northern flickers and ospreys. Vegetation in the area includes cottonwood, willow, fig trees and wild grape, among many other trees, shrubs, and plants along the river.
The 4,507-acre Colusa National Wildlife Refuge is located one-half mile west of the City. The refuge typically supports wintering populations of more than 200,000 ducks and 50,000 geese. The grassland habitat supports several populations of endangered and sensitive species of plants. The refuge is a center for populations of the endangered palmate-bracted bird's-beak and the threatened giant garter snake.

LOCAL ENVIRONMENT

Biological Habitats/Vegetation Communities
Biological habitats and vegetation communities found in the proposed Planning Area include irrigated row and field crops, freshwater emergent wetlands, orchard and vineyard, valley- foothill riparian, and urban (Figure 4.8-1). In addition, irrigated pastures and riparian vegetation habitat are found in the proposed Planning Area. These biological habitats and vegetation communities are discussed below.

Irrigated Row and Field Crops

This vegetation category includes agricultural cropland, fallow agricultural land, irrigated ditches, irrigated pasture and annual grassland.

City of Colusa Colusa General Plan
July 2007 Draft Master Environmental Impact Report
4.8-1

4.8 BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES

Agricultural Cropland

Agricultural cropland occurs interspersed throughout the rural residential areas in the City, and
throughout the proposed Planning Area, with the majority occurring within the western portion. Because this habitat is intensively managed, vegetation is limited to cultivated crops, predominately grains, orchards, and vineyards, with ruderal (weedy) vegetation along the margins. Ruderal species observed include Italian ryegrass, ripgut brome, and yellow star-thistle.
Agricultural cropland generally provides low breeding habitat for wildlife species due to the high level and frequency of disturbance; however, it provides cover and foraging habitat for many species. Species expected to occur in this habitat include American crow, American robin, western scrub jay, yellow-billed magpie, black-tailed jackrabbit, and deer mouse.

Fallow Agricultural Land

Fallow agricultural land occurs throughout the proposed Planning Area. In general, within the City the majority of this habitat occurs adjacent to parks and recreational areas, and within undeveloped areas. Plant species expected to occur within this habitat include field mustard,
filaree, Fitch's tarweed, Italian ryegrass, and wild oats.
Fallow agricultural land provides breeding, cover, and foraging habitat for a variety of wildlife species. Species expected to occur in this habitat are similar to those expected to occur in the annual grassland habitat discussed below.

Irrigation Ditches

Irrigation ditches flow through several portions of the proposed Planning Area. These ditches are
predominantly devoid of vegetation; however, the associated banks support hydrophytic vegetation. Predominant species associated with this habitat include bulrush, curly dock, narrow-leaved cattail, and smartweed. Additionally, some riparian woodland vegetation is associated with the ditches. The riparian woodland species observed include arroyo willow, Fremont's cottonwood, and valley oak.
Irrigation ditches provide suitable breeding, cover, and foraging habitat for a variety of wildlife species. Belted kingfisher, and great egret were observed in this habitat. Marsh wren, red-wing blackbird, and other bird species could also use this habitat.

Irrigated Pasture

Irrigated pastures occur throughout the proposed Planning Area. These pastures are used for livestock grazing. Grass and herbaceous species tolerant of year-round wet conditions are associated with this habitat. The frequent irrigation of these areas has resulted in the establishment of areas of seasonal and perennial wetland conditions in some pastures. Common wetland vegetation observed in these areas includes species such as bulrush, narrow-
leaved cattail, sedge, and spike rush.
Irrigated pastures support foraging habitat for a variety of avian and small mammal species and the wetlands areas interspersed throughout this habitat likely support a variety of wildlife species. Species expected to occur within this habitat include great egret, great blue heron, red-winged blackbird, bullfrog, and Pacific chorus frog.

4.8 BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES

Freshwater Emergent Wetland

This vegetation category includes perennial and seasonal marsh, seasonal wetlands, and Valley- foothill riparian.

Perennial and Seasonal Marsh

Perennial and seasonal marsh habitat occurs adjacent to several of the open water habitats
within the proposed Planning Area. Marshes support such species as baltic rush, broad-leaved cattail, narrow-leaved cattail, and spike rush.
Wildlife species use perennial and seasonal marsh habitat for temporary water sources and cover. Species expected to occur in this habitat include black phoebe, great blue heron, great egret, red-winged blackbird, bullfrog, and Pacific chorus frog.

Seasonal Wetlands

Seasonal wetland habitat is typically associated with shallow drainages, swales, or depressions, which inundate long enough to support hydric soils and hydrophytic vegetation. Seasonal wetland habitat occurs within the annual grassland and irrigated pasture habitats in the proposed Planning Area. This habitat is expected to support grasses and other herbaceous species, such as fiddle dock, Mediterranean barley, mint, and perennial ryegrass.
Wildlife species use seasonal wetlands for temporary water sources and cover. Species expected to occur in this habitat are similar to those expected to occur in the annual grassland, irrigated pasture, and perennial and seasonal marsh habitats as discussed above.

Valley-Foothill Riparian

Valley-foothill riparian habitat supports a
diversity of plant species that have adapted
to the wet soll conditions found alongside waterways. This habitat occurs adjacent to
the Sacramento River, near irrigation ditches,
on the margins of some of the open water, and perennial and seasonal marsh habitats in
the proposed Planning Area. Dominant plant
species in this habitat include arroyo willow, Fremont's cottonwood, red willow, and valley
oak. Additional plant species expected to occur in this habitat include California
buckeye and coffeeberry.

The valley-foothill riparian habitat provides substantial breeding, cover, and foraging habitat for a variety of resident and migratory wildlife species. Additionally, this habitat provides a sheltered corridor for wildlife movement. Species expected to occur in this habitat include belted kingfisher, black phoebe, bushtit, great blue heron, great egret, and mule deer.

Urban

This vegetation category includes areas that have been developed either for commercial or residential uses and include both ruderal and horticultural/landscaped. Ruderal areas contain

4.8 BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES

grasses and weeds, and are generally found on vacant lots. Horticultural/landscaped vegetation is associated with residences within the proposed Planning Area. This habitat is also
associated with commercial lots within the City. Typically non-native plant species are
incorporated into landscape design in residential and commercial areas. Species commonly associated with these areas include agapanthus, Italian cypress, oleander, and sweet gum. Horticultural/landscaped vegetation provides marginal habitat for wildlife species. Species expected to occur in these areas include Brewer's blackbird, European starling, house sparrow, rockdove, and white-crowned sparrow.

SPECIAL-STATUS SPECIES

Special-status species are defined as plants and animals that are legally protected under the Federal Endangered Species Act (FESA), the California Endangered Species Act (CESA), or other regulations; considered sufficiently rare by the scientific community to qualify for such listing; or
considered sensitive because they are unique or are declining regionaily or locally.

Note: MBTA - Migratory Bird Treaty Act Potential to occur: "High" - Species known to occur in or near proposed Planning Area (based on CNDDB records within five miles andlor professional expertise specific to species or the proposed Planning Area) and there is suitable habitat within the proposed Planning Area. "Moderate" - Species known to occur in the vicinity of proposed Planning Area (based on CNDDB records within ten miles) and there is marginal habitat within the proposed Planning Area; or species not known to occur within the proposed Planning Area but suitable habitat exists.

Raptors and Other Migratory Birds

Raptors, including Cooper's hawk and short-eared owl among others, are protected under the MBTA and Section 3503.5 of the California Fish and Game Code. Suitable raptor nesting and foraging habitat occurs in the proposed Planning Area. American kestrel and northern harrier were observed during the field reconnaissance. Consequently, raptor species are likely to forage and nest in the proposed Planning Area.

Migratory birds forage and nest in multiple habitats such as annual grasslands, seasonal wetland,
and agricultural lands. The nests of all migratory birds are protected under the MBTA, which

4.8 BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES

it makes it illegal to destroy an active migratory bird nest. Numerous migratory bird species have the potential to nest in the proposed Planning Area.

SENSITIVE BIOLOGICAL HABITAT

Sensitive biological resources include those that are of special concern to resource agencies or those that are protected under CEQA, Section 1600 of the California Fish and Game Code, or Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. Sensitive resources within the proposed Planning Area include native and some non-native trees, riparian habitat, and jurisdictional waters of the U.S.,
which may include intermittent and perennial creeks, irrigation ditches, rivers, marsh and
wetland.

Trees

Loss of native tree species is a concern of the CDFG and CNPS because of their continued
depletion throughout California. As shown in Figure 4.8-1, the vegetation communities in the proposed Planning Area include a portion of land adjacent to the Sacramento River and north of the City as Valley-Foothill Riparian. Valley-foothill riparian habitat supports a diversity of plant species that have adapted to the wet soil conditions found alongside waterways, with dominant
plant species including arroyo willow, Fremont's cottonwood, red willow, and valley oak. In particular, loss of native oak woodlands is a subject of State concern, as embodied in Senate Bill (SB) 1334, effective 2005. SB 1334 establishes mitigation standards designed to preserve oak woodlands. This measure applies only to counties, and no oak woodland habitat was identified in the proposed Planning Area, although there is the is potential for individual oak trees to occur.
However, the City of Colusa does have a tree ordinance that provides some protection.

Riparian Habitat

As discussed above, riparian habitat provides food, water, migration and dispersal corridors, and escape, nesting, and thermal cover for an abundance of wildlife. This habitat occurs adjacent to the Sacramento River, near irrigation ditches, on the margins of some of the open water, and perennial and seasonal marsh habitats in the proposed Planning Area. Riparian habitat within the drip line or outer canopy of riparian vegetation that is dependent on surface or subsurface water is protected under California Fish and Game Code Section 1602.

Jurisdictional Waters of the U.S.

Jurisdictional waters of the U.S. include jurisdictional wetlands as well as other waters of the U.S. such as creeks, ponds, and intermittent drainages. Wetlands are defined as "those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support and under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions" [33 C.F.R. §328.3(b)]. Presently, to be a wetland, a site must exhibit three wetland criteria: hydrophytic vegetation, hydric soils, and wetland
hydrology existing under the "normal circumstances" for the site. Potential jurisdictional waters of the U.S. in the proposed Planning Area includes ponds, intermittent and perennial creeks, irrigation ditches, perennial and seasonal marsh, river, and seasonal wetland.

. Central Valley fall/late fall run Chinook salmon
Central Valley spring run Chinook salmon Central Valley winter run Chinook salmon Central Valley steelhead

4.8.2 REGULATORY FRAMEWORK

FEDERAL

Federal Endangered Species Act
The Federal Endangered Species Act (FESA) protects threatened and endangered plants and animals and their critical habitat. Candidate species are those proposed for listing; these species are usually treated by resource agencies as they were actually listed during the environmental review process. Procedures for addressing impacts to federally listed species follow two principal pathways, both of which require consultation with the USFWS, which administers FESA for all terrestrial species. The first pathway, Section 10(a) incidental take permit, applies to situations where a non-federal government entity must resolve potential adverse impacts to species protected under FESA. The second pathway, Section 7 consultation, applies to projects directly undertaken by a federal agency or private projects requiring a federal permit or approval.
Migratory Bird Treaty Act
The Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) implements international treaties between the United States and other nations devised to protect migratory birds, their parts, eggs, and nests from activities
such as hunting, pursuing, capturing, killing, selling, and shipping, unless expressly authorized in the regulations or by permit. The State of California has incorporated the protection of birds of prey in Sections 3800, 3513, and 3503.5 of the Fish and Game Code.
All raptors and their nests are protected from take or disturbance under the MBTA (16 United States Code Section 703 et seq.) and California statute (Fish and Game Code Section 3503.5). The golden eagle and bald eagle are also afforded additional protection under the Eagle Protection Act, amended in 1973 (16 United States Code Section 669 et seq.).

Clean Water Act

Section 401 of the Clean Water Act (CWA) requires any applicant for a federal license or permit to conduct any activity that may result in a discharge of a pollutant into waters of the United States to obtain a certification that the discharge will comply with the applicable effluent limitations and water quality standards. The appropriate Regional Water Quality Control Board
(RWQCB) regulates Section 401 requirements in California.
Section 404 of the CWA prohibits the discharge of dredged or fill material into "waters of the United States" without a permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). The USACE and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency administer the Section 404 provisions. In addition to
streams with a defined bed and bank, the definition of waters of the U.S. includes wetland areas

Colusa General Plan of City of Colusa

4.8-10

4.8 BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES

"that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions" (33 Code of Federal Regulations 328.3 7b).
Substantial impacts to jurisdictional wetlands may require an individual permit. Small-scale projects may require a nationwide permit, which typically has an expedited process compared to the individual permit process. Mitigation of wetland impacts is required as a condition of the Section 404 permit and may include on-site preservation, restoration, or enhancement and/or off-site restoration or enhancement. The characteristics of the restored or enhanced wetlands must be equal to or better than those of the affected wetlands to achieve no net loss of
wetlands.

STATE

California Endangered Species Act
Under the California Endangered Species Act (CESA), CDFG has the responsibility for maintaining a list of endangered and threatened species (Fish and Game Code Section 2070). Fish and Game Code Sections 2050-2098 outline the protection provided to California's rare, endangered, and threatened species. Section 2080 prohibits the taking of plants and animals listed under the CESA. Section 2081 establishes an incidental take permit program for state-listed species. CDFG also maintains a list of "candidate species," those CDFG formally notices as being under review for addition to the list of endangered or threatened species.
Pursuant to the requirements of CESA, an agency reviewing a proposed project within its jurisdiction must determine whether any state-listed endangered or threatened species may be present, and whether the proposed project will have a potentially significant impact on such species. CDFG encourages informal consultation on any proposed project that may impact a candidate species.
Project-related impacts to species on the CESA endangered or threatened list would be considered significant. State-listed species are fully protected under the mandates of CESA. "Take" of protected species incidental to otherwise lawful management activities may be authorized. Authorization from CDFG would be in the form of an Incidental Take Permit.

Native Plant Protection Act of 1977

The Native Plant Protection Act of 1977 (Fish and Game Code Section 1900 et seq.) prohibits the taking, possessing, or sale within California of any plants with a state designation of rare, threatened, or endangered, as defined by CDFG. An exception allows landowners to take listed plant species under specified circumstances, provided that the owners first notify CDFG and give CDFG at least 10 days to come and retrieve the plants before they are plowed under or otherwise destroyed (Fish and Game Code Section 1913). Project impacts to these species are not considered significant unless the species are known to have a high potential to occur within the area of disturbance associated with construction of the proposed project.
California Native Plant Society

While the California Native Plant Society (CNPS) is not a regulatory agency, it does maintains a it list of plant species native to California with low numbers, limited distribution, or otherwise threatened with extinction that are used for planning purposes and to determine special-status

plant species. This information is published in the Inventory of Rare and Endangered Vascular Plants of California. Potential impacts to populations of CNPS-listed plants receive consideration under CEQA review. The following defines the CNPS listings:

List 1A: Plants believed extinct.

List 1B: Plants rare, threatened, or endangered in California and elsewhere.

List 2: Plants rare, threatened, or endangered in California, but more numerous
elsewhere.

List 3: Plants about which more information required - a review list.

List 4: Plants of limited distribution - a watch list.

California Fish and Game Code

California Fish and Game Code Sections 3500-5500 outline protection for "fully protected" species of mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish. Species that are fully protected may not be taken or possessed at any time. The CDFG cannot issue permits or licenses that authorize the "take" of any fully protected species except under certain circumstances, such as scientific
research and live capture and relocation of such species pursuant to a permit for a the protection
of livestock.

Under Section 3503.5 of the Fish and Game Code it is unlawful to take, possess, or destroy any birds in the orders of Falconiformes or Strigiformes (birds of prey) or to take, possess, or destroy the nest or eggs of any such bird except as otherwise provided by this code or any regulation adopted pursuant thereto.
State and local public agencies are subject to Fish and Game Code Section 1602, which
governs construction activities that will substantially divert or obstruct the natural flow or
substantially change the bed, channel, or bank of any river, stream, or lake designated by the
CDFG. Under Section 1602, a discretionary Streambed Alteration Agreement permit must be issued by the CDFG to the project developer prior to the initiation of construction activities within lands under CDFG jurisdiction. As a general rule, this requirement applies to any work undertaken within the 100-year floodplain of a stream or river containing fish or wildlife resources.

Other State Regulations
CDFG has identified and maintains lists of "Species of Special Concern." Species with this status have limited distribution, or the extent of their habitats has been reduced substantially such that
their populations may be threatened. Their populations are monitored, and they may receive
special attention during environmental review. While they do not have statutory protection, they
may be considered rare under CEQA and thereby warrant specitic protection measures.

While CEQA by itself does not protect biological resources, it does require local governments to disclose and analyze potential impacts on such resources, and to identify measures to mitigate these impacts. CEQA Guidelines Section 15065 considers a substantial reduction in numbers of a
rare or endangered species a significant effect. CEQA Guidelines Section 15380 provides for
assessment of unlisted species as rare or endangered under CEQA if the species can be shown if
to meet the criteria for listing. Unlisted plant species on the CNPS Lists 1A, 1B, 2 and 2 typically
would be considered under CEQA.

LOCAL

Existing Colusa General Plan
The adopted City of Colusa General Plan currently is used as the "blueprint" to guide future development within the City limits and in unincorporated portions of the existing Planning Area. The proposed General Plan Update would replace the existing goals, policies, implementing actions and land use map in the City's adopted General Plan. Proposed policies and action
items relevant to biological resources are identitied under the specific impact analyses below.

Colusa Tree Ordinance

The City considers its large variety of mature trees lining its streets to be a significant resource. Many of these trees are in the public right-of-way in the historic area of downtown Colusa and
are protected by City ordinance (Colusa Municipal Code Chapter 19.3). This code establishes a
five-member Tree Commission, which governs the planting, removal, and maintenance of these
trees. For tree removal, property owners are required to submit an application to the Tree Commission, which decides whether there are valid reasons for the removal. When a tree is removed, another tree must be planted. The property owner pays for the new tree; however, the City plants, maintains, and owns the tree. A list of City-maintained tree species can be found at the City of Colusa Public Works Department.

4.8.3 IMPACTS AND MITIGATION MEASURES

STANDARDS OF SIGNIFICANCE

Based on Appendix G of the CEQA Guidelines, biological resource impacts are considered to be significant if the following could resuit from the implementation of the General Plan Update:

1) A substantial adverse effect, either directly or through habitat modifications, on any species identified as a candidate, sensitive, or special status species in local or regional
plans, policies or regulations, or by the CDFG or USFWS.
2) A substantial adverse effect on any riparian habitat or other sensitive natural community identified in local or regional plans, policies, or regulations or by the CDFG or USFWS.
3) A substantial adverse effect on federally protected wetlands as defined by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (including, but not limited to, marsh, vernai pool, coastal, etc.) through direct removal, filling, hydrological interruption, or other means.
4) Substantial interference with the movement of any native resident or migratory fish or wildlife species or with established native resident or migratory wildlife corridors, or
impediment of the use of native wildlife nursery sites.

5) Conflicts with any local policies or ordinances protecting biological resources, such as
tree preservation policy or ordinance.
6) Conflicts with the provisions of an adopted Habitat Conservation Plan, Natural Community Conservation Plan, or other approved local, regional or state habitat conservation plan.

4.8 BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES

METHODOLOGY

Available information pertaining to the natural resources of the proposed Planning Area was reviewed. Documents included, but were not limited to, the California Natural Diversity Data Base (CDFG 2006a); the CNPS Inventory of Rare and Endangered Vascular Piants of California (CNPS 2001); a list of special-status plant and wildlife species from the USFWS for Colusa and
eight surrounding quadrangles and for Colusa County (USFWS 2006b); the Jepson Manual: Higher Plants of California (Hickman 1993); and the City of Colusa General Plan (City of Colusa 1994).

Vegetation community and habitat information is based on Geographic Approach to Planning (GAP) data. GAP, a product of the California GAP group spearheaded by the University of California, Santa Barbara Department of Geography, is a vegetation map system developed for the preservation of biological diversity in United States.
A PMC biologist conducted reconnaissance-level fieldwork in January and February 2006. Field reconnaissance included general plant and wildlife surveys and general habitat assessments. Surveys of the entire proposed Planning Area were not completed due to the size of the project boundaries and the scope of this analysis. The limited fieldwork allowed for general verification of the vegetation communities and sensitive habitats present.

IMPACTS AND MITIGATION MEASURES FOR THE GENERAL PLAN UPDATE

Special-Status Plant Species

Impact 4.8.1 Implementation of the proposed General Plan Update could result in direct and indirect impacts on special-status plant species and their habitat. This is considered a potentially signiticant impact.
Suitable habitat (e.g., wetlands and creek habitat conditions) for special-status plant species,
including Ferris's milk-vetch, brittlescale, palmate-bracted bird's beak, and rose mallow, occurs
within the proposed Planning Area. Subsequent development under the proposed General Plan could result in direct loss of habitat areas associated with these special-status plant species, since these habitat conditions do occur in areas planned for development. In addition to direct impacts, indirect impacts to special-status species could occur with implementation of the proposed General Plan which may include habitat degradation as a result of impacts to water quality (see Section 4.7, Hydrology and Water Quality, regarding water quality impacts), introduction of non-native species, and increased human presence.
Special-status species receive protection from various federal and state laws and regulations, including FESA and CESA. These regulations generally prohibit the taking of these plant species without a special permit.

4.8 BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES

Implementing Action PRC-1.1a: Development Review

Through the development review process, the City will use the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) process to evaluate the impacts of proposed new development on natural resources. The CEQA process specifies that the City will refer any development proposal with the potential for direct or indirect impact. on open space and sensitive local resources to the City Planner, City Engineer, and other local agencies, as applicable, for review and comment.

Implementing Action PRC-1.2.b: Fees, Dedications and Easements

Parcel lines (in the case of a subdivision] or easements (in the case of a subdivision or other development) should be located to optimize resource protection. if a sensitive local resource or significant corridor is proposed for inclusio: in an open space parcel or easement, allowed uses and maintenance responsibilities within that parcel should be clearly defined and conditioned
prior to map or project approval. Fees and dedications will also be used to ensure adequate preservation of sensitive local resources.

Policy PRC-6.1 The City shall protect and preserve the area's biological resources, to the greatest extent feasible.

Implementing Action PRC-6.1.a: Development Review

Through the development review process, and consistent with the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), the City will require development projects to avoid disturbing biological resources within the City, to the greatest extent feasible, and to mitigate, as feasible and appropriate, signiticant adverse impacts to those resources. If, during the development review process, the City determines that a proposed project has the potential to affect biological resources, the City may require the applicant to prepare, at the applicant's expense, a biological resources assessment, a wetlands delineation, a tree survey and/or arborist's report, and/or other technical information that will allow the City to assess the project's potential to cause adverse impacts to biological resources.
The City's review of proposed development projects will inciude, but is not necessarily limited to, the following considerations:

Preservation of heritage oaks and oak woodland habitat:

Protection of special-status plant and animal species;

Conservation of sensitive wildlife habitat, and mitigation for any loss of that habitat, if
appropriate:

Avoidance of wetlands and riparian piant communities, and mitigation for any loss of that habitat, as appropriate;
Replanting of native vegetation.
Implementing Action PRC-6.1.b: Interagency Coordination

The City will coordinate with Colusa County and responsible resource and regulatory agencies during project development. The purpose will be to ensure that ample opportunity is given to

solicit their comments concerning potential impacts to threatened and endangered species or other sensitive biological resources within the planning area.

Policy PRC-6.2 The City shall ensure that projects identify alternative site designs where
sensitive habitat areas may be adversely affected.
Policy PRC-1.1 would encourage the preservation of specific biological resources such as riparian corridors and woodlands. These resources provide potential nesting and foraging habitat for many special-status bird species. Implementing Action PRC-1.1.a would allow the City to impose mitigation measures or conditions of approval on development projects to preserve these potential habitats. Implementing Action PRC-1.2.b would provide mechanisms, including easements, dedications and fee programs, to preserve sensitive habitats and areas
with sensitive resources. Policy PRC-6.1 would make protection and preservation of biological resources a policy of the City. This policy would be implemented through the development review process (Implementing Action PRC-6.1.a). Policy PRC-6.2 would encourage future
development to avoid sensitive biological resources by alternative site designs. Impacts after implementation of the above-identified General Plan policies and actions would be less than
significant.

Additional Mitigation Measures

None required.

Special-Status Wildlife Species

Impact 4.8.2 Implementation of the proposed General Plan could result in direct and indirect impacts on special-status wildlife species and their habitat. This is
considered a potentially significant impact.

Invertebrates

Suitable vernal pool and wetland habitat for special-status vernal pool invertebrates, including vernal pool fairy shrimp, vernal pool tadpole shrimp and California fairy shrimp, occurs within the
proposed Planning Area. Subsequent development under the proposed General Plan could result in direct loss of habitat areas associated with these special-status species. In addition to direct impacts, indirect impacts to special-status species could occur with implementation of the proposed General Plan which may include habitat degradation as a result of impacts to
water quality, introduction of non-native species, and increased human presence.
The Sacramento Valley tiger beetle is known to occur along the Sacramento River within the proposed Planning Area. Suitable habitat (e.g. sand bars associated with rivers) for the California species of special concern occurs. Subsequent development under the proposed General Plan
could result in direct loss of habitat areas associated with this special-status species. In addition
to direct impacts, indirect impacts to special-status species could occur with implementation of
the proposed General Plan which may include habitat degradation as a result of impacts to
water quality, introduction of non-native species, and increased human presence.

The is Valley elderberry longhorn beetle is known to occur along the Sacramento River within the
proposed Planning Area. Suitable habitat, elderberry shrubs, exists within the proposed Planning Area. There are known occurrences of the Valley elderberry longhorn beetle within the riparian
corridor, where the majority of elderberry shrubs are found. Subsequent development under the proposed General Plan could result in disturbance and removal of elderberry shrubs, which are

the host plant for federally threatened Valley elderberry longhorn beetle. These actions could
result in direct take of a valley elderberry longhorn beetle through habitat removal, as well as increase incidental take due to additional traific, increased human presence, and degradation of the riparian area.

Amphibians/Reptiles

The western spadefoot toad is a California species of special concern. Suitabie habitat occurs within the proposed Planning Area. Subsequent development under the proposed General Plan could result in disturbance, degradation, and removal of wetland features and adjacent upland habitat. The proposed project does not offer special protection to the wetland features such as
ponds that this species would use for breeding. These actions could result in direct loss (or take)
of the western spadefoot toad through habitat degradation as well as increase incidental take
from additional traffic, and degradation of habitat. In addition TO direct impacts, indirect
impacts to special-status species could occur with implementation of the proposed General Plan which may include habitat degradation as a result of impacts to water quality, introduction of non-native species, and increased human presence.
Implementation of the proposed General Plan would result in disturbance, degradation, and removal of wetland features and adjacent upland habitat for the northwestern pond turtle. The proposed project does not offer special protection to the riparian habitat and other wetland features such as vegetated streams, irrigation ditches, and ponds that this species would inhabit. These actions could result in direct loss (or take) of a northwestern pond turtle through habitat degradation as well as increase incidental take from additional traffic, increased human presence, and degradation of the riparian area.
Implementation of the proposed General Plan would result in disturbance, degradation, and removal of suitable habitat for giant garter snake (e.g., freshwater marsh, streams, sloughs and irrigation ditches). The proposed project does not offer special protection to wetland features such as vegetated streams, irrigation ditches, and ponds that this species would inhabit. These actions could result in direct loss (or take) of a giant garter snake through habitat degradation as well as increase incidental take from additional traffic, increased human presence, and degradation of suitable habitat. The active period for giant garter snakes is between May 1 and October 1. Direct impacts due to construction activities would be lessened during this time, because snakes are actively moving and avoiding danger. More danger is posed to snakes during their inactive period, because they are occupying underground burrows or crevices and are more susceptible to direct effects, especially during excavation.

Fish

Suitable aquatic habitat for special-status fish species, including green sturgeon, Central Valley steelhead, and Chinook salmon (fall/late-fall, spring and winter runs), occurs within the proposed Planning Area. Subsequent development under the proposed General Plan could result in disturbance, degradation, and removal of riparian habitat. The General Plan update does not offer special protection to the riparian corridor or to water quality. The General Plan update would also potentially allow encroachment upon the riparian area that currently supports these special-status fish. Adverse impacts to sturgeon, steelhead, and salmon resources can also arise from improperly designed sand and gravel extraction projects, which could lead to loss of existing spawning riffles, loss of rock/gravel recruitment for maintenance of spawning areas, entrapment of adult and young salmon in gravel pits during high river flows, and other
adverse impacts. In addition, recreational and residential developments which reduce riparian
vegetation and/or increase urban runoff into the Sacramento River may also affect local

4.8 BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES

populations. Other activities such as road and bridge construction may negatively impact special-status fish. Potential problems include the accidental introduction of unwanted fish species into the Sacramento River from adjacent irrigational canals, ponds and streams during high flow events or by accident.

Special-status species receive protection from various federal and state laws and regulations, including FESA and CESA. These regulations generally prohibit the taking of these fish species without a special permit.

Birds

Implementation of the proposed General Plan may result in disturbance, degradation, and removal of suitable habitat for tri-colored blackbird (freshwater marsh and other wetlands). These actions could result in direct take of tri-colored blackbird through habitat degradation as well as increase incidental take from additional traffic, increased human presence, and
degradation of suitable habitat.
Implementation of the proposed General Plan may result in disturbance, degradation, and removal of suitable habitat for western burrowing owl (annual grassland, fallow agricultural fields). These actions could result in direct take of western burrowing owl through habitat degradation as well as increase incidental take from additional traffic, increased human presence, and degradation of suitable habitat.

Implementation of the General Plan Update may result in disturbance, degradation, and
removal of large trees for nesting and foraging habitat for Swainson's hawk. Swainson's hawks
prefer low growing cropland such as alfalfa and fallow fields for foraging. Increased conversion of farmland into residential and commercial development would significantly reduce the foraging habitat for this species. These actions could result in direct take of Swainson's hawk through habitat degradation as well as increase incidental take from additional traffic, increased human presence, and degradation of the riparian area.
Implementation of the proposed General Plan may result in disturbance, degradation, and removal of suitable habitat for western yellow-billed cuckoo (riparian habitats near water). These actions could result in direct take of western yellow-billed cuckoo through habitat degradation as well as increase incidental take from additional traffic, increased human presence, and degradation of suitable habitat.
Implementation of the proposed General Plan may result in disturbance, degradation, and removal of suitable habitat for the California species of special concern, the white-faced ibis, (freshwater marshes and other wetlands). These actions could result in direct take of white-faced
ibis through habitat degradation as well as increase incidental take from additional traffic,
increased human presence, and degradation of suitable habitat.
Implementation of the proposed General Plan may result in disturbance, degradation, and removal of suitable habitat for bank swallow (riverine banks or cliffs). These actions could result in direct take of bank swallow through habitat degradation as well as increase incidental take from additional traffic, increased human presence, and degradation of suitable habitat.

(or take) of protected migratory birds through habitat degradation as well as increase incidental take from additional traffic, increased human presence, and degradation of habitat. The General Plan update does not offer special protection to migratory birds such as great egret, great blue heron, American bittern, Aleutian Canada goose, snowy egret, greater sandhill crane, loggerhead shrike, and black-crowned night heron would use for nesting.
Implementation of the proposed General Plan would result in disturbance, degradation, and removal of large trees for nesting and foraging habitat. These actions could result in direct loss (or take) of migratory birds and raptors through habitat degradation as well as increase incidental take from additional traffic, increased human presence, and degradation of the riparian area. The proposed General Plan does not offer special protection to raptors such as ferruginous hawk, white-tailed kite, American peregrine falcon, bald eagle, and osprey would use for nesting. Many raptors or birds of prey prefer low-growing cropland such as alfalfa fields, and grassland for foraging. Increased conversion of farmland into residential and commercial
development would significantly reduce the foraging habitat for these raptor species.
Migratory bird species receive protection from various federal and state laws and regulations, particularly the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA). These regulations generally prohibit the taking of these species unless a special permit is obtained. Raptor bird species receive protection from various federal and state laws and regulations. These regulations generally prohibit the taking of these species unless a special permit is obtained.

Mammals

Implementation of the proposed General Plan would result in disturbance, degradation, and removal of suitable habitat for Pacific western big-eared bat (caves, buildings and mine tunnels). These actions could result in direct take of Pacific western big-eared bat through habitat degradation as well as increase incidental take from additional traffic, increased human presence, and degradation of suitable habitat.

Implementation of the proposed General Plan would result in disturbance, degradation, and removal of suitable habitat for San Joaquin pocket mouse (annual grassland). These actions could result in direct take of San Joaquin pocket mouse through habitat degradation as well Cs increase incidental take from additional traffic, increased human presence, and degradation of suitable habitat.

Special-status species receive protection from various federal and state laws and regulations, including FESA and CESA. These regulations generally prohibit the taking of these invertebrate species without a special permit.

Implementing Action PRC-6.1.b: Public Awareness and Education (see Impact 4.8.1)
Policy PRC-6.2 (see Impact 4.8.1)

Policy PRC-9.1 The City shall require natural drainage flows be maintained in new
development projects to the greatest extent feasible.

Implementing Action PRC-9.1.a: Development Review
As part of the development review process, the City will review individual projects to determine the setback requirements that will adequately buffer natural drainage corridors from development. The City will require that new deveiopment ensures protection of natural drainage corridors and other watercourses from the adverse effects of construction activities and urban runoff.

As described in Impact 4.8.1, Policy PRC-1.1 would encourage the preservation of specific biological resources such as riparian corridors and woodlands. These resources provide potential nesting and foraging habitat for many special-status bird species. Implementing Action PRC-1.1.a would allow the City to impose mitigation measures or conditions of approval on development projects to preserve these potential habitats. Implementing Action PRC-1.2.b would provide mechanisms, including easements, dedications and fee programs, to preserve sensitive habitats and areas with sensitive resources. Policy PRC-6.1 would make protection and
preservation of biological resources a policy of the City. This policy would be implemented
through the development review process (Implementing Action PRC-6.1.a) and increased public awareness of the value of biological resources (Implementing Action PRC-6.1.b). Policy PRC-6.2 would encourage future development to avoid sensitive biological resources by alternative site designs. Policy PRC-9.1 would encourage natural drainage flows to be maintained to the extent feasible, mainly through City requirements to buffer natural drainage corridors, which would be imposed during the development review process as set forth in Implementing Action PRC-9.1.a. The buffering requirement would assist in preserving the quality of habitat used by special-status fish species. Implementation of these General Plan policies and implementing actions would reduce impacts to special-status wildlife species associated with the General Plan Update to less than significant.

Additional Mitigation Measures

None required.

Riparian Habitat

Impact 4.8.3 Implementation of the proposed General Plan could result in the loss of
riparian habitat areas in the City. This is considered a potentially significant
impact.

Riparian habitat supports a high diversity of wildlife species and provides shade for streams and wetlands, maintaining stream temperatures and reducing stream evaporation. This habitat is considered important and sensitive by the USFWS, CDFG, USACE and the City of Colusa. It also is considered to be a sensitive natural community under CEQA. Implementation of the General Pian update would result in disturbance, degradation, and removal of riparian habitat, since this habitat does occur in areas planned for development. It also would result in direct and indirect

impacts to riparian conditions along the Sacramento River. Indirect impacts to riparian habitat could occur with implementation of the proposed General Plan which may include habitat degradation as a result of impacts to water quality (see Section 4.8, Hydrology and Water Quality, regarding water quality impacts), introduction of non-native species, and increased human presence. Riparian habitat is under the jurisdiction of the CDFG under California Fish and
Game Code Section 1602.

Impacts after implementation of the above-identified General Plan policies and actions would
be less than signiticant.

Additional Mitigation Measures

None required.

Wetlands and Other Waters of the U.S

Impact 4.8.4 Implementation of the proposed General Plan could result in the loss of wetlands or other waters of the U.S. This is considered a potentially significant impact.

Implementation of the proposed General Plan would result in impacts on wetlands, irrigation canals and ditches and other waters of the U.S., primarily the Sacramento River. Development within the proposed General Plan Planning Area has the potential to impact riparian wetlands
along the Sacramento River and other wetland areas such as irrigation canals and drainage
ditches. This future development could physically affect these waters, which are potentially subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps). Activities that have impacts on these wetlands and other jurisdictional waters would require a Section 404 permit from USACE and a Section 401 Water Quality Certification from the Regional Water Quality Control Board. Potential trenching of the Sacramento River also would require a Streambed Alteration Agreement from CDFG. USACE and CDFG have a "no net loss" policy applicable to jurisdictional waters, particularly wetlands,

Additional Mitigation Measures

None required.

Migratory Corridors and Nursery Sites

Impact 4.8.5 Implementation of the proposed General Plan could result in substantial interference with the movement of any native resident or migratory fish or
wildlife species with established native resident or migratory wildlife corridors,
or impede the use of native wildlife nursery sites. This is considered a potentially significant impact.
Although this portion of the Central Valley is a part of the Pacific Flyway, implementation of the General Plan update would not result in the obstruction of the movement of migratory birds as the aquatic areas and associated riparian habitat, as well as areas of suitable foraging habitat, will still be available within the proposed Planning Area. Migratory birds may however use the wetlands, ponds, irrigation ditches and other water features during migration. The major area with remaining natural lands includes the riparian corridor along the Sacramento River which provides adequate cover and vegetation to be used as a migratory corridor for common and special-status fish and wildlife species. Implementation of the General Plan update would result in disturbance, degradation, and removal of portions of the riparian corridor, an important
corridor for the movement of common and speciai-status species. The proposed General Plan also could result in habitat degradation due to additional traffic, increased human presence, and degradation of water quality.

Implementation of the proposed General Plan policies and implementing actions would reduce potential impacts on migratory corridors and nursery sites, mainly by protecting the riparian corridor from substantial
development. Impacts would be less than significant.
Additional Mitigation Measures

None required.

Loss of Trees

Impact 4.8.6 Implementation of the proposed General Plan could result in removal of trees, which may conflict with the intent of a City tree ordinance. This is considered is a potentially significant impact.
Locaily important biological resources within the proposed Planning Area consist of some native and non-native trees. These resources are considered important and sensitive by the City of Colusa, which has adopted a tree ordinance that provides some protection. Subsequent development under the proposed General Plan could result in direct loss of these resources, since these resources occur in areas planned for development. These areas are primarily located along drainage ditches, such as east of the Colusa Medical Center and along Will S.
Green Avenue. This would conflict with the purpose of the City's tree ordinance, which is to
preserve trees whenever feasible. The City's tree ordinance would be required to be updated

Habitat Conservation Plan Conflicts

Impact 4.8.7 The proposed General Plan does not conflict with any habitat conservation plan or natural community conservation plan in the area. This is considered to have no impact.
There are currently no adopted habitat conservation plans or natural community conservation plans in the General Plan Planning Area. Biological resource issues associated with implementation of the proposed General Plan and habitats and special status species are addressed in Section 4.8 Biological Resources of this document.

Therefore, the development proposed in association with the proposed General Plan will not have an impact on any habitat conservation plans or natural community conservation plans in
the area.

4.9 HISTORIC AND CULTURAL RESOURCES

4.9 CULTURAL RESOURCES

This section considers and evaluates the potential impacts of the proposed General Plan Update on cultural and paleontological resources. Cultural resources include historic buildings
and structures, historic districts, historic sites, prehistoric and historic archaeological sites, and other prehistoric and historic objects and artifacts. Paleontological resources include fossil remains, as well as fossil localities and formations, which have produced fossil material in other nearby areas. Key issues addressed in this section are: loss or disturbance of historical buildings
and sites, and loss of cultural and paleontological resources. Information for this section primarily
came from cultural resource investigations conducted by PMC.

4.9.1 EXISTING SETTING

PREHISTORIC ENVIRONMENT

The Central Valley of California has long held the attention of California archaeologists. The project area is within Patwin ethnographic territory. Patwin are the southernmost members of a group of Native American cultures (i.e., Wintu, Nomlaki, and Patwin) that share a related set of languages. The Native American members of the Colusa Rancheria identify themselves as the Cachil Dehe Band of Wintun Indians. Consequently, Wintun will be used as an alternative to Patwin in this discussion. Wintun occupied the southwest portion of the Sacramento Valley, from the lower hills of the eastern North Coast Ranges to the Sacramento River, and from Princeton south to San Pablo and Suisun Bays. A number of Wintun villages had been identified along the Sacramento River near the City of Colusa (Kroeber 1925, 1932).
Wintun are comprised of numerous different tribal groups with separate dialects. Wintun were organized into tribelets, which were usually composed of a principal village and a few satellite settlements. Each tribelet had a head chief and each village had a chief who administered its
economic and ceremonial activities. The chief possessed political, ceremonial, and economic
powers and enjoyed high prestige (McKern, 1922).

Wintun subsistence relied on hunting, fishing, and gathering a wide variety of plant resources that were located within their territory. Acorns were a major part of their diet, and were
obtained from hill and mountain oaks communally owned by the tribelet (Johnson, 1978). Ethnographic records indicate that large game (e.g., deer, tule elk, antelope) was captured using nets or were shot using bows-and-arrows (Johnson, 1978). Fish were also a prime resource a for River Wintun, and certain fishing sites were privately owned (Kroeber, 1932; McKern, 1922). Wintun manufactured a variety of utilitarian and ceremonial/luxury items, including baskets, stone tools, mortars and pestles, shell beads and clothing. Mortuary customs of the ethnographic Wintun involved elaborate mourning ceremonies for the deceased, burial rather
than cremation, interment in tightly flexed positions, and the simultaneous burial of one's
possessions at death.

The Korusi

The City of Colusa is located at the site of the former Native American village of Koru. Koru was
the governing seat for the Korusi tribelet of Southern Wintun. There are several spellings of the names of tribelet groups and villages along the Sacramento River in Colusa County. Some of the spellings for the Korusi tribelet are Koru, Ko-r0o, Coru, Kol-loos, Coluse, Korusi, Ko-ru-si, Colusi, Colouse, and Colusa. The native language pronunciation of "r" was a quick roll, which was probably interpreted by Euroamericans as an "I", a distortion that created the name "Colusa" (De Jarnatt, 1886; Green, 1880; Merriam, n.d.; Rogers, 1891). The Korusi inhabited the land on the west side of the Sacramento River, from approximately 2 miles above Princeton south to approximately one-quarter mile below Grimes at the mouth of Sycamore Slough. Additional

4.9 CULTURAL RESOURCES

settlements were located along western tributaries of the Sacramento River, extending as far as 35 miles across the valley. Early travelers noted many Korusi villages along the river, but all agreed that Koru was the largest (Green, 1880; Merriam, 1935; Rogers, 1891).
The earliest reference to the Korusi and a village named "Coru" is by Padre Blas Ordaz in 1821 (Cook, 1962). Other early accounts of the Korusi and their villages come from notes and manuscripts by General John Bidwell. In 1843, Bidwell and a small party of men traveled south along the Sacramento River through Korusi territory on their way to Sutter's Fort in Sacramento. Bidwell estimated the population of the village of Koru to be at least 1,000. He also noted 17 large villages west of Colusa along a stream that connected to the Sacramento River and estimated that not less than 15,000-20,000 Native Americans occupied the area within ten miles of Koru (Green, 1880; Rogers, 1891). Bidwell's population estimates, however, could be low
because the Korusi were probably affected by the smallpox epidemic of 1833 that reduced the
populations of Native Americans in the valley by an estimated 75 percent (Cook 1939, 1955, 1978). Consequently, it is probable that Native American populations in the area were significantly larger prior to Bidwell's travels through the area.
Will S. Green, one of Colusa's early settlers, recalled in his History of Colusa County, that there were at least 15 Korusi villages along the Sacramento River when he arrived in 1850. He
estimated the Korusi population along the river to be at least 1,000, and that village and family boundaries were marked by particular sloughs. Most of these villages were well populated and had their own communal structures and sweat lodges (Green, 1851; Rogers, 1891). C. Hart Merriam, a federal biologist who had visited the area several times in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, also made a list of 42 Koru and Patwin village names and their locations along the Sacramento River from two miles above Princeton to Knights Landing (Merriam, n.d.). Based on 1935 interviews with remaining members of the Korusi, Merriam related that Korusi traditionally
would likely have crossed the river to the eastern side to set up temporary camps. No permanent villages were established on the east banks due to the propensity for flooding on that side of the river.

HISTORIC PERIOD

Mission registers provide the earliest historic accounts of Wintun populations. Consequently, Euroamerican contact with Wintun groups occurred by at least 1800 (Johnson, 1978). The influx
of European and Spanish explorers and settlers during the 1830s and 1840s certainly affected Wintun populations. The discovery of gold at Sutter's Mill in Coloma in 1848, however, was the catalyst that caused a dramatic a alteration of both Native American and Euroamerican cultural patterns in California. Initially, the Euroamerican population grew slowly, but soon exploded as the presence of large deposits of gold was confirmed in the Sacramento area. The population of California quickly swelled from an estimated 4,000 Euroamericans in 1848 to 500,000 in 1850.
The territory of the Korusi was granted to or purchased by several early settlers in the region. Bidwell surveyed and mapped the Colusa area in 1844 as part of land grant requests he and others submitted to the Mexican government. Subsequently, Bidwell personally acquired the Colusa Land Grant in 1845, which included the village of Koru (Rogers, 1891). The Korusi were allowed to remain in their traditional villages until the late 1840s. For example, the village of Koru appears to have remained relatively undisturbed until 1849. The Korusi tribe was included in the
1851 United States treaty negotiations with native populations (Heizer, 1972). Sioc, the Korusi chief, signed a treaty with the U.S. government, and the remaining people of his tribelet were relocated north of Koru.

4.9 CULTURAL RESOURCES

Dr. Robert Semple, a Kentuckian, made a trip up the Sacramento Valley in 1847. He was so impressed with the beautiful land in
the vicinity of Koru that three years later he convinced his brother, C.D. Semple, to purchase part of the Colusa Land Grant previously acquired by Bidwell. The portion of property that C.D. Semple purchased included the village of Koru. Semple occupied his property in early 1850, and by July had "mapped out" the town of Colusa (originally called Salmon Bend) and sold 25
"lots" {McComish and Lambert 1918). At
about the same time, Sioc, chief of the Korusi, decided to move Koru to the east
side of the river, across from Semple's
Colusa (Green 1880). Although disputes arose over land ownership, the general area continued to develop. By the end of 1851, Colusa County was organized. Colusa was selected as the county seat in 1854 (Green, 1880; McComish and Lambert, 1918; Rogers, 1891).
The decline of the Korusi, as with other groups of Native Americans, was relatively rapid after the establishment of permanent Euroamerican settlements. By 1900, the dwindling population of Korusi occupied only two villages located nine miles north of Colusa (Green, 1880; Hendrix, 1992). Congress never ratified the 1851 treaty signed by Sioc. Therefore, no formal rancheria
was set up for the Korusi until 1907, when the government bought 40 acres approximately 4 miles north of Colusa. By that time, there were only about 60 natives left in Colusa County, and the population fell to only 50 by 1918 (McComish and Lambert, 1918}.
Beginning in the late 19th century, Colusa County and the City of Colusa became agricultural
centers for the production of wheat. Wheat was shipped down the river and then on to England. In 1876, Colusa County produced 143,000 tons of wheat for export. In 1894, the wheat bonanza came to an end when Australia, Argentina, and Canada all became major wheat exporters and the price of wheat fell dramatically. In 1911-12, rice was introduced into the valley and eventually replaced wheat as the major agricultural crop in Colusa County. Rice required more water than other crops, which fostered the development of irrigation projects such as the Glenn-Colusa Irrigation Canal. Consequently, both rice and water have been major factors in the growth of both Colusa County and the City of Colusa.

CULTURAL RESOURCES IN THE PROPOSED PLANNING AREA

Previous archaeological and historical investigations encompassed approximately 50 percent of the proposed Planning Area. These investigations have led to the determination that the proposed Planning Area is archaeologically sensitive. The following cultural resources have been identified:

• Eight prehistoric or historic archaeological sites.
A minimum of 244 buildings identified as locally significant or eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places and/or the California Register of Historical Resources.
California State Historical Landmark Number 890, the Colusa County Courthouse.

PALEONTOLOGICAL RESOURCES

Paleontology is defined as a science dealing with the life of past geological periods as known from fossil remains. Paleontological resources include fossil remains, as well as fossil localities and formations, which have produced fossil material in other nearby areas. This resource can be an important educational resource, and are classified as non-renewable scientific resources.
Paleontological resources are protected by California Public Resources Code Section 5097.5. A search of the University of California Museum of Paleontology (UCMP) collections database did not identify any evidence of significant paleontological resources in the proposed Planning
Area.

4.9.2 REGULATORY FRAMEWORK

FEDERAL

National Historic Preservation Act

The National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), enacted in 1966, attempts to preserve the historical and cultural foundations of the American people. Section 106 of the NHPA primarily governs federal regulations for cultural resources. Section 106 requires federal agencies to take into account the effects of their undertakings on historic properties. The goal of the Section 106 review process is to offer a measure of protection to sites, which are determined eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places. 36 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 60
contain the criteria for determining National Register eligibility. Recent amendments to the NHPA (1986 and 1992) and subsequent revisions to the implementation regulations have strengthened the provisions for Native American consultation and participation in the Section 106 review process. While federal agencies must follow federal regulations, most projects by private developers and landowners do not require this level of compliance. Federal regulations apply in the private sector only the project requires a federal permit or if it uses federal money.

STATE

California Register of Historic Places

The California Register of Historic Places serves as the authoritative guide to resources considered historic under CEQA. Generally, a resource shall be considered by the lead agency to be "historically significant" if the resource meets the criteria for listing on the California Register
of Historical Resources (California Public Resources Code Section 5024.1; Title 14 California Code
of Regulations, Section 4852). The Register establishes 50 years as the period in which sufficient time has passed to allow a scholarly perspective in understanding the historic importance of a
resource. A historical resource must be significant at the local, State, or national level under one
or more of the following four criteria:

l. It is associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad
patterns of local or regional history, or the cultural heritage of California or the United
States;

2. It is associated with the lives of persons important to local, California, or national
history;

3. It embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, region, or method of construction, or represents the work of a master or possesses high artistic values; or.

4. It has yielded, or has the potential to yield, information important to the prehistory or history of the local area, California, or the nation.
A historical resource must also retain the integrity of its physical identity that existed during the resource's period of significance and is evaluated with regard to the retention of location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association.

4.9 CULTURAL RESOURCES

California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA)

Under CEQA, public agencies must consider the effects of their actions on both "historical
resources" and "unique archaeological resources" (California Public Resources Code Sections 21083.2 and 21084.1). Pursuant to Public Resources Code Section 21084.1, a "project that may cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of an historical resource is a project that may have a significant effect on the environment." "Historical resource" is defined in Public
Resources Code Section 21084.1 as any resource listed in or determined to be eligible for listing in the California Register of Historical Resources (CRHR). More specifically, CEQA Guidelines Section 15064.5 defines an historical resource as "any object, building, structure, site, area, place, record, or manuscript that is historically or archeologically significant, or is significant in the architectural, engineering, scientific, economic, agricultural, educational, social, political or
cultural annals of California." A resource shall be considered "historically significant" if it meets any of the following criteria (CEQA Guidelines Section 15064.5):
Is associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns
of California's history and cultural heritage;

Is associated with the lives of persons important in our past;
Embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, region, or method of construction, or represents the work of an important creative individual, or possesses high artistic values; or

Has yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history.
For historic structures, CEQA Guidelines Section 15064.5(b) (3) indicates that generally a project that follows the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties with Guidelines for Preserving, Rehabilitating, Restoring, and Reconstructing Historic Buildings, or the
Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation and Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic
Buildings (1995), shall mitigate impacts to a level that is less than significant. Potential eligibility also rests upon the integrity of the resource. Integrity is defined as the retention of the resource's physical identity that existed during its period of significance. Integrity is determined through considering the setting, design, workmanship, materials, location, feeling and association of the
resource.

As noted above, CEQA also requires lead agencies to consider whether projects will impact unique archaeological resources. Public Resources Code Section 21083.2(g) defines "unique archaeological resource" as an archaeological artifact, object, or site about which it can be
clearly demonstrated that, without merely adding to the current body of knowledge, there is a is high probability that it meets any of the following criteria:

• Contains information needed to answer important scientific research questions and that
there is a demonstrable public interest in that information.
Has a special and particular quality such as being the oldest of its type or the best available example of its type.
is directly associated with a scientifically recognized important prehistoric or historic event or person.
Treatment options under Section 21083.2 include activities that preserve such resources in place in an undisturbed state. Other acceptable methods of mitigation include excavation and

4.9-6

4.9 CULTURAL RESOURCES

curation, or study in place without excavation and curation if the study finds that the artifacts would not meet one or more of the criteria for defining a unique archaeological resource.
CEQA Guidelines Section 15064.5(f) requires that a lead agency make provisions for the accidental discovery of historical or archaeological resources, generally. These provisions should include "an immediate evaluation of the find by a qualified archaeologist. If the find is
determined to be an historical or unique archaeological resource, contingency funding and a time allotment sufficient to allow for implementation of avoidance measures or appropriate mitigation should be available. Work could continue on other parts of the building site while
historical or unique archaeological resource mitigation takes place."

Paleontological Resources
The Environmental Checklist in Appendix G of the CEQA Guidelines mentions impacts on paleontological resources, indicating it is an issue requiring disclosure and analysis in the CEQA review process. No state or local agencies have specific jurisdiction over paleontological resources. No state or local agency requires a paleontological collecting permit to allow for the recovery of fossil remains discovered as a result of construction-related earth moving on state or private land in a project site.

Native American Burials

California law protects Native American burials, skeletal remains and associated grave goods regardless of their antiquity and provides for the sensitive treatment and disposition of those remains. Section 7050.5(b) of the California Health and Safety code specifies protocol when human remains are discovered. CEQA Guidelines Section 15064.5(e) requires that excavation
activities be stopped whenever human remains are uncovered and that the County Coroner be
called in to assess the remains. If the County Coroner determines that the remains are those of
Native Americans, the Native American Heritage Commission must be contacted within 24
hours. At that time, the lead agency must consult with the appropriate Native Americans, if any,
as timely identified by the Native American Heritage Commission. CEQA Guidelines Section 15064.5 directs the lead agency or applicant, under certain circumstances, to develop an agreement with the Native Americans for the treatment and disposition of the remains.

SB 18

Senate Bill (SB) 18 (California Government Code Sections 65352.3 and 65352.4) provides a mechanism for Native American tribes to become involved in planning activities that may affect specified Native American places, features, and objects. SB 18 requires that, prior to the
adoption or amendment of a general plan or a specific plan, a city or county must notify the appropriate Native American tribes of the opportunity to consult with that jurisdiction. The contacted tribes have 90 days to respond to the notification to consult. The Native American
Heritage Commission maintains a list of tribes that each jurisdiction may contact for consultation.
In addition, prior to adopting or substantially amending a general plan or specific plan, the local government must refer the proposed action to the appropriate tribes at least 45 days in
advance of the action.

LOCAL

City of Colusa General Plan

The adopted City of Colusa General Plan currently is used as the "blueprint" to guide future development within the City limits and in unincorporated portions of the existing Planning Area.
The proposed General Plan Update would replace existing policies and implementing actions associated with historic and cultural resources. Specific proposed policies and implementing
actions are discussed in the impact analyses below.

4.9.3 IMPACTS AND MITIGATION MEASURES

STANDARDS OF SIGNIFICANCE

Based on Appendix G of the CEQA Guidelines, historic and cultural resource impacts are considered to be significant if the following could result from the implementation of the General
Plan update:

l. A substantial adverse change in the significance of a historical resource as defined in
CEQA Guidelines Section 15064.5.

2. A substantial adverse change in the significance of an archaeological resource pursuant to CEQA Guidelines Section 15064.5.

3. Direct or indirect destruction of a unique paleontological resource or site or unique
geologic feature.

4. Disturbance of any human remains, including those interred outside of formal
cemeteries.

METHODOLOGY

Cultural resources staff of PMC conducted an archaeological and historical investigation of the
proposed Planning Area. This included a records search al a the Northwest Information Center at Sonoma State University, a sacred lands search conducted by the Native American Heritage Commission, consultation with the Native American community, and archival research. In
addition, PMC conducted a search of the University of California Museum of Paleontology collections database for paleontological resources within the proposed Planning Area
boundaries.

IMPACTS AND MITIGATION MEASURES FOR THE GENERAL PLAN UPDATE

Historic Resources

Impact 4.9.1 Implementation of the proposed General Plan Update could result in the disturbance of known historic resources in the proposed Planning Area. This is considered a potentially significant impact.
Development under the proposed General Plan Update could conflict with existing known historical resources. In particular, activities in the downtown area could have an adverse impact on identified historical resources. Historical resources in the proposed Planning Area are discussed in the Existing Setting subsection and identified in Table 4.9-1). As previously noted, a

4.9 CULTURAL RESOURCES

project that may cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of a historical resource
may have a significant effect on the environment. CEQA Guidelines Section 15064.5 defines a
"substantial adverse change" as "physical demolition, destruction, relocation, or alteration of the resource or its immediate surroundings such that the significance of an historical resource would be materially impaired." While demolition or destruction of these historic sites is unlikely, activities could alter the surrounding area such that the historic value of these buildings or sites would be diminished.

Proposed General Plan Policies and Implementing Actions that Mitigate Potential Impacts

Community Character and Design Element

Policy CCD-1.1 New development and rehabilitation of existing development shall comply with a Design Review process that supports preservation and enhancement of Colusa's community character and promotes economic
vitality within the Planning Area.

Implementing Action CCD-1.1.b: Design Guidelines

The City will adopt Community Design Guidelines in which preservation and enhancement of
the City's existing character will be the overriding design principle. These Guidelines, to be used in conjunction with the City's zoning ordinance, will include specific design criteria for each of the foilowing development types:
Historic Downtown and Riverfront District Design Criteria: Criteria to incorporate design provisions that encourage and facilitate the preservation and restoration of Colusa's historic residences, buildings and landmarks. To include a set of historic preservation principles. These principles will be used to provide guidance for the preservation of architectural features, use of historic building materiais, adaptive reuse of historic structures, and recommendations for new additions, site features, signage and public
improvements.

Rehabilitation, Reconstruction, and Renovation Design Criteria: Criteria will establish minimum acceptable standards for quality rehabilitation of historic buildings and other residential and non-residential structures. They will focus on site development relating to open space and street facades, building design and materials, and pedestrian and
vehicle access.

Policy CCD-10.1 The City will encourage and promote the preservation, restoration,
rehabilitation, and adaptive reuse of downtown structures in a manner
that preserves and enhances their historic character to the greatest
extent feasible.

implementing Action CCD-10.1.b: Ordinance No. 403 Article 30-Landmark and Historic
Preservation Ordinance

The City will complete an update of the Landmark and Historic Preservation Ordinance. This ordinance will provide for the identification, designation, protection and enhancement of historic structures and landscapes that reflect Colusa's heritage. It is also intended to prevent the needless destruction and impairment of such site's structures and areas, as well as to
discourage the decay, disuse and neglect of the same to promote economic vitality in the City.

4.9 CULTURAL RESOURCES

Policy CCD-10.2 Demolition of historic structures shall be considered a "last-resort" remedy for buildings, limited to those in such disrepair that they are beyond reconstruction or relocation and are creating blight and threatening public health and safety. Prior to any demolition, the City shall ensure that the neighborhood interest will be served best by removal and that demolition is the only reasonable course of action.

Policy CCD-10.3 The City shall require high-quality architecture that preserves the historic integrity within the historic Downtown. "Franchise architecture" that
detracts from the unique and distinctive setting of the Downtown shall be
discouraged.

Policy CCD-10.4 Building renovations of historic structures shall complement the character of historic architecture in the Downtown.

Policy CCD-10.6 Exterior alterations of historic structures with no historic basis shall be
discouraged.

Policy CCD-10.7 Rehabilitation and renovation projects shall ensure that the integrity of distinctive historic features and examples of skilled crattsmanship that
characterize structure is maintained.

Parks, Recreation and Resource Conservation Element

Policy PRC-4.1 The City shall encourage the inclusion of significant sites or districts in the Federal or State Historical Register.

Implementing Action PRC-4.1.a: Landmark and Historic Preservation Ordinance

The City will update the Landmark and Historic Preservation Ordinance to ensure effective
preservation, protection and management of Colusa's historic and culturai resources.

Policy PRC-4.2 The City shall preserve identified cultural and historic landmarks and
buildings, and ensure that new development, redevelopment, alterations and remodeling projects are sensitive to the historic context.

Implementing Action PRC-4.2.a: Development Review

As a part of the development review process, discretionary development projects will be required to identify any important historic andjor cuitural sites the development may impact, and avoid disturbance to or degradation of these resources.

Implementing Action PRC-4.2.b: Public Awareness and Education
The City's role in public education about cuitural and historic resources will be to work with the Heritage Preservation Committee to promote involvement in historical preservation, construction of informational markers, and historic structure restoration efforts. In partnership with this group and locai historians, outreach efforts will be made to solicit involvement in signage design, funding and construction through local schools, businesses and residents.

Policy PRC-4.3 The City shall encourage the preservation, enhancement, and conservation of historic and older neighborhoods through its direct
actions.

4.9 CULTURAL RESOURCES

Implementing Action PRC-4.3.a: Federal, State and Local Funding
The City will work cooperatively with private developers to pursue financial incentives through Federal, State and local funding sources that encourage structural rehabilitation and restoration of private historic properties. The City will also pursue grants for historic preservation, such as the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) and the California Heritage Fund (provided by the Safe Neighborhood Parks, Clean Water, Clean Air and Coastal Protection Bond Act of 2000j.
Implementing Action PRC-4.3.b: Mills Act

The City will participate in the Mills Act Tax Abatement Program as an economic incentive for
private property owners to actively participate in the restoration of their properties. The Mills Act legislation grants participating local governments (cities and counties) the authority to enter into contracts with owners of qualified historic properties that actively participate in the restoration and maintenance of their historic properties while receiving property tax relief.
The policies and implementing actions in the proposed Community Character and Design Element intend to preserve the historic appearance and character of existing historic buildings is and districts. Key to this is the adoption of design guidelines, as Implementing Action CCD-1.1.b would require. The policies and implementing actions in the proposed Parks, Recreation and Resource Conservation Element have the same objective. Actions to implement these policies
include identification and mitigation of impacts during the development review process, update of the Landmark and Historic Preservation Ordinance, increased public awareness of the value of the City's historic resources, and funding of preservation and conservation programs. Implementation of the proposed General Plan Update policies and implementing actions would avoid or reduce adverse impacts on identified historic buildings and districts. Impacts after implementation would be less than significant.

Additional Mitigation Measures

None required.

Disturbance of Cultural and Paleontologic Resources

Impact 4.9.2 Future development associated with implementation of the General Plan
could uncover known and currently unknown cultural resources, including paleontologic resources and human remains, thereby disturbing their sites. This is considered a potentially signiticant impact.
There is a potential for development accommodated under the proposed General Plan Update
to encounter identified as well as currently undiscovered prehistoric and historic resources. As noted in the Existing Setting subsection, a substantial Native American population existed in the Colusa area. There are eight known archaeological sites in the proposed Planning Area. The archaeological and historical review conducted by PMC concluded that the proposed Planning Area is archaeologically sensitive for both prehistoric and historic sites and artifacts. Future development accommodated by the proposed General Plan Update would disturb areas with a high potential for historic and prehistoric resources, including areas near the
Sacramento River. This disturbance may result in damage to or loss of these resources.
A search of the University of California, Berkeley Museum of Paleontology collections database did not identify any evidence of paleontological resources (fossils) in the proposed Planning
Area. However, there is a possibility of unanticipated and accidental paleontological

City of Colusa Colusa General Plan

4.9 CULTURAL RESOURCES

discoveries during ground-disturbing activities. Unanticipated and accidental paleontological discoveries during project implementation have the potential to impact paleontological
resources.

As previously described, the Colusa area contained a high concentration of Native Americans prior to settlement by Euroamericans. Although no burial sites have been explicitly identified, it is possible that Native American remains may be located within the proposed Planning Area. These remains could be encountered during future construction work. It is also possible that gravesites containing non-Native American remains could be encountered.
As discussed in the Regulatory Framework subsection, if human remains are discovered, all work must stop in the immediate vicinity of the find, and the County Coroner must be notified, according to Section 7050.5 of California's Health and Safety Code. If the remains are determined to be Native American, the coroner will notify the Native American Heritage Commission, and the procedures outlined in CEQA Guidelines Section 15064.5(d) and (e) shall
be followed. Compliance with these regulations and guidelines would minimize impacts on
uncovered human remains, and ensure a proper and respectful disposition of these remains.

Proposed General Plan Policies and Implementing Actions that Mitigate Potential Impacts

Parks, Recreation and Resource Conservation Element

Policy PRC-4.2 (see Impact 4.9.1)
Implementing Action PRC-4.2.a: Development Review (see Impact 4.9.1)
Policy PRC-4.2 encourages the preservation of historic and cultural landmarks in the City. Implementing Action PRC-4.2.a would identify development project impacts on such resources
during the development review process, and mitigate these impacts if necessary. However, this policy and implementing action does not explicitly identify measures to take if previously unknown historic or prehistoric resources are discovered. Typically, such measures are identified and implemented at the development project level, either as a mitigation measure or as a condition of approval. However, to make the City's CEQA review process more efficient in this circumstance, the following mitigation measure shail be implemented at the Generai Plan level.
The proposed General Plan Update has no policies addressing impacts on paleontological resources. Since on the potential for paleontological resources discovery and disturbance exists, such impacts are considered potentiaily significant.

Additional Mitigation Measures

MM 4.9.2 AS part of the development review process conducted under Implementing Action PRC-4.2.a: Development Review, discretionary development projects
shall identify any known paleontological sites that may be affected by the project, address the potential for paloentological resources to exist on the site, and identify measures to avoid disturbance to or degradation of these
resources.

Implementation of the mitigation measure, along with the proposed General Plan policies and action items, would avoid or minimize adverse physical impacts on cultural resources, including prehistoric and paleontological resources, and ensure their proper disposition with minimal loss of resource value. Impacts after mitigation would be less than significant.

4.10 VISUAL RESOURCES

4.10 VISUAL RESOURCES/LIGHT AND GLARE

This section describes the existing visual resources of the proposed Planning Area, summarizes its
landscape characteristics, and discusses the impacts associated with implementation of the General Plan Update. The analysis focuses on the anticipated alteration of the landscape characteristics and potential visual resource impacts in the proposed Planning Area. Key issues addressed in this section include: alteration of existing visual character, degradation of scenic resources or views of scenic resources, and increased light and glare. Information for this section
comes from City staff, field observations and public documents.

4.10.1 EXISTING SETTING

In general, the dominant visual features within the proposed Planning Area are the Sacramento River, urban development, agricultural lands, and various species of trees. Because the terrain is relatively flat, views of these resources are available from roadways throughout the proposed Planning Area, except for the Sacramento River. Views of the Sutter Buttes and Coast Ranges are available, and the Sierra Nevada foothills and mountains can be visible under clear
conditions.

CITY LANDSCAPE

The City of Colusa was founded in 1850, and incorporated in 1868. Originally, the City developed adjacent to the Sacramento River, which reflected its status as a steamship port. Today, much of the City's commercial area is located in the section from Main Street to Oak
Street. Residential areas developed around this commercial center. The variety of housing styles reflects the development of these residential areas over the years. Some houses from the 19th century Victorian era may still be seen, along with housing from later periods.

Two distinct areas have been identified within
the City of Colusa. One is the Downtown
area, a primarily commercial area located
around Market Street. Downtown has been
the historic commercial center of the City, and still has significant activity. The other area is the Riverfront district. As defined in the
proposed General Plan Update, the Riverfront district is the area between the Sacramento
River and Market Street, between Thirteenth
Street and Bridge Street. The Riverfront district
currently has a mix of commercial, residential
and public land uses, as well as the historic
Chinatown area.

The City developed on a grid street pattern, comprised of 300-foot-wide blocks and 20-foot- wide alleys bisecting each block. This pattern, along with streetscape additions such as established tree canopies and sidewalks, has assisted in lending a "small town" atmosphere to much of the City. It is also credited with providing a more pedestrian-friendly urban environment, as residential neighborhoods are well connected to the commercial activities in
downtown Colusa. More recent residential developments, in the southern portion of the City, are of a more suburban character. Characteristics in these residential developments include wider and more curvilinear streets, cul-de-sacs, and greater prominence of garages in single- family residences.

4.10 VISUAL RESOURCES/LIGHT AND GLARE

Historic visual resources are important features of a community's history, providing a link between the visual landscape of the past and the urbanized landscape that characterizes the present. Examples of historic visual resources include buildings, structures, landmarks, monuments and other visually prominent features. The most notable historic structure in Colusa is
the Colusa County Courthouse along Market Street. Other historic structures of note include the
former Colusa High School building (now a performing arts center) and the Carnegie Library (now housing the Colusa Police Department). The older houses in Colusa contribute to the visual
quality of the community. For additional discussion on historic resources within the proposed Planning Area, please refer to Section 4.9, Historic and Cultural Resources.
Interspersed throughout the City are open space areas such as parks, school grounds and the local cemetery. Open space areas provide a visual break from the predominantly built environment, with their lack of large structures and provision of relatively large areas of grass. They also allow for a variety of activities from sitting to organized sports programs. Outside the City limits are two major open space areas. One is the Colusa Sacramento River State Recreation Area, adjacent to and north of the City. This unit of the State Parks system contains mature oaks and other trees that provide shade for picnic areas and campsites. The other is the
Colusa Golf Course, southeast of the City near the Colusa County Airport. This nine-hole course
not only is a recreational amenity, but also provides a view of green spaces for motorists entering the City from the southeast on State Route 20/45.

AGRICULTURAL LAND

Agricultural lands surround the City of Colusa. Agricultural lands offer a break from the urban landscape by providing an open space visual resource, characterized by lack of structures. Generally, there is a distinctive boundary between the built-up urban area and the agricultural lands. The proposed Planning Area currently contains a variety of agricultural uses, the main ones including row crops, field crops, orchards, and grazing land for cattle. For a detailed description and analysis of agricultural resources within the proposed Planning Area, refer to Section 4.1, Land Use and Agricultural Resources.

TREE RESOURCES

The proposed Planning Area contains many native tree types, such as valley oak, interior live oak, cottonwood and willow. These trees, found in rural and urban areas, propagate and grow under natural conditions along water channels. They also provide a visual break from the uniformity of urban development. Non-native trees are also found in the proposed Planning Area, mostly planted because of ornamental value, shade production, resistance to particular
pests, or proven adaptation to the urban environment. There are no woodland corridors in the
proposed Planning Area, except for the riparian woodland along the Sacramento River.

SACRAMENTO RIVER

The main natural feature within the proposed Planning Area is the Sacramento River. The Sacramento River forms much of the northern and eastern boundary of the proposed Planning Area, and the City of Colusa is located along its southern bank. The river is the only significant stream within the proposed Planning Area. The Colusa Basin Drain, approximately three miles west of the City, diverts streams from the Coast Ranges that approach Colusa.
The river has been important in the City's history, as it served as a major transportation route for steamships. Colusa's role as a steamship port was a major factor in the City's early development. Today, the Sacramento River serves as a scenic and recreational a amenity for the
Colusa General Plan City of Colusa
Draft Master Environmental Impact Report July 2007
4.10-2

4.10 VISUAL RESOURCES/LIGHT AND GLARE

City. Trees and other riparian vegetation grow along the riverbanks. This provides a green and shaded area during the summer months, when temperatures are hot and other vegetation becomes dry. The river itself provides a scenic water feature through a region that is generally dry in the summertime, outside of irrigated fields. The river supports the landscape of the Colusa Sacramento River State Recreation Area.

It should be noted that views of the Sacramento River from the City of Colusa and other portions of the proposed Planning Area are obstructed by a levee along the southern bank. The levee is a flood control measure and cannot be removed. However, the levee top affords views of the river and adjoining areas. The top has a paved surface that can be utilized by bicyclists and pedestrians, making it a scenic way.

SCENIC VISTAS

Views of natural features, both near and distant, can add to the appeal of a town. Within the a proposed Planning Area, the most prominent scenic vista is that of the Sutter Buttes, located approximately nine miles to the east. The Sutter Buttes are readily visible from every part of the proposed Planning is Area that is not significantly obstructed by trees or urban development. To the west, the Coast Ranges are visible from the western portion. However, they are less visible from other portions, as they are farther away and therefore more easily obstructed than the Sutter Buttes. The foothills and mountains of the Sierra Nevada, located to the east, are even
more distant from the City. They are visible mainly from relatively undeveloped areas in the south and east of the proposed Planning Area, and are partially obstructed by the Sutter Buttes. Views of the Sierra Nevada may also be affected by poor air quality, as haze caused by air pollution reduces the visibility of more distant features.

4.10.2.1 REGULATORY FRAMEWORK

STATE

Scenic Highway Program
California's Scenic Highway Program was created by the Legislature in 1963. Its purpose was to preserve and protect scenic highway corridors from changes that would diminish the aesthetic value of lands adjacent to highways. A highway may be designated scenic depending upon how much of the natural landscape can be seen by travelers, the scenic quality of the landscape, and the extent to which development intrudes upon the traveler's enjoyment of the view. A scenic corridor is the land generally adjacent to and visible from the highway and is identified using a motorist's line of vision. A reasonable boundary is selected when the view extends to the distant horizon. There are currently no designated scenic highways within the proposed Planning Area.

LOCAL

Existing Colusa General Plan

The adopted City of Colusa General Plan is currently used as the "blueprint" to guide future development within the City limits and in unincorporated portions of the existing Planning Area. The proposed General Plan Update would establish policies and implementing actions associated with visual resources. Specific proposed policies and implementing actions are discussed in the impact analyses below.

4.10.3 IMPACTS AND MITIGATION MEASURES

STANDARDS OF SIGNIFICANCE

Based on Appendix G of the CEQA Guidelines, visual resource impacts are considered to be
significant the following could result from the implementation of the General Plan update:

1. A substantial adverse affect on a scenic vista.

2. Substantial damage to scenic resources, including, but not limited to, trees, rock outcroppings, and historic buildings within a state scenic highway.

3. Substantial degradation of the existing visual character or quality of a site and its surroundings, or introduction of a feature that is out of character that dominates the
view.

4. Creation of a new source of substantial light or glare that would adversely affect day or
nighttime views in the area.

METHODOLOGY

The visual resource analysis is based on field visits of the proposed Planning Area, review of existing City documents, and review of the proposed land use map. For this visual analysis, the visual quality standards of the proposed General Plan Update were used for guidance. This analysis is based on anticipated changes within the proposed Planning Area from implementation of the proposed land use map.

IMPACTS AND MITIGATION MEASURES FOR THE GENERAL PLAN UPDATE

Alteration of Existing Visual Character

Impact 4.10.1 Implementation of the proposed General Plan Update would result in the
alteration of visual resources associated with the urban landscape within the
proposed Planning Area. This is considered a potentially significant impact.
The existing visual character of the City is one with a small town feel including a historic
downtown and riverfront areas adjacent to the Sacramento River, streets lined with abundant mature trees, multiple parks, a variety of historic residential and commercial buildings, and low density residential areas, all surrounded by farmland. The implementation of the proposed General Plan Update would result in alterations to existing landscape characteristics of the City.
Most notably, the existing urban area would expand into areas that are currently undeveloped
or agricultural lands.

State Routes 20 and 45 are the principal corridors through the City of Colusa. While these highways are not designated scenic routes, they serve as entrances from the east and west, as well as Colusa's main street and commercial corridor. Since most travelers pass through the City
on these highways, the General Plan Update considers facilitating well-designed development along this corridor as key to establishing a desirable community image. The General Plan Update would accommodate development and proposes policies that would have a direct
effect on the view corridor along the State routes.

Colusa General Plan City of Colusa
Draft Master Environmental Impact Report July 2007
4.10-4

4.10 VISUAL RESOURCES/LIGHT AND GLARE

The existing visual character within the central city would remain unchanged due to the relatively buildout condition of this area. However, proposed development to the south, east and west of the City would alter the existing visual characteristics of the City from its main entryways. From the west, the view of scattered commercial, industrial and public buildings leading into the residential core of the City would be replaced by more extensive low-density residential, commercial and industrial development, particularly in the area where the proposed Colusa Crossings development is proposed. The north entryway would see a mostly rural area leading to the mixed commercial/residential portion of the City become more low-density and very-low density residential. To the southeast, the existing commercial and office development would expand, and some very low-density residential development would be inciuded.
Moreover, the character of the proposed new development would be different from that existing in the older portions of the City. The development style would be more similar to the newer residential development in the southern portion of the proposed Planning Area. Also, the
streets would be less likely to maintain the grid pattern found within the City limits. The grid pattern has been identified as a key component in maintaining the "small town" character favored by Colusa residents. More current development also tends to favor wider streets and roadways, which discourage pedestrian travel and orient neighborhoods more to automobiles.
This, in turn, may discourage pedestrian-scale development of neighborhoods that is often
associated with the older, more historic residential areas.

Proposed General Plan Policies and Implementing Actions that Mitigate Potential Impacts
The proposed General Plan Update contains numerous policies and implementing actions related to the City landscape, particularly in the Community Character and Design Element. The policies and implementing actions listed below specifically address the issues discussed in the preceding impact analysis. Other policies in the General Plan update address various aspects of urban landscape design. For other proposed General Plan policies related to city design, refer to Section 4.3, Transportation and Circulation, and Section 4.9, Cultural Resources.

Community Character and Design Element

Policy CCD-1.1 New development and rehabilitation of existing development shall comply with a Design Review process that supports preservation and
enhancement of Colusa's community character and promotes economic
vitality within the Planning Area.

Implementing Action CCD-1.1.a: Design Review Process

The City shall adopt a Design Review process that considers a wide range of design issues. These include such issues as open space and natural features, pedestrian and traffic circulation, building scale and massing, architectural history and details, signs and advertising features,
landscaping, site lighting, and utility connections. The Design Review process will provide the
public with an opportunity to review and comment on all development projects requiring a
permit before the Design Review Board makes a final decision on the project.

Implementing Action CCD-1.1.b: Design Guidelines
The City shall adopt Community Design Guidelines in which preservation and enhancement of the City's existing character shall be the overriding design principle. These Guidelines, to be used in conjunction with the City's zoning ordinance, shall include specific design criteria for each of the following development types:

4.10 VISUAL RESOURCES/LIGHT AND GLARE

• Community Design Criteria: General criteria and overriding design principles to enhance and preserve Colusa's unique character. Defines basic principles of high-quality urban design, environmental sustainability, architecture, and landscape architecture. Considerations include, but are not limited to, human-scaled development, pedestrian- oriented design, interconnectivity of street layout, siting of corner buildings, entryways, focal points, and landmarks.

Highway 20 and 20/45 Corridor Design Criteria: Design criteria to include, but not be limited to, setback provisions, parking requirements, walkways, bikeways, landscaping, lighting, architecture, signage, landmarks/focal points, and other design criteria as
determined appropriate.

Streets and Blocks Design Criteria: Design criteria to emphasize safety and minimum intrusion into neighborhoods. Visual quality to include attractive streetscape design, providing interest within the public right-of-way. Traffic calming measures, bicycle paths/on-street lanes, sidewalk design and greenways, as well as criteria for infrastructure siting and installation and utility undergrounding to be included.
New Single-Family Residential Design Criteria: Criteria to consider relationship to the streets and neighborhood through building orientation and site layout. They may include, but not be limited to, varied setbacks, a range of architectural designs, reor alley-loaded and detached street-loaded garages, and fencing requirements.
Ancillary or Second Unit Design Criteria: Criteria to address maximum unit size, compatibility with primary residence, flexibility in setbacks and design, exterior building materiais, entrance and parking access points.
Multifamity Unit Design Criteria: Criteria to emphasize well-designed and visually attractive multifamily residential structures to provide high-quality housing close to employment centers and transportation routes. A variety of massing options,
architectural and building materials will be recommended. Site planning hardscape and landscaping elements, coupled with open space amenities, will be geared toward creating an inviting atmosphere and an asset to the larger community.
Non-residential Building Siting, Orientation, and Access Design Criteria: Criteria to
generally address commercial, office, light industrial, and public facility land uses.
Parking and circulation, landscaping, architecture, screening of mechanical equipment, lighting and signage (applied using separate criteria described below).
Lighting and Signage Design Criteria: Criteria to guide the types and placement of signs and sign structures so as to not detract from the architectural character and scale of their surroundings. Factors to be considered are height, size, scale, illumination characteristics, enhancements, and integration into project landscaping or streetscape.
Historic Downtown and Riverfront District Design Criteria: Criteria to incorporate design provisions that encourage and facilitate the preservation and restoration of Colusa's historic residences, buildings and iandmarks. To include a set of historic preservation
principles. These principles will be used to provide guidance for the preservation of
architectural features, use of historic building materials, adaptive reuse of historic
structures, and recommendations for new additions, site features, signage and public
improvements.

4.10 VISUAL RESOURCES/LIGHT AND GLARE

Rehabilitation, Reconstruction, and Renovation Design Criteria: Criteria will establish minimum acceptable standards for quality rehabilitation of historic buildings and other residential and non-residential structures. They will focus on site development relating to open space and street facades, building design and materials, and pedestrian and vehicie access.

Policy CCD-5.1 Residential and commercial development in the Riverfront District will provide outdoor spaces that maximize views of, and access to, the
Sacramento River and Riverfront Park.

Policy CCD-7.2 The City shall encourage development of attractive community entry
features at key entry points along Highway 20 and 20/45.

Policy CCD-7.3 The intersections of Market Street and 13th and Market and Bridge Streets shall be given special attention in their design as gateways to the Downtown, as illustrated in Figure 3.2, General Plan Downtown & Riverfront
Design Concepts [of the Community Character and Design Element].

Policy CCD-10.3 The City shall require high quality architecture that preserves the historic integrity within the historic Downtown. "Franchise architecture" that detracts from the unique and distinctive setting of the downtown shall be
discouraged.

Policy CCD-11.4 Architectural design of new residential development, including large additions, shall complement the scale and character of surrounding neighborhoods.

Policy CCD-12.2 Multifamily units shall be designed as an integral part of residential neighborhoods and mixed-use districts.

Policy CCD-12.3 Multifamily housing design shall complement the scale and character of the surrounding neighborhood.

Policy CCD-13.1 The City shall ensure reconstruction of existing residential structures is to a height, massing, scale and architectural style that reflects or enhances the surrounding neighborhood.

Policy CCD-14.2 Where non-residential buildings are sited close to a residential area, the City shall ensure that their scale and character complement the
surrounding neighborhood.

Policy CCD-17.1 Rehabilitation projects shall ensure that new additions to existing non- residential structures are constructed to a height, massing, scale and architectural style consistent with adjacent buildings.
The above policies in the proposed Community Character and Design Element and Parks, Recreation and Resource Conservation Element are intended to maintain and enhance the
overall existing visual character of the City, and to avoid the installation of structures or features
that contrast with the character of the surrounding area. Implementing Actions CCD-1.1.a and CCD-1.1b provide the two principal mechanisms for implementing these policies: a design review process that allows the City to impose requirements on projects that are consistent with the policies, and design guidelines that specify design requirements for projects.

City of Colusa Colusa General Plan
July 2007 Draft Master Environmental Impact Report
4.10-7

4.10 VISUAL RESOURCES/LIGHT AND GLARE

Policies CCD-7.2 and CCD-7.3 more explicitly address the State Route corridors, primarily emphasizing highway improvements and encouraging attractive entry points to the City. Policy PRC-12.1 would require new development in areas such as the SR 20 corridor to incorporate design, construction and maintenance techniques that maintain and enhance visual quality. Implementing Action PRC-12.1.a would allow the City to impose mitigation measures or conditions of approval on development projects that may affect the scenic quality of the SR 20 corridor, while Implementing Action PRC-12.1.b would require coordination with appropriate
agencies to ensure consistency in design and construction.

Implementation of the proposed General Plan policies and implementing actions that address community design would ensure that features associated with the older residential and commercial areas are maintained with some consistency with the newer development. These features are designed to maintain the pedestrian-level scale and "small town" character that
most residents favor. Impacts after implementation of these policies would be less than
significant.

Additional Mitigation Measures

None required.

Downtown and Riverfront Districts

Impact 4.10.2 Implementation of the proposed General Plan Update may result in changes
in the visual character of the Downtown and Riverfront districts. This is
considered a less than significant impact.
The General Plan Update focuses attention on the Downtown and the Riverfront districts. The residential structures in the downtown and Rivertront and historic neighborhoods generally are intact and relatively unchanged from the time of construction. Most structures still exhibit most, if not all, of the original architectural elements and details that make them unique. The historic
character of these structures and neighborhoods should be preserved and enhanced. The
General Plan update suggests that blanket or prescriptive zoning regulations that are not compatible with the density or design characteristics of these neighborhoods should be replaced with a historic district that provides appropriate land use and design policies and criteria. Application of these policies and criteria could alter the character of Downtown and the Riverfront district to an extent and may improve the aesthetics of the area.

Parks, Recreation and Resource Conservation Element

Policy PRC-12.1 The City should require new development in scenic areas (e.g., river banks, Highway 20 corridor, and Sacramento River waterfront) to use
planning design, construction and maintenance techniques that:

incorporate design and screening measures to minimize the visibility of structures and graded areas.
Maximize views in sensitive viewing areas and corridors.

Maintain the character and visual quality of the area.

Implementing Action PRC-12.1.a: Development Review

Through the development review process, the City will use the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) process to evaluate the impacts of proposed new development on natural resources. The CEQA process specifies that the City will refer any development proposal with a
potential for direct or indirect impacts on open space and sensitive local resources to the City Planner, City Engineer, and other local agencies, as applicable, for review and comment.

Implementing Action PRC-12.1.b: interagency Coordination

The City, in cooperation with relevant agencies, should enhance the Sacramento River and its
Riverfront as a scenic resource consistent with water-oriented recreation.

Policy PRC-12.3 The City should enhance the Sacramento River and its waterfront as a
scenic resource consistent with water-oriented recreation.

Implementing Action PRC-12.3.b: Riverfront Pian
The City will work with developers to undertake a major planning effort for the Riverfront District as delineated on the Land Use Map. A primary objective of the Riverfront Pian will be to preserve and enhance views of the Sacramento River. A more detailed description of the Riverfront Plan is provided in Chapter 2 Land Use, Implementing Action LU-6.1.a.
The above policies in the proposed Community Character and Design Element and Parks, Recreation and Resource Conservation Element are intended to maintain and enhance the

overall existing visual character of the Downtown and Riverfront districts. As discussed in Impact 4.10.1, Implementing Actions CCD-1.1.a and CCD-l.lb provide a design review process and design guidelines. These actions would implement the specified policies.
Policies PRC-12.1 and PRC-12.3 would enhance the visual quality of the Sacramento River waterfront, which is part of the Riverfront District, by requiring new development in areas such as the SR 20 corridor to incorporate design, construction and maintenance techniques that maintain and enhance visual quality. Implementing Actions PRC-12.1.a would allow the City to impose mitigation measures or conditions of approval on development projects that may affect the scenic quality of the waterfront. The Riverfront Plan specified by Implementing Action PRC-
12.3.b would provide guidelines for development activities in this area. Implementing Action PRC-12.1.b would require coordination with other agencies having jurisdiction over the waterfront to ensure a consistent application of policies and standards for waterfront development.

The proposed General Plan policies and implementing actions listed above intend to enhance and improve the existing visual characteristics of the Downtown and Riverfront areas. Their implementation would improve the visual appearance of these areas while preserving their
unique architectural and historic character. Impacts after implementation would be less than
significant.

Additional Mitigation Measures

None required.

Scenic Vistas

Impact 4.10.3 Implementation of the proposed General Plan Update may result in the obstruction of scenic vistas at the existing edges of urban development. This is considered a potentially significant impact.
Development as proposed by the General Plan Update may obstruct scenic vistas from existing development, primarily at the current edges of urban development. On the eastern edge, proposed development east of State Route 20/45 could obstruct views of the Sutter Buttes. Most of this proposed development would be residential in character, of either low or medium density. Residential development is subject to restrictions on the height of structures, as set forth in the appropriate provisions of the City's Zoning Ordinance. For residential development of all densities, the maximum allowed height is 35 feet. Some commercial and professional office development is also proposed in the eastern part of the proposed Planning Area. These types of development are also subject to height restrictions, with a maximum allowed height of 35 feet, although the C-H and C-N commercial zones have a maximum height of 30 feet. However, even with the height restrictions and the proximity of the Sutter Buttes, views of the buttes would be partially obstructed by future development under the General Plan Update.
The western edge of the proposed Planning Area has relatively unobstructed views of the Coast Ranges. Future development under the proposed General Plan Update could obstruct these views. As in the eastern portion, most of the proposed future development is low- to very-low density residential development. Residences would be subject to the height restrictions described above. In addition, the very low-density development would mean fewer residences Special Planning Area is designated for a mix of low- and medium density residential, commercial and office uses. However, all of these uses would be subject to the height restrictions described above, and most adjacent land uses to the proposed project site are non-

Parks, Recreation and Resource Conservation Element

Policy PRC-12.2 The City should ensure that significant scenic viewsheds, such as views of Sutter Buttes, the Sacramento River, and the Coastal Range, are protected to the greatest extent feasible.
Implementing Action PRC-12.2.a: Community Design Criteria
As prescribed in Chapter 3, Community Character and Design Element, the City will develop and implement specific criteria, consisting of design guidelines and development standards, to maximize protection of the City's scenic viewsheds.
Implementing Action PRC-12.2.b: Environmental/Visual Constraints Map
The City will require with each development proposal an environmental/visual constraints map,
based on the findings of a project-specific site assessment that identifies significant viewsheds for the Sacramento River, Sutter Buttes and Coastal Range that could be potentially impacted by the project.

As discussed in Impact 4.10.1, Implementing Actions CCD-1.1.a and CCD-1.1b would provide a
design review process and design guidelines. These actions would implement Policy CCD-1.1, which would make preservation of the City's community character a policy. Policies CCD-2.3 and PRC-12.2 explicitly call for protection of scenic viewsheds to the extent feasible, Implementing Action CCD-2.3.g would allow the City to require a visual impact analysis if a project could affect scenic viewsheds. This would enable the City to impose appropriate mitigation measures or conditions of approval that would protect scenic vistas if feasible. Implementing Action PRC-12.3 requires actions designed to assist the City in devising measures to protect scenic views of the Sacramento River, the Sutter Buttes and the Coastal Range from adverse project impacts. Implementation of the General Plan policies and implementing actions

would further reduce potential impacts on scenic vistas in the area. However, it is likely that obstruction of scenic views would still occur. Therefore, impacts after implementation would remain significant and unavoidable.

Additional Mitigation Measures

Policies and implementing actions would protect scenic vistas to the extent feasible. However, the only way to avoid or reduce this impact to a less than significant impact would be to prohibit development that would affect views of scenic resources. This would be inconsistent with the objectives of the proposed General Plan Update and the proposed land use map. No feasible mitigation measures can be applied.

Daytime Glare

Impact 4.10.4 Implementation of the proposed General Plan Update could result in the introduction of a substantial amount of daytime glare sources to the area. This is considered a less than significant impact.
The main sources of daytime glare are generally sunlight reflecting from structures and other reflective surfaces and windows. Implementation of the proposed General Plan Update would infroduce new sources of daytime glare into the City and increase the amount of daytime glare in existing developed areas. Proposed land uses in the updated General Plan consist of various densities of commercial, office, recreation and other public uses. Such uses may utilize materials that produce glare. Daytime glare impacts would be most significant in areas adjacent to new development and to motorists traveling on roadways adjacent to new development.

While the implementing actions may not specifically address daytime glare, these mechanisms would be employed as part of the overall development review process of the City and will allow the City to require the reduction or elimination of a potential glare source. Implementation of the proposed General Plan policies and implementing actions would reduce or eliminate daytime glare generated by new
development. Impacts would be less than significant.

Nighttime Lighting

Impact 4.10.5 implementation of the proposed General Plan Update may increase the amount of nighttime lighting in developed portions of the proposed Planning Area, and would create new sources in undeveloped areas. Increased nighttime lighting could have an adverse affect on adjacent areas and land uses. This is considered a less than significant impact.
Many of the streets within the Colusa City limits have street lighting installed. These lights provide visibility for motorists, bicyclists and pedestrians. They also provide security by making areas more visible at night, for both residents and police officers. Lighting is also provided throughout the proposed Planning Area at commercial centers, industrial sites, government offices and institutional buildings. Many of these lights are installed in parking lots. At school sites, lights are turned on for athletic events, graduations or other special programs.
Planned development and growth accommodated by the proposed General Plan Update would introduce new light sources into undeveloped portions of the City. New light sources would include, but not be limited to, new residential developments, street lighting, parking lot lights, and security related lighting for non-residential uses. Nighttime lighting levels would increase substantially over current levels in undeveloped portions of the City, and incrementally with future projects in developed areas. These new light sources could result in the indirect illumination (or "light spillover") into adjacent properties. Indirect illumination of adjacent residential properties would be an adverse impact, as the additional lighting would disturb residents. Another adverse impact, resulting from increased development, would be "sky glow" conditions that reduce visibility of the nighttime sky,

4.11.1 FIRE PROTECTION AND EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES

4.11.1.1 EXISTING SETTING

Fires can be significant hazards in developed areas. Even well-constructed buildings may suffer damage from fires started accidentally or intentionally. in addition, structures located adjacent to fields and wildlands may be vulnerable to fires started on such lands. In addition to property damage, fires pose a threat to human life.

The City of Colusa, surrounded by agricultural fields, is in an area of low potential for wildfires. Cultivated and irrigated fields have a low incidence of fire, unless these fields are burned as part of agricultural operations. Such burning would pose a threat only to City structures adjacent to these fields. However, in recent years the State of California has sought to discourage burning of agricultural fields, particularly rice fields that are widespread in
Colusa County.

The riparian area adjacent to the Sacramento River is a potential source of wildland fires, started by either natural or human causes. This
hazard would be greatest during the summer and early autumn. Lack of rain lowers river levels,
and low humidity and high temperatures cause some vegetation to lose moisture. Given its proximity to the Sacramento River, the riparian area is unlikely to go completely dry, except during times of severe drought. Most of the riparian area is separated from the City by the levee in the downtown area. However, it is possible that fires in the riparian area would jump over the levee and threaten adjacent buildings.

CITY OF COLUSA FIRE DEPARTMENT

The City of Colusa Fire Department provides firefighting services within the City limits. The Fire Department participates in a countywide mutual aid program with six other fire protection agencies in Colusa County. Fire Department career staff consists of the Fire Chief, Assistant Chief, Fire Captain/Mechanic, and two Fire Apparatus Engineers. The volunteer staff consists of a
Division Chief, four captains, four Driver/Operators, and 17 Firefighters. Of the entire staff, 12 personnel are trained as Emergency Medical Technicians (EMT) and all other personnel are
trained as First Responders. Shift personnel work 24-hour rotating shifts year-round.

4.11 COMMUNITY SERVICES

The Fire Department has one fire station in the City of Colusa located al 750 Market Street.
Firefighting equipment consists of four engine pumpers (three with a capacity of more than
1,250 gallons per minute (gpm) and one with a capacity of 1,000 gpm), one ladder truck with
a 1,500-gpm capacity and 500-gallon water tank, and one grass rig with a 300-gpm capacity and 500-gallon tank. One reserve ambulance is housed for emergency back-up
only, and is rarely dispatched.

n 2004, services calls for the Fire Department totaled 450. Of these, 235 were for emergency medical service. According to the Fire Chief, the Fire Department can provide an average 3-4 minute response time to anywhere within the
current service area. Access problems are slight throughout the City of Colusa, as most of the
City's streets are in a grid pattern that facilitates emergency vehicle movement. Traffic is the
sole issue the Fire Department considers when answering a service call (Randall Dunn, Colusa Fire Department, pers. comm.).
The Fire Department currently has an ISO rating of 3. An Insurance Services Office (ISO) rating is based upon the public protection classification program, a which rates a given city's fire service for water supply, equipment, personnel, alarm and dispatch, and training. An ISO rating is a prime factor in determining fire insurance rates within a community. The rating is on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 representing the best level of fire protection.

The Colusa County Sheriff's Office, along with the City of Colusa Fire Department, is the primary responder to any hazardous materials incidents, based on the City's Hazardous Materials Management Plan. The Plan identifies the specific locations of flammable or toxic materials are used and stored, allowing appropriate response to a hazardous material emergency.
SACRAMENTO RIVER FIRE PROTECTION DISTRICT

The Sacramento River Fire Protection District provides fire protection services in the area outside the Colusa city limits. This agency was formed in 1997 as the result of a merger of the Colusa Rural Fire District and the Grand Island Fire District. The Sacramento River Fire Protection District provides services to the land along the Sacramento River from the southern boundary of Colusa County almost to the northern boundary. The Fire District includes land around the City of
Colusa and the community of Grimes. also provides service to the Cachil Dehe Wintun
Reservation and the Colusa National Wildlife Refuge. Along with the other fire departments in the County, the Fire District participates in a mutual aid program. The mutual aid system provides aid on an automatic response basis to specified hazard or life hazard areas.
The District has one paid fire fighter, the Fire Chief, and 43 volunteers. Dispatch services are
handled by the Colusa County Sheriff Department. The Fire District has two stations: one in Colusa at 235 Market Street, and the Grand Island Station in the community of Grimes.
Firefighting equipment consists of four engine a pumpers: two with a capacity of 1,250 gallons per
minute (gpm), one with a capacity of 750 gpm, and one with a capacity of 250 gpm. The Fire
District also has two water tenders, one with a capacity of 750 gpm, and the other with a capacity of 250 gpm. It also consists of one air/light unit, light rescue, and staff vehicle. In the 2004-2005 fiscal year, service calls for the Fire District totaled 356. Of these, 183 were for

emergency medical service. Approximately 26 percent of all calls were for fire purposes. The District has an ISO rating of 5 in areas with fire hydrants and 9 in other areas.
EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES

The Colusa Fire Department, through an agreement with Colusa County Emergency Medical Services (EMS}, assumes the first response to all medical emergency calls in the City. Shift personnel on the initial response apparatus are certified as Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs). The Colusa Fire Department currently has twelve first responder EMTs on staff, along with nine EMS personnel who are cross-trained. The Sacramento River Fire Protection District has 26 EMS personnel and 17 EMT personnel. As previously noted, the Fire Department received 235 calls for emergency medical service in 2006, while the Fire District received 183 calls in the 2004- 2005 fiscal year. Enloe Hospital, based in Chico, provides ambulance service.

4.11.1.2 REGULATORY FRAMEWORK

STATE

Office of Emergency Services

The Governor's Office of Emergency Services (OES) coordinates overall state agency response to major disasters in support of local government. The office is responsible for assuring the state's readiness to respond to and recover from natural, manmade, and war-caused emergencies, and for assisting local governments in their emergency preparedness, response and recovery efforts. OES is the "grantee" for federal disaster assistance, principally from the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). During the recovery phase of disaster, OES helps local governments assess damages and assists them with federal and state grant and loan applications to repair damaged public property.

The Colusa Office of Emergency Services is located within the Colusa Fire Department, and handles all major emergencies within the city limits. Such emergencies include major fire, flood, earthquake, major hazardous materials incidents and acts of terrorism. The Fire Chief also serves
as the Director of Emergency Services for the City of Colusa. The Director works in conjunction with the Mayor, City Manager and City Council, as well as other local, state and federal agencies to mitigate emergencies. The City utilizes an Emergency Operations Pian that is updated regularly to maintain current standards.

Certified Unified Program Agency
In 1993, California legislators passed SB 1082, creating the Certified Unified Program Agency [CUPA) system in order to simplify the process of regulating and managing hazardous materials and hazardous wastes. Rather than having numerous state and local agencies regulating a single business, SB 1082 consolidates the enforcement of several different environmental
regulations under the administration of one local agency called a CUPA.

The CUPA is implemented at the local level by 85 government agencies certified by the Secretary of the California Environmental Protection Agency (Cal EPA). These CUPAS have typically been established as a function of a local environmental health or fire department. Some CUPAs also have contractual agreements with one or more other local agencies, which implement one or more program elements under the oversight of the CUPA. In Colusa County, the CUPA for the area is the Colusa County Department of Environmental Health.

LOCAL

Existing Colusa General Plan
The adopted City of Colusa General Plan currently is used as the "blueprint" to guide future development within the City limits and in unincorporated portions of the existing Planning Area. The proposed General Plan Update would establish policies and implementing actions associated with fire protection and emergency medical services. Specific proposed policies and implementing actions are discussed in the impact analyses below.

Colusa County General Plan

The Colusa County General Plan contains policies in its Public Health and Safety Element regarding fire protection. The following County General Plan policies are applicable to the unincorporated portions of the proposed Planning Area.

Fire-1. When an unincorporated area is annexed to a city, fire protection policies should be transferred from the rural service district to the city fire department.
City Emergency Response/Evacuation Plans
The City of Colusa is responsible for emergency response and evacuation plans within the City limits. The State of California passed legislation authorizing the Office of Emergency Services (OES) to prepare a Standard Emergency Management System (SEMS) program, which sets forth measures by which a jurisdiction should handle emergency situations and respond to a disaster
or hazardous materials release. Non-compliance with SEMS could result in the State withholding disaster relief from the non-complying jurisdiction in the event of an emergency disaster. The City has prepared a Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan, which defines the primary and support roles of City agencies and departments in after-incident damage assessment and reporting requirements. In addition, the plan provides for the operation of police, fire and health services, as well as transportation alternatives in the event of a multi-hazard
emergency.

4.11.1.3 IMPACTS AND MITIGATION MEASURES

STANDARDS OF SIGNIFICANCE

Based on Appendix G of the CEQA Guidelines, fire protection service impacts are considered to be significant if the following could result from the implementation of the General Plan update:
1. Substantial adverse physical impacts associated with the provision of new or physically altered governmental facilities, need for new or physically altered governmental facilities, the construction of which could cause significant environmental impacts, in order to maintain acceptable service ratios, response times or other performance objectives for fire protection.

2. Expose people or structures to significant risk of loss, injury, or death involving wildland fires, including where wildlands are adjacent to urbanized areas or where residences are
intermixed with wildlands.

METHODOLOGY

The primary sources of information for fire protection services in the Colusa area were the Colusa Fire Department and the Sacramento River Fire Protection District, primarily from personal communications. Other information came from research of public documents, including the LAFCo 2005 Draft Municipal Services Review and website information.

IMPACTS AND MITIGATION MEASURES FOR THE GENERAL PLAN UPDATE

Fire Protection and Emergency Medical Services

Impact 4.11.1.1 Implementation of the proposed General Plan would increase the demand
for fire protection and emergency medical services. This is considered a
potentially signiticant impact.

Development of the City of Colusa under the proposed General Plan would result in an increase of population, an expansion of the City limits and sphere of influence, and an increased amount of commercial and professional offices. Additionally, the City is surrounded by agricultural uses, in which burning of rice fields was a common practice. However, the State of California has
sought to discourage burning of rice fields. The City of Colusa Fire Chief has expressed concern that this could lead to a greater potential for vegetation fires, as fields are not maintained (Randall Dunn, Colusa Fire Department, pers. comm.). This could become more of a concern as the City annexes agricuitural fields that may not be developed immediately. Fires originating in these fields could threaten adjacent existing buildings. All of these occurrences would increase the need for fire protection and emergency medical services.

Expansion of the City limits would increase response times to locations farther from the existing fire station, reducing the effectiveness of the Fire Department's ability to provide services. Additionally, proposed General Plan buildout would result in an additional 5,278,775 square feet of commercial and industrial space and a total of 9,087 residential units, which correspond to a projected population of approximately 25,811. The City of Colusa Fire Department received 430 total calls for service in 2004 from a population of approximately 5,689. Assuming the same proportion between calls for service and population, the Fire Department would receive 1,951 calls for service at buildout of the General Plan. At its present staffing levels, the Fire Department could not provide services to potential growth allowed under the proposed General Plan.
The Fire Department seeks to maintain a ratio of firemen per resident of approximately 1 per 1,000. The Department also recognizes that the addition of three firemen generates a demand for a new pumper. Based on the potential growth and preferred ratios, a population of 25,811 would require approximately 26 firemen and 12 vehicles. The additional firemen, fire engines, and associated equipment needed to respond to calls generated by buildout under the General Plan would create the demand for a new fire facility. The new facility would be essential in maintaining acceptable response times and ISO ratings. In addition, there would likely be environmental impacts associated with the construction of a new fire facility. The exact impacts cannot be determined at this time, as no site for a new facility has been designated.
However, the impacts would likely be similar to those associated with new development under
the proposed General Plan, such as impacts associated with construction activities including air quality, drainage, and noise as described in the relevant sections of this EIR. This MEIR addresses
the potential impacts of new development and identifies mitigation measures where
appropriate.

4.11 COMMUNITY SERVICES

According to the Fire Chief for the Sacramento River Fire Protection District, the fire station at 235 Market Street is considered in "fair" condition, and the Grand Island Station is in "poor" condition (Walters, pers. comm.). The District would like to hire two additional paid fire fighters to reduce the response time. Flooding and road damage may cause access problems due to few County roads within the District and flooding hazards. The District believes that additional revenue and additional staff could improve the ISO ratings to 4 in areas with hydrants and 8 in other areas.
However, with implementation of the proposed General Plan, more land would be annexed to
the City, and service to these lands would be provided by the Colusa Fire Department. Service demands from these lands upon the Sacramento River Fire Protection District would be reduced. Therefore, implementation of the proposed General Plan Update is not anticipated to increase the service demands for the Sacramento River Fire Protection District nor would it require new or expanded Sacramento River Fire Protection District facilities.
The number of calls for emergency medical services also would increase under General Plan development. The 2004 population generated 235 calls for medical services. Assuming the same proportion between calls and population, a population of 25,811 would generate 1,066 calls. Despite the increase in population and expected calls for service, ENLOE Medical assesses impacts to paramedic services based solely upon response times. A potentially significant impact would occur should response time to 10 percent of the calls exceed 8 minutes. When
this threshold is reached, ENLOE Medical would need to supply additional ambulance services
to the City of Colusa.

Proposed General Plan Policies and Implementing Actions that Mitigate Potential Impacts

Safety Element

Policy SAF-3.4 The City shall maintain adequate fire protection services for its residents and businesses.

Implementing Action SAF-3.4.a: Interagency Coordination
The City will continue to participate in its mutual aid agreements with other fire protection agencies. With the support of the City, the Department will strive to maintain its ISO rating of 3.
Implementing Action SAF-3.4.b: City Budget and Rate Review

During its annual budget review, the City will consider the needs of the Colusa Fire Department
and will support those needs with budget revenues, grants, and impact fees. As part of the
budget review process, the City will review impact fee rates to ensure they adequately reflect a fair share of funding by development and other Fire Department service recipients.

Municipal Facilities and Services Element

Policy MFS-1.1 The City shall ensure that new development does not exceed the capacity of the City to provide adequate municipal facilities and does disproportionately impact the capacity of existing service levels. New growth shall pay its fair-share cost of facilities and services without
creating an additional burden to existing residents.

Colusa General Plan City of Colusa
Draft Master Environmental Impact Report July 2007

4.11 COMMUNITY SERVICES

Implementing Action MFS-1.la: Capitai Improvement Program
The City of Colusa will establish a apital Improvement Program (CIP), which will guide the
development of municipal facilities and infrastructure improvements over a five-year period. The program, which is to be updated on an annual or biannual basis, schedules by fiscal year
the proposed capital construction phases and related expenditure and financing needs expected to occur during the five-year period. The Program will identify priorities, funding sources, and timing for design, construction, and operation, to be developed in conjunction with the City's budget.

Implementing Action MFS-1.1.b: Development impact Fees
The City will update its Development Impact Fee Program. As new development occurs, project will be charged their fair-share of development impact fees to offset the cost of needed improvements to the City's municipal facilities. The City will review and update the development impact fee schedule on an annual basis.

Implementing Action MFS-1.1.c: Assembly Bill (ABJ 1600 Analysis
In accordance with Government Code Section 66000 et seq., as amended, the City will conduct a thorough analysis of the City's development impact fee structure (commonly referred to as the AB 1600 Analysis) to ensure that fees are (1) adequate to fund capitai projects and facilities, (2) based on expansion or provision of new facilities required by growth, and (3) meet all requirements of State law. The AB 1600 analysis will be initiated at the same time as the first Capital Improvement Program, and fees will be adjusted annually to keep up with inflation and construction costs. The applicant will be responsible for the cost of this analysis. The City may require a particular project to fund the master study, with reimbursement to be made for areas not affected by the particular project through credits against developer fees when building permits are issued. Until the AB 1600 citywide master analysis is completed, the share of facilities costs and impacts on the community should be determined on a project-by-project
basis.

Policy MFS-3.1 The City shall maintain its own fire protection services for City residents and businesses through the provision of adequate facilities and equipment.
Implementing Action MFS-3.1.a: Monitor Facilities and Equipment Needs
The City will review the Fire Department's facilities needs annually, concurrent with the City budget process, to address facility deficiencies and maintenance issues. The City will also review the Department's equipment needs to ensure the Department maintains up-to-date safety equipment, tools, and vehicles that will enable the Department to continue to provide excellent emergency services to the Community. Additionally, the City will consult with the Fire Chief when development applications are received to determine the degree of impacts on the
Department, and to establish appropriate mitigation measures.

Policy MFS-3.3 The City shall require that the construction and staffing of fire station facilities be scheduled such that they are ready to serve new development as it occurs.

Implementing Action MFS-3.3.b: Specific Plans
The City will ensure that proposed specific pians and planned unit developments (PUDs) will specify anticipated need, if any, for additional fire facilities based on land use designations in

4.11 COMMUNITY SERVICES

the plan area. The specific plan should include the location and size of fire facilities, a fire facility phasing plan, and source(s) of funding to be available at the time of development.
Implementing Action MFS-4.3.c: Development Review

Where necessary, the City will require, as a condition of project approval, the dedication of land and facilities or payment of appropriate fees and exactions to help offset municipal costs for fire protection facilities and services. As growth occurs, this measure will help to ensure the continued provision of adequate fire services and facilities. The City will evaluate its development impact fees related to fire protection services and implement any changes necessary to adequately fund needed facilities.
The proposed Safety Element policies and implementing actions seek to maintain adequate levels of fire protection service, primari through the budgeting process and mutual aid agreements with other agencies. Policy MFS-1.1 in the proposed Municipal Facilities and Services Element, along with its associated implementing actions, address the provision of public services in general, while Policies MFS-3.1 and MFS-3.3 more specifically address fire protection services. As described in the implementing actions, support for increased services would come from development impact fees, conditions placed on project approvals such as fees or land dedications, funding provided for the Capital Improvements Program, and specification of fire protection facilities and their funding in specific plans. Implementing Action MFS-3.1.a would require the City to monitor fire protection service and facility needs, and to address identified deficiencies. Implementing Action MFS-1.1.b and MFS-1.1.c would require the City to conduct an analysis of the adequacy of its development impact fees to provide funds for tire protection
services, and to adjust these fees if necessary. Implementation of the above General Plan policies and implementing actions would ensure adequate fire protection services and facilities for City residents and properties. Impacts after implementation would be less than signiticant.
Additional Mitigation Measures

None required.

Wildland Fire

Impact 4.11.1.2 Implementation of the proposed General Plan could result in safety hazards associated with wildland fires in residential areas adjacent to open space and natural areas. This is considered a potentially signiticant impact.
As described previously, the City of Colusa is surrounded by agricultural fields, which is in an area
of low potential for wildfires. However, portions of the Colusa Planning Area are located adjacent to Sacramento River. This area includes riparian areas which are a potential source of wildland fires, started by either natural or human causes. This hazard would be greatest during
the summer and early autumn. Lack of rain lowers river levels, and low humidity and high temperatures cause some vegetation to lose moisture. Given its proximity to the Sacramento River, the riparian area is unlikely to go completely dry, except during times of severe drought. Most of the riparian area is separated from the City by the levee in the downtown area. However, it is possible that fires in the riparian area would jump over the levee and threaten adjacent buildings.

sergeants and five officers. There is one personnel position consisting of a non-sworn secretary. The Police Department currently utilizes seven vehicles to patrol the City and respond to calls for
service.

Patrol shifts for the Police Department consist of one officer during the 7:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. shift, one officer during the 5:00 p.m. to 3:00 a.m. shift, and one officer during the 9:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. shift. A fourth supplemental shift serves at the department's discretion for days or nights, depending on immediate needs. Due to the relatively small size of the City of Colusa, response times are minimal, typically averaging to 2 minutes per call.

COLUSA COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT

The Colusa County Sheriff's Department provides police protection services to the unincorporated areas of Colusa County, including those areas outside the Colusa city limits. The
Sheriff's Department is located on and operates a single dispatch facility at 929 Bridge Street in the City of Colusa. The Sheriff's Department currently employs 60 staff, of which thirty positions are divided between correctional staff, animal control staff, the Office of Emergency Services,
administration and support staff. The thirty additional employees are sworn officers that
maintain a person per officer ratio of approximately 660 to 1.

The Colusa County Jail, located at 929 Bridge Street in the City of Colusa, houses both County
and City of Colusa inmates. The facility has the ability to hold State and federally incarcerated inmates. The jail has a 96-person capacity.

Based on Appendix G of the CEQA Guidelines, police protection service impacts are considered
to be significant if the following could result from the implementation of the proposed General
Plan Update:

City of Colusa Colusa General Plan
July 2007 Draft Master Environmental Impact Report
4.11-11

4.11 COMMUNITY SERVICES

1. Substantial adverse physical impacts associated with the provision of new or physically altered governmental facilities, need for new or physically altered governmental facilities, the construction of which could cause significant environmental impacts, in order to maintain acceptable service ratios, response times or other performance objectives for police protection.

METHODOLOGY

The primary source of information for police protection services in the Colusa area was the LAFCo 2005 Draft Municipal Services Review (MSR) for the City of Colusa. The MSR describes existing services, identifies potential needs, and discusses opportunities for more efficient provision of services. Other information came from research of other public documents and discussions with appropriate agencies.

IMPACTS AND MITIGATION MEASURES FOR THE GENERAL PLAN UPDATE

Police Protection

Impact 4.11.2.1 The General Plan Update would increase the demand for police protection services, which would require additional staff and facilities. This is considered is
a potentially significant impact.
Development of the City of Colusa under the proposed General Plan would result in an increase in population, an expansion of the City limits and sphere of influence, and an increased amount of commercial and professional offices. All of this development will increase the need for police protection services. In its current condition, the City of Colusa Police Department cannot
provide adequate services at buildout under the General Pian.

The City is approaching buildout within its existing City limits. As noted in the discussion under Impact 4.11.1.1, expansion of the City's sphere of influence and eventual extension of the City limits under the proposed General Plan Update would result in a projected population of approximately 25,811 persons. In 2004, the Police Department received 4,936 calls for service from a population of approximately 5,689. Assuming the same proportion between calls for service and population, the Police Department likely would receive 22,395 calls for service at
General Plan buildout.

The Police Department seeks to maintain an officer per citizen ratio of 2 sworn officers 2 per 1,000 residents. Based on these preferred ratios, the City at General Plan buildout would require 52 officers and 26 patrol vehicles. The additional officers, patrol units, and associated equipment would create the need for a new police facility. The Police Department notes that the existing station no longer has the capacity to house additional staff and equipment under current conditions. In addition, there would likely be environmental impacts associated with the construction of a new police facility. The exact impacts cannot be determined at this time,
since it is not known if a new facility or expansion of the existing facility would occur. If the City chooses the expansion option, impacts would not be as great, as the existing police station is in an area that is already developed. If the City chooses to build a new facility, the impacts would likely be similar to those associated with new development under the proposed General Plan, such as impacts associated with construction activities including air quality, drainage, and noise as described in the relevant sections of this EIR. This MEIR addresses the potential impacts of new development and identifies mitigation measures where appropriate.

Proposed General Plan Policies and Implementing Actions that Mitigate Potential Impacts

Safety Element

Policy SAF-6.1 The City shall strive to provide high-quality police services for City residents and businesses with adequate facilities, modern technology and current training to maximize job performance.
Implementing Action SAF-6.1.a: Law Enforcement Technology and Service Levei Update
The City will continue to emphasize the use of modern technology in providing effective law enforcement for the community and support such technology through the budget process. The City will strive to maintain its stated response time standards, which it is currently meeting, of three to five minutes for ali calls, especially emergencies.
implementing Action SAF-6.1.b: Mutual Aid Agreements
The City will continue to participate in its mutual aid agreements and coordination between the City's police department and other law enforcement agencies.
Implementing Action SAF-6.1.c: City Budget and Rate Review
During its annual budget review, the City will consider the needs of the Colusa Police Department and will support those needs with budget revenues, grants, and impact fees. As
part of the budget review process, the City will review impact fee rates to ensure they adequately reflect a fair share of funding by development.

Policy SAF-6.2 The City shall incorporate police protection considerations into City and community activities.
Implementing Action SAF-6.2.g: Development Review
The City will refer development proposals to the Colusa Police Department for review and comment. The review process will consider the provision of access to lands for emergency services. street access to all structures, and crime prevention programs.

4.11 COMMUNITY SERVICES

Policy MFS-3.2 The City shall ensure that the public safety facilities are designed and constructed adequately to efficiently operate paramedic, fire, and police services in times of disaster.

implementing Action MFS-3.2.a: Audit of Public Safety Facilities

The City will conduct an audit of public safety facilities af least once every two years. The audit will identify any needed or corrective measures to maintain the utility of the facilities in the event of a disaster.

The proposed Safety Element policies and implementing actions seek to maintain adequate levels of police protection service, primarily through the budgeting process and mutual aid agreements with other agencies, and use of up-to-date technology. Policy SAF-6.2 and Implementing Action SAF-6.2.a seek to incorporate within development projects features that improve the effectiveness of police protection, such as improved access.
Policy MFS-1.1 in the proposed Municipal Facilities and Services Element, along with its associated implementing actions, address the provision of public services in general, while Policy MFS-3.2 more specifically address police protection services and facilities. As described in the implementing actions, support for increased services would come from development impact fees, conditions placed on project approvals such as fees or land dedications, funding provided for the Capital Improvements Program. Implementing Action MFS-1.1.c would require the City to conduct an analysis of the adequacy of its development impact fees to provide funds for police protection services, and to adjust these fees if necessary.
Implementation of the proposed General Plan policies and implementing actions would ensure adequate police protection services and facilities for the City. Impacts would be less than significant.

Students in the 9th through 12th grade currently attend Colusa High School. Colusa High School's capacity is approximately 675 students. Currently, Colusa High School has an enrollment of 364 students, and its student-
to-teacher ratio is far less than the State-
mandated 30 students per teacher.

The Colusa Alternative High School has two State emergency portables for its students. Colusa Alternative High School's capacity is 40
students. An application for permanent facilities has been filed with the State Allocation Board. It is uncertain when, or if, the State will fund this project. The District's plan for the facility calls for a three-acre site. Currently, there is no land at the high school to expand this site.

PRIVATE SCHOOLS

Colusa has one private school - Our Lady of Lourdes, a Catholic school. It serves students from kindergarten to 8th grade. Enrollment is approximately 106 students, and the school has the capacity to expand its facilities.

4.11.3.2 REGULATORY FRAMEWORK

STATE

Leroy F. Greene School Facilities Act of 1998 (SB 50)

The Leroy F. Greene School Facilities Act of 1998, also known as Senate Bill (SB) 50, changed
methods of school construction financing in California, in part by regulating a school district's authority to levy impact fees. Prior to SB 50, case law allowed cities to consider and impose conditions to mitigate impacts of new development on school facilities. SB 50 suspended this authority, commonly referred to as Mira authority. Government Code Section 65995, as amended by SB 50, establishes the dollar amount school districts may impose on new development. These amounts were adjusted for inflation in the year 2000, and would be adjusted every two years thereafter. The current fees are $2.24 per square foot for residential development and $0.36 for commercial development. The Colusa Unified School District has historically used these fees to lease portables. It currently uses the fees to construct new
classrooms when the need presents itself.
Under specified circumstances, school districts may impose alternative fees pursuant to Government Code Sections 65995.5 and 65995.7 (Level 2 and/or Level 3 fees, respectively). If State funding expires at any time, school districts may impose up to 100 percent of the State average cost of school facilities on new development (alternative Level 3 fees). However, in 2006, if a State bond measure fails, Mira authority would be partially restored to the extent that a city could deny an application. However, it could not it condition the project to pay fees above those set by the State.
California Government Code Section 65995(e) states that a city does not have the ability to condition any land use approval, whether legislative or adjudicative, on the need for school facilities. In addition, Government Code Section 65995(f) prohibits a city or county from imposing a requirement to participate in a Community Facilities District (CFD), also known as a Mello-Roos district. Govemnment Code Section 65995(g) (1) further states that a developer's refusal to participate in a CFD cannot be a factor in a considering a legislative or adjudicative act. However, Government Code Section 65995(g) (2) says that a person can voluntarily elect to pay a fee through a CFD.
Government Code Section 65995(h) states that the payment or satisfaction of a fee, charge, or other requirement levied or imposed pursuant to provisions of SB 50 and Section 17620 of the
Education Code is deemed to be full and complete mitigation of the impacts of any legislative or adjudicative act related to the provision of adequate school facilities. Section 65996(b) states that, notwithstanding Section 65858, the provisions of CEQA or any other provision of state or local law, a state or local agency may not deny or refuse to approve a legislative or adjudicative act on the basis that school facilities are inadequate. Historically, the City has taken the initiative to require developers to mitigate the impact on schools by conditioning tentative maps.

Update would establish policies and implementing actions associated with schools. Specific proposed policies and implementing actions are discussed in the impact analyses below.

Colusa Unified School District

As previously noted, the Colusa Unified School District manages all public schools in the Colusa area. Governance is by a five-member elected board. A District Superintendent oversees day- to-day operations of the District.

it The District states it currently does not have a Facility Master Plan, but has completed a draft Enrollment Projection 2006-2007 study in February 2006 that examines the enrollment and facilities projections. Upon receipt of these projections, the District will begin a Facility Master Plan. The draft Enrollment Project Study concludes that the District will begin increasing enrollment and reach 2,105 students in ten years. To house the students projected from the new developments, there will be a need for additional schools. A total of 49 classrooms are
projected to be needed. This will likely consist of two elementary schools or one elementary school and one middle school, depending on the future configuration of the current schools.
The needs at the high school level may be addressed by adding to the existing school.
Currently, the District identifies at least two additional schools, either two elementary schools or one elementary school and one middle school for future development. The draft Enrollment Project Study was based several databases of information, including 4 years of past student records, birthrate counts for the past ten years compiled by zip codes, historical building permits, county planning documentation for projected new housing developments, and a computerized street file for the entire county.

4.11.3.3 IMPACTS AND MITIGATION MEASURES

STANDARDS OF SIGNIFICANCE

Based on Appendix G of the CEQA Guidelines, school service impacts are considered to be
significant if the following could result from the implementation of the General Plan update:
1. Result in substantial adverse physical impacts associated with the provision of new or physically altered governmental facilities, need for new or physically altered governmental facilities, the construction of which could cause significant environmental impacts, in order to maintain acceptable performance objectives for schools.

METHODOLOGY

Evaluation of potential public school impacts was based on review of applicable public documents and consultations with Colusa Unified School District staff.

IMPACTS AND MITIGATION MEASURES FOR THE GENERAL PLAN UPDATE

Public School Facilities

Impact 4.11.3.1 Implementation of the proposed General Plan would increase demand for school services provided by the Colusa Unified School District. This is considered a potentially significant impact.
Buildout anticipated under the proposed General Plan Update would result in the addition of
new residents, and a resultant increase in the number of students in the Colusa Unified School

District. Based on the draft Enrollment Projects study, the District predicts that the public school enrollment will increase to reach 3,105 students in ten years.
As previously noted Burchfield Elementary School currently uses eleven portable classrooms and has three lunch schedules to accommodate its enrollment. Future growth in the City of Colusa likely would require expansion of elementary school facilities. The District's draft Enrollment Projection for 2006-2007 projects the need for two additional schools to serve anticipated growth each year as the area starts developing. Within 10 years, it is anticipated that a total of 29 classrooms will be needed, which is the equivalent of a new elementary school.
The District has completed an architectural study that indicates two additional portable classrooms can be placed on the Egling Middle School campus. Should the school receive these two classrooms, an additional portable restroom also must be provided. The draft Enroliment Projection study indicates that no additional classrooms are needed over the next five years, however, in the ten year projection a total of 15 classrooms are needed.
The student population at Colusa High School currently is under facility capacity. However, the high school could experience a rapid increase in enrollment over the next several years, given proposed residential development projects.
The District would attempt to utilize several funding sources to facilitate the construction and maintenance of the additional facilities needed to serve projected growth. Sources include but are not limited to Proposition 47 funds, developer impact fees, and any local general obligation bond funds. The environmental effects of constructing additional school facilities in the City generally have been considered in Sections 5.0 through 5.3 of this EIR, both the Colusa Crossings and Colusa Riverbend projects have included plans for schools to be located within the project area. In addition, provisions of SB 50 state that payment of fees provide full and complete school facilities mitigation.

For example, the City may coordinate with the school district in planning for parks and recreation facilities and other facilities that maximize community use opportunities. This effort will include a joint-use study for all school sites, starting with existing sites and continuing with new sites as they are proposed and developed. The study will establish the feasibility of pursuing joint-use agreements between the Colusa Unified School District and the City. This study will aiso identify opportunities to maximize public use of school facilities and minimize duplication of services.
The above policies and implementing actions in the proposed Municipal Facilities and Services Element would encourage cooperation between the City and the School District in planning for new school facilities and pursuing financing for these facilities. Policy MFS-5.2 and Implementing Action MFS-5.2.a would encourage joint-use facilities that could be utilized by both the School
District and the City at a lower cost than if each agency provided separate facilities. implementation of the above General Plan policies and implementing actions would assist the Colusa Unified School District in providing adequate school facilities for the future student population. Compliance with the requirements of SB 50 is considered adequate mitigation of potential impacts to a less than significant level.

The Recreation Division is responsible for organizing recreational activities that are offered year-
round to City and County residents. Activities include adult sports, youth sports, after school activities, aquatics, and senior citizen programs. While most of these programs take place at Parks and Community Development Department facilities, a few occur at other public and even private facilities.
In addition, City residents have access to three other facilities that provide recreational services. The Colusa County Fairgrounds are located within the City limits on State Highway 20 near the southwestern entrance to the City. The Fairgrounds include exhibition halls, a grandstand, an entertainment building, and other facilities. The Colusa County Fair is held at this site every June, and the Farm Equipment Show is held every February. However, the Fairgrounds are also used year-round for exhibits, weddings, shows, banquets, dances and general entertainment.
The Colusa-Sacramento River State Recreation Area attracts both City residents and out-of-town
visitors. This park, part of the California State Parks system, is located just outside the City limits to
the northwest, along the Sacramento River. This 67-acre facility includes picnic tables, barbeque stoves, a boat launch ramp, campsites, beach areas, and restroom facilities. Various recreational activities take place at the State Recreation Area: hiking, fishing, boating and bicycling.

The Colusa Golf Course is located at the southeastern entryway to the City along SR 20/45, northwest of the Colusa County Airport. The golf course is a semi-private facility that has nine holes. It is one of only two golf courses in Colusa County.

PARK ACREAGE STANDARDS

The National Recreation and Parks Association (NRPA) has established guidelines for the amount of recreational land necessary to serve a given population. These guidelines are oriented
toward more metropolitan areas; therefore, the NRPA advises each jurisdiction to establish its
own standards that are tailored to the unique characteristics of the area. However, most
jurisdictions typically adopt a standard of five acres of parkland per 1,000 persons, per general NRPA guidelines (See Quimby Act discussion below for another parkland standard). The City of Colusa has not formally adopted a parkland standard, but the adopted General Plan uses the five-acre standard to evaluate the adequacy of its park services. Based on its estimated 2005 population (5,582), the City currently has approximately 2.9 acre of parkland per 1,000 persons.

unimproved parkland at the minimum standard of three acres per 1,000 residents to a maximum
of five acres per 1,000 residents. The parkland and/or in-lieu fees are to be used for new or

Demand on Existing Park Facilities

Impact 4.11,4.1 Implementation of the proposed General Plan would encourage an increase
in the local population, thereby leading to an increase in the use of existing park and recreation service facilities. significant impact. This is considered a potentially

The additional demand on existing parks and recreational facilities, particularly the City- managed facilities, would increase the need for maintenance and improvements. These improvements could have environmental impacts, although the exact impacts cannot be determined since the potential improvements are unknown. However, given the developed character of the existing parks, these impacts are expected to be limited.

As previously noted, the proposed Planning Area currently has approximately 154.6 acres of parks, recreation areas and open space. The proposed General Plan Update would add another 71 acres of such lands, bringing the total parks and open space land to 225.6 acres at General Plan buildout. With an estimated population of 25,811 at General Plan buildout, the ratio of parkland to population would be approximately 8.7 acres per 1,000 persons, which would exceed the NRPA general guideline for parklands. As new developments are proposed, the City will have an opportunity to work with developers to set aside open space lands. Opportunities for increased access to the City's riverfront are a high priority for the City, and will promote this through the Riverfront District. Other new developments have proposed parks and recreational areas of between 21 and 25 acres each. The existence of additional park area
would reduce the impact the increased population would have on existing facilities.

Implementing Action PRC-2.3.c: Development Agreements

The City will use development agreements to ensure that the design and development of project areas that are consistent with the goals and policies of this element. Development agreements should specify the timing of construction of project improvements, including parklands, trails, and open space. Requirements for improvements and/or dedications and any credit to apply to park standards will be reflected in the agreement.
Policy PRC - 3.2 The City shall pursue opportunities for joint use of recreational facilities.

implementing Action PRC-3.2.a: Interagency Coordination

The City will confer with other jurisdictions in an effort to identify new programs and approaches to parks, traiis, and open space development that have proven successful in other communities.
The City may develop joint powers agreements with the school district, the County, and other agencies to develop, administer, and use parks, open space, and recreation facilities and programs. These agreements could facilitate use of non-City-owned properties including, but
not limited to, schools and the fairgrounds.

Implementing Action MFS-1.1.b: Development Impact Fees (see Impact 4.11.1.1)

Implementing Action MFS-1.1.c: AB 1600 Analysis (see Impact 4.11.1.1)

As described in Impact 4.11.1.1, Policy MFS-1.1 in the proposed Municipal Facilities and Services Element, along with its associated implementing actions, address the provision of public services in general. Policies PRC-2.1 addresses the need for maintenance of existing park facilities, while
PRC-2.2 addresses new facilities. Policy PRC-2.3 would establish a standard for the provision of parks, which would be at least five acres of parkland for every 1,000 City residents. Policy 3-2 would encourage opportunities for the joint use of recreational facilities. Implementing Action PRC-2.1.a would provide funding for existing parks through the Capital Improvements Program. Implementing Actions PRC-2.3.a, PRC-2.3.b and PRC-2.3.c would provide mechanisms for the provision of new parks, including development agreements, fees or dedications, and conditions
of approval for new development projects. Implementing Action PRC-2.2.a would require a
Parks Master that would guide the City in its decisions on the provision of park facilities. Implementing Action 3.2.a would establish interagency coordination for opportunities for joint
Uses of recreational facilities. Implementation of the above General Plan policies and
implementing actions would ensure adequate park and recreation services and facilities for City residents, which would reduce impacts on existing facilities. Impacts after implementation would be less than significant.

Development of Parks and Recreational Facilities

Impact 4.11.4.2 The General Plan update proposes additional parks and recreation areas, as well as park and recreation improvements in portions of the City. This would
be a less than significant impact.
As previously noted, the proposed General Plan update would add another 71 acres of parks, recreational lands and open space. The City has identified the need for a new community park of approximately 50 acres. Two potential sites for a community park have been identified on the proposed Land Use Diagram of the General Plan. In addition, the General Plan update has identified opportunities for increased access to and enjoyment of the City's riverfront. The riverfront is the focal point for the proposed development of a pedestrian/bicycle path that would encircle the City. These proposed new facilities could have environmental impacts, the impacts would likely be similar to those associated with new development under the proposed General Plan, such as impacts associated with construction activities including air quality, drainage, and noise as described in the relevant sections of this EIR. This MEIR addresses the potential impacts of new development and identifies mitigation measures where appropriate.

4.12 PUBLIC SERVICES AND UTILITIES

This section describes the public facilities and services for the proposed Planning Area. Each service includes descriptions of existing facilities, service standards and potential impacts on each service resulting from implementation of the proposed General Plan Update. Services include water supply, wastewater collection and treatment, storm water drainage, solid waste, and energy and communication services. Key issues addressed in this section include:
increased demand for water service, increased demand for wastewater service, stormwater
drainage, increased solid waste disposal, and increased demand for energy and communication services. Information for this section primarily came from City documents, City staff interviews, and a draft Municipal Services Review.

4.12.1 WATER SERVICE

4.12.1.1 EXISTING SETTING

The City of Colusa provides potable water for residential, commercial and industrial uses within the City limits. It also provides water to the following areas outside the City limits: the Walnut Ranch development, the Lurline Avenue area, the area east of Bridge Street, and restrooms at Moon Bend Road. The City receives its municipal water from deep wells that tap aquifers within underground geological formations. Land uses in the unincorporated portion of the proposed Planning Area not served by City water rely on individual welis for their water supply.
As noted in Section 4.7, Hydrology and Water Quality, the City of Colusa is within the Colusa Subbasin of the Sacramento Valley Groundwater Basin. The Colusa Subbasin aquifer system
comprises continental deposits of late Tertiary to Quaternary age. A review of hydrographs of spring-spring groundwater levels indicated a slight decline in levels associated with 1976-77 and 1987-94 droughts, followed by recovery to pre-drought conditions. Generally, groundwater levels have an average seasonal fluctuation of approximately five feet for normal and dry years. Overall, there appears to be no increasing or decreasing trends in groundwater levels (Tully and Young, 2007).
Existing Water Facilities
Within the City limits, the City of Colusa
administers a domestic water delivery system, operated by the Public Works Department. All
water used by the City comes from five wells. The depth of these wells exceeds 200 feet below ground surface, and each well is encased with a deep-water sanitary seal for a minimum of 50 feet to prevent infiltration. In 2006, the annual total for all five wells was
approximately 545.8 million gallons (Shaw, E., pers. comm., 2007). The wells pump between 1,000 and 1,330 gallons per minute (gpm) with one 225-kW diesel generator. The average dry weather pumping is between approximately 1.5 and 2.0 million gallons per day (mgd), with a peak of 3.0 mgd.
As of 2006, there were 2,126 active water service connections within the City. Of these connections, 1,914 were for residential customers, 195 were for commercial/institutional customers, and the remainder were for industrial and other users (Patty Hickel, pers. comm.,

City of Colusa Colusa General Plan
July 2007 Draft Master Environmental Impact Report

4.12 PUBLIC SERVICES AND UTILITIES

2007). A standard residential connection is ⅝-inch or ¾-inch. The City meters all water
connections.

Water lines in the older sections of the City vary in size from 4 to 8 inches in diameter. In a few
cases, water lines may have a smaller diameter than 4 inches. Much of the newer lines in the developing southern section of the City are 8-inch, 10-inch and 12-inch ductile iron pipe. Water is stored in two large elevated storage tanks, for pressure purposes. Combined, the two tanks
have a 250,000-gallon storage capacity. Figure 4.12-1 provides the locations of the main water
lines in Colusa.

Based on its annual report to the Department of Health Services, the City appears to provide an adequate level of service to its customers. As described in Section 4.7, Hydrology and Water Quality, water provided by the City's system is of generally good quality, with only elevated levels of manganese and iron noted at three of the City's wells. The most prevalent problems
encountered in 2003 were service connection leakages and complaints about dirty water and
iron and manganese levels. In 2003, ten water system problems were reported. Of these, eight were service connection breaks/leaks, one was a main break/leak, and one was a "positive bacteriological incident of treated water." In addition, there were a total of 73 complaints
reported and investigated, mostly dealing with meter leaks and taste/odor/color of water.
None of these complaints were reported to the Department of Health Services.

4.12.1.2 REGULATORY FRAMEWORK

STATE

California Department of Health Services
The Department of Health Services, Division of Drinking Waler and Environmental Management, oversees the Drinking Water Program. The Drinking Water Program regulates public water systems and certifies drinking water treatment and distribution operators. it provides suppori for small water systems and for improving their technical, managerial, and financial capacity. It provides subsidized funding for water system improvements under the State Revolving Fund (SRF) and Proposition 50 programs. The Drinking Water Program also oversees water recycling projects, permits water treatment devices, supports and promotes water system security, and oversees the Drinking Water Treatment and Research Fund for MTBE and other oxygenates.
California Code of Regulations

California Code of Regulations (CCR) Title 22, Chapter 15, Article 20 requires all public water
systems to prepare a Consumer Confidence Report for distribution to its customers and to the
Department of Health Services. The Consumer Confidence Report provides information regarding the quality of potable water provided by the water system. It includes information on the sources of the water, any detected contaminants in the water, the maximum contaminants levels set by regulation, violations and actions taken to correct them, and opportunities for public participation in decisions that may affect the quality of the water provided. The City prepared its most recent Consumer Confidence Report for the year 2003.
Urban Water Management Planning Act

The Urban Water Management Planning Act has as its objectives the management of urban water demands and the efficient use of urban water. Under its provisions, every urban water
supplier is required to prepare and adopt an urban water management plan. An "urban water

4.12 PUBLIC SERVICES AND UTILITIES

supplier" is a public or private water supplier that provides water for municipal purposes either directly or indirecty to more than 3,000 customers or supplying more than 3,000 acre-feet of waler annually. The plan must identity and quantify the existing and planned sources of water available to the supplier, quantify the projected water use for a period of 20 years, and describe the supplier's water demand management measures. The urban water supplier should make every effort to ensure the appropriate level of reliability in its water service sufficient to meet the needs of its various categories of customers during normal, dry, and multiple dry years. The Department of Water Resources must receive a copy of an adopted urban water management plan.

Senate Bill (SB) 610 and Assembly Bill (AB) 901

The State Legislature passed SB 610 and AB 901 in 2001. Both measures modified the Urban Water Management Planning Act. SB 610 requires additional information in an urban water management plan if groundwater is identified as a source of water available to an urban water supplier. It also requires that the plan include a description of all water supply projects and programs that may be undertaken to meet total projected water use. SB 610 requires a city or county that determines a project is subject to CEQA to identify any public water system that may supply water to the project and to request identified public water systems to prepare a specified water supply assessment. The assessment must include, among other information, an identification of existing water supply entitlements, water rights, or water service contracts relevant to the identified water supply for the proposed project, and water received in prior years pursuant to these entitlements, rights and contracts.
AB 901 requires an urban water management plan to include information, to the extent practicable, relating to the quality of existing sources of water available to an urban water supplier over given time periods. AB 901 also requires information on the manner in which water quality affects water management strategies and supply reliability. The bill requires a plan to describe plans to supplement a water source that may not be available at a consistent level of use, to the extent practicable. Additional findings and declarations relating to water quality are required.

Senate Bill (SB) 221
SB 221 adds Government Code Section 66455.3, requiring that the local water agency be sent a copy of any proposed residential subdivision of more than 500 dwelling units within five days of the subdivision application being accepted as complete for processing by the city or county. It also adds Government Code Section 66473.7, establishing detailed requirements for establishing whether a "sufficient water supply" exists to support any proposed residential subdivisions of more than 500 dwellings, including any such subdivision involving a development agreement. When approving a qualifying subdivision tentative map, the city or county must include a condition requiring availability of a sufficient water supply. The applicable public water system must provide proof of availability. If is there is no public water system, the city or county must undertake the analysis described in Government Code Section 66473.7. The analysis must include consideration of effects on other users of water and groundwater.

4.12 PUBLIC SERVICES AND UTILITIES

The proposed General Plan Update would replace existing policies and implementing actions associated with water service. Specific proposed policies and implementing actions are discussed in the impact analyses below.

4.12.1.3 IMPACTS AND MITIGATION MEASURES

STANDARDS OF SIGNIFICANCE

Based on Appendix G of the CEQA Guidelines, water service impacts are considered to be if significant if the following could result from the implementation of the proposed General Plan
Update:

1. Require or result in the construction of new water treatment facilities or expansion of existing facilities, the construction of which would cause significant environmental
effects.

2. Insufficient water supplies available to serve the project from existing entitlements and resources, or require new or expanded entitlements.
3. Substantially degrade groundwater supplies or interfere substantially with groundwater recharge such that there would be a net deficit in aquifer volume or a lowering of the local groundwater table level (e.g., the production rate of pre- existing nearby wells would drop to a level which would not support existing land uses or planned uses for which permits have been granted).

METHODOLOGY

Evaluation of potential impacts on water facilities and services was based on consultation with City staff and review of City documents. A major source of information was the Water Supply Evaluation completed for the City in 2007 by Tully and Young. Section 4.7, Hydrology and Water Quality, describes the analysis and findings of the Water Supply Evaluation. Other sources included surveys forms completed by City staff and returned to Pacific Municipal Consultants in 2005, and correspondence with City staff.
IMPACTS AND MITIGATION MEASURES FOR THE GENERAL PLAN UPDATE

Water Infrastructure

Impact 4.12.1.1 Implementation of the proposed General Plan Update would require additional water infrastructure, including treatment and distribution facilities, to serve new development. This is considered a potentially significant impact.
The proposed General Plan Update would allow urban development in areas currently used for agriculture or are otherwise undeveloped. These include areas west, south and east of the
current City limits. To serve the new development, water lines would need to be installed or extended. Additional wells and water treatment facilities would also be necessary. Additional water infrastructure also may be necessary to serve currently undeveloped areas within the City limits, such as the portion of the City within the proposed Colusa Riverbend project. The
expansion and development of new water infrastructure facilities could result in physical effects to the environment. Additional water extraction from groundwater may also result in physical

Draft Master Environmental Impact Report July 2007
4.12-4

4.12 PUBLIC SERVICES AND UTILITIES

effects to the environment. Environmental impacts that could be associated with new or expanded water supply facilities include the following:
Increase in erosion and sedimentation from construction activities; change in sediment
transport in streams; expansive soils could cause problems for new facilities (see Section
4.6, Geology, Seismicity, Soils and Hazardous Materials).

• Potential direct impacts on a variety of biological resources from the construction of new facilities, including changes in the amount or functions and values of various types of wetlands, and disturbance to special-status plants and wildlife and their habitats (see
Section 4.8, Biological Resources).
New pipelines, pumping stations, or transmission lines near or in residential areas or highly visited areas would cause negative visual impacts {see Section 4.10, Aesthetics and
Visual Resources).

Some agricultural land could be taken out of production where project conveyance
facilities need to be located and to accommodate growth (see Section 4.1, Land Use
and Agricultural Resources).
Historic and prehistoric resources could be affected by the construction and maintenance of new facilities (see Section 4.9, Cultural Resources).
The routing and siting of new project facilities could interfere with the operation or maintenance of existing or planned public utilities, including communication and energy infrastructure (see Section 4.12, Public Services and Utilities).
Air emissions from construction equipment and traffic could occur during the construction phase of new projects (see Section 4.5, Air Quality).
Loud noises could occur during the construction phase of new projects. New pumping stations in or near residential areas may cause adverse noise impacts for nearby residents (see Section 4.4, Noise).
Local roads would experience traffic increases during construction (see Section 4.3, Transportation).
New system infrastructure would likely cause growth-inducing impacts (see Section 8.0, Other Sections Required by CEQA).

Future water infrastructure projects would be reviewed for compliance with CEQA on a project-
by-project basis.
Proposed General Plan Policies and Implementing Actions that Mitigate Potential Impacts
Municipal Facilities and Services Element

Policy MFS-1.1 The City shall ensure that new development does not exceed the
capacity of the City to provide adequate municipal facilities and does not disproportionately impact the capacity of existing service levels. New growth shall pay its fair-share cost of facilities and services without creating an additional burden to existing residents.

City of Colusa Colusa General Plan
July 2007 Draft Master Environmental Impact Report
4.12-5

4.12 PUBLIC SERVICES AND UTILITIES

Implementing Action MFS-1.1.a: Capital Improvement Program
The City of Colusa will establish a Capital Improvement Program, which will guide the deveiopment of municipal facilities and infrastructure improvements over a five-year period. The Program, which is to be updated on an annual or biannual basis, schedules by fiscal year the proposed capital construction phases and related expenditure and financing needs expected to occur during the five-year period. The Program will identify priorities, funding sources, and timing for design, construction and operation, to be developed in conjunction with the City's budget.

Implementing Action MFS-1.1.b: Development Impact Fees
The City will update its Development Impact Fee Program. As new development occurs, projects will be charged their fair-share of development impact fees to offset the cost of needed improvements to the City's municipal facilities. The City will review and update the development impact fee schedule on an annual basis.
Implementing Action MFS-1.1.c: Assembly Bill (AB) 1600 Analysis
in accordance with Government Code Section 66000 et seq., as amended, the City will conduct a thorough analysis of the City's development impact fee structure (commonly referred to as the AB 1600 Analysis) to ensure that fees are (1) adequate to fund capital projects and facilities, (2) based on expansion or provision of new facilities required by growth, and (3) meet all requirements of State law. The AB 1600 analysis will be initiated at the same time as the first Capital Improvement Program, and fees will be adjusted annually to keep up with inflation and construction costs. The project applicant will be responsible for the cost of this analysis. The City may require a particular project to fund the master study, with reimbursement to be made for areas not affected by the particular project through credits against developer fees when building permits are issued. Until the AB 1600 city-wide master analysis is completed, the share of facilities costs and impacts on the community should be determined on a project-by-project basis.

Policy MFS-7.1 The City shall establish development standards and plans to ensure that the water treatment and delivery system is not unduly burdened by new development.

implementing Action MFS-7.1.a: Capital Improvement Program (see Implementing Action MFS- 1.1a)

Implementing Action MFS-7.1.b: Development Review
The City will use the development entitlement review process to ensure the adequacy of water infrastructure in new developments, and will require consistency with the General Plan and ali applicable policies and regulations. As part of the development review process, the City will also consider the cost of service delivery and fiscal impacts of both private development projects and public projects pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).
Implementing Action MFS-7.1.c: Water Master Plan
The City will prepare and implement a Water Master Plan to provide a framework for timed capital improvements and facility expansion projects. The plan will aid the City in identifying and establishing funding sources beyond monthly service charges to finance improvements related

Colusa General Plan City of Colusa
Draft Master Environmental Impact Report July 2007

4.12 PUBLIC SERVICES AND UTILITIES

to water quality, supply, recycling, distribution, conservation, and other issue areas identified by the City and the plan. The plan will evaluate the depth, size, recharge rate, and capacity of the aquifer to accommodate the City's projected future growth. The plan will aiso make determinations regarding the need to develop additional water sources during the planning period of this General Plan.

Implementing Action MFS-7.1.d: Development impact Fees (see Implementing Action MFS-1.1b)
Policy MFS-1.1 would establish a general policy that adequate municipal services must be
maintained for both existing and new development. Municipal services would include water
supply. Implementing Action MFS-1.1.a would commit the City to a Capital Improvements Program that would identify necessary improvements to service facilities, along with a schedule for completion of projects and funding sources. Implementing Actions MFS-1.1.b and MFS-1.1.c would establish development impact fees as one source of funding capital improvements, and include an analysis to determine the adequacy of fees to fund improvements.
Policy MFS-7.1 and Implementing Action MFS-7.1.a are similar to Policy MFS-1.1 and Implementing Action MFS-1.1.a, but more specifically addresses water system facilities. Under Implementing Action MFS-7.1.b, the City would determine during the development review process if proposed development projects would have any adverse impacts on the water system, and impose mitigation measures or conditions of approval if necessary. Implementing Actions MFS-7.1.c and MFS-7.1.d would provide a framework for water system improvement projects, including a Water Master Plan that identifies necessary improvements and their scheduling, and development impact fees to provide funding. Implementation of the above General Plan policies and implementing actions would ensure an adequate water supply and delivery system for City residents. Impacts after implementation would be less than significant.

Additional Mitigation Measures

None required.

Water Demand

Impact 4.12.1.2 Implementation of the proposed General Plan Update would increase demand on existing water supplies. This is considered a potentially significant impact.

The proposed General Plan Update would allow for additional residential, commercial and industrial development. All these land uses would require additional water supplies. Currently, the City's water system can meet the demand by its customers. However, increased demand would require more pumping from the City's wells, and additional wells may need to be drilled. The discussion under Impact 4.7.5 in Section 4.7, Hydrology and Water Quality, contains an evaluation of this issue. Table 4.7-2 in the Hydrology section shows projected water demand in the proposed Planning Area. The conclusion of the impact discussion was that additional groundwater would need to be withdrawn to satisfy future demand, but that the amount required would be less than under existing conditions. Current (2007) demand is 9,033 acre-feet per year, yet the demand is projected to decrease to 8,839 acre-feet per year by 2027. The amount of water used by existing agricultural operation exceeds the amount projected to be used as agricultural lands are converted to developed uses (Tully and Young, 2007). Therefore, the proposed General Plan Update would not result in increased water demand and would have a less than significant impact on water supply.

Policy PRC-9.3 and its associated implementing actions would assist the City in maintaining its groundwater supply through impact fees to maintain its water supply infrastructure and ability to impose water conservation measures during its review of
development application. Policies PRC-9.4, MFS-7.2 and MFS-7.3 would further the main objective of Policy PRC-9.3 by encouraging plans and practices that conserve water. These include a landscaping ordinance that establishes standards for water-conserving landscapes, a Water Master Pian that includes facilities for recycling and conserving water, a water conservation program that implements more aggressive measures if program goals are not achieved, and the use of treated wastewater and other non-potable water for irrigation and groundwater recharge. Implementing Action MFS-7.3.a, like Implementing Action PRC-9.3.a, would allow the City to impose water conservation measures on development projects.
Implementation of the General Plan policies and implementing actions and mitigation measure MM 4.7.5b would reduce potential water demand from levels that would occur without these
actions, thereby reducing demand on the City's water supply and decreasing the need to find additional water supplies. Impacts after implementation would be less than significant.

4.12.2 WASTEWATER SERVICE

4.12.2.1 EXISTING SETTING

The City of Colusa provides wastewater collection and treatment services to all of its residents within the City limits, as well as the Walnut Ranch development outside the City limits. Land uses in other unincorporated portions of the proposed Planning Area rely on individual septic systems for its wastewater disposal.

EXISTING WASTEWATER FACILITIES

Within the City of Colusa, sewage is conveyed mostly through a series of 6-, 8-, 10-, 12- and 15- inch clay pipes to larger collection systems. The sewer lines and mains lead toward a series of
pump stations located throughout the City. There are 1,872 connections to the City's sewer
system as of 2006 (Patty Hickel, pers. comm.., May 15, 2007). Figure 4-12.2 depicts the locations of the main sewer lines in Colusa.

The City's wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) is located approximately one mile southwest of the City limits. It consists of a pond system, with ten ponds total. This system supports jow-rate
biological process that produces an effluent considered equivalent to secondary effluent from conventional mechanical processes. Chlorine gas disinfects the effluent. Sulfur dioxide gas dechlorinates the treated wastewater before its discharge into a tributary of Powell Slough. The City's WWTP currently has a permitted capacity of 0.9 million gallons per day (mgd) on the average dry weather flow (ADWF) basis; the current flow is approximately 0.5 mgd ADWF (Nicholas Ponticello, pers. comm.., May 15, 2007
The City of Colusa's current secondary treatment process is not meeting recently imposed regulations of the RWQCB, in compliance with the federal Clean Water Act. The WWTP currently operates under Wastewater Discharge Requirements Order No. R5-2002-0020, National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit No. CA 0078999, issued March 2002. The current
permit requires significant upgrades to the existing WWTP to continue discharges to the Powell Slough tributary, which at a minimum includes tertiary treatment and nutrient removal.

4.12.2.2 REGULATORY FRAMEWORK

FEDERAL

Clean Water Act

In 1972, the Clean Water Act (CWA) was adopted to protect the waters of the nation. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and corresponding state agencies regulate public wastewater systems to ensure compliance with the CWA. To implement the CWA regulatory standards, the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit Program was
instituted.

The CWA requires that all point sources discharging pollutants into waters of the United States must obtain a NPDES permit. By point sources, EPA means discrete conveyances such as pipes or man-made ditches. Although individual households do not need permits, facilities must obtain permits if their discharges go directly to surface waters. Some pollutants that may threaten public health and the nation's waters are: human wastes, ground-up food from sink disposals, laundry and bath waters, toxic chemicals, oil and grease, metals, and pesticides.
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Permit

Discharge of treated wastewater to surface water(s) of the United States, including wetlands, require a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit. In California, the Regional Water Quality Control Boards (RWQCB) administers the issuance of these Federal
Permits. Obtaining an NPDES permit requires preparation of detailed information, including characterization of wastewater sources, treatment processes, and effluent quality. Whether or not a permit may be issued and the conditions of a permit are subject to many factors such a

Basin Plan water quality objectives, impaired water body status of the receiving water, historical flow rates of the receiving water, effluent quality and flow, the State Implementation Plan (SIP) and the California Toxics Rule (CTR), and established Total Maximum Daily Loading (TMDL) rates for various pollutants. These factors are highly specific to the potential discharge point. Obtaining a NPDES permit is generally considered difficult in inland areas and may not be
possible in sensitive areas.

STATE

State Water Resources Control Board - Basin Plan for the Central Valley Region
The Basin Plan for the Central Valley Region covers the entire area of the Sacramento and San Joaquin River drainage basins, which includes the Mokelumne River basin. The Basin Plan defines beneficial uses for both surface waters and ground waters in this region. Water quality objectives are established to protect those beneficial uses. The land application of recycled water must be compatible with the beneficial uses and water quality objectives detailed in the Basin Plan.

Regional Water Quality Control Board - Waste Discharge Requirements
A Waste Discharge Requirements (WDR) permit is typically required for any facility that discharges or proposes to discharge waste that may affect the quality of waters of the State. This may include systems that have waste storage systems with land disposal, such as a seasonal storage and reuse. Potential dischargers must file complete Report on Waste Discharge with the RWQCB at least 120 days prior to discharging waste. In addition, a Report on Waste Discharge must be submitted for onsite septic systems at residential subdivisions of over 100 homes. Issuance of a WDR permit is based on information provided in the Report on Waste Discharge. A WDR permit may set effluent standards for activities that do not pose a threat or nuisance to water quality.

LOCAL

Existing Colusa General Plan
The existing City of Colusa General Plan currently is used as the "blueprint" to guide future development within the City limits and in unincorporated portions of the existing Planning Area. The proposed General Plan Update would replace existing policies and implementing actions associated with wastewater service. Specific proposed policies and implementing actions are discussed in the impact analyses below.

4.12.2.3 IMPACTS AND MITIGATION MEASURES

STANDARDS OF SIGNIFICANCE

Based on Appendix G of the CEQA Guidelines, wastewater service impacts are considered to be significant if the following could result from the implementation of the General Plan update:
1. Meet or exceed wastewater treatment requirements of the applicable Regional Water Quality Control Board.

City of Colusa Colusa General Plan
July 2007 Draft Master Environmental Impact Report
4.12-11

4.12 PUBLIC SERVICES AND UTILITIES

2. Require or result in the construction of new wastewater treatment facilities or expansion of existing facilities, the construction of which could cause significant
environmental effects.

3. Result in a determination by the wastewater treatment provider, which serves or may serve the project, that it has inadequate capacity to serve the project's projected demand in addition to the provider's existing commitments.

METHODOLOGY

Evaluation of potential impacts on water facilities and services was based on consultation with City staff and review of City documents. These included survey forms completed by City staff and returned to Pacific Municipal Consultanis in 2005, and correspondence with the City Engineer. The Municipal Facilities and Services Element of the proposed General Plan Update were consulted for background information.

IMPACTS AND MITIGATION MEASURES FOR THE GENERAL PLAN UPDATE

Wastewater Treatment Capacity

Impact 4.12.2.1 Implementation of the proposed General Plan Update would increase
wastewater flows and demand for sanitary sewer facilities, which may exceed the capacity of the City's wastewater treatment plant. This is considered a potentially significant impact.

Increased development associated with implementation of the proposed General Plan Update would increase the amount of wastewater generated. The City has scheduled necessary
improvements to the WWTP for completion by the end of 2008, which include upgrading the plant to tertiary-level treatment with a capacity of 0.7 mgd (Frank Garofalo, pers. comm., 2006). This would reduce the City's WWTP capacity from the currently permitted capacity of 0.9 mgd (Nicholas Ponticello, pers. comm.., 2007).
Implementation of the proposed project would require additional treatment capacity to serve development under the General Pian Update. This means a larger amount of wastewater would need to be treated at the City's WWTP. This would significantly exceed the WWTP's currently allowed treatment capacity (0.90 mgd). Expansion of the WWTP would be necessary to serve projected development.
Potential environmental effects associated with the expansion of the City's WWTP include, but
are not limited to, construction and operational air quality and noise effects, biological resource impacts to protected habitat, geologic and hydrologic impacts from construction and operation, hazards and growth inducement. These environmental effects would likely occur at the existing WWTP site as well as for potential offsite facilities such as a reclamation facility. However, no specific facility expansion designs have been developed to date that would further specify the potential environmental effects.
Policy PRC-9.4 of the proposed General Plan encourages the use of treated wastewater for irrigation and groundwater recharge. As previously noted, the City's WWTP discharge its treated effluent into a tributary of Powell Slough. Implementation of this policy would divert an unknown amount of this discharge. The potential reduction to flow in the tributary to Powell Slough occurring with application of recycled water to land, could result in adverse effects to

Implementing Action MFS-8.7.a: Wastewater Master Plan
As part of the Wastewater Master Plan, the City will Identify and implement as necessary applications for addressing hazards and nuisances associated with wastewater treatment plant
operations.

As described in Impact 4.12.1.1, Policy MFS-1.1 would establish a general policy that adequate municipal services, including wastewater collection and treatment must be maintained for both
existing and new development. Implementing Action MFS-1.1.a would commit the City to a Capital Improvements Program that would identify necessary improvements to service facilities, along with a schedule for completion of projects and funding sources. Implementing Actions MFS-1.1.b and MFS-1.1.c would establish development impact fees as one source of funding capital improvements, and include an analysis to determine the adequacy of fees to fund improvements.

Policies MFS-8.1 and MFS-8.2 are similar to Policy MFS-1.1, but more specifically addresses wastewater system facilities. Policy MFS-8.1 and its associated implementing actions would focus on the City's wastewater treatment plant, ensuring the plant has adequate capacity to serve additional wastewater generated by projected growth under the proposed General Plan
Update. Under Implementing Action MFS-8.2.a, the City would determine during the development review process proposed development projects would have any adverse impacts on the water system, and impose mitigation measures or conditions of approval if necessary. Implementing Actions MFS-8.2.b and MFS-8.2.c would provide a framework for water system improvement projects, including Wastewater Master Plan that identifies necessary improvements and their scheduling, and development impact fees to provide funding.
Policy MFS-8.3 and Implementing Action MFS-8.3.a would have the City investigate the feasibility of the reuse of treated effluent, which would reduce demand on water supplies and reduce treatment plant discharges to channels. Policy MFS-8.4 and Implementing Action MFS-8.4.a would require a pretreatment program that would apply to industrial activities. This program would reduce potential problems with treating industrial wastewater, thereby ensuring continued safe and effective operation of the City's treatment plant. Policy MFS-8.5 would establish a general requirement that all activities within the City limits that generate sewage connect to the City's wastewater system, except in limited cases. Implementing Action MFS- 8.5.a would make this requirement part of the City codes and improvement standards. Policy MFS-8.6 and Implementing Action MFS-8.6,a would make gravity-flow systems, with limited exceptions, the standard design for collection facilities. Policy 8.7 and Implementing Action MFS-8.7.a would require the City to investigate potential hazards and nuisances associated with
treatment plant operations to reduce potential conflicts with nearby land uses.

Additional Mitigation Measures

MM 4.12.2.1 Ali development project applications submitted to the City prior to the adoption of the Wastewater Master Plan shall be required to submit a Wastewater Plan which addresses the project's wastewater flow and its impact on the local wastewater system, and identification of a funding mechanism, if necessary, for the project's share of potential improvements necessary to the existing wastewater system to treat the project wastewater. The Wastewater Plan will also include a plan for the potential re-use of treated wastewater on the project site. This Wastewater Plan will be developed to the satisfaction of the City of Colusa.

Implementation of the proposed General Plan policies and implementing actions and mitigation measure MM 4.12.2.1 described above would ensure the completion of required improvements to the City's wastewater treatment plant as development occurs. Impacts atter implementation would be less than signiticant.

Wastewater Infrastructure

Impact 4.12.2.2 Implementation of the proposed General Plan Update would increase wastewater flows, thereby requiring additional sanitary sewer infrastructure.
This is considered a potentially significant impact.
Increased development associated with implementation of the proposed General Plan Update would require the installation or extension of sewer lines to collect wastewater generated by the new development. Developers would install most of the new lines as they develop their sites. However, some of the older lines may need replacement to ensure that the collection system handle the increased wastewater flows effectively. While infiltration and inflow are currently minor problems, they may become more significant as development under the proposed General Pian Update occurs. Infiltration and inflow reduce the carrying capacity of sewer lines, thereby reducing the wastewater collection capacity of the system. Other impacts associated with sewer infrastructure generally include the following:
Increase in erosion and sedimentation from construction activities; change in sediment
transport in streams; expansive soils could cause problems for new facilities (see Section
4.6, Geology, Seismicity, Soils and Hazardous Materials).
Some agricultural land could be taken out of production where project conveyance facilities need to be located and to accommodate growth (see Section 4.1, Land Use and Agricultural Resources),

Short-term direct visual impacts associated with construction activities (see Section 4.10, Aesthetics and Visual Resources).

Potential direct impacts on a variety of biological resources, including disturbance of wetlands, loss of trees, and loss or disturbance of special status plant and animal species or their habitats (see Section 4.8, Biological Resources).
Historic and prehistoric resources could be affected by the construction and maintenance of new facilities (see Section 4.9, Cultural Resources).

The routing and sitting of new project facilities could interfere with the operation or maintenance of existing or planned public utilities, including communication and energy infrastructure (see Section 4.12, Public Utilities and Services).

Air emissions from construction equipment and traffic could occur during the
construction phase of new projects (see Section 4.5, Air Quality).
Loud noises could occur during the construction phase of new projects. New pumping stations in or near residential areas may cause adverse noise impacts for nearby residents (see Section 4.4, Noise).
Local roads would experience traffic increases during construction (see Section 4.3,
Transportation).

4.12.3 STORM WATER DRAINAGE

4.12.3.1 EXISTING SETTING

As described in the Municipal Facilities and Services Element of the proposed General Plan, there are two drainage sheds within the City of Colusa: the west shed (Area 1) and east shed (Area 2), as illustrated in Figure 4.12-3. The dividing line between the two areas splits the city east and west generally beginning at the Sacramento River at 6th Street running south to Sioc Street at 3rd Street, and continuing south to the intersect with Wescott Road. Historically, the east downtown shed, Area 2A, has been the subject of numerous studies due to extensive and repeated flooding. Several studies have been prepared in 1974, 1986, and 1991, identifying possible drainage solutions, but none of the solutions have been completely implemented.
Both drainage sheds consist primarily of surface drainage systems conveying storm water by means of guttered flow lines that traverse under intersections and driveways via under-roadway culverts. The west downtown runoff enters into underground piping in 10th Street and in Fremont Street. There are two pipelines, 24 inches and 54 inches in diameter, that convey the runoff to a lift station on the southwest corner of Colusa High School. The runoff is lifted to a 60-inch pipeline that opens to the main westerly drainage ditch, which conveys the storm water southwest to the
Colusa Basin/Powell Slough. Area 1C, as illustrated, also conveys that development's runoff to the west lift station. The remaining portion of Area 1, including 1B. 1D, 1E, and land west of Wescott Road drain through pipes and natural ditches to the West Ditch, as indicated in Figure
4.12-3.

The east downtown storm water is collected by drainage piping and conveyed south and east to Bridge Street, where it is transported south along Bridge Street. The runoff is then released into a drainage ditch at the intersection of SR 20/45 and Wescott Road, where it continues south along SR 20/45. The water is then transported across SR 20/45 through a ditch that crosses under the road via culverts and drainage piping to the drainage channel that flows through the golf course and southeast through the Colusa Industrial Park property. The watler eventually turns west to empty into the Colusa Basin/Powell Slough.
The storm water drainage system is constructed of approximately 35,000 linear feet of underground piping ranging in size from 15 to 60 inches in diameter. Three (3) small lift stations within Areas 2B, 2C, and 2D assist in conveying drainage from other localized areas and from detention ponds for subdivisions that lift drainage to gravity pipe systems. These gravity pipe systems ultimately release into the natural drainage channel flowing through the golf course and southeast through the CIP property. All other portions of Area 2 east of Wescott Road drain
through pipes and the drainage channel that flows through the golf course and the Colusa Industrial Park property.

Under a NPDES, a permit is required for discharges from municipal separate storm sewer systems (MS4s) and industrial operations into streams and other bodies of water. The City's storm water drainage system currently does not require a NPDES permit, as it does not meet the criteria that

IMPACTS AND MITIGATION MEASURES FOR THE GENERAL PLAN UPDATE

Storm Water Runoff

Impact 4.12.3.1 New development would increase storm water runoff rates generated within and downstream of the proposed Planning Area when compared with existing conditions. This is considered a potentially significant impact.
Much of the precipitation that falls on natural or undeveloped land slowly infiltrates into the soil and is stored either temporarily or permanently on the surface or in underground layers of soil. When the soil becomes saturated with water, or the rate of rainfall exceeds the infiltration capacity of the soil, precipitation begins to flow over the surface of the land, becoming storm water runoff. The infiltration and runoff process is altered when is a site is developed with urban uses. As impervious surfaces are added to the ground, the natural infiltration and storage processes are reduced. As a result, the volume and flow rate of storm water runoff increases. The effect of these increases in runoff rates and volumes will be more pronounced during storms of lower magnitude and higher frequency. The increased volumes and flow rates of storm water runoff may result in downstream flooding if not properly mitigated.
Development accommodated under the proposed General Plan Update would increase flow rates and volumes of runoff by introducing streets, homes/buildings, parking areas, and other impervious surfaces and by providing improved facilities for onsite drainage conveyance. Existing downstream storm drainage facilities may have insufficient capacity to accept the additional runoff generated by the additional development. The east downtown shed has been subject repeated flooding. Therefore, construction of storm water detention facilities and/or downstream storm drainage conveyance facilities would be necessary to mitigate the impacts of increased runoff. The expansion and development of new storm water infrastructure facilities could result in physical effects to the environment. Additional water extraction from groundwater may also result in physical effects to the environment. Environmental impacts that could be associated with new or expanded storm water drainage facilities include the following:
Increase in erosion and sedimentation from construction activities; change in sediment transport in streams; expansive soils could cause problems for new facilities (see Section
4.6, Geology, Seismicity, Soils and Hazardous Materials).

Potential direct impacts on a variety of biological resources from the construction of new
facilities, including changes in the amount or functions and values of various types of wetlands, and disturbance to special-status plants and wildlife and their habitats (see Section 4.8, Biological Resources).
New drainage lines and detention basins could cause negative visual impacts (see Section 4.10, Aesthetics and Visual Resources).

Implementing Action SAF-2.2.a: Storm Drainage Master Plan

The City will adopt a Storm Drainage Master Plan for Colusa. The Master Plan will identify
drainage facilities that will be constructed to eliminate or mitigate drainage problems in the City, and describe the means for financing the proposed improvements. The Storm Drainage Master Plan will be consistent with any Capital Improvements Plan prepared by the City and will address Regional Water Quality Control Board water quality standards, inciuding Best Management Practices of storm drainage.

Implementing Action SAF-2.2.b: Development Review

The City will require new development to ensure that the cumulative rate of peak runoff does
not exceed pre-development levels. New development and redevelopment of existing sites will
provide storm water detention or retention facilities (on- or off-site}, if necessary, to prevent
flooding due to runoff or where existing storm drainage facilities are unable to accommodate
increased storm water drainage.

Implementing Action SAF-2.2.c: Ordinance and Regulation Review and Update
The City will review and revise its Subdivision Ordinance as needed to incorporate specific data and design requirements related to storm water drainage that are contained in this General
Plan update.

As described in Impact 4.12.1.1, Policy MFS-1.1 would a establish a general policy that adequate municipal services, including storm water drainage, must be maintained for both existing and new development. Implementing Action MFS-1.1.a would commit the City to a Capital Improvements Program that would identify necessary improvements to service facilities, along with a schedule for completion of projects and funding sources. Implementing Actions MFS- 1.1.b and MFS-1.1.c would establish development impact fees as one source of funding capital
improvements, and include an analysis to determine the adequacy of fees to fund
improvements.

Policy MFS-9.1 and Implementing Action MFS-9.1.b are similar to Policy MFS-1.1 and
Implementing Action MFS-1.1.a, but more specifically addresses storm water system facilities. Policy SAF-2.2 establishes as City policy minimization of flood damage caused by excess storm water runoff. Implementing Actions MFS-9.1.a, MFS-9.1.c and SAF-2.2.b would provide a
framework for storm water system improvement projects, including a Storm Drainage Master
Plan that identifies necessary improvements and their scheduling, and development impact
fees to provide funding. Under Implementing Action SAF-2.2.b, the City would determine during the development review process if proposed development projects would have any adverse impacts on the storm water system, and impose mitigation measures or conditions of approval if necessary. Implementing Action SAF-2.2.c would revise City improvement standards for drainage facilities in accordance with requirements of the proposed General Plan.

Additional Mitigation Measures

MM 4.12.3.1 All development project applications submitted to the City prior to the
adoption of the Storm Water Master Plan shall be required to submit a Storm
Water Plan which addresses the project's storm water drainage system, and
any storm water detention or retention facilities (on- or off-site), if necessary,
to prevent flooding due to runoff or where existing storm drainage facilities are unable to accommodate increased storm water drainage. This Storm Water Plan will be developed to the satisfaction of the City of Colusa.
Implementation of the proposed General Plan policies and implementing actions described above and mitigation measure MM 4.12.3.1 would ensure the completion of required improvements to the City's storm drainage system as development occurs. Impacts after
implementation would be less than significant.

4.12.4 SOLID WASTE SERVICE

4.12.4.1 EXISTING SETTING

The City of Colusa provides solid waste collection service within the City limits to residential,
commercial and industrial customers. Residential services include the pickup of one 90-gallon yard waste container early in the week, and one 30-, 60- or 90-gallon household waste container later in the week. The owner or occupants of all residential properties shall subscribe to no less than the minimum service. The City will also collect excess yard refuse and loose clippings deposited in alleys and streets for a charge, as well as other materials that otherwise may not be placed in the containers. Trailer bins with a capacity of six cubic yards may be rented from the City, when available and when not being used by City refuse collection crews.
Commercial and industrial bin rates vary according to the bin size, with a minimum of two cubic yards and a maximum of eight cubic yards. Commercial establishments are charged a
minimum rate, regardless of amount of solid waste disposed. All restrictions placed on residential users regarding type of containers used and the type of materials to be collected also apply to commercial and industrial users.

According to the Parks, Recreation and Resource Conservation Element of the proposed General Plan, daily waste collection in the City of Colusa usually yields approximately 40 tons of household solid waste. The City delivers all solid waste to the Ostrom Road Landfill near Beale Air Force Base in Yuba County. According to information from the California Integrated Waste Management Board, the Ostrom Road Landfill has a maximum permitted capacity of 41,822,300 cubic yards. As of April l, 2004, the landfill had a remaining capacity of 40,600,000 cubic yards, with a maximum permitted throughput of 3,000 tons of solid waste per day. The estimated
closure date for the landfill is December 31, 2066 (California Integrated Waste Management
Board, 2007).
According to the Parks, Recreation and Resource Conservation Element of the proposed General Plan, recycling in Colusa is handled by the Lions Club and by private contractors. The Lions Club manages a recycling dropoff site at Ninth and Webster Streets for glass, aluminum and plastic. Private contractors in the City provide recycling facilities for plastics, aluminum,
glass, newspaper, cardboard, white paper, and colored paper.

4.12.4.2 REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR SOLID WASTE SERVICES

STATE

California Integrated Waste Management Act

The purpose of the California Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989 (also known as AB 939) is to "reduce, recycle, and re-use solid waste generated in the State to the maximum extent feasible." The term "integrated waste management" refers to the use of a variety of waste management practices to handle safely and effectively the municipal solid waste stream with
the least adverse impact on human health and the environment. The Act has established a
waste management hierarchy, as follows:

Source Reduction
Recycling
• Composting
Transformation
Disposal

The Act requires every city and county in the State to prepare a Source Reduction and Recycling Element to its Solid Waste Management Plan. This element must identify how the local jurisdiction will meet the mandatory State waste diversion goals of 25 percent by 1995 and 50 percent by 2000.

4.12.4.3 IMPACTS AND MITIGATION MEASURES

STANDARDS OF SIGNIFICANCE

Based on Appendix G of the CEQA Guidelines, solid waste service impacts are considered to be significant if the following could result from the implementation of the proposed General Plan
Update:

1. Be served by a landfill with insufficient permitted capacity to accommodate the project's solid waste disposal needs.

2. Fails to comply with federal, state, and local statutes and regulations related to solid
waste.

METHODOLOGY

Evaluation of potential impacts on solid waste services was based on consultation with City staff and review of City documents. These included survey forms completed by City staff and returned to Pacific Municipal Consultants in 2005, and correspondence with City staff. Another source of information was the California Integrated Waste Management Board, whose website contains the Solid Waste Information System (SWIS) database. This information provides data on landfills, including maximum permitted capacity and remaining capacity.

IMPACT STATEMENTS AND MITIGATION MEASURES FOR THE GENERAL PLAN UPDATE

Solid Waste Disposal Demand

Impact 4.12.4.1 Implementation of the proposed General Plan Update would increase solid waste generation and the demand for related services. This is considered a
potentially significant impact.
The proposed General Plan Update would allow for more residential, commercial and industrial development, which would result in the generation of more solid waste. Most of the additional solid waste would likely be disposed of at the Ostrom Road Landfill in Yuba County, as the City currently delivers collected solid waste directly to the landfill (Patty Hickel, pers. comm., 2005). As previously noted, the Ostrom Road Landfill has a permitted throughput capacity of approximately 3,000 tons per day. The current residential solid waste load from the City (40 tons) is slightly over one percent of the permitted throughput. Even with a larger residential load and the addition of commercial and industrial loads, the amount of solid waste generated by the City after General Plan buildout would still be well below permitted throughput. The Ostrom Road Landfill has approximately 97 percent of its maximum permitted capacity still available.
Proposed General Plan Policies and Implementing Actions that Mitigate Potential Impacts

Parks, Recreation and Resource Conservation Element

Policy PRC-10.1 The City shall continue to encourage recycling, waste reduction, and the re-use of materials to reduce the amount of solid waste generated in Colusa.

Implementing Action PRC-10.1.a: Assembly Bill (AB) 939
The City will continue to comply with the requirements of AB 939 with regard to meeting state- mandated targets for reductions in the amount of solid waste generated in Colusa.

Policy PRC-10.1 would encourage recycling, waste reduction and reuse by City residents and activities. Such actions would reduce the amount of solid waste that would need to be sent to a landfill. Implementing Actions PRC-10.1.a would require the City to continue compliance with existing State law that set targets for reduction of solid waste amounts sent to landfills. implementing Action PRC-10.1.b would implement a City program that would further reduce the amount of solid waste that would need to go to a landfill.
Implementation of the proposed General Plan policies and implementing actions would assist in reducing the solid waste stream, thereby reducing demand on landfill capacity, and would ensure adequate provision of solid waste services. Impacts would be less than significant.

Additional Mitigation Measures

None required.

4.12.5 ENERGY AND COMMUNICATION SERVICES

Private companies operate most energy and communication services. Energy companies provide electricity, natural gas and other energy sources. Communication companies provide services such as telephone, Internet access and television. These companies operate in specific territories that cover many states. All the companies discussed in this section provide service within both the City of Colusa and the unincorporated portion of the proposed Planning Area.

4.12.5.1 EXISTING SETTING

ENERGY

The Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) provides electrical and natural gas service to the City of Colusa and the proposed Planning
Area. A private utility, PG&E has a service area
that covers most of northern and central
California. PG&E generates electric power
from many sources, including hydroelectric
powerhouses, a nuclear power plant (Diablo
Canyon) and a few small fossil-fired power plants. PG&E also purchases power from independent power producers; generation
sources from these producers can range from
large fossil power plants to smaller renewable
and cogeneration plants. After the power is produced or bought, it goes into PG&E's electric transmission and distribution systems to get to the homes and businesses of PG&E's customers.
Infrastructure to deliver electricity and natural gas is currently in place. PG&E generally can provide these services to newer development on request. However, residents outside the City limits may also heat their residences using propane, generally stored in individual tanks and delivered by propane companies.

4.12 PUBLIC SERVICES AND UTILITIES

COMMUNICATION SERVICES

Frontier Communications, a private company that serves several states, provides local telephone service to the proposed Planning Area. Several private companies provide long distance telephone services. Consumers can select the company that provides long distance service. Telephone facilities include both aerial and underground fiber and copper transmission lines. Both local and long distance companies utilize these lines. Generally, telephones companies can provide service to those willing to pay for them.
Several private companies provide access to the Internet, through either dial-up or broadband. Dial-up services utilize the telephone lines within the proposed Planning Area. Broadband
services use telephone lines (DSL), cable television lines, or electronic waves (wireless). As with telephone services, Internet service providers generally can provide service to customers willing to pay, provided the customers have the necessary equipment for the type of service requested.

Comcast provides cable television services for the City of Colusa. Infrastructure for cable television services is installed within the City limits. Outside the cable television service area, residents and other customers may use satellite television, an option also available to City residents. As with other private utilities, cable and satellite television providers generally can extend service to paying customers.

4.12.5.2 REGULATORY FRAMEWORK

STATE

The California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) is the primary State agency that regulates private utilities. These utilities include telecommunications, electricity, natural gas, water, railroad, rail transit, and passenger transportation companies. A primary role of the PUC is to authorize utility rate changes. also establishes service standards and safety rules, monitors the safety of utility and transportation operations, prosecutes unlawful marketing and billing activities, and oversees
the merger and restructure of utility corporations.

4.12.5.3 IMPACTS AND MITIGATION MEASURES

STANDARDS OF SIGNIFICANCE

Utilities impacts are considered to be significant if the following could result from the implementation of the proposed General Plan Update:

l. Result in the need for new facilities, or a substantial expansion or alteration to existing energy and communication systems, the construction of which would result in significant environmental effects.

2. Result in the need for new supplies of energy, the development or acquisition of which would result in significant environmental effects.

METHODOLOGY

Evaluation of potential impacts on electrical, natural gas and telephone services was based on review of public documents and research of the websites of the utilities.

IMPACT STATEMENTS AND MITIGATION MEASURES FOR THE GENERAL PLAN UPDATE

Energy Demand

Impact 4.12.5.1 Implementation of the proposed General Pian Update would increase the demand for electricity, natural gas and other energy sources. This is
considered a potentially significant impact.

Development under the proposed General Plan Update would increase the energy demand for residential Uses and to maintain commercial and industrial operations. In general, fee-based utilities and services would provide for the additional demand through the purchase of additional electricity and natural gas or development of its own power-generating facilities. Even during the 'rolling blackout" year of 2001, energy supply to the City was not affected significantly. The rolling blackouts resulted from a combination of circumstances that drastically affected the energy market in California, and was not the result of actual energy shortages. However, energy costs could increase in the future, due to circumstances both foreseen and
unforeseen. The increased population and business activity resulting from buildout of the proposed General Plan Update would result in increased demand for energy.
It is anticipated that, as development occurs under the proposed General Plan, PG&E would need to increase its electric power supply to serve the proposed project. PG&E provides power generated by a variety of sources, including hydrological, wind, fossil fuel, and nuclear. Potential environmental effects of obtaining more power through the development of power plants include, but are not limited to, air quality, biological resources, cultural resources (depending on location), hazardous materials, land use, noise and vibration, traffic, visual
resources, waste management, water and soil resources, and health hazards.

Proposed General Plan Policies and Implementing Actions that Mitigate Potential Impacts

Parks, Recreation and Resource Conservation Element

Policy PRC-11.1 The City shall seek to minimize energy impacts from new residential and commercial projects.
Implementing Action PRC-11.1.a: Development Review (similar to implementing Action PRC- 1.1.a - see Impact 4.12.1.1)
Implementation Action PRC-11.1.b: Public Awareness and Education
The City will provide information on available energy conservation techniques and products to the public and builders. Resources will include information on programs such as Pacific Gas and Electric's "Savings by Design" program for remodeling residences as a means of reducing energy demands and costs.
Implementation Action PRC-11.1.c: Tie 24 Building Codes
The City will require energy efficient siting and building design in all new development projects consistent with the requirements of Title 24 of the California Administrative Code. Measures include building orientation and shading, landscaping, use of active and passive solar heating and hot water systems, etc. The City will also investigate and consider adopting Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) sustainability standards for residential and commercial
development.

Policy PRC-11.2 The City shall utilize new, environmentally safe energy sources to the maximum extent feasible.

Impiementation Action PRC-11.2.a: Facilities Master Plan
As part of its Facilities Master Plan, the City will evaluate options for use of alternative energy systems when retrofitting or constructing new City facilities or when purchasing new equipment, provided they meet ail public, safety, health, and design requirements and are proven to be reliable.

implementation Action PRC-11.2.b: Capitai Improvement Program
The City will consider incorporating into its Capitai Improvement Program a green fleet that includes the City's purchase of fuel-efficient and alternative-fuel vehicies.

Policy PRC-11.1 seeks to reduce the amount of energy consumed by new residential and commercial projects, thereby reducing the amount of new energy that would need to be supplied. Implementing Action MFS-11.1.a would allow the City to evaluate the potential impacts of proposed development projects on energy supplies, and impose mitigation measures or conditions of approval if necessary. Implementing Action PRC-11.1.c calls for the enforcement of energy efficiency standards for building construction, as set forth by State building codes. It also would give the City the ability to adopt LEED standards, part of which promote building design and operation that lead to a greater level of energy efficiency than under typical building design and operation. Implementing Action PRC-11.1.b would promote greater public awareness of energy conservation and include programs that would lead to more energy- efficient structures. Policy 11.2 and Implementing Actions PRC-11.2.a and PRC-11.2.b would focus on facilities and operations of City government, encouraging the City to include energy efficiency measures in new facility construction and its operations. Implementation of the proposed General Plan policies and implementing actions would reduce potential energy demand, as well as provide alternative sources for energy. This also would reduce the need for additional power plants to generate energy, thereby reducing potential environmental impacts associated with their construction. Impacts after implementation would be less than significant.
Additional Mitigation Measures

None required.
Energy and Communication Infrastructure

Impact 4.12.5.2 Implementation of the proposed General Plan Update would require the extension of energy and communication infrastructure within the proposed Planning Area. This is considered a potentially significant impact.
Electrical service infrastructure extensions likely would be required to serve development accommodated under the proposed General Plan Update. These may include additional distribution lines, transmission lines, and substations. New substations would require new transmission lines, new transmission poles and other related distribution facilities. The extension of natural gas infrastructure may also be required to accommodate the development under the proposed General Plan Update. Natural gas infrastructure would be extended to proposed development when sufficient development to pay the costs for hooking into the locally available infrastructure is proposed. Typically, natural gas pipelines are located within road or utility rights-of-ways. Locating them within existing rights-of-way would eliminate potential

environmental impacts resulting from new trenches. Implementation of the proposed General Plan Update would also require the extension of telephone lines within currently undeveloped portions of the proposed Planning Area.
New developments generally provide the required infrastructure to connect to these systems, or provide easements within which the necessary infrastructure can be installed. In general, new utility lines can be installed with little problem. However, installation of new facilities could have potentially significant environmental impacts. Potential environmental effects for the construction of energy and communications lines and facilities include, but are not limited to:
Air pollutant emissions during construction (see Section 4.5, Air Quality).
Potential impacts on biological resources during construction, including wetlands, trees and special-status species and their habitats (see Section 4.8, Biological Resources).
Historic and prehistoric resources could be affected by the construction and maintenance of new facilities (see Section 4.9, Cultural Resources).
Use of hazardous materials and associated potential health hazards (see Section 4.6, Geology, Soils and Hazardous Materials).
Some agricultural land could be taken out of production where project conveyance facilities need to be located and to accommodate growth (see Section 4.1, Land Use and Agricultural Resources),
Noise and vibration during construction (see Section 4.4, Noise).
Local roads would experience traffic increases during construction (see Section 4.3, Transportation},

• New lines, substations and other energy or communications facilities could cause negative visual impacts (see Section 4.10, Aesthetics and Visual Resources).
New system infrastructure would likely cause growth-inducing impacts (see Section 8.0, Other Sections Required by CEQA).
Future energy and communications infrastructure projects would be reviewed for compliance with CEQA on a project-by-project basis.
Proposed General Plan Policies and Implementing Actions that Mitigate Potential Impacts

Policy MFS-6.1 The City shall provide for the review and comment on development proposals by utility companies, including review of the location of utilities.
implementing Action MFS-6.1.a: Development Review (see Implementing Action MFS 5.1.a).

Policy MFS-6.2: The City shall require the provision of necessary utility easements in all new developments.

Policies MFS-6.1 and MFS-6.2 would require greater City involvement in planning for the installation of utilities. However, Implementing Action MFS-5.1.a applies to schools, and does not explicitly address development review related to utilities. Therefore, the following mitigation measure shall be implemented.

Additional Mitigation Measures

MM 4.12.5.2 As part of the development review process, the City shall evaluate proposed public and private utility projects for potential environmental impacts. Utility projects shall be required to comply with the environmental protection measures provided throughout this MEIR and the General Plan that are applicable to development projects.
Implementation of the above mitigation measure would minimize or avoid potential utility infrastructure extension impacts on sensitive environmental resources. Impacts after mitigation would be less than significant.

5.1 COLUSA RIVERBEND

This section analyzes the potential environmental impacts of the Colusa Riverbend project. This section is intended to evaluate the environmental impacts of the Colusa Riverbend project to the greatest extent possible. This section addresses environmental impacts to the extent information is available and details of project are known. Environmental issues to be addressed through subsequent environmental review are identified, consistent with the requirements of CEQA Guidelines Section 15176(c).

5.1.1 EXISTING SETTING

PROJECT LOCATION

As described in Section 3.0, Project Description, Colusa Riverbend is a Specific Plan covering 442 acres. The approximate location of the project is north of Moon Bend Road and east of Bridge Street and SR 20/45, in the northeastern and eastern portions of the Planning Area. Portions of
the project site are within the existing City limits, but most of it is in unincorporated area. The City's intent for this planning area is that it be annexed to the City to be developed with low- and medium-density residential development.

The main access roads to the project site are Crommer Avenve, a two-lane rural roadway that becomes Clay Street upon entering the
City of Colusa, and Moon Bend Road, a two-
lane rural roadway that intersects SR 20/45 south of the Colusa city limits. D Street, Webster Street and Carson Street provide
access to the western site boundary. Dirt and gravel roads traverse portions of the project site, as do drainage channels. A levee is
located along the Sacramento River at the
northern and eastern site boundaries.

SURROUNDING USES

Existing residences are located along the western boundary of the site, along with an
abandoned concrete structure and rice driers operated by the River Bend rice mill. Tri County Petroleum is located at the eastern end of Crommer Avenue, just outside the project site. Farther down along the western boundary are the County Public Health and Welfare Office, the County Maintenance Yard and other County offices. A drainage channel parallels the western boundary of the project site, and has trees and other vegetation adjacent to it. A senior apartment complex is located at the end of Carson Street next to the project site. Beyond Carson Street to Moon Bend Road, land uses consist primarily of vacant land, with a church, apartment complex and industrial activities along SR 20/45. South of Moon Bend Road is vacant land and orchards, with a few rural residences. The Sacramento River forms the approximate northern and eastern boundaries of the project site. Beyond the river are agricultural lands, with
scattered rural residences.

City of Colusa Colusa General Plan July 2007 Draft Master Environmental Impact Report
5.1-1

5.1 COLUSA RIVERBEND

EXISTING CONDITIONS

The project site consists primarily of irrigated walnut and prune orchards, interspersed with rural residences and produce processing facilities. Vacant land exists in the area south of Carson Street. A fallow field and an abandoned residence and barn are located in the northern
portion of the site. A rural residence with barn structures is located along Moon Bend Road. A
pond is located on the site's western boundary, approximately halfway between Crommer Avenue and Moon Bend Road.

The topography of the project site and vicinity is moderately flat, with the Sacramento River to
the north and east of the project site. The site highest elevations are along the eastern portion of the property next to the Sacramento River and along the western portion of the properly. Topography ranges from approximately 45 feet above sea level to 55 feet above sea level.
CURRENT AND PROPOSED GENERAL PLAN LAND USE DESIGNATIONS

The majority of the project site is outside the City of Colusa's City Limits, but within the Sphere of Influence and located in Special Planning Area (SPA) #4. The City's current General Plan Diagram designation for the entire area east of City limits and within the project area is Vacant is and Low Density Residential (3-8 units per acre) The County's General Plan land use designation for the unincorporated area east of City limits and within SPA #4 is Rural Residential (1-acre minimum), and Industrial south to Moonbend Road. The proposed General Plan land use designations for SPA #4 includes Low Density Residential (3-8 units per acre) and Medium Density Residential (8-12 units per acre).

5.1.2 PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The Colusa Riverbend Specific Plan proposes a long-range plan for development of the entire 442 acre site (see Figure 5.1-1). This Specific Plan development includes 372.5 acres for Low Density Residential and 29.5 acres for Medium Density Residential. Based on a General Plan buildout assumption of mid-range density, maximum development for Low Density Residential would be 2,235 units (4 to 8 units/acre) and the maximum for Medium Density Residential would be 295 (8 to 12 units/acre), for 2,530 total units (Table 5.1-1). The project also proposes an elementary school site near the center of the site. Approximately 25 acres of the site would be dedicated to a system of parks and open space, with paseos connecting neighborhood parks a to a larger community park and open space area. Part of this community open space would be used as a detention area for storm water drainage.

5.1 COLUSA RIVERBEND

The project site would connect to Colusa City streets, including SR 20/45 (Bridge Street),Market Street, Clay Street, Fremont Street, and Moon Bend Road. Roundabouts are proposed for the residential collectors of the main streets on the project site (see Figure 5.1-2).
PROJECT BACKGROUND

Because the majority of the Specific Plan area is not within the City limits, the City may consider annexation of the twenty-seven parcels located between the existing City limits and the Specific Plan area (see Figures 3.3 and 3-4). The Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCo) is tasked with review and approval of the formation and logical extension of local agency boundaries and will review the City's request for annexation. Currently, the majority of these properties are located within Colusa County jurisdiction but all are included within the City of Colusa's Sphere of Influence.

PROJECT CHARACTERISTICS

The components of the Colusa Riverbend Specific Plan are described below. The project is expected to be developed in phases, with the 80 acres within the City limits proposed as Phase with a planned development permit prior to the City's consideration of the remainder of the Colusa Riverbend Specific Plan. programmatic level. This MEIR analyzes the Colusa Riverbend SPA at the

Financing Plan

The Colusa Riverbend Specific Plan will include a Public Facilities Financing Plan. This Financing Plan defines the specific mechanisms which will be required to fund the capital costs of all infrastructures necessary to accomplish the Colusa Riverbend Specific Plan buildout. The Financing Plan also defines funding for the maintenenace of new infrastruture and public services needed by future residents and businesses within the Specific Plan area.
Development Agreement
Concurrent with the approvai of the developments within the Colusa Riverbend Specific Plan area and for Phase Planned Developments, the City will enter into a development agreement(s) with the landowner(s) within the SPA. A development agreement sets forth the specific obligations of each property owner relating to the construction and financing of infrastructure; financial obligations relating to the construction and financing of infrastructure; financial contributions for infrastructure maintenance and public services; and other obligations which may be imposed by the City as a condition of development. A development agreement also provides the property owner with certain vested development rights. Development agreements are authorized by the California Government Code Section 65864 et. Sec. They are recorded and bind future property owners and the City to the terms of the agreement.
Tentative Map(s)
Concurrent with approval of the Colusa Riverbend project, the City will consider approval of a tentative parcel map for Phase I; and a large lot tentative map and/or tentative subsdivision map(s) for the remainder of the unincorporated specitic plan area. These maps will show arterial, boulevard, and collector street rights-of-way, open space corridors, parks and school sites, and the boundaries between different land use categories. The large lot tentative map(s) establish a framework for subsequent tentative subdivision maps which will define, in detail, the

City of Colusa Colusa General Plan

5.1 COLUSA RIVERBEND

local street, lottting patterns and other specific design features that conform to the Colusa Riverbend Specific Plan.

Design Guidelines and Development Standards
The Colusa Riverbend Specific Plan and Phase will include Design Guidelines and Development Standards. The guidelines will provide the framework to help ensure that the SPA will be a high quality, distinguishable community, which creates an attrative living environment and builds a chohesive statement of community and neighborhoods. The Design Guidelines will define key elements introduced and illustrated in the General Development Plan for Phase I and the Colusa Riverbend Specific Plan and they will outline criteria needed for implementation. The Development Standards provide the criteria for specitic site development for land uses within the Specific Plan area in place of the City of Colusa Zoning Code.

CIRCULATION PLAN

Roadway Access
The project street network will connect to existing roadways including a north-south collector, Darling Lane, and Moon Bend Road. Based on the location of the site and the street network, it is anticipated that the daily trips will be distributed roughly equally among these three street networks. The project is expected to add approximately 8,300 vehicles per day to the three collectors. This results in the anticipated volumes on these collectors of 11,000 vehicles per day or less when project traffic is added to traffic from other sources. The project is not expected to result in a collector street volume exceeding 11,000 vehicles per day, which is consistent with the is proposed General Plan.
Future Roadway Improvements
AS part of the Design Review process under Implementing Action CIR-1.1-b, the project would be required to dedicate adequate right-of-way for the circulation system shown on the Circulation Map of the General Plan. The Colusa 2025 General Pian identifies "Future Collector" streets in and around the project area as follows:
A north-south collector that will intersect SR-20/45 at Market Street, extend east past D Street, then curve to the south, past Moon Bend Road and terminate at the SR-30/45 intersection with Sunrise Boulevard.

Extension of Carson Street from the intersection of SR-20/45 to the north-south collector
noted above.

Moon Bend Road, from SR-20/45 to the north-south collector noted above.

D Street from Darling Lane to the north-south collector noted above.
The General Plan also identifies several intersections near the project area that will require improvement. These improvements are:

Bridge Street (SR-20/45) at Wescott Road: Improvements at this location are not specified.

SR-20/45 at Moon Bend Road: Signalization.

PUBLIC FACILITIES AND SERVICES

The following are the public utilities and public services required to serve the Colusa Riverbend Specific Plan area including sewer, water, and storm drainage. Public services include police and fire protection. The following are the public facilities and services that will serve the Colusa Riverbend project:
Domestic Water: Preliminary information shows that domestic water will be provided to the project site by connection to the City which would require the extension of existing City-owned water lines.

Sanitary Sewer: The project proposes sanitary sewer connection to the City of Colusa system at the County Health & Weifare Department upon annexation of the area to the District. Construction of a lift-station may be required for portions of the site, and potential construction of off-site infrastructure to connect to existing sewer infrastructure.
Storm Water: Preliminary information proposes that storm water will be directed and detained in a paseo/drainage corridor, located in the southern portion of the project site, and eventually discharged into the Sacramento River. Storm water must be maintained to the pre-development peak rate of discharge during all storm events to and including a 100-year event.
The City of Colusa Police Department will provide police protection services to the project once the area has been annexed into the City.
The City of Colusa Fire Department will provide fire protection services to the project once the area has been annexed into the City.

5.1.3 SUBSEQUENT CEQA REVIEW

ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW FOR PROJECT UNDER CEQA

This MEIR is intended to provide environmental analysis of the Colusa Riverbend Specific Plan to the maximum extent allowable, consistent with the requirements of CEQA Guidelines Section 15175. Therefore, subsequent review of the Colusa Riverbend project shall be subject to and limited by the provisions for review of subsequent projects previously described in a Master EIR set forth in CEQA Guidelines Sections 15177 and 15178.

AREAS OF INSUFFICIENT AVAILABLE INFORMATION REQUIRING FURTHER STUDY
CEQA Guidelines Section 15176 discusses the required contents of a Master EIR. Section 15176(c) requires that a description of potential impacts of anticipated projects for which there is not sufficient information reasonably available to support a full assessment of potential impacts be disclosed in an MEIR. Due to the preliminary nature of the Colusa Riverbend project, areas of insufficient information do exist which would require further analysis to determine the potential

5.1.4 IMPACTS AND MITIGATION MEASURES

LAND USE AND AGRICULTURE

The reader is referred to Section 4.1 of this MEIR for background information pertaining to the existing setting for land use for the proposed Planning Area which includes the Colusa Riverbend project.

Standards of Significance
Refer to Section 4.1 of this MEIR for a list of the standards of significance for land use and agriculture. All of these standards were evaluated for the proposed Colusa Riverbend project as to the potential impact levels the project may cause.
Methodology

Evaluation of potential land use impacts of the Colusa Riverbend project was based on review of planning documents pertaining to the City of Colusa, including the City of Colusa General Plan, City of Colusa Zoning Ordinance, a field review of the City and surrounding areas, and consultation with appropriate agencies. Potential impacts to the project area outside the City limits were based on review of planning documents relevant to those areas, including the Colusa County General Plan, consultation with appropriate agencies, and field review. The is analysis contained herein is based on buildout conditions for the General Pian, as described in Section 4.0.

The agricultural analysis utilized information from the California Department of Conservation Farmland Conversion Report 1998-2000, the California Department of Conservation Important Farmland Map of Colusa County, the Soil Survey of Coiusa County prepared by the NRCS in 2002, and the Summary of County Agricultural Commissioners' Reports, 2003-2004 by the National Agricultural Statistics Service. Based on this information, the analysis assessed the potential value of agricuitural lands in the Specific Plan Area, and utilized the project land uses to determine potential impacts.
The focus of this land use analysis is on physical environmental impacts that would result from the changes in land use requested for the project.
Specific impacts and project consistency issues associated with biological resources, hydrology and water quality, geology, visual resources, noise, traffic, public services, and utilities are addressed in the respective technical sections and the reader is referred to those sections for detailed analysis of other relevant environmental effects as a result of project development.
Impacts Dismissed from Further Discussion
The proposed project is considered to have either no impact or a less than significant impact under the following standards as discussed below and therefore these issues are not further discussed in this section.

1) Physical division of an established community - the project is located on the eastern border of the City of Colusa. There is urban development adjacent to the western border of the project site and open space/agricultural land on the south side. To the north and east of the project is the Sacramento River. The project site is not surrounded by an established community, but is adjacent to the downtown area to
City of Colusa Colusa General Plan July 2007 Draft Master Environmental Impact Report
5.1-9

5.1 COLUSA RIVERBEND

the west of the project site. Therefore, the Colusa Riverbend project will not divide a community and the project is considered to have no impact. Please refer to Impact 4.1.1 in Section 4.1 (Land Use and Agricultural Resources) for additional information.
2) Conflict with any applicable land use plan, policy or regulation of an agency with jurisdiction over the project (including, but not limited to, the general plan, specific plan, or zoning ordinance) adopted for the purpose of avoiding or mitigating an environmental effect the Colusa Riverbend project is in compliance with the proposed General Plan land use designations. The Zoning Ordnance is required to be update to comply with these land use designations. Therefore, the Colusa Riverbend project is in compliance with all applicable land use plans and considered to have no impact. Please refer to Impact 4.1.3 in Section 4.1 (Land Use and Agricultural Resources) for additional information.
3) Conflict with any applicable habitat conservation plan or natural community conservation plan. No applicable habitat conservation or natural community plans exist on the project site, therefore the Colusa Riverbend project is considered to have no impact. Please refer to Impact 4.1.4 in Section 4.1 (Land Use and Agricultural Resources) for additional information.
Standards of significance under which implementation of the project may result in a potential impact are discussed under the individual impact statements below.
Agricultural Land Conversion

Impact 5.1.1 The project would convert land from agricultural use to urban uses. This is considered a potentially significant impact.
The standard of significance for the conversion of farmland to urban uses has been established in CEQA Guidelines Appendix G as follows: the conversion of Prime Farmland, Unique Farmland, or Farmland of Statewide Importance as shown on the maps prepared pursuant to the Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Program of the California Resources Agency to non-agricultural use. This impact was evaluated for the proposed General Plan Update, which includes the Colusa Riverbend project, in Impact 4.1.5 in Section 4.1 (Land Use and Agricultural Resources), and concluded that because projects will remove Prime Farmland and Farmland of Local Importance from existing agricultural production without the assurance of replacement with like lands, it is considered signiticant and unavoidable.
The Important Farmland Map for Colusa County classifies the site as Prime Farmland (see Figure 4.1-1 in Land Use and Agricultural Resources (Section 4.1)). The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) categorizes farmland throughout the nation. One important factor used in the determination of farmland type by the USDA is the soil (along with growing season, and moisture supply). The soil on the project site is Vina loam, which is rated as an "Excellent" soil for irrigated crops by the Storie Index in the Soil Survey of Colusa County.
is The project site is currently being used for agricultural operations. Development of the project site into residential, open space and educational uses would remove this area from potential agricultural production and result in the permanent loss of 442 acres of prime or locally important farmland to urban development. This is considered a significant impact.

Colusa General Plan City of Colusa Draft Master Environmental Impact Report July 2007

5.1 COLUSA RIVERBEND

Applicable General Plan Policies and Implementing Actions
General Plan Policy LU-4.1 requires that the City shall support efforts to preserve existing agricultural land uses in areas outside the City's sphere of influence. The Implementing Action LU-4.1.b Public/Private Partnerships states that the City will work with Colusa County, nonprofit organizations and landowners to establish policies that will protect prime agricultural areas around the sphere of influence, including a process to implement techniques such as transfer of development rights, agricultural easements and farmland trusts.
General Plan Policy LU-5.1 states that development patterns shall tier off of existing development and avoid leap-frogging, including areas intended for annexation that are presently outside the city limits. The Implementing Action LU-5.4.a: Annexation Phasing Plan requires that the City will prepare and adopt an Annexation Phasing Plan to ensure a logical progression of annexations that meet the City's economic and planning needs and do not strain City services, resources, and infrastructure. The plan will also include criteria, consistent with the Cortese-Knox-Hertzberg Reorganization Act of 2000, that promote the preservation of open space and agricultural lands.
Mitigation Measures

MM 5.1.1 The project applicant shall mitigate for loss of Prime Farmiand, Farmland of Statewide Importance or Farmland of Local Importance by either (1) granting a farmland conservation easement to or for the benefit of the City and/or an entity approved by the City, at a 1:1 ratio for each acre developed, or (2) if the City adopts a farmland conservation program, by payment of an in lieu fee as established by the farmland conservation program, which shall be reviewed and adjusted periodically to ensure that the fee is adequate to offset the cost of purchasing farmland conservation easements at a 1:1 ratio.

Timing/Implementation: Prior to issuance of grading permits.
Enforcement/Monitoring: City of Colusa Planning Department.
Implementation of MM 5.1.1 would reduce the impact of the loss of important farmland by compensating for any loss due to development. However, because the project will remove Prime Farmland and Farmland of Local Importance from existing agricultural production without the assurance of replacement with like lands, the project would still result in the direct loss of Prime Farmland and Farmland of Local Importance. Therefore, this impact is considered significant and unavoidable.

Agricultural/Urban Interface

Impact 5.1.2 The project would result in the placement of urban uses adjacent to agricultural uses, creating potential conflicts. This is considered a potentially significant impact.
The standards of significance for this impact discussion are established in CEQA Guidelines Appendix G as follows: conflict with existing zoning for agricultural use, or a Williamson Act contract, and/or changes in the existing environment which, due to their location or nature, could result in conversion of farmland to non-agricultural use. This impact was evaluated for the proposed General Plan Update, which includes the Colusa Riverbend project, in Impact 4.1.3 in Section 4.1 (Land Use and Agricultural Resources), which identified mitigation for the impact

City of Colusa Colusa General Plan
July 2007 Draft Master Environmental Impact Report
5.1-11

5.1 COLUSA RIVERBEND

(MM 4.1.5) and concluded that implementation of proposed General Plan policies and implementing actions would reduce the impact to less than significant.
The project proposes the development of residential, educational and recreational uses at the eastern edge of the Colusa Sphere of Influence. The Colusa County General Plan designations adjacent to the project boundary include Agriculture-Transition (A-T) and Agriculture-General (A-G) to the south. The Sacramento River creates a natural boundary on the east and north side of the project area from the City's Planning Area and the land within the County. These areas east and north of the project boundary are designated by the County as Agriculture-General (A-G). To the west side of the project site is the city limits.
The project would place more urban development adjacent to agricultural operations to the south, which could create conflicts between these land uses. These conflicts have the potential to result in adjacent agricultural land conversion to a non-agricultural use.
There is property currently in a Williamson Act contract located on the opposite side of the Sacramento River, to the north of the Colusa Riverbend project site. The Sacramento River would adequately buffer Williamson Act lands to the north from conflicts with project uses, as the river would preclude trespass onto agricultural lands and would reduce the amount of noise and other potential nuisances that would carry to the project site from the Williamson Act lands.
Generally, residential Uses generate the most conflicts with agricultural operations. Agriculture/urban interface conflicts vary depending on the type of agricultural use, but generally include, although are not limited to, the following:
Inconveniences or discomforts associated with dust, smoke, noise, and odor from agricultural operations.
Restrictions on agricultural operations (such as pesticide application) along interfaces with urban uses.

Conflicts with farm equipment and vehicles using roadways.
Trespassing and vandalism on active farmlands.
Increased pressure to convert adjacent agricultural land to urban uses as a result of above-mentioned conflicts and increases in property values.
Applicable General Plan Policies and Implementing Actions
City of Colusa General Plan Policy L.U-2.1 requires that development projects are to be reviewed on a case-by-case basis to ensure adequate urban/agriculture buffers are included as part of project design. Implementing Action LU-2.1.a requires the mitigation of significant urban/agriculture conflicts be included as conditions of approval. Policy PRC-8.1 requires the City to evaluate the impacts of a development project on agricultural operations, specifically projects adjacent to agricultural lands and to take measures to reduce conflicts with those lands. This is to be implemented through the development review process described in implementing Actions LU-2.1.b and PRC-8.1.a, including provision of a buffer between new development and agricultural uses and notification of the County's right-to-farm ordinance. Mitigation measures are identified below to require an urban/agriculture buffer and notification of adjacent farming activities.

Colusa General Plan City of Colusa Draft Master Environmental Impact Report July 2007

5.1 COLUSA RIVERBEND

Mitigation Measures

MM 5.1.2a An urban/agriculture buffer between existing agriculture and proposed project development along the southern boundaries of the project shall be included as a part of project design and shown on the tentative map and improvement plans. The urban/agriculture buffer area shall separate existing agricultural uses and future project development and shall be a minimum of 250 feet in width or, based on the specific proposed uses, a width acceptable to the City that provides an adequate transition between the proposed uses and the adjacent agricultural uses. The buffer may include roadways, most non-residential land uses (i.e., non-sensitive receptors), park land, and open space.
Prior to approval of the final map, the project applicant shall identify and implement a financing mechanism to fund maintenance of the buffer.
Timing/Implementation: Buffer shall be shown on the tentative map and improvement plans and a financing mechanism entered into prior to final map approvai. The buffer shall be maintained as long as agricultural uses remain adjacent to the project
Enforcement/Monitoring: City of Colusa Planning Department

MM 5.1.2b Concurrent with recordation of the Final Map, the project applicant shall cause to be recorded a disclosure to potential buyers of the dwelling units of the adjacent agriculture uses. This disclosure shall be in a form acceptable to the City and generally consistent with those required under Colusa County's Right to Farm Ordinance.

Timing/Implementation: Disciosure statement to be reviewed and approved by the City prior to tentative map approval and shail be recorded concurrently with the Final Map
Enforcement/Monitoring: City of Colusa Planning Department
Implementation of the mitigation measures MM 5.1.2a and MM 5.1.2b, would provide a buffer between proposed project development and adjoining agricultural uses, reducing potential odor, noise, and nuisance conflicts and would also ensure that future buyers within the proposed project are notified of the adjacent agricultural uses. Implementation of these mitigation
measures uld reduce agriculture/urban interface conflicts to less than significant.
POPULATION, HOUSING AND EMPLOYMENT
The reader is referred is to Section 4.2 of this MEIR for background information pertaining to the existing setting for population, housing and employment for the City of Colusa.

City of Colusa Colusa General Plan July 2007 Draft Master Environmental Impact Report 5.1-13

5.1 COLUSA RIVERBEND

Standards of Significance
Section 4.2 of the MEIR identifies the standard of significance for population and housing. All of these standards were evaluated for the Colusa Riverbend project as to the potential impact levels the project may cause.

Methodology

City staff conducted research on demographic and housing conditions, utilizing existing documents and other information sources. Information was obtained from governmental agencies through their websites. Among these agencies were the U.S. Bureau of the Census, the California Department of Finance, and the California Employment Development Department. The recently adopted City of Colusa Housing Element was an additional source of information on housing and socioeconomic conditions as weli as housing policies.
Impacts Dismissed from Further Discussion
The project is considered to have either no impact or a less than significant impact on the following standards based on reasoning listed and therefore are not further analyzed in this EIR for the Colusa Riverbend project.

1) Displacement of substantial numbers of existing housing, necessitating the construction of replacement housing elsewhere - The Colusa Riverbend project site does have existing rural residential housing which would be removed with development of the project. However, there are few residential units on the site and some are vacant or abandoned. The proposed project would provide more housing than would be removed and would not require construction of replacement housing. Therefore the project would have no impact. Please refer to Impact 4.2.3 in Section 4.2 (Population, Housing, and Employment) for additional information.
2) Displacement of substantial numbers of people, necessitating the construction of replacement housing elsewhere - The Colusa Riverbend project site would remove some rural residencies, not all of which are occupied. While some people may move as a result of the project developer purchasing the site and developing the land, there would not be displacement of substantial numbers of people and the project would provide more housing than would be removed. Therefore the project would have a less than significant impact. Please refer to Impact 4.2.3 in Section 4.2 (Population, Housing, and Employment) for additional information.
Standards of significance that were found to result in a potential impact are discussed under the individual impact statements.

Population and Housing Growth

Impact 5.1.3 Development of the project has the potential to result in a substantial increase in population and the number of housing units, with its attendant environmental impacts. This is considered a potentially signiticant impact.
The standard of significance for the introduction of a substantial number of people into an area has been established in CEQA Guidelines Appendix G as follows: a project will introduce substantial growth or concentration of population in an area either directly or indirectly (e.g., through projects in an undeveloped area or extension of major infrastructure) that results in a

physical effect on the environment. This impact was evaluated for the proposed General Plan Update area in Impact 4.2.1 in Section 4.2 (Population, Housing, and Employment), which identifies that population and housing growth and the attendant environmental impacts would result in a significant and unavoidable impact.
The Colusa Riverbend project includes the potential development of 2,530 total housing units. Based on housing densities identified by the California Department of Finance of 2.85 persons per household, the projected resident population would be 7,210. This is an increase of 126.7 percent over he estimated existing City population of 5,6891.
Although portions of this project are not currently within the City of Colusa, the project is located entirely within the Sphere of Influence and corresponding Planning Area as identified within the General Plan. The Land Use Diagram is used as the "blueprint" to guide future housing development in the portion of the Planning Area that is outside the City limits. It is anticipated that future development projects in the unincorporated portion of the Planning Area would annex to the City prior to development. In these circumstances, the policies and programs of the City of Colusa Housing Element would apply. Based on the land use designations in the General Plan, the General Plan Policies and Implementing Actions, and the 2004 Housing Element, this project is consistent with these goals and policies.
A substantial increase in population has the potential to impact a variety of services and utilities in the area. These impacts are discussed in the Community Services and Public Services and Utilities Sections of this chapter.
The Colusa Riverbend project is consistent with the General Plan Land Use Diagram and therefore considered in the future population projections for the City. The Colusa Riverbend development would be consistent with development analyzed under Impact 4.2.1 associated with the General Plan Update and would not contribute to any additional environmental effects beyond those disclosed under Impact 4.2.1; therefore, at the project level this impact would be less than significant.

Applicable General Plan Policies and Implementing Actions
The Land Use Element policies LU-1.1, LU-5.1, LU-5.2, LU-5.3, LU-5.4, LU-6.3, LU-6.4, LU-8.2, and LU- 9.2 and implementing actions LU-2.1.c, and LU-9.2.a seek to direct housing development in a manner that provides sufficient housing for the anticipated population, while reducing some of the adverse environmental impacts such as conflicts with agricultural operations, inadequate service systems, and loss or alteration of historic homes and areas.
Mitigation Measures

None Required.

TRANSPORTATION AND CIRCULATION

The reader is referred to Section 4.3 of this MEIR for background information pertaining to the existing setting for traffic and circulation for the City of Colusa.

City of Colusa Colusa General Plan July 2007 Draft Master Environmental Impact Report 5.1-15

5.1 COLUSA RIVERBEND

Standards of Significance
Section 4.3 of the MEIR identifies the standard of significance for transportation and circulation. All of these standards were evaluated for the Colusa Riverbend project as to the potential impact levels the project may cause.

Methodology
Generally, the methodology for analyzing the potential traffic and roadway impacts that a large project may have is the availability of a project specific traffic study. As part of the Design Review process under Implementing Action CIR-1.1-b, the project would be required to dedicate adequate right-of-way for the circulation system shown on the Circulation Map of the General Plan. The traffic study would identify the potential project specific traffic and roadway impacts. As a traffic study has not been completed for the Colusa Riverbend project at this time, project specific impacts and mitigation measures cannot be determined. Therefore, the methodology to determine the traffic and roadway impacts from the Colusa Riverbend project to analyze the General Plan Circulation Element, the project's proposed interaction with the existing roadway system, the City Level of Service standards and the potential for General Plan policies and implementing actions to mitigate the Colusa Riverbend project potential impacts.
Impacts Dismissed from Further Discussion

The proposed project is considered to have either no impact or a less than significant impact on following standards based on reasoning listed and therefore are not further analyzed in this EIR for the Colusa Riverbend project.
1) Changes in air traffic patterns, including either an increase in traffic levels or a change in location that results in substantial safety risks the Colusa Riverbend project is considered to have a less than significant impact because it would not necessitate changes in operations nor would require expansion of the Colusa County Airport and the project would not interfere with air traffic patterns. Please refer to Impact 4.3.9 in Section 4.3 (Transportation and Circulation) for additional information.

Because project specific traffic and circulation information is not available for the project, further analysis of project traffic impacts cannot be competed at this time. The reader is referred to Table 5.1.2 which identifies areas requiring additional information to complete a thorough environmental analysis.

NOISE

The reader is referred to Section 4.4 of this MEIR for background information pertaining to the existing setting for noise for the City of Colusa.
Standards of Significance
Section 4.4 of the MEIR identifies the standard of significance for noise. All of these standards were evaluated for the Colusa Riverbend project as to the potential impact levels the project may cause.

Colusa General Plan City of Colusa Draft Master Environmental Impact Report July 2007
5.1-16

5.1 COLUSA RIVERBEND

Methodology

Project specitic potential noise impacts were determined using a combination of the General Plan Noise Element and Section 4.4 of the General Plan MEIR, and application of accepted noise prediction and sound propagation algorithms. A site specific noise study was not completed for the Colusa Riverbend project. Therefore, project specific noise impacts could not be fully evaluated.

Impacts Dismissed from Further Discussion
The project is considered to have either no impact or a less than significant impact on following standards based on reasoning listed and therefore are not further analyzed in this EIR for the Colusa Riverbend project.
1) Exposure of persons to, or generation of, excessive groundborne vibration or groundborne noise levels - the Colusa Riverbend project is not located near a source of groundborne vibration, such as a railroad, and therefore is expected to have no impact.

2) For a project within the vicinity of a private airstrip, exposure of people residing or working in the project area to excessive noise levels - there are no private airstrips within the project vicinity, therefore the Colusa Riverbend project is considered iS to have no impact.
Because a project specific noise survey was not completed for the project, further analysis of project noise impacts cannot be completed at this time. The reader is referred to Table 5.1.2 which identifies areas requiring additional information to complete a thorough environmental analysis.

AIR QUALITY
The is reader is referred to Section 4.5 of this MEIR for background information pertaining to the existing setting for air quality for the City of Colusa.
Standards of Significance
Section 4.5 of the MEIR identifies the standard of significance for air quality. All of these standards were evaluated for the proposed Colusa Riverbend project as to the potential impact levels the project may cause.

Methodology
Estimates of regional emissions generated by project traffic and other sources can be identified by air emissions software programs such as URBEMIS-2002, EMFAC2007, or CALINE4. Because the Colusa Riverbend project does not provide adequate information regarding project specific uses, mainly due to the preliminary nature of the project, a project specific air emissions evaluation cannot be completed at this time.

5.1 COLUSA RIVERBEND

Impacts Dismissed from Further Discussion
The proposed project is considered to have either no impact or a less than significant impact on following standards based on reasoning listed and therefore are not further analyzed in this EIR for the Colusa Riverbend project.
1) Create objectionable odors affecting a substantial number of people - the Colusa Riverbend project consists of residential, educational and recreational uses. Uses of
this type are generally not considered to cause objectionable orders. During construction various diesel-powered vehicles and equipment in use on the site would create odors. These sources are mobile and transient in nature, and the emission occurs at a substantial distance from nearby receptors (which provides for dilution of odor-producing constituents). These odors would be temporary and unlikely to be noticeable beyond the project boundaries. Therefore the project is expected to have a less than significant impact. Please refer to Impact 4.5.3 in Section 4.5 (Air Quality) for additional information.
Because a project specific air emissions analysis was not completed for the project, further determination of project air quality impacts cannot be competed at this time. The reader is referred to Table 5.1.2 which identifies areas requiring additional information to complete a thorough environmental analysis.

GEOLOGY, SEISMICITY, SOILS AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
The reader is referred to Section 4.6 of this MEIR for background information pertaining to the existing setting for geology, seismicity, soils and hazardous materials for the City of Colusa.

Standards of Significance
Section 4.6 of the MEIR identifies the standard of significance for geology, seismicity, soils, and hazardous materials. All of these standards were evaluated for the Colusa Riverbend project as to the potential impact levels the project may cause.

Methodology
This analysis of hazards, human health and risk of upset included the review of existing documentation, field review of the project area and consultation with applicable local, state, and federal agencies. Documentation included a quarterly report on leaking underground storage tank sites by the Central Valley RWQCB, and a review of hazardous material site information on the website of the California Department of Toxic Substances Control.
Impacts Dismissed from Further Discussion
The project is considered to have either no impact or a less than significant impact on following standards based on reasoning listed and therefore are not further analyzed in this EIR for the Colusa Riverbend project.

1) Exposure of people or structures to potential substantial adverse effects, including the risk of loss, injury or death, involving:

Colusa General Plan City of Colusa
Draft Master Environmental Impact Report July 2007
5.1-18

5.1 COLUSA RIVERBEND

Rupture of a known earthquake fault, as delineated on the most recent Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Map issued by the State Geologist for the area or based on other substantial evidence of a known fault;
i. Strong seismic ground shaking;

ii. Seismic-related ground failure, including liquefaction; and

iv. Landslides.

As identified in the General Plan Safety Element, no active or potentiaily active faults underlie the City of Colusa, based on published geologic maps. Surface evidence of faulting has not been observed. However, the City of Colusa may experience ground shaking from earthquakes outside the area. Still, the best geologic evidence indicates that Colusa would experience only low-intensity shaking from faults outside the County. Additionally, all buildings constructed would be required to comply with the City's construction seismic standards.
Based upon known soil, groundwater, and ground shaking conditions within the Planning Area, the potential for liquefaction beneath the Planning Area is considered low. The potential for ground lurching, differential settlement, or lateral spreading occurring during or after seismic events in the Planning Area is also considered low. The project site is relatively flat, is no landslides would occur. Please refer to Impact 4.6.3 in Section 4.6 (Geology, Soils, and Hazardous Materials) for additional information.
2) Substantial soil erosion or the loss of topsoil - the Colusa Riverbend project is not expected to result in impacts to soil erosion of the loss on topsoil with implementation of existing regulations, General Plan policies and implementing actions as discussed under Impact 4.6.1 in Section 4.6 (Geology, Soils, and Hazardous Materials).
3) Location of development on soils incapable of adequately supporting the use of septic tanks or alternative wastewater disposal systems, where sewers are not available for the disposal of wastewater. The Colusa Riverbend project would not use septic tanks as it will be required to connect to the City's wastewater system.

4) For a project within the vicinity of a private airstrip, a safety hazard for people residing or working in the project area - there are no private airstrips in the Colusa Riverbend project area; therefore there will be no impact.
5) Exposure of people or structures to a significant risk of loss, injury or death involving wildland fires, including where wildlands are adjacent to urbanized areas or where residences are intermixed with wildlands - the Colusa Riverbend project is located adjacent to the downtown area of the City and will be annexed and City fire department services will be provided to the project area. Therefore, this is not expected to have an impact.
6) a Creation of a significant hazard to the public or the environment through the routine transport, use, or disposal of hazardous materials - the Colusa Riverbend project will result in residential, educational and recreational uses; these are uses that are not associated with transport or use of large quantities of hazardous materials. Therefore, this project is not expected to have an impact. Please refer to Impact 4.6.4 in Section 4.6 (Geology, Soils, and Hazardous Materials) for additional information.

7) Result in the loss of availability of a known mineral resource that would be of value to the region and residents of the state. Neither the City's existing General Plan nor the County's General Plan identifies any mineral resources in the proposed Planning Area, including the project site.

8) Result in the loss of availability of a locally-important mineral resource recovery site delineated on a local general plan, specific plan or other land use plan. Neither the City's existing General Plan nor the County's General Plan identifies any mineral resources in the proposed Planning Area.

Standards of significance that were found to result in a potential impact are discussed under the
individual impact statements.

Expansive Soils

Impact 5.1.4 The project proposes construction on soils that are considered expansive. This is a potentially signiticant impact.

The standard of significance for geology, soils and hazardous materials impacts has been
established in CEQA Guidelines Appendix G as follows: location of development on expansive
soil, as defined in Table 18-1-B of the Uniform Building Code (1994), creating substantial risks to life or property. This impact was evaluated for the proposed General Plan Update area in Impact 4.6.1 in Section 4.6 (Geology, Seismicity, Soils, and Hazardous Materials).

Raney Geotechnical Inc. conducted a preliminary geotechnical investigation in August 2004 of the portion of the project site north of Crommer Avenue. The investigation report indicated that the near-surface soils generally were sandy silty clays of low-to-moderate plasticity. These soils
are considered capable of significant expansion and contraction with variations in moisture. This could have an adverse impact on building floor slabs, foundations and flatwork, unless measures
are taken to mitigate soil expansiveness. Moreover, the Raney report identified potential seepage of groundwater to the surface, particularly during high river stage (see Hydrology and
Water Quality discussion below). ENGEO Consulting, Inc. prepared a preliminary geotechnical report in May 2006 that covered most of the project site south of Crommer Avenue. The ENGEO report did not identify expansive soils as a significant issue in this area. Based on the findings of the Raney Geotechnical Inc. investigation, soils have been identified in the project area that have a significant expansion and contraction potential due to variations in moisture. Therefore, Mitigation Measure 5.1.4 is proposed to minimize or eliminate this expansive soil hazard.
Applicable General Plan Policies and Implementing Actions

Policy SAF-1.1 requires that the City shall continue to mitigate the potential impacts of seismic and geologic hazards through Implementing Action SAF-1.1.a, Development Review, SAF-1.1.b, Subdivision Ordinance Review and SAF-1.1.c, Un-reinforced Masonry Plan. Additionally, Policy SAF-1.2 requires the City will continue to maintain current information on seismic hazards and to take appropriate action upon discovery of significant seismic hazards. The associated implementing Action SAF-1.2.a requires monitoring of California Geological Survey studies for potentially active faults in the vicinity of Colusa.

Mitigation Measure

MM 5.1.4 Prior to tentative map approval, the project applicant shall submit a plan
describing measures to minimize or eliminate the identified expansive soil

hazard. Measures may include, but are not limited to, increasing foundation depths, reinforcement, and saturation/preswelling of soils prior to slab placement. The plan shall be reviewed and approved by the City Engineer.
Timing/Implementation: Prior to tentative map approval.
Enforcement/Monitoring: City of Colusa Planning Department.
Implementation of the above mitigation measure would reduce or eliminate potential expansive soil problems. Impacts after mitigation would be less than significant.
Liquefaction of Soils

Impact 5.1.5 The project site may contain soils that have the potential for liquefaction. This is considered a potentially significant impact.
The standard of significance for geology, soils and hazardous materials impacts has been established in CEQA Guidelines Appendix G as follows: would the project be located on a geologic unit or soils that is unstable, or that would become unstable as a result of the project, and potentially result in on- or off-site landslide, lateral spreading, subsidence, liquefaction or collapse. This impact was evaluated for the proposed General Plan Update area in Impact 4.6.3 in Section 4.6 (Geology, Seismicity, Soils, and Hazardous Materials).
Liquefaction is the loss of soil strength due to seismic forces generating various types of ground failure. The potential for liquefaction must account for soil types and density, the groundwater table, and the duration and intensity of ground shaking.
ENGEO Incorporated conducted a Preliminary Geotechnical Report on 162 acre portion of the project site. This area included lands south of E Clay Street, east of D Street to the levee of the Sacramento River, and north of Moon Bend Road. This Report identified the presence of relatively loose sandy silt below the groundwater table in one of the soil borings. In general, loose granular soil below the groundwater table combined with the potential for moderate seismic shaking is an indication of liquefaction potential. However, due to the preliminary nature of the Report, an accurate estimate of liquefaction potential could not be determined.

Applicable General Plan Policies and Implementing Actions

Policy SAF-1.1 would establish as City policy the mitigation of geologic impacts, including those associated with soils. Implementing Action SAF-1.1.a would require identification of potential geologic hazards during the development review process and require mitigation if necessary. Implementing Action SAF-1.1.b would amend the Subdivision Ordinance to include requirements related to geologic hazards. Additionally, Policy SAF-1.2 requires the City will continue to maintain current information on seismic hazards and to take appropriate action upon discovery of significant seismic hazards. The associated Implementing Action SAF-1.2.a requires monitoring of California Geological Survey studies for potentially active faults in the vicinity of Colusa.

Mitigation Measures

MM 5.1.5 Prior to tentative map approval, the project applicant shall submit a liquefaction evaluation, which will be incorporated in the design level geotechnical study, to determine if liquefaction could potentially affect the

site development. The plan shall be reviewed and approved by the City
Engineer.

Timing/Implementation: Prior to tentative map approval.
Enforcement/Monitoring: City of Colusa Planning Department.
Implementation of the above mitigation measure would reduce or eliminate potential liquefaction problems. Impacts after mitigation would be less than significant.
Contamination of Project Site

Impact 5.1.6 The project would encourage development on lands that may have been contaminated from past activities. This is a potentially significant impact.
The standard of significance for geology, soils and hazardous materials impacts has been established in CEQA Guidelines Appendix G as follows: would the project be developed on a site which is included on a list of hazardous materials sites compiled pursuant to Government Code Section 65962.5 and, as a result, would it create a a significant hazard to the public or the environment. This impact was evaluated for the proposed General Plan Update area in Impact 4.6.7 in Section 4.6 (Geology, Seismicity, Soils, and Hazardous Materials).
The project proposes development on land that has been used historically for agricultural activities. Typically, such operations have used chemicals such as pesticides, herbicides and fertilizers. Over time, these substances may have accumulated in the soil of these agricultural sites to a level that may present a potential health hazard to construction workers and to future residents on the project site. In addition, it is reported that the former Union Oil depot with tank
farm was located along the eastern boundary of the project site. Leaks from tanks and other
facilities could have contaminated soil on the site.

ENGEO Incorporated conducted a Phase II Environmental Site Assessment of the Riverbend
Estates property above Crommer Avenue in June 2004. The Phase II Assessment made the
following findings:

Historic uses of the Riverbend Estates site consisted of the production of prunes and oats. A common pesticide used on prunes through 1970 was lead arsenate. Both lead and arsenic are highly persistent and immobile in soil. A subsequent Phase Environmental Site Assessment, including soil sampling, indicated that lead levels were below the 2002
EPA Region IX Preliminary Remediation Goal for residential development of 150 milligrams per kilogram of soil. Sampling identified two points of elevated arsenic concentrations, but further testing revealed that arsenic levels on the site were within the general range of expected background leveis. Onsite organochlorine pesticide levels were below
laboratory reporting levels. Therefore, the property does not appear to have been significantly impacted as a result of past agricultural use. Additional sampling and analysis is not recommended. However, if the planned development of the property changes to include sensitive uses such as a school, a Preliminary Endangerment Assessment would be required.
Structures located within the Riverbend Estates site were built during a time when lead- based paints and asbestos-containing building material may have been used.

There are two septic systems and three wells reportedly located within the Riverbend
Estates site.

A concrete underground fuel storage tank is located within the southwest corner of the
barn. The tank was used for crude oil storage to fuel the older of the two fruit driers on
the Riverbend Estates site.

A check of the area along the eastern boundary of the Riverbend Estates site, adjacent to the former Union Oil Depot site, revealed no surface soil staining, dead/distressed vegetation, or odors. A view of the former depot site and its publicly accessible area led to the same observations. Interviews with Unocal and with governmental agencies
indicated no record of incidents or complaints.

ENGEO Incorporated also conducted a Phase II Environmental Site Assessment in February 2006 of properties in the southern portion of the project site. The properties included two parcels adjacent to and north of Moon Bend Road (the Moon Bend Property), and one parcel adjacent to and south of Crommer Avenue (the Crommer Property). This assessment made the following
findings:

The Tri Counties Petroleum facility north of the Crommer Property contains aboveground storage tanks and monitoring wells. This facility is known to have leaked petroleum hydrocarbons into groundwater and to have contaminated soil. Based on data obtained from the Geotracker database maintained by the Central Valley RWQCB, the assessment concluded that groundwater quality beneath the Crommer Property has not been impaired by contamination associated with the Tri Counties Petroleum site.
Research conducted on the former Union Oil Depot site (now a dairy facility) found no record of hydrocarbon releases from aboveground storage tanks located on the site.
On a half-acre portion of the Moon Bend Property, there is a burn area with a significant amount of burned wood, metal, plastic, soil and household items. The burn area also contained approximately three cubic yards of soil from another property that had been contaminated by petroleum hydrocarbons from a leaking underground storage tank.
Hydraulic containers, six steel 55-gallon drums and other debris were found at locations
around structures on the Moon Bend Property.

A residential well located on the Moon Bend Property is located within 100 feet of a
septic tank. California water well standards require that water supply wells be separated
from septic tanks by at least 150 feet.

The presence of potentially lead- and asbestos- containing materials, an underground storage
tank, contaminated soils, debris and the residential well proximate to a septic tank are conditions that could result in the potential exposure to hazards or hazardous materiais as a result of development of the project site.
Applicable General Plan Policies and Implementing Actions
The General Plan update has no policies addressing hazardous material site impacts, or impacts related to hazardous materials on agricultural lands.

Impacts after mitigation would be less than significant.

HYDROLOGY AND WATER QUALITY

The reader is referred to Section 4.7 of this MEIR for background information pertaining to the existing setting for hydrology and water quality for the City of Colusa.
Standards of Significance

Section 4.7 of the MEIR identifies the standard of significance for hydrology and water quality. All of these standards were evaluated for the Colusa Riverbend project as to the potential impact levels the project may cause.

Methodology

This analysis is based on a review of City documents, including the City of Colusa Subdivision
Standards Resolution, along with meetings and discussions with City staff. The analysis reviewed U.S. Geological Survey topographic maps and aerial photographs, and considered various comments from letters received in response to the Notice of Preparation for this MEIR. Data from the Western Regional Climate Center (WRCC) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) provided background information on the local climate. Information on flooding came from FEMA maps covering the Planning Area and FEMA's Flood insurance Study for Colusa County, California and Incorporated Areas.

5.1 COLUSA RIVERBEND

Impacts Dismissed from Further Discussion

The project is considered to have either no impact or a less than significant impact on following standards based on reasoning listed and therefore are not further analyzed in this EIR for the Colusa Riverbend project.
1) Substantial depletion of groundwater supplies or substantial interference with groundwater recharge such that there would be a net deficit in aquifer volume or a lowering of the local groundwater table level (e.g., the production rate of pre- existing nearby welis would drop to a level which would not support existing land uses or planned uses for which permits have been granted) - the Colusa Riverbend project proposes to use groundwater sources. However, it is anticipated that there is ample groundwater resources available, studies have indicated that groundwater in the vicinity is between 5 to 10 feet below the ground surface (ENGEO, 2006). Please refer to Impact 4.7.5 in Section 4.7 (Hydrology and Water Quality) for additional information.

2) Placement of housing within a 100-year flood hazard area as mapped on a Federal Flood Hazard Boundary or Flood Insurance Rate Map or other flood hazard delineation map - the Colusa Riverbend project is within a Zone X which designates areas subject to flooding during a 500-year storm event or areas that are protected by levees from flooding during a 100-year storm event. Therefore, flooding hazards for this project is considered a less than significant impact. Please refer to Impact
4.7.4 in Section 4.7 (Hydrology and Water Quality) for additional information.
3) Placement within a 100-year fiood hazard area structures which would impede or redirect flood flows - the Colusa Riverbend project site is adjacent to the Sacramento River; however, it is not located within a designated flood zone and would not create structures that would impede or redirect flood flows. Also, see discussion above
under #2. Please refer to Impact 4.7.4 and Impact 4.7.2 in Section 4.7 (Hydrology and Water Quality) for additional information.
4 Exposure of people or structures to a significant risk of loss, injury or death involving flooding, including flooding as a result of the failure of a levee or dam - the Colusa Riverbend project is within the influence of five reservoirs, which retain water from the Sacramento River or its tributaries, which could cause damage in the City of Colusa if their dams were to fail: Lake Oroville, Shasta Lake, Whiskeytown Lake, Black Butte Lake, and East Park Reservoir. However, the probability of dam failure at any given
time is very remote and is considered less than significant. Please refer to Impact 4.7.4 in Section 4.7 (Hydrology and Water Quality) for additional information.
5) Inundation by seiche, tsunami, or mudflow - the Colusa Riverbend project will not be impacted by seiche, tsunami or mudflow due to the relatively flat location, underlying and surrounding soils, it's distance from an ocean or large body of water, and lack of nearby volcanoes.
Because a project specific drainage report was not completed for the project, further determination of project potential impacts to water quality, drainage patterns or drainage system cannot be competed at this time. The reader is referred to Table 5.1.2 which identifies areas requiring additional information for subsequent environmental analysis.

BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES

The reader is referred to Section 4.8 of this MEIR for background information pertaining to the existing setting for biological resources for the City of Colusa.

Standards of Significance
Section 4.8 ol the MEIR identifies the standard of significance for biological resources. All of these standards were evaluated for the Colusa Riverbend project as to the potential impact levels the project may cause.

Methodology

Available information pertaining to the natural resources of the City and the Specific Pian Area was reviewed. ECORP Consulting, Inc. completed a Preliminary Wetland and Special-Status Species Assessment for River Bend Estates on October 12, 2006. A PMC biologist conducted reconnaissance-level fieldwork in January and February 2006. Field reconnaissance included general plant and wildlife surveys and general habitat assessments. Surveys of the entire General Plan Planning Area were not completed due to the size of the project boundaries and the scope of this analysis. The limited fieldwork allowed for general verification of the vegetation communities and sensitive habitats present within the Planning Area.
Because only preliminary biological resources surveys were completed for the project, further determination of potential impacts to special-status species, tree loss and potential interference with a migratory corridor or nursery sites cannot be competed at this time. The reader is referred to Table 5.1.2 which identifies areas requiring additional information for subsequent environmental analysis.
Impacts Dismissed from Further Discussion
The project is considered to have either no impact or a less than significant impact on following standards based on reasoning listed and therefore are not further analyzed in this EIR for the Colusa Riverbend project.

1) Conflicts with the provisions of an adopted Habitat Conservation Plan, Natural Community Conservation Plan, or other approved local. regional or state habitat conservation plan - the Colusa Riverbend project would have no impact because there is no adopted Habitat Conservation Plan, Natural Community Conservation Plan, or other approved local, regional or state habitat conservation plan. Please refer to Impact 4.8.7 in Section 4.8 (Biological Resources) for additional information.
Standards of significance that were found to result in a potential impact are discussed under the individual impact statements.

Wetlands and Other Waters of the U.S.

Impact 5.1.7 Development of the proposed project may affect wetlands and other waters of the U.S., including those regulated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. This is considered a less than signiticant impact.
The standard of significance for biological resource impacts into an area has been established in CEQA Guidelines Appendix G as follows: will the project have a substantial adverse effect on

federally protected wetlands as defined by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (including, but not limited to, marsh, vernal pool, coastal, etc.) through direct removal, filling, hydrological interruption, or other means. This impact was evaluated for the proposed General Plan Update area in Impact 4.8.4 in Section 4.8 (Biological Resources).

ECORP Consulting, Inc. prepared a preliminary wetland assessment of the project site in October
2006. The assessment identified approximately 2.99 acres of riparian wetlands along the Sacramento River within the assessment area. Other identified potential "waters of the United States" include the pond (2.81 acres) and a drainage ditch in the center of the site (0.19 acres). Future development could physically affect these waters, which are potentially subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps). Under Section 404 of the federal Clean Water Act, the Corps must authorize any fill or dredge activities expected to affect wetlands under its jurisdiction. It should be noted that the ECORP assessment did not include a formal delineation of wetlands and other waters of the U.S. While some of the wetland features may be retained, such as the potential use of the pond as a detention basin, this impact analysis anticipates that all of the wetland features may be disturbed during project construction or development.
Applicable General Plan Policies and Implementing Actions
City of Colusa General Plan Policy PRC-1.1 ensures that the development process respects the unique characteristics and functions of sensitive local resources. The preferred treatment is first avoidance, second - onsite restoration, third - in-kind replacement, and fourth - impact fees. Sensitive local resources include wetlands, riparian corridors, floodplains, and woodlands. Implementing Action PRC-1.1a states that through the development review process, the City will use the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) process to evaluate the impacts of new development on natural resources. Policy PRC-1.2 requires that new development be designed and constructed to preserve the following types of areas and features as open space to the maximum extent feasible: high erosion hazard areas, scenic corridors, wetlands and riparian vegetation, drainage corridors, Colusa-Sacramento River State Recreation Area, and other
areas of federal, state or local significance.
City of Colusa General Plan Policy PRC-6.1 protects and preserves the area's biological resources, to the greatest extent feasible. Implementing Action PRC-6.1a states that through the development review process, and consistent with the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), the City will require development projects to avoid disturbing biological resources within the City, to the greatest extent feasible. Policy PRC-9.1 requires natural drainage flows be maintained in new development projects to the greatest extent feasible. Implementing Action PRC-9.1a states that the City will review individual projects to determine the setback requirements that will adequately buffer natural drainage corridors from development. The City will require new development ensures that natural drainage corridors and other watercourses are protected from the adverse effects of construction activities and
urban runoff.

Mitigation Measures

MM 5.1.7a A U.S. wetland delineation assessment shall be completed, finalized, submitted to the USACE for verification, and written verification of the delineation(s) by the USACE.

Timing /Implementation: Prior to Section 404 Permit Application and Prior
to Issuance of a grading permit.

5.1 COLUSA RIVERBEND

Enforcement/Monitoring: City of Colusa Planning Department and
USACE.

MM 5.1.7b To the extent practicable, the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the U.S. and waters of the State shall be avoided (this also includes waters
not subject to USACE jurisdiction, but subject to RWQCB, CDFG jurisdiction). This includes avoiding activities that would obstruct the flow of, or alter the bed, channel, or bank of any intermittent or ephemeral creeks, complete
avoidance is implemented, no further measures are necessary. If complete
avoidance is not practicable, the following measures shall be implemented:

Prior to any discharge of dredged or fill material into "waters of the U.S.",
including wetlands, authorization under a Nationwide Permit or Individual Permit shall be obtained from the USACE. For any features determined to not be subject to USACE jurisdiction during the verification process, authorization to discharge (or a waiver from regulation) shall be obtained
from the RWQCB. For fill requiring a USACE permit, water quality certification shall be obtained from the RWQCB prior to discharge of dredged or fill material.
If the extent of impacts to wetland features is greater than 0.5 acres, development will be permitted by the USACE under the Individual Permit process which requires a 404(b)(1) alternatives analysis. The 404(b)(1) alternatives analysis process requires the project applicant to demonstrate that there are no less environmentaily damaging practicable alternatives to the proposed action, that would have less
adverse impact on the aquatic system. Through this process, which involves negotiations with the USACE, USFWS, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the least environmentally damaging practicable alternative will be selected.
Prior to any activities that would obstruct the flow of, or alter the bed, channel, or bank of any intermittent or ephemeral creeks, notification of streambed alteration shall be submitted to the CDFG; and, if required, a streambed alteration agreement shall be obtained.
Construction activities that will impact "waters of the U.S." shall be conducted during the dry season to minimize erosion.
Appropriate sediment control measures to protect avoided "waters of the U.S." shall be in place prior to the onset of construction and shall be
monitored and maintained until construction activities have ceased.
Temporary stockpiling of excavated or imported material shall occur only
in approved construction staging areas. Excess excavated soil shall be used on site or disposed of at a regional landfill or other appropriate
facility. Stockpiles that are to remain on the site through the wet season shall be protected to prevent erosion (e.g. silt fences, straw bales).
All pedestrian and vehicular entry into "waters of the U.S.", including wetlands, shall be prohibited during construction.

The applicant shall ensure that the mitigated project will result in no net loss of wetlands.

Loss of non vernal seasonal wetlands shall be compensated at a minimum of a 1:1 creation ratio (i.e. one acres created for each acre
destroyed). Loss of vernal pools or vernal swales shall be compensated at a minimum of 1:1 creation and 2:1 preservation at an USACE approved mitigation bank or 2:1 creation and 3:1 preservation at an approved off- site mitigation bank. Indirect effects to vernal pools shall be compensated at a ratio of 2:1 preservation. This can be accomplished through purchase of appropriate credits at an approved mitigation bank, appropriate payment into a USACE and/or USFWS approved in-lieu fee fund (California Natural Lands Management mitigation bank for individual projects being permitted under a Nationwide Permit), acquiring suitable mitigation property through fee-title or purchase of conservation easement, or on-site or off-site creation, monitoring, and maintenance (as approved by the USACE, USFWS and RWQCB).
Loss of "other waters" shall be compensated through purchase of appropriate credits at a USACE approved mitigation bank, appropriate payment into a USACE approved in-lieu fee fund (California Natural Lands Management mitigation bank for individual projects being permitted under a Nationwide Permit), or through placement of avoided waters and associated riparian buffers into a conservation easement or similar protective mechanism. The amount of avoided waters and riparian buffers to be permanently protected shall be sufficient to offset the impact and shall be determined by the USACE and the applicant during the permitting process.
Any monitoring, maintenance, and reporting required by the regulatory agencies (i.e. USACE, RWQCB, CDFG} shall be implemented and completed. All measures contained in the permits or associated with agency approvals shail be implemented.

Timing/Implementation: Prior to issuance of a grading permit.
Enforcement/Monitoring: City of Colusa Planning Department, USACE, RWQCB, and CDFG.
Implementation of these mitigation measures along with the General Plan policies and implementing actions listed above would avoid or minimize direct impacts on wetlands. Impacts after implementation would be less than significant.

Riparian Habitat

Impact 5.1.8 Implementation of the project could result in the loss of riparian habitat areas in the project vicinity, especially in areas adjacent to the Sacramento River. is This is considered a potentially signiticant impact.
The standard of significance for this impact has been established in CEQA Guidelines Appendix G as follows: will the project have a substantial adverse effect on any riparian habitat or other sensitive natural community identified in local or regional plans, policies, or regulations or by the

CDFG or USFWS. This impact was evaluated for the proposed General Plan Update area in Impact 4.8.3 in Section 4.8 (Biological Resources).
Riparian habitat supports a high diversity of wildlife species and provides shade for streams and wetlands, maintaining stream temperatures and reducing stream evaporation. This habitat is considered important and sensitive by the USFWS, CDFG, USACE and the City of Colusa. It also is considered to be a sensitive natural community under CEQA. Implementation of the Colusa Riverbend project may result in disturbance, degradation, and removal of riparian habitat, since this habitat does occur in the project vicinity. The project may also result in direct and indirect impacts to riparian conditions along the Sacramento River. Riparian habitat is under the jurisdiction of the CDFG under Fish and Game Code Section 1602.

Applicable General Plan Policies and Implementing Actions

Policy PRC-6.1 would make protection and preservation of biological resources a policy of the City. This policy would be implemented through the development review process (Implementing Action PRC-6.1.a). Policy PRC-6.2 would encourage future development to avoid sensitive biological resources by alternative site designs. Policy PRC-9.1 would encourage natural drainage flows to be maintained to the extent feasible, mainly through City requirements to buffer natural drainage corridors, which would be imposed during the development review
process as set forth in Implementing Action PRC-9.1.a.

Policy PRC-1.1 would encourage the preservation of specific biological resources such as riparian comridors. Implementing Action PRC-1.1.a would allow the City to impose mitigation measures or conditions of approval on development projects to preserve riparian habitat. Policy PRC-1.2 would make it City policy that future development should preserve various types of areas and features to the extent feasible, including riparian areas. Implementing Action PRC- 1.2.b would provide mechanisms to preserve such areas, including easements, dedications and
fee programs.

While these policies and implementing actions would provide some protection of riparian habitat, they do not discuss methods to minimize or compensate for any unavoidable impacts on such habitat. Therefore, the following mitigation measures shall be implemented.
Mitigation Measures

MM 5.1.8a The applicant shall prepare a plan for no net loss of riparian habitat, which may be accomplished by avoidance, re-vegetation and restoration onsite or creation of riparian habitat offsite. Riparian habitat shall be avoided to the maximum extent feasible. In order to avoid impacts to riparian areas, construction and grading shall be limited to outside of the drip line or outer canopy of riparian vegetation that is dependent on surface or subsurface water and seasonal channels.

Timing/implementation: Prior to tentative map approval.
Enforcement/Monitoring: City of Colusa Planning Department, California
Department of Fish and Game.

MM 5.1.8b f impacts riparian habitat cannot be feasibly avoided, the project applicant shall be required to retain a qualified restoration ecologist approved by the
City of Colusa to assist with identifying an appropriate mitigation area within

City of Colusa Colusa General Plan
July 2007 Draft Master Environmental Impact Report
5.1-31

5.1 COLUSA RIVERBEND

the Sacramento River watershed no more than five miles from the project site. Within the mitigation area, riparian habitat greater in size to the area
impacted by implementation of the project (minimum 2:1 ratio) shall be re-
established and protected in perpetuity through a conservation easement. The restoration ecologist shall develop a riparian replacement program that specifies the iocations of riparian habitat creation, the plants and/or trees to be utilized, details on irrigation of habitat creation areas, and success criteria. A minimum five-year monitoring plan shall be enacted to ensure the long- term success of the newly vegetated area. Plantings shall have a minimal survival rate of 100 percent at the end of the five-year monitoring and maintenance period. If this rate is not met, the program will require replanting and continued monitoring until a five-year success period is met. The project applicant is responsible for any costs associated with completion of this
mitigation.

Timing/Implementation: Prior to tentative map approval.
Enforcement/Monitoring: City of Colusa Planning Department, California
Department of Fish and Game.

Implementation of the above mitigation measures, along with the General Plan policies and implementing actions, would reduce potential impacts on riparian habitats or compensate for
any loss. Impacts after mitigation would be less than significant.

HISTORIC AND CULTURAL RESOURCES

The reader is referred to Section 4.9 of this MEIR for background information pertaining to the
existing setting for cultural resources for the City of Colusa.

Standards of Significance

Section 4.9 of the MEIR identifies the standard of significance for cultural resources. All of these standards were evaluated for the Colusa Riverbend project as to the potential impact levels the
project may cause.

Methodology

ECORP Consulting, Inc. prepared a cultural resource review for the project site in September 2006. The review consisted of records and literature searches, consultation with the Native American Heritage Commission and appropriate tribes, and a field visit. Additionally, cultural resources staff of PMC conducted archaeological and historical investigations for the Specific Plan Area. These investigations included a records search at the Northwest Information Center at Sonoma State University, a sacred lands search conducted by the Native American Heritage Commission, consultation with the Native American community, and archival research. In addition, PMC conducted a search of the University of California Museum of Paleontology collections database for paleontological resources within the Specific Plan Area boundaries.

Standards of significance that were found to result in a potential impact are discussed under the a
individual impact statements.

Colusa General Plan City of Colusa

5.1 COLUSA RIVERBEND

Cultural Resources

Impact 5.1.9 Development of the project site could affect a known historic or prehistoric site as well as undiscovered cultural resources, including paleontologic
resources and human remains. This is considered a potentially significant
impact.

The standard of significance for this impact has been established in CEQA Guidelines Appendix G as follows: will the project have a substantial adverse change in the significance of an archaeological resource as defined in CEQA Guidelines Section 15064.5. This impact was evaluated for the proposed General Plan Update area in Impact 4.9.2 in Section 4.9 (Cultural
Resources).

ECORP Consulting, Inc. prepared a preliminary cultural resource review for the project site in September 2006. The review consisted of records and literature searches, consultation with the Native American Heritage Commission and appropriate tribes, and a field visit. The records
search indicated the existence of a prehistoric lithic scatter within the project site. Further
investigation and a field visit indicated the existence of three buildings potentially of historic age
(50 years or older). The prehistoric site previously had been determined not to be eligible for
inclusion in the National Register for Historic Places. However, no determination of eligibility has been made by a federal agency or the State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO). Also, artifacts were found outside the prehistoric site boundary, indicating the site may be larger than originally recorded. No records were found for any historic structures on-site.
There is a potential for future development to encounter currently undiscovered prehistoric and historic resources. As noted in the Setting section, a substantial Native American population existed in the Colusa area. There are eight known archaeological sites in the Planning Area. The archaeological and historical review conducted for the General Plan update concluded that the Planning Area is archaeologically sensitive for both prehistoric and historic sites and artifacts.
A search of the University of California, Berkeley Museum of Paleontology collections database did not identify any evidence of paleontological resources (fossils) in the Planning Area. However, there is a possibility of unanticipated and accidental paleontological discoveries during ground-disturbing activities. Unanticipated and accidental paleontological discoveries during project implementation have the potential to impact paleontological resources.
Although no burial sites have been explicitly identified, it is possible that Native American remains may be located within the Specific Plan Area. These remains could be encountered during future construction work. It is also possible that gravesites containing non-Native American remains could be encountered.

Applicable General Plan Policies and Implementing Actions

City of Colusa General Plan Policy PRC-4.1 encourages the inclusion of significant sites or districts in the Federal or State Historical Register. Policy PRC-4.2 preserves identified cultural and historic landmarks and buildings and ensures that new development, redevelopment, alterations and remodeling projects are sensitive to the historic context. Implementing Action PRC-4.2a states that as a part of the development review process, discretionary development projects will be required to identify any important historic and cultural sites the development may impact and
avoid disturbance to or degradation of these resources.

Mitigation Measures

MM 5.1.9a Prior to approval of the first tentative or parcel map within the project site, a field survey of cultural resources shall be conducted by a qualified specialist, in compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act. The survey shall determine the eligibility of the prehistoric site and the three buildings for inclusion in the National Register for Historic Places and the California Register of Historical Resources. If the site and buildings are
determined to not be eligible, no further action is required. If the site and/or
the buildings are determined to be eligible, the survey shall recommend feasible mitigation measures to avoid or minimize impacts on these resources. Measures for the prehistoric site may include, but are not limited to, designation of the site as open space and capping the site. Measures for the
buildings may include, but are not limited to, preservation of the structures.
Timing/implementation: Prior to approval of first tentative map or parcel map.
Enforcement/Monitoring: City of Colusa Planning Department.

MM 5.1.9b In the event of the discovery or recognition of prehistoric or historic resources
during development project construction, the project applicant shall require no further excavation or disturbance of the project site within 50 feet of the discovery until a professional archaeologist is consuited. Upon completion of the site examination, the archaeologist shall submit a report to the City describing the signiticance of the find and making recommendations as to its
disposition. Mitigation measures, as recommended by the archaeologist and approved by the City in accordance with Section 15064.5 of the CEQA Guidelines, shall be implemented prior to recommencement of construction activity within the 50-foot perimeter.
Timing/Implementation: During project construction.
Enforcement/Monitoring: City of Colusa Planning Department.

MM 5.1.9c f any paleontological resources are found during ground-disturbing activities, all work in the immediate vicinity must stop and the City shall be immediately notified. A qualified paleontologist shall be retained to evaluate the find and recommend appropriate mitigation measures for the disposition of the paleontological resources.
Timing/Implementation: As a condition of project approval, and implemented during construction activities.
Enforcement/Monitoring: City of Colusa Planning Department.

Implementation of MM 5.1.9a through MM 5.1.9c, along with the General Plan policies and
implementing actions, would avoid or minimize adverse physical impacts on uncovered cultural resources, and ensure their proper disposition with minimal loss of resource value. Impacts after mitigation would be less than signitic ant.

VISUAL RESOURCES/LIGHT AND GLARE

The reader is referred to Section 4.10 of this MEIR for background information pertaining to the existing setting for visual resources/light and glare for the City of Colusa.

Standards of Significance

Section 4.10 of the MEIR identifies the standard of significance for visual resources/light and glare. All of these standards were evaluated for the Colusa Riverbend project as to the potential impact levels the project may cause.

Methodology
Analysis of impacts to visual character is subjective by nature, because the qualities that create an aesthetically pleasing setting will vary from person to person. The visual resource analysis is based on field visits of the Specific Plan Area, review of existing City documents, and review of the land use map. Photographs were taken from several vantage points within the project site and public view areas in the Specific Plan Area. This analysis is based on anticipated changes within the Specific Plan Area from implementation of the land use map.
Impacts Dismissed from Further Discussion
The project is considered to have either no impact or a less than significant impact on the
following standards for the reasons stated:

1) Substantial damage to scenic resources, including, but not limited to, trees, rock outcroppings, and historic buildings within a state scenic highway - the Colusa Riverbend project will not cause substantial damage to scenic resources, as the project site is not located adjacent to a designated state scenic highway. A
discussion about conversion of open space and agricultural uses to residential is
addressed below in Impact 5.1.32. Please refer to Impact 4.10.2 in Section 4.10 (Visual
Resources/Light and Glare) for additional information.

Standards of significance that were found to result in a potential impact are discussed under the
individual impact statements.
Loss of Scenic Views and Visual Character

Impact 5.1.10 Implementation of the project would result in the loss of views of scenic area and change the visual character within the project vicinity. This is considered a potentially significant impact.
The standard of significance for visual resource impacts into an area has been established in CEQA Guidelines Appendix G as follows:

1) Will the project have a substantial adverse affect on a scenic vista?;

2) will the project create substantial degradation of the existing visual character or quality of a site and its surroundings?.
This impact was evaluated for the proposed General Plan Update area in Impact 4.10.1 and Impact 4.10.3 in Section 4.10 (Visual Resources/Light and Glare).

5.1 COLUSA RIVERBEND

City General Plan policies declare that scenic areas such as river banks and the Sacramento River waterfront as well as views of Sutter Buttes and the Coastal Range should be protected. The project site is currently used in agricultural production, and existing views of this area just
outside the current urban boundaries are predominantly of agricultural fields. Views from public vantage points and surrounding existing development of Sutter Buttes and the Coastal Range
may be impaired due to construction of the Colusa Riverbend project. Additionally, construction
of the project would change the existing character of the open, agricultural areas to urban
development.

Applicable General Plan Policies and Implementing Actions
City of Colusa Policy PRC - 12.1 requires new development in scenic areas (e.g., river banks and Sacramento River waterfront) to use planning design, construction and maintenance techniques designed to protect the views of the area. Policy PRC-12.2 requires the City to develop and implement specific design standards intended to accomplish the goal of protecting scenic viewsheds. Implementation Program PRC-12.2.a requires the City to develop and implement specific criteria, consisting of design guidelines and development standards, to maximize protection of the City's scenic viewsheds. Implementation Program PRC-12.2.b: requíres each development proposal to provide an environmental/visual constraints map,
based on the findings of a project-specific site assessment that identifies significant viewsheds for the Sacramento River, Sutter Buttes and Coastal Range that could be potentially impacted by the project. Policy PRC - 12.4 states that the City should work to ensure that new roads, parking and utilities be designed to minimize visual impacts. Unless limited by geological or engineering constraints, utilities shall be instalied underground and roadways and parking areas shall be landscaped and designed to accommodate the natural terrain.
While the City General Plan incorporates a number of policies and implementing actions to remove potential impacts to scenic resources of the City, impacts to the change of visual characteristics is subjective by nature. Development of a parcel of land that is currently agricultural or vacant into uses that would place buildings in the viewshed of existing uses would
invariably change the existing character of the landscape and impact views of scenic resources. While the changes in the views of the project site will be different in character from the existing views, strict design guidelines can result in construction of a project that could be aesthetically pleasing. However, the overall change in the character of the area will be considerable. There is no feasible mitigation for the loss of these views from existing development therefore; project implementation will result in signiticant and unavoidable impacts.

Mitigation Measures

None available.

COMMUNITY SERVICES

The community services section considers those services which supply fire and police protection, educational and parks and recreation facilities in the City. The reader is referred to Section 4.11 of this MEIR for background information pertaining to the existing setting for community services for the City of Colusa.

Standards of Significance

Section 4.11 of the MEIR identifies the standard of significance for school and park and recreational services. All of these standards were evaluated for the Colusa Riverbend project as to the potential impact levels the project may cause.

Methodology

The primary sources of information for fire protection services and police protection services in the Colusa area were the Colusa Fire Department, the Sacramento River Fire Protection District
and the Colusa Police Department, primarily from personal communications. Other information
came from research of public documents, including the LAFCo 2005 Draft Municipal Services Review and website information. Evaluation of potential public school impacts was based on review of applicable public documents and consultations with Colusa Unified School District
staff. Additionally, this section was prepared and evaluated based on consuitation with City staff
and review of applicable public documents.
Impacts Dismissed from Further Discussion
The proposed project is considered to have either no impact or a less than significant impact on following standards based on reasoning listed and therefore are not further analyzed in this EIR for the Colusa Riverbend project.
1) Result in a substantial adverse physical impact associated with the provision of new or physically altered governmental facilities, the construction of which could cause significant environmental impacts, in order to maintain acceptable park acreage ratios, or other performance objectives for parks. The Colusa Riverbend project includes the provision for approximately 25 acres of parkland. This parkland will be required to be developed at the applicant's expense. The Colusa Riverbend project does not include the provision of any new or altered governmental facilities; therefore, there would be no impact. Please refer to Impact 4.11.4.1 through Impact 4.11.4.2 in Section 4.11 (Community Services) for additional information.
2) Will the project create substantial adverse physical impacts associated with the provision of new or physically altered school facilities, need for new or physically altered school facilities, the construction of which could cause significant environmental impacts, in order to maintain acceptable service ratios, response times or other performance objectives for educational services. The Colusa
Riverbend project includes approximately 15 acres for the development of an
elementary school. Additionally, Government Code Section 65995(h) states that the payment or satisfaction of a fee, charge, or other requirement levied or imposed pursuant to provisions of SB 50 and Section 17620 of the Education Code is deemed
to be full and complete mitigation of the impacts of any legislative or adjudicative
act related to the provision of adequate school facilities. As the Colusa Unified
School District imposes impact fees for new development, this mitigates any impacts from the development of school facilities incurred as a result of project development. Please refer to Impact
information. 11.3.1 in Section 4.11 (Community Services) for additional

5.1 COLUSA RIVERBEND

Result in Additional Fire Protection Facilities

Impact 5.1.11 The project would increase the demand for fire protection services, which would require additional personnel. This is considered a potentially significant
impact.

The standard of significance for community service impacts has been established in CEQA Guidelines Appendix G as follows: will the project create substantial adverse physical impacts associated with the provision of new or physically altered governmental facilities, need for new or physically altered governmental facilities, the construction of which could cause significant environmental impacts, in order to maintain acceptable service ratios, response times or other performance objectives for fire protection. This impact was evaluated for the proposed General Plan Update area in Impact 4.11.1.1 in Section 4.11 (Community Services).
Development of the project potentially would result in a maximum of 2,235 low-density residential units and 295 medium-density units, for a maximum total of 2,530 residential units. Assuming approximately 2.85 persons per unit, the resulting population increase would be approximately 7,210 persons. Based on estimates provided for the former Riverbend Estates project in the area, development at project buildout would generate approximately 545 calls for service to the Fire Department. The Colusa Fire Department attempts to maintain a ratio of paid fire personnel to population of 1 to 1,000. Therefore, the project would generate a demand for approximately seven paid full-time firefighters. Department policy requires one pumper per three personnel; thus, the project would generate a demand for two additional pumpers.
The new personnel and new equipment would exceed the Fire Department's current capacity to house staff and equipment. The Fire Department would need to construct additional facilities to accommodate the additional staff and engines to maintain acceptable service ratios. The construction of new facilities could result in a significant environmental impact.
The City's fire station is located at 750 Market Street. The Fire Department has stated that projects outside a 2.5-mile radius of the station may require a longer response time, thereby jeopardizing public safety. While the project site is within the 2.5-mile radius, future development throughout the City may increase response times and calls for service due to potential traffic congestion. Because of the proposed developments in the eastern portion of Colusa, the Fire Department has identified the need for station improvements and expansion to serve the City's eastern area. Should a fire station be constructed in the eastern portion of the City, response times to the development would be quicker than response times from the Market Street station.
The City of Colusa Fire Department would provide fire protection for the project site upon annexation. However, infrastructure for water lines does not currently exist and will require construction. Water lines would be installed such that the project will meet the minimum flows specified by the Uniform Fire Code.
Applicable General Plan Policies and Implementing Actions
General Plan Policy SAF-3.4 which states that the City shall maintain adequate fire protection services for its residents and businesses and will be implemented by Implementing Action SAF- 3.4.g and SAF-3.4b through Interagency Coordination and City Budget and Rate Review. Policy MFS-1.1 states that the City shall ensure that new development does not exceed the capacity of the City to provide adequate municipal facilities and does not disproportionately impact the capacity of existing service levels. New growth shall pay it's fair share cost of facilities and services without creating an additional burden to existing residents. Implementing Action MFS-

Policy MFS-3.1 states that the City shall maintain its own fire protection services for City residents and businesses through the provision of adequate facilities and equipment. Implementing Action MFS-3.1.a requires Monitor Facilities and Equipment Needs. Policy MFS-3.3 states that the City shall require that the construction and staffing of fire station facilities be scheduled such that
they are ready to serve new development as it occurs and is implemented by Implementing Action MFS-3.3.a, 3.3.b and 3.3.c requiring Capital Improvement Program, Specific Pians and
Development Review.

Mitigation Measures

MM 5.1.11a The project applicant will coordinate directly with the Colusa Fire Department, City staff, and adjacent project developers to prepare a fire services plan for the project. The plan will determine service requirements for all project land uses and ratios for public/private fire services that are acceptable to the Fire Department. The plans must meet current City
performance standards for response times, personnel, equipment and infrastructure needs.

Timing/Implementation: Prior to tentative map approvai.
Enforcement/Monitoring: City of Coiusa Fire Department and project
proponent.

MM 5.1.11b The project applicant will coordinate directly with the Colusa Fire Department, other developers in the eastern portion of the City of Colusa, and City staff to negotiate appropriate payments for a new fire station, personnel, infrastructure and equipment. The Fire Department shall receive adequate monetary compensation to provide fire services to the project,
while maintaining or improving services to the existing residents of the City of
Colusa.

Timing/implementation: Prior to tentative map approval.
Enforcement/Monitoring: City of Colusa Fire Department, City Manager,
and project proponent.

Implementation of these mitigation measures, along with the General Pian policies and implementing actions, would ensure adequate provision of fire protection services that meet the anticipated demand by the project, without adversely affecting service to other areas of the City. Impacts after mitigation would be less than signiticant.

Result in Additional Police Protection Facilities

Impact 5.1.12 The project would increase the demand for police protection services, which would require additional staff and facilities. This is considered a potentially significant impact.
The standard of significance for community service impacts has been established in CEQA Guidelines Appendix G as follows: will the project create substantial adverse physical impacts associated with the provision of new or physically altered governmental facilities, need for new or physically altered governmental facilities, the construction of which could cause significant

environmental impacts, in order to maintain acceptable service ratios, response times or other performance objectives for police protection. This impact was evaluated for the proposed General Plan Update area in Impact 4.11.2.1 in Section 4.11 (Community Services).
Project development would result in an approximate maximum total of 2,530 residential units and an additional 7,109 persons. At project buildout, development would generate approximately 931 calls for service to the Police Department, based on estimates for the former Riverbend Estates project. The Colusa Police Department attempts to maintain a ratio of paid police personnel to population of 2 to 1,000. The project would create an additional demand for approximately 14 paid law enforcement officers. Additionally, the Department prefers to maintain one patrol car for every two officers. Therefore, the department would require an additional 14 officers and seven patrol cars to maintain service levels with development of the
project. The police station would need to be expanded and/or improved to accommodate the additional staff and resources that the project likely would generate.
The project site is located within two miles of the City's police station, located on 260 Sixth Street.
However, future development throughout the City may increase response times and calls for
service due to potential traffic congestion. This may generate a requirement for a substation to
ensure rapid response times. The project proposes the establishment of a substation along Moon
Bend Road near SR 20/45.

Applicable General Plan Policies and Implementing Actions
General Plan Policy SAF-6.1 states that the City shall strive to provide high-quality police services for City residents and businesses with adequate facilities, modern technology and current training to maximize job performance. To implement this Policy, Implementing Actions SAF-6.1.a, 6.1.b, and 6.1.c require a Law Enforcement Technology and Service Level Update, as well as Mutual Aid Agreements, and a City Budget and Rate Review. Policy SAF-6.2 states that the City shall incorporate police protection considerations into City and community activities through Implementing Action SAF-6.2.a by Development Review. Policy MFS-2.1 states that the City shall maintain acceptable law enforcement services for City residents and businesses through the provision of adequate facilities and equipment through Implementing Action MFS-2.1.a Monitor Facilities and Equipment Needs. Policy MFS-2.2 states that the City shall require that the
construction and staffing of police facilities be scheduled such that they are ready to serve new development as it occurs and will be implemented through Implementing Action MFS-2.2.a and 2.2.b Capital Improvement Program and Development Review. Policy MFS-2.3 states that all development shail pay City-adopted impact fees for fair-share contributions to police facilities and equipment improvements.

Mitigation Measures

MM 5.1.12a The project applicant will coordinate directly with the Colusa Police Department, City staff, and adjacent project developers to prepare a police services plan for the project. The plan will determine service requirements for all projected land uses and ratios for public/private police services that are acceptable to the Police Department. The plan must meet current City performance standards for response times, personnel, equipment and
infrastructure needs.

Timing/Implementation: Prior to tentative map approval.

City of Colusa.

Timing/Implementation: Prior to tentative map approval.

Enforcement/Monitoring: City of Colusa Police Department, City
Manager, and project proponent.
Implementation of the mitigation measures would ensure adequate police protection services for the project and for the City overall. Impacts after mitigation would be less than significant.
Result in Additional Park and Recreational Facilities

Impact 5.1.13 The project would encourage an increase in the local population, thereby leading to an increase in the demand for park and recreation services. This is considered a potentially significant impact.
The standard of significance for community service impacts into an area has been established in CEQA Guidelines Appendix G as follows: will the project result in an increase in the use of existing neighborhood and regional parks or other recreational facilities such that substantial physical deterioration of the facility would occur or be accelerated. This impact was evaluated for the proposed General Plan Update area in Impact 4.11.4.2 in Section 4.11 (Community Services).
As previously noted, a rule of thumb for provision of is parks is five acres for every 1,000 residents, based on National Recreation and Parks Association (NRPA) guidelines. As previously discussed, the estimated total number of residents on the project site at buildout would be 7,109, assuming a maximum total of 2,530 residential units. This would translate into a need for approximately
35.55 acres of parkland for residents in the new development.
The project proposes the development of a park system that centers on a community park/open space area adjacent to the school site. Neighborhood parks would be located throughout the project site, connected by paseos containing natural features and pedestrian walkways, with possible inclusion of playground equipment in some paseos. The total amount of parkland and open space would be approximately 25 acres. This would be short of the NRPA
guidelines. This deficiency may be partially offset by other developments where parkland relative to population would exceed the NRPA guidelines, such as Colusa Crossings and Brookins Ranch (see discussion in Section 5.2 and 5.3). Nevertheless, the additional population on the project site would place a substantial demand on both existing and future parks and recreational facilities within the Planning Area.
Applicable General Plan Policies and Implementing Actions
The General Plan Policies including Policy PRC - 2.3 state that the City shall ensure that a park development ratio is met of no less than five acres of parkland for every 1,000 Colusa residents,

is which is implemented through Implementing Action PRC-2.3.a, 2.3.b, and 2.3.c Development Review, Dedications, Fees and Exactions, and Development Agreements. Policy MFS-1.1 states that the City shall ensure that new development does not exceed the capacity of the City to provide adequate municipal facilities and does not disproportionately impact the capacity of existing service levels. New growth shall pay its fair-share cost of facilities and services without creating an additional burden to existing residents. This Policy is implemented through Implementing Action MFS-1.1.b and 1.1.c: Development Impact Fees and Assembly Bill (AB) 1600
Analysis.

Mitigation Measures

MM 5.1.13 Prior to tentative map approval, the project applicant shall submit a park plan for the City's review and approval. The park plan shall specify the park and open space areas on the project site, and shall discuss their construction, maintenance and financing of operations. The provision of adequate park and open space land that meets the NRPA guidelines for parkland per 1,000 residents is strongly encouraged. The park plan shall be consistent with any Master Park Plan adopted by the City.
Timing./implementation: Prior to tentative map approval
Enforcement/Monitoring: City of Colusa Planning Department
Implementation of the above mitigation measure would reduce potential impacts related to a lack of parkland for future residents. Impacts after mitigation would be less than significant.

PUBLIC SERVICES AND UTILITIES

Public services and utilities are those services which supply water, wastewater, storm drainage, and solid waste facilities and infrastructure. The reader is referred to Section 4.12 of this MEIR for background information pertaining to the existing setting for public services and utilities for the City of Colusa.

Standards of Significance
Section 4.12 of the MEIR identifies the standards of significance for public services and utilities. These standards were evaluated for the Colusa Riverbend project as to the potential impact levels the project may cause.

Methodology

Evaluation of potential impacts on water facilities and services was based on consultation with City staff and review of City documents. A major source of information was the Water Supply Evaluation completed for the City in 2007 by Tully and Young. Section 4.7, Hydrology and Water Quality, describes the analysis and findings of the Water Supply Evaluation. Other sources included survey forms completed by City staft and returned to Pacific Municipal Consultants in 2005, and correspondence with City staff.

Impacts Dismissed from Further Discussion
The proposed project is considered to have either no impact or a less than significant impact on following standards based on reasoning listed and therefore are not further analyzed in this EIR for the Colusa Riverbend project.
1) Will the project be served by a landfill with sufficient permitted capacity to accommodate the project's solid waste disposal needs and comply with federal, state, and local statutes and regulations related to solid waste. Increased
development associated with implementation of the Colusa Riverbend project would increase the amount of solid waste generated. However, implementation of the proposed General Plan policies and implementing actions would assist in reducing the solid waste stream, thereby reducing demand on landfill capacity, and would ensure adequate provision of solid waste services. Therefore, this impact is considered to be less than significant. Please refer to Impact 4.12.4.1 in Section 4.12
(Public Services and Utilities) for additional information.

Because of the preliminary nature of the Colusa Riverbend project, project specific water, wastewater and stormwater demands and need to improve existing facilities have not been determined at this time. Therefore further analysis of project impacts to these facilities cannot be competed at this time. The reader is referred to Table 5.1.2 which identifies areas requiring additional information to complete a thorough environmental analysis.

5.2 COLUSA CROSSING

5.2 COLUSA CROSSINGS

This section analyzes the potential environmental impacts of the Colusa Crossings project. This section is intended to evaluate the environmental impacts of the Colusa Crossings project to the greatest extent possible. This section addresses environmental impacts to the extent information is available and details of project are known. Environmental issues to be addressed through subsequent environmental review are identified, consistent with the requirements of CEQA Guidelines Section 15176(c).

5.2.1 EXISTING SETTING

PROJECT LOCATION
The Colusa Crossings site is located on 310-acres of land in northwest Colusa. SR 20 forms the southern boundary of the site, while Wilson Road forms the approximate northern and western boundaries. See Figure 3-3, Specific Projects, for project location.

SURROUNDING USES

The project site is surrounded by agricultural uses to the north and west. The Colusa County Fairgrounds and some commercial activities are located across SR 20 from the project site, while single-family residences are located to the east. SR 20 and Wilson Road are the primary
access roads to the site.

EXISTING CONDITIONS

The proposed Colusa Crossings project site is
1 currently being used for agriculture production. A former railroad bed traverses the project site in a north-south direction. A barn with farm vehicles and equipment is
located on the site along SR 20.

CURRENT AND PROPOSED GENERAL PLAN LAND USE DESIGNATIONS
The Colusa County General Plan land use designation for the project site is Agricultural- Transition(A-T) and a small amount of Commercial (C). The City of Colusa General Plan update proposes to designate the site as Special Planning Area (SPA) #3, which allows for a variety of uses including low, medium and high density residential, commercial/professional, parks/open space and a school site. See Figure 3-2, Proposed General Plan Land Use Diagram.
5.2.2 PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The Colusa Crossings project is outside the existing City limits within the proposed Planning Area and would require annexation by the City. The project proposes residential, open space and parkland, an elementary school site, and commercial land uses. The preliminary land use map indicates that the northern, western and eastern portions of the project site would have low- density residential development. Medium- and high-density residential development would occur closer to State Route 20. Commercial areas are designated on lands adjacent to State Route 20, while a 10-acre elementary school site has been designated in the east-central area. Two mini-parks totaling one acre are proposed within the low-density residential area. The
City of Colusa Colusa General Plan

center of the site would contain either a community park of approximately 50 acres, or a neighborhood park of 20 acres with an additional 30 acres of low-density residential development. For the CEQA analysis, it is assumed that the neighborhood park would be built, as the additional residences would likely generate more significant environmental impacts than the park space. See Figure 5.2-1 for the proposed land use worksheet.

LAND USES

Table 5.2-1 identifies the proposed land uses, acreage for each development type, and maximum development density. Maximum development for Low Density Residential would be 1,050 units (5 units/acre), the maximum for Medium Density Residential would be 130 units (10 units/acre), and the maximum for High Density Residential would be 200 units (20 units/acre). The total maximum number of residential units would be 2,324. In addition, the project designates 25 acres for commercial uses. Assuming that net developable acreage is approximately 80 percent of total acreage and that commercial building floor area is approximately 40-45 percent of the net acreage, approximately 381,150 square feet of commercial/professional floor area would be developed.

Note: *The project proponent has not yet determined if 30 acres on the project site would be designated for low-density residential or park use. Figures in parentheses assume the 30 acres would be designated for low-density residential uses.

ACCESS AND CIRCULATION

Access to the project site would be primarily from State Route 20, with two conceptual access points off that roadway. One of these access roads is proposed to be located directly across from will S. Green Avenue, and would proceed northward to Wilson Avenue to the north. The other access road would connect. to Wilson Avenue to the west. Two additional access roadways are proposed to connect to Wilson Avenue, one to the north and one to the west. An internal street system would center around three main streets. As part of the Design Review process under Implementing Action CIR-1.1-b, the project would be required to dedicate adequate right-of-way for the circulation system shown on the Circulation Map of the General
Plan.

5.2 COLUSA CROSSINGS

DRAINAGE IMPROVEMENTS

The south-central portion of the site is designated for a storm drain detention basin as well as a lake within the basin area. Berms from 3 to feet in height would be constructed along the northern, western and southern boundaries of the project site, for flood protection purposes. The project applicant a may construct a landscaped joint-use pedestrian and bike path around the entire project, alongside the berms. The width of this landscaped area would vary depending on the necessity for a berm and its height, and the area would have to conform to Army Corps of Engineers design standards.
5.2.3 SUBSEQUENT CEQA REVIEW

ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW FOR PROJECT UNDER CEQA

This MEIR is intended to provide environmental analysis of the Colusa Crossings project to the maximum extent allowable, consistent with the requirements of State CEQA Guidelines Section 15175. Therefore, subsequent CEQA review of the Colusa Crossings project shall occur as
applications for entitlements are submitted and shall be subject to and limited by the provisions for review of subsequent projects previously described in a Master EIR set forth in CEQA Guidelines Sections 15177 and Section 15178.

AREAS OF INSUFFICIENT AVAILABLE INFORMATION REQUIRING FURTHER STUDY

CEQA Guidelines Section 15176 discusses the required contents of a Master EIR. Section 15176(c) requires that a description of potential impacts of anticipated projects for which there is not sufficient information reasonably available to support a full assessment of potential impacts be disclosed in an MEIR. Due to the preliminary nature of the Colusa Crossings project, areas of
insufficient information do exist which would require further analysis to determine the potential for specific environmental impacts of the project. Potential impacts not addressed in the MEIR and associated areas of insufficient information are identified in Table 5.2-2.

5.2.4 IMPACTS AND MITIGATION MEASURES

LAND USE AND AGRICULTURE

The reader is referred to Section 4.1 of this MEIR for a description of the existing setting for land use and agricultural resources for the proposed Planning Area which includes the Colusa
Crossings project.

Standards of Significance
Refer to Section 4.1 of this MEIR for a list of the standards of significance for land use and agriculture. All of these standards were evaluated for the proposed Colusa Crossings project as to the potential impact levels the project may cause.
Methodology
Evaluation of potential land use impacts of the Colusa Crossings project was based on review of planning documents pertaining to the City of Colusa, including the City of Colusa General Plan, City of Colusa Zoning Ordinance, a field review of the City and surrounding areas, and consultation with appropriate agencies. The analysis contained herein is based on buildout conditions for the City of Colusa General Plan, as described in Section 4.0.
The agricultural analysis utilized information from the California Department of Conservation Farmiand Conversion Report 1998-2000, the California Department of Conservation important Farmland Map of Colusa County, the Soil Survey of Colusa County prepared by the NRCS in 2002, and the Summary of County Agricultural Commissioners' Reports, 2003-2004 by the National Agricultural Statistics Service. Based on this information, the analysis assessed the potential value of agricultural lands on the Colusa Crossings site, and utilized the proposed project land uses to determine potential impacts.

Colusa General Plan
Draft Master Environmental Impact Report City of Colusa
July 2007
5.2-6

5.2 COLUSA CROSSINGS

The focus of this land use analysis is on physical environmental impacts that would result from the changes in land use requested for the project.
Specific impacts and project consistency issues associated with biological resources, hydrology and water quality, geology, visual resources, noise, traffic, public services, and utilities are addressed in the respective technical sections and the reader is referred to those sections for detailed analysis of other relevant environmental effects as a result of project development.
Impacts Dismissed from Further Discussion
The proposed project is considered to have either no impact or a less than significant impact under the following standards as discussed below and therefore these issues are not further discussed in this section.

1) Physical division of an established community - the proposed project is located on the western border of the City of Colusa. There is urban development adjacent to the eastern border of the project site and open space/agricultural land on the remaining three sides. The project site is not surrounded by an established community, therefore the Colusa Crossings project will not divide a community and the project is considered to have no impact. Please refer to Impact 4.1.1 in Section 4.1 (Land Use and Agricultural Resources) for additional information regarding this impact.
2) Conflict with any applicable land use plan, policy or regulation of an agency with jurisdiction over the project (including, but not limited to, the general plan, specific plan, or zoning ordinance) adopted for the purpose of avoiding or mitigating an environmental effect - The Colusa Crossings project is consistent with the General Plan Update land use designations. The Zoning Ordinance is required to be update to comply with these land use designations. Therefore, the Colusa Crossings project is in is compliance with all applicable land use plans and considered to have no impact. Please refer to Impact 4.1.3 in Section 4.1 (Land Use and Agricultural Resources) for additional information regarding this impact.
3) Conflict with any applicable habitat conservation plan or natural community conservation plan. No applicable habitat conservation or natural community plans exist on the project site, therefore the Colusa Crossings project is considered to have no impact. Please refer to Impact 4.1.4 in Section 4.1 (Land Use and Agricultural Resources) for additional information.
Standards of significance under which implementation of the project may result in a potential impact are discussed under the individual impact statements below.
Agricultural Land Conversion

Impact 5.2.1 The project would convert land from agricultural use to urban uses. This is considered a significant impact.
The standard of significance for the conversion of farmland to urban uses has been established in CEQA Guidelines Appendix G as follows: the conversion of Prime Farmland, Unique Farmland, or Farmland of Statewide Importance as shown on the maps prepared pursuant to the Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Program of the California Resources Agency to non-agricultural use. This impact was evaluated for the proposed General Plan Planning Update in Impact 4.1.5 in
Section 4.1 (Land Use and Agricultural Resources), which requires subsequent development to mitigate for the loss of farmland, and concluded that the impact would be significant and

City of Colusa Colusa General Plan
July 2007 Draft Master Environmental Impact Report
5.2-7

5.2 COLUSA CROSSINGS

unavoidable for the proposed General Plan Update project, which includes the Colusa
Crossings project.

The Important Farmland Map for Colusa County classifies of the majority of the site as Prime Farmland (see Figure 4.1-1). The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) categorizes farmland throughout the nation. One important factor used in the determination of farmland type by the USDA is the soil (along with growing eason, and moisture supply). The soil on the project site is Moonbend silt loam, which is rated an excellent soil for irrigated crops by the Storie Index in the
Soil Survey of Colusa County.

The project site is currently being used for agricultural operations. Development of the project site into commercial and residential uses would remove this area from potential agricultural production and result in the permanent loss 310 acres of prime or locally important farmland to urban development. This is considered a significant impact.
Applicable General Plan Policies and Implementing Actions
City of Colusa General Pian Policy LU-4.1 requires that the City shall support efforts to preserve
existing agricultural land uses in areas outside the City's sphere of influence. The Implementing Action LU-4.1.b Public/Private Partnerships states that the City will work with Colusa County, nonprofit organizations and landowners to establish policies that will protect prime agricultural areas around the sphere of influence, including a process to implement techniques such as transfer of development rights, agricultural easements and farmland trusts.

General Plan Policy LU-5.1 states that development patterns shall tier off of existing development and avoid leap-frogging, including areas intended for annexation that are presently outside the city limits. The Implementing Action LU-5.4.a: Annexation Phasing Pian requires that the City will prepare and adopt an Annexation Phasing Plan to ensure a logical progression of annexations that meet the City's economic and planning needs and do not strain City services, resources, and infrastructure. The plan will also include criteria, consistent with the
Cortese-Knox-Hertzberg Reorganization Act of 2000, that promote the preservation of open
space and agricultural lands.

Mitigation Measures

MM 5.2.1 The project applicant shall mitigate for loss of Prime Farmland, Farmland of
Statewide Importance or Farmland of Local Importance by either (1) granting a farmland conservation easement to or for the benefit of the City and/or an entity approved by the City, at a 1:1 ratio for each acre developed, or (2) if the City adopts a farmland conservation program, by payment of an in lieu fee as established by the farmland conservation program, which shall be
reviewed and adjusted periodically to ensure that the fee is adequate to
offset the cost of purchasing farmland conservation easements at a 1:1 ratio.
Timing/Implementation: Prior to issuance of grading permits.

Enforcement/Monitoring: City of Colusa Planning Department.

Implementation of MM 5.2.1 would help reduce the impact of the loss of important farmland by conserving comparable existing agricultural lands. However, development of the project would result in an irrevocable decrease in the amount of Prime Farmland and Farmland of Local

Colusa General Plan City of Colusa
Draft Master Environmental Impact Report July 2007
5.2-8

5.2 COLUSA CROSSINGS

Importance and a net reduction in important agricultural lands. Therefore, this impact is considered significant and unavoidable.
Agricultural/Urban Interface

Impact 5.2.2 The project would result in the placement of urban uses adjacent to agricultural uses, creating potential conflicts. is This is considered a potentially significant impact.
The standards of significance for this impact discussion are established in CEQA Guidelines Appendix G as follows: conflict with existing zoning for agricultural Use, or a Williamson Act contract, and/or changes in the existing environment which, due to their location or nature, could result in conversion of farmland to non-agricultural use. This impact was evaluated for the proposed General Plan Update, which includes the Colusa Crossings project, in Impact 4.1.3 in Section 4.1 (Land Use and Agricultural Resources), which identified mitigation for the impact (MM 4.1.5) and concluded that implementation of proposed General Plan policies and implementing actions would reduce the impact to less than significant.
The project proposes the development of residential, commercial and professional uses at the western edge of the Colusa Sphere of Influence. The Colusa County General Plan designations adjacent to the project boundary include Industrial (I) to the south, the city limits to the east, Urban Residential (UR), Parks and Recreation (P-R), and Rural Residential (RR) to the north, and Agriculture-Transition (A-T) to the west. No Williamson Act contract properties are located adjacent or in the vicinity of the Colusa Crossings project site.
The project would place more urban development adjacent to agricultural operations to the west, which could create conflicts between these land uses. These conflicts have the potential to result in adjacent agricultural land conversion to a non-agricultural use.
Generally, residential uses generate the most conflicts with agricultural operations. Agriculture/urban interface conflicts vary depending on the type of agricultural use, but generally include, although are not limited to, the following:
Inconveniences or discomforts associated with dust, smoke, noise, and odor from
agricultural operations.
Restrictions on agricultural operations (such as pesticide application) along interfaces
with urban uses.

Conflicts with farm equipment and vehicles using roadways.

Trespassing and vandalism on active farmlands.
Increased pressure to convert adjacent agricultural land to urban uses as a result of
above-mentioned conflicts and increases in property values.

Applicable General Plan Policies and Implementing Actions
City of Colusa General Plan Policy LU-2.1 requires that development projects are to be reviewed on a case-by-case basis to ensure adequate urban/agriculture buffers are included as part of project design. Implementing Action LU-2.1.a requires the mitigation of significant urban/agriculture be included as conditions of approval. Policy PRC-8.1 requires the City to

City of Colusa Colusa General Plan
July 2007 Draft Master Environmental Impact Report
5.2-9

5.2 COLUSA CROSSINGS

evaluate the impacts of a development project on agricultural operations, specifically projects adjacent to agricultural lands and to take measures to reduce conflicts with those lands. This is to be implemented through the development review process described in Implementing Actions LU-2.1.b and PRC-8.1.a, including provision of a buffer between new development and agricultural uses and notification of the County's right-to-farm ordinance. Mitigation measures are identified below to require an urban/agriculture buffer and notification of adjacent farming
activities.

Mitigation Measures

MM 5.2.2a An urban/agriculture buffer between existing agriculture and proposed project development along the northern and western boundaries of the project shall be included as a part of project design and shown on the tentative map and improvement pians. The urban/agriculture buffer area shall separate existing agricultural uses and future project development and shall be a minimum of 250 feet in width or, based on the specific proposed uses, a width acceptable to the City that provides an adequate transition between the proposed uses and the adjacent agricultural uses. The buffer may include roadways, infrastructure easements, parkiand, and open space.
Prior to approval of the final map, the project applicant shall identify and implement a financing mechanism to fund maintenance of the buffer.
Timing/Implementation: Buffer shall be shown on the tentative map and
improvement plans and a financing mechanism
entered into prior to final map approval. The
buffer shall be maintained as long as
agricultural uses remain adjacent to the project

Enforcement/Monitoring: City of Colusa Planning Department

MM 5.2.2b Concurrent with recordation of the Final Map, the project applicant shall cause to be recorded a disclosure to potential buyers of the dwelling units of the adjacent agriculture uses. This disclosure shall be in a form acceptable to the City and generally consistent with those required under Colusa County's Right to Farm Ordinance.
Timing/Implementation: Disclosure statement to be reviewed and
approved by the City prior to tentative map approvai and shail be recorded concurrently
with the Final Map

Enforcement/Monitoring: City of Colusa Planning Department
Implementation of the mitigation measures MM 5.2.2a and MM 5.2.2b, would provide a buffer between proposed project development and adjoining agricultural uses, reducing potential odor, noise, and nuisance conflicts and would also ensure that future buyers within the proposed project are notified of the adjacent agricultural uses. Implementation of these mitigation measures would reduce agriculture/urban interface conflicts to less than significant.

POPULATION AND HOUSING

The reader is referred is to Section 4.2 of this MEIR for background information pertaining to the existing setting for population and housing for the City of Colusa.
Standards of Significance
Section 4.2 of the MEIR identifies the standard of significance for population and housing. All of these standards were evaluated for the proposed Colusa Crossings project as to the potential
impact levels the project may cause.

Methodology
City staff conducted research on demographic and housing conditions, utilizing existing documents and other information sources. Information was obtained from govemmental agencies through their websites. Among these agencies were the U.S. Bureau of the Census, the California Department of Finance, and the California Employment Development Department. The recently adopted City of Colusa Housing Element was an additional source of information on housing and socioeconomic conditions as well as housing policies.

Impacts Dismissed from Further Discussion
The proposed project is considered to have either no impact or a less than significant impact under the following standards as discussed below and therefore these issues are not further
discussed in this section.

5. Displacement of substantial numbers of existing housing, necessitating the construction of replacement housing elsewhere the Colusa Crossings project site does not have any existing housing, therefore the project would have no impact. Please refer to Impact 4.2.3 in Section 4.2 for additional information regarding this impact.
6. Displacement of substantial numbers of people, necessitating the construction of replacement housing elsewhere the Colusa Crossings project site does not have any existing housing or population, therefore the project would have no impact. Please refer to Impact 4.2.3 in Section 4.2 for additional information regarding this impact.
Standards of significance that were found to result in a potential impact are discussed under the individual impact statements.
Population and Housing Growth

Impact 5.2.3 Development of the proposed project has the potential to substantially increase population growth in the area. This is considered a potentially significant impact.
The standard of significance for the introduction of a substantial number of people into an area has been established in CEQA Guidelines Appendix G as follows: a project will introduce substantial growth or concentration of population in an area either directly or indirectly (e.g., through projects in an undeveloped area or extension of major infrastructure) that results in a physical effect on the environment. This impact was evaluated for the proposed General Plan Update area in Impact 4.2.1 in Section 4.2 (Population, Housing, and Employment), which

City of Colusa Colusa General Plan
July 2007 Draft Master Environmental Impact Report
5.2-11

5.2 COLUSA CROSSINGS

identifies that population and housing growth and the attendant environmental impacts would result in a significant and unavoidable impact.
The proposed Colusa Crossings project includes the potential development 1,380 total housing units. Based on housing densities identified by the California Department of Finance of 2.85 persons per household, the projected resident population would be 3,933. This iS an increase of 69.1 percent over the estimated existing City population of 5,6891.
Although the Colusa Crossings project is not currently within the City of Colusa and will require annexation by the City, the project is located entirely within the Planning Area as identified within the General Plan Update. The General Plan land use diagram is used as the "blueprint" to guide future development in the Planning Area. The land use diagram identifies the Colusa Crossings site as a future urban growth area. Projected growth for the site is illustrated in Table 2.3 of the General Plan Update. The Colusa Crossings project is consistent with General Plan land USe designations identified in the land use diagram and Table 2.3.
A substantial increase in population has the potential to impact a variety of services and utilities in the area which can be evaluated on a quantitative basis, such as the need for additional sewer facilities or fire stations which in and of itself causes environmental impacts. Impacts to these areas are discussed in the service and utilities sections of the EIR.
The General Plan contains goals, policies and implementing actions related to land use, circulation, open space and conservation, municipal services, noise, safety, and community design. Some of these goals, policies and implementing actions are intended to accommodate the anticipated population growth in a manner that reduces impacts to the extent feasible on the locai environment.

Master plans analyze future need for a service and/or utility. As stated previously, project related impacts to service and/or utility providers are discussed in the appropriate section of this EIR. The master plans for the various services and utilities are partially based on General Plan future population and housing projections. As the Colusa Crossings project is consistent with the General Plan Land Use Diagram and therefore considered in the future population projections for the City. All master plans should have or will consider the Colusa Crossings population in projecting the need for future facilities and infrastructure. Impact 4.2.1 discusses the increased population growth as a result of implementation of the proposed General Plan. The Colusa Crossings project is included in the buildout projections in the proposed General Plan and would not increase the population beyond the growth identified in the projections. The Colusa Crossings development would be consistent with development analyzed under Impact 4.2.1 associated with the General Plan Update and would not contribute to any additional environmental effects beyond those disclosed under Impact 4.2.1; therefore, at the project level this impact would be less than signiticant.
Applicable General Plan Policies and Implementing Actions
The Land Use Element policies LU-1.1, LU-5.1, LU-5.2, LU-5.3, LU-5.4, LU-6.3, LU-6.4, LU-8.2, and LU- 9.2 and implementing actions LU-2.1.c, and LU-9.2.a seek to direct housing development in a manner that provides sufficient housing for the anticipated population, while reducing some of the adverse environmental impacts such as conflicts with agricultural operations, inadequate service systems, and loss or alteration of historic homes and areas.

TRANSPORTATION AND CIRCULATION

The reader is referred is to Section 4.3 of this MEIR for background information pertaining to the existing setting for traffic and circulation for the City of Colusa.
Standards of Significance
Section 4.3 of the MEIR identifies the standard of significance for transportation and circulation. All of these standards were evaluated for the proposed Colusa Crossings project as to the potential impact levels the project may cause.

Methodology
Generally, the methodology for analyzing the potential traffic and roadway impacts a large project may have is the availability of a project specific traffic study. As part of the Design Review process under Implementing Action CIR-1.1-b, the project would be required to dedicate adequate right-of-way for the circulation system shown on the Circulation Map of the General Plan. The traffic study would identify the potential project specific traffic and roadway impacts. As a traffic study has not been completed for the Colusa Crossings at this time, project specific impacts and mitigations measures cannot be determined. Therefore, the methodology to determine the traffic and roadway impacts the Colusa Crossings is to analyze the General Plan Circulation Element, the project's proposed interaction with the existing roadway system, the City Level of Service standards and the potential for General Pian policies and implementing actions to mitigate the Colusa Crossings potential impacts.

Impacts Dismissed from Further Discussion

The proposed project is considered to have either no impact or a less than significant impact under the following standards as discussed below and therefore these issues are not further discussed in this section.

1) Changes in air traffic patterns, including either an increase in traffic levels or a change in location that results in substantial safety risks - the Colusa Crossings project is considered to have a less than significant impact because it would not necessitate changes in operations nor would it require expansion of the Colusa County Airport and the project would not interfere with air traffic patterns.
Because project specific traffic and circulation information is not available for the project, further analysis of project traffic impacts cannot be competed at this time. The reader is referred to Table 5.2.2 which identifies areas requiring additional information to complete a thorough
environmental analysis.

NOISE

5.2 COLUSA CROSSINGS

Standards of Significance

Section 4.4 of the MEIR identifies the standard of significance for noise. All of these standards
were evaluated for the proposed Colusa Crossings project as to the potential impact levels the
project may cause.

Methodology

Project specific potential noise impacts were determined using a combination of the General Plan Noise Element and Section 4.4 of the General Plan MEIR, and application of accepted noise prediction and sound propagation algorithms. A site specific noise study was not
completed for the Colusa Crossings project. Therefore, project specific noise impacts could not
be fully evaluated.
Impacts Dismissed from Further Discussion
The proposed project is considered to have either no impact or a less than significant impact under the following standards as discussed below and therefore these issues are not further
discussed in this section.

1) Exposure of persons to, or generation of, excessive groundborne vibration or groundborne noise levels - the Colusa Crossings project is not located near a source of
groundborne vibration, such as a railroad, therefore is expected to have no impact.

2) or a project within the vicinity of a private airstrip, exposure of people residing or working in the project area to excessive noise levels - there are no private airstrips within the project vicinity, therefore the Colusa Crossings project is considered to have no impact.
3) For a project located within an airport land use plan, or within two miles of a public airport or public use airport if such a plan has not been adopted, exposure of people residing or working in the area to excessive noise noise contours for the Colusa
County Airport are identified in Figure 4.4-1. This figure illustrates that the Colusa Crossings project site is located outside of the noise contours for the Colusa County Airport and therefore, the project would not subject future residents or workers to noise impact from the Colusa County Airport. This impact is further discussed as it relates to it the General Plan Planning Area in Section 4.4 under Impact 4.4.4.
Because a project specific noise survey was not completed for the project, further analysis of project noise impacts cannot be competed at this time. The reader is referred to Table 5.2.2 which identifies areas requiring additional information to complete a thorough environmental a
analysis.

AIR QUALITY

5.2 COLUSA CROSSINGS

Standards of Significance
Section 4.5 of the MEIR identifies the standard of significance for air quality. All of these standards were evaluated for the proposed Colusa Crossings project as to the potential impact levels the
project may cause.

Methodology
Estimates of regional emissions generated by project traffic and other sources can be identified by air emissions software programs such as URBEMIS-2002, EMFAC2007, or CALINE4. Because the Colusa Crossings project does not provide adequate information regarding project specific Uses, mainly due to the preliminary nature of the project, project specific air emissions evaluation
cannot be completed at this time.
Impacts Dismissed from Further Discussion
The proposed project is considered to have either no impact or a less than significant impact under the following standards as discussed below and therefore these issues are not further
discussed in this section.

1) Create objectionable odors affecting a substantial number of people - the Colusa Crossings project consists of residential, educational, commercial and recreational uses. Uses of this type are generally not considered to cause objectionable orders. During construction various diesel-powered vehicles and equipment in use on the site would create odors. These sources are mobile and transient in nature, and the emission occurs at a substantial distance from nearby receptors (which provides for dilution of odor- producing constituents). These odors would be temporary and unlikely to be noticeable beyond the project boundaries. Therefore the project is expected to have a less than significant impact. Further discussion of objectionable odors is included in Impact 4.5.3 as it pertains to the General Plan Planning Area.
Because a project specific air emissions analysis was not completed for the project, further determination of project air quality impacts cannot be competed at this time. The reader is referred to Table 5.2.2 which identifies areas requiring additional information to complete a thorough environmental analysis.
GEOLOGY, SEISMICITY, SOILS AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
The reader is referred to Section 4.6 of this MEIR for background information pertaining to the existing setting for geology, soils and hazardous materials for the City of Colusa.
Standards of Significance
Section 4.6 of the MEIR identifies the standard of significance for geology, soils, and hazardous materials. All of these standards were evaluated for the proposed Colusa Crossings project as to the potential impact levels the project may cause.

Methodology
This analysis of geology, soils hazards, human health and risk of upset included the review of existing documentation, field review of the project area and consultation with applicable local, state, and federal agencies. Documentation included a quarterly report on leaking

underground storage tank sites by the Central Valley RWQCB, and a review of hazardous material site information on the website of the California Department of Toxic Substances
Control.

Impacts Dismissed from Further Discussion
The proposed project is considered to have either no impact or a less than significant impact under the following standards as discussed below and therefore these issues are not further
discussed in this section.

1) Exposure of people or structures to potential substantial adverse effects, including the risk of loss, injury or death, involving:

i) Rupture of a known earthquake fault, as delineated on the most recent Alquist- Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Map issued by the State Geologist for the area or based on other substantial evidence of a known fault;

ii) Strong seismic ground shaking;

iii) Seismic-related ground failure, including liquefaction;

iv) Landslides.

As identified in the General Plan Safety Element, no active or potentially active faults underlie the City of Colusa, based on published geologic maps. Surface evidence of faulting has not been observed. However, the City of Colusa may experience ground shaking from earthquakes outside the area. Still, the best geologic evidence indicates that Colusa would experience only low-intensity shaking from faults outside the County. Additionally, all buildings constructed would be required to comply with the City's construction seismic standards. Based upon known soil, groundwater, and ground
shaking conditions within the Planning Area, the potential for liquefaction beneath the Planning Area is considered low. The potential for ground lurching, differential settlement, or lateral spreading occurring during or after seismic events in the Planning Area is also considered low. The project site is relatively flat, no landslides would occur. This impact is further discussed as it relates to the General Plan Planning Area in Section
4.6 under Impact 4.6.3. 2) Substantial soil erosion or the loss of topsoil - the Colusa Crossings project is not
expected to result in impacts to soil erosion of the loss of topsoil with implementation
of existing regulations, General Plan policies and implementing actions as discussed under Impact 4.6.1 in Section 4.6 (Geology, Soils, and Hazardous Materials).
3) Location of development on a geologic unit or soil that is unstable, or that would become unstable as a result of development, and potentially result in on- or off-site landslide, lateral spreading, subsidence, liquefaction or collapse. As described in Section 4.6, there are no identified active faults within the Planning Area or in Colusa
County and as such, the project would not be located on an unstable geologic unit or cause the geologic unit to become unstable. Policies and Implementing Actions discussed under Impact 4.6.1 would reduce potential instability associated with soil
erosion to a less than significant level. This impact is further discussed as it relates to
the General Plan Planning Area in Section 4.6 under Impact 4.6.1 and Impact 4.6.3.

4) Location of development on soils incapable of adequately supporting the use of septic tanks or alternative wastewater disposal systems, where sewers are not

5.2-16

5.2 COLUSA CROSSINGS

available for the disposal of wastewater. The Colusa Crossings project would not use septic tanks as it will be required to connect to the City's wastewater system.
5) Location of development on a site which is included on a list of hazardous materials sites compiled pursuant to Government Code Section 65962.5 and, as a result, would it create a significant hazard to the public or the environment. Section 4.6 of this MEIR identifies the location of hazardous materials sites within the Planning Area. The Colusa Crossings site is not identified as a hazardous materials site in Section 4.6.
This impact is further discussed as it relates to the General Plan Planning Area in
Section 4.6 under Impact 4.6.5.
6) For a project located within an airport land use plan or within two miles of a public airport or public use airport where such a plan has not been adopted, a safety hazard for people residing or working in the project area. The Colusa Crossings Site is not located in the Colusa County Airport land use plan area.

7) For a project within the vicinity of a private airstrip, a safety hazard for people residing or working in the project area. No private airstrips are located in the Planning Area or within the Colusa Crossings project site vicinity.
8) Exposure of people or structures to a significant risk of loss, injury or death involving wildland fires, including where wildlands are adjacent to urbanized areas or where residences are intermixed with wildlands. Existing development surrounding the
Colusa Crossings project site consist of residential and agricultural uses. No wildlands are within the project vicinity.
9) Result in the loss of availability of a known mineral resource that would be of value
to the region and residents of the state. Neither the City's existing General Plan nor the County's General identifies any mineral resources in the proposed Planning Area, including the project site.
10) Result in the loss of availability of a locally-important mineral resource recovery site delineated on a local general plan, specific plan or other land use plan. Neither the City's existing General Plan nor the County's General identifies any mineral resources in the proposed Planning Area.

As identified in Table 5.2-2, a Phase | Environmental Site Assessment and a Preliminary
Geotechnical Report have not been prepared. Subsequent environmental analysis would address potential impacts associated with expansive soils and the potential for the project to result in exposure to hazardous conditions or materials. Standards of significance that were found to result in a potential impact with project implementation are discussed under the individual impact statements below.

Hazardous Material Use, Storage and Transport

Impact 5.2.4 Implementation of the Colusa Crossings project may include uses that would Use and/or store hazardous materials, and increase the amount of traffic
carrying these materials. This is considered a potentially significant impact.

The standard of significance for this impact has been established in CEQA Guidelines Appendix
G as follows:

City of Colusa Colusa General Plan
July 2007 Draft Master Environmental Impact Report
5.2-17

5.2 COLUSA CROSSINGS

l. Emit hazardous emissions or handle acutely hazardous material, substances, or waste within one-quarter mile of an existing or proposed school.
2. Create a significant hazard to the public or the environment through the routine transport, use, or disposal of hazardous materials.
The Colusa Crossings project includes the development of commercial uses. These uses may involve the use and/or storage of hazardous materials. This would increase the likelihood of local residents and employees coming into contact with such materials, as well as increase the potential risk of an accident that could cause serious injury or death. Moreover, increased usage of hazardous materials means than more such materials would need to be transported to the Planning Area. Risks associated with the transport of hazardous material include accidents or spills that release these materials into the environment.
The Colusa Crossings project includes a 10 acre site set aside for an elementary school. The project's commercial land use designations are all within ¼ mile of this site. As discussed above, commercial uses may include the use, transport or storage of hazardous materials. This impact is further discussed as it relates to the General Plan Planning Area in Section 4.6 under Impact
4.6.4.

Applicable General Plan Policies and Implementing Actions
The City of Colusa General Plan Policy SAF-4.1 requires the disciosure of the use and storage of hazardous materials in existing and proposed industrial, commercial, and public-use activities, and the siting of hazardous waste disposal facilities, in accordance with federal, State and local regulations. Implementing Action SAF-4.1.a requires the compliance with and enforcement of Chapter 6.95, Section 25503 of the California Health and Safety Code governing the storage of hazardous materials. Implementing Action SAF-4.1.b requires the referral of any development proposal that may be affected by, or affect, the storage, handling, disposal or transportation of hazardous materials to the Fire Depariment, the Colusa County Sheriff's Office, and other appropriate agencies for review.
The General Plan update policies and implementing actions listed above along with the requirements of the federal Hazardous Materials Transport Act - Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 49, the California Occupational Safety and Health Act, CCR Title 8, the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Act- Underground Storage Tank Law, the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act, the Hazardous Materials Release Response Plans/Inventory Law, Food and Agriculture Code, Uniform Fire Code, CR Title 19, (see section 5.0 for a brief description of these regulations) as well as others would reduce or eliminate the potential hazards posed by the increased use, storage and transport of hazardous materials engendered by future development. Impacts after mitigation would be less than significant.
Mitigation Measures

None required.

HYDROLOGY AND WATER QUALITY
The reader is referred to Section 4.7 of this MEIR for background information pertaining to the existing setting for hydrology and water quality for the City of Colusa.

Colusa General Plan
Draft Master Environmental Impact Report City of Colusa
July 2007
5.2-18

5.2 COLUSA CROSSINGS

Standards of Significance
Section 4.7 of the MEIR identifies the standard of significance for hydrology and water quality. All of these standards were evaluated for the proposed Colusa Crossings project as to the potential impact levels the project may cause.

Methodology
This analysis is based on a review of City documents, inciuding the City of Colusa Subdivision Standards Resolution, along with meetings and discussions with City staff. The analysis reviewed U.S. Geological Survey topographic maps and aerial photographs, and considered various comments from letters received in response to the Notice of Preparation for this MEIR. Data from the Western Regional Climate Center (WRCC) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) provided background information on the local climate. Information on flooding came from FEMA maps covering the Planning Area and FEMA's Flood Insurance Study for Colusa County, California and Incorporated Areas.
Impacts Dismissed from Further Discussion
The proposed project is considered to have either no impact or a less than significant impact under the following standards as discussed below and therefore these issues are not further
discussed in this section.

1) Substantial depletion of groundwater supplies or substantial interference with groundwater recharge such that there would be a net deficit in aquifer volume or a lowering of the local groundwater table level (e.g., the production rate of pre-existing nearby wells would drop to a level which would not support existing land uses or planned uses for which permits have been granted) - the Colusa Crossings project is anticipated to use groundwater sources. However, it is anticipated that there is ample groundwater resources available, studies have indicated that groundwater in the vicinity is between 5 to 10 feet below the ground surface (ENGEO, 2006). This impact is further discussed as it relates to the General Plan Planning Area in Section 4.7 under
Impact 4.7.5.
2) Inundation by seiche, tsunami, or mudflow - the Colusa Crossings project will not be impacted by seiche, tsunami or mudflow due to the relatively flat location, underlying and surrounding soils, it's distance from an ocean or large body of water, and lack of
nearby volcanoes.
3) Exposure of peopie or structures to a significant risk of loss, injury or death involving flooding, including flooding as a result of the failure of a levee or dam - The Colusa Crossings project is within the influence of five reservoirs, which retain water from the Sacramento River or its tributaries, which could cause damage in the City of Colusa if their dams were to fail: Lake Oroville, Shasta Lake, Whiskeytown Lake, Black Butte Lake,
and East Park Reservoir. While the probabilily of dam failure at any given time is remote. For further discussion on the reader is referred to Section 4.7 Dam Failure, which discuses the potential for dam failure in the Planning Area.
Because a project specific drainage report was not completed for the project, further analysis of the project impacts to hydrology and water quality, except for potential flood hazards cannot be competed at this time. The reader is referred to Table 5.2.2 which identifies areas requiring
additional information to complete a thorough environmental analysis.

City of Colusa Colusa General Plan
July 2007 Draft Master Environmental Impact Report

5.2 COLUSA CROSSINGS

Flood Hazards

Impact 5,2.5 Implementation of the project could expose development to potential flooding. This is considered a potentially significant impact.
The standard of significance for this impact has been established in CEQA Guidelines Appendix G as follows:
1. Placement of housing within a 100-year flood hazard area as mapped on a Federal Flood Hazard Boundary or Flood Insurance Rate Map or other flood hazard delineation
map.

2. Placement within a 100-year flood hazard area structures which would impede or redirect flood flows.

3. Exposure of people or structures to a significant risk of loss, injury or death involving flooding, including flooding as a result of the failure of a levee or dam.
The majority of the project site is located in Zone AE, which outlines the 100-year floodplain. The Zone AE designation reflects FEMA's conclusion that the levee system along the Colusa Drain does not meet the standards set forth in its levee policy. Therefore, FEMA computed the floodplain on the landward side of the Colusa Drain levee system under the assumption that the Colusa Drain levees do not act as an effective flow barrier. Base flood elevations for the 100- year flood, represented on the FIRMs for the western portion of the Planning Area, range from elevation 52 feet at the north portion of the impacted area to elevation 49 feet near the south portion of the impacted area.
FEMA floodplain regulations require that finished floor elevations for structures (buildings) placed in a 100-year floodplain be elevated at or above the applicable base flood elevation. According to the City's Subdivision Standards Resolution, building finished floors are required to be set a minimum of 1.0 foot above the FEMA base flood elevation. Because of its location within the AE flood zone, the Colusa Crossings project is required to be in accordance with this
resolution.
The project proposes to construct levees on the northern, western and southern boundaries. The levees would be approximately 3 to 6 feet in height. The levees would be designed to remove the potential for 100-year floodwaters entering the project site, thereby protecting structures and residents. A draft hydrologic analysis for the project (MBK Engineers, 2006) indicated that the project itself would cause an elevation in water levels of the Colusa Basin Drain of only 0.1 foot in one location. Therefore, the project would not contribute to any increase in peak flows within
the drain.

This impact is further discussed as it relates to the General Plan Planning Area in Section 4.7
under impact 4.7.4.
Applicable General Plan Policies and Implementing Actions
City of Colusa General Plan Policy SAF-2.1 requires the City to continue to regulate all uses and development in areas subject to potential flooding through land use planning, zoning and other appropriate actions. Implementing Action SAF-2.1.a requires that development proposals will be referred to the Fire and Building Department/Building Division, Public Works Department, and City Engineer to address potential flooding. Implementing Action SAF-2.2.a requires the City to adopt a Storm Drainage Master Plan for Colusa. Implementing Action SAF-2.2.b requires that

5.2 COLUSA CROSSINGS

new development be designed to ensure that the cumulative rate of peak runoff does not
exceed pre-development levels.
The inclusion of a levees system along the northern, western and southern boundaries of the project site, the General Plan policies and implementing actions listed above, and the FEMA floodplain regulations would reduce or eliminate the potential flooding hazards posed by development on the project site. Impacts after implementation would be less than significant.

Mitigation Measure

None required.

BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES

The reader is referred to Section 4.8 of this MEIR for background information pertaining to the existing setting for biological resources for the City of Colusa.
Standards of Significance

Section 4.8 of the MEIR identifies the standard of significance for biological resources. All of these
standards were evaluated for the Colusa Crossings project as to the potential impact levels the
project may cause.

Methodology
Generally, in order to determine the potential for a project to impact biological resource a biological survey is competed for the project site. Available information pertaining to the natural resources of the proposed site are reviewed and documented. Review of pertinent documents such as the California Natural Diversity Data Base (CDFG 2006a); the CNPS Inventory of Rare and Endangered Vascular Plants of California (CNPS 2001); a list of special-status plant and wildlife species from the USFWS for Colusa and eight surrounding quadrangles and for Colusa County (USFWS 2006b); the Jepson Manual: Higher Plants of California (Hickman 1993); and the City of Colusa General Plan (City of Colusa 1994) is completed. A biologist conducts reconnaissance-
level fieldwork which includes general plant and wildlife surveys and general habitat assessments. However, in the case of the Colusa Crossings project, a biological survey has not been completed; therefore a thorough analysis of potential biological impacts cannot be instigated at this time.

Impacts Dismissed from Further Discussion

The proposed project is considered to have either no impact or a less than significant impact under the following standards as discussed below and therefore these issues are not further discussed in this section.

1) Will the project conflict with the provisions of an adopted Habitat Conservation Plan, Natural Community Conservation Plan, or other approved local, regional or state habitat conservation plan there is no adopted Habitat Conservation Plan, Natural Community Conservation Plan, or other approved local, regional or state habitat conservation plan in the area of the project. Therefore, the Colusa Crossings project would have no impact. This impact is further discussed as it relates to the General Plan Planning Area in Section 4.8 under Impact 4.8.7.

City of Colusa Colusa General Plan
July 2007 Draft Master Environmental Impact Report
5.2-21

5.2 COLUSA CROSSINGS

2) Will the project have substantial interference with the movement of any native resident or migratory fish or wildlife species or with established native resident or migratory wildlife corridors, or impediment of the use of native wildlife nursery sites. Although the Colusa Crossings project is within the Pacific Flyway, implementation of the project would not result in the obstruction of the movement of migratory birds as the project site does not contain any wetlands or areas suitable for migratory habitat. This impact is further discussed as it relates to the General Plan Planning Area in Section 4.8 under Impact 4.8.5.
Because a site specific biological survey was not completed for the project, further analysis of project impacts to biological resources cannot be competed at this time. The reader is referred is to Table 5.2.2 which identifies areas requiring additional information to complete a thorough environmental analysis.

HISTORIC AND CULTURAL RESOURCES

The reader is referred to Section 4.9 of this MEIR for background information pertaining to the existing setting for cultural resources for the City of Colusa.
Standards of Significance
Section 4.9 of the MEIR identifies the standard of significance for cultural resources. All of these standards were evaluated for the Colusa Crossings project as to the potential impact levels the
project may cause.

Methodology
The cultural resources staff of PMC conducted archaeological and historical investigations for the General Plan Planning Area. These investigations included a records search at the Northwest Information Center at Sonoma State University, a sacred lands search conducted by the Native American Heritage Commission, consultation with the Native American community, and archival research. In addition, PMC conducted a search of the University of California Museum of Paleontology collections database for paleontological resources within the Specific Plan Area boundaries. However, a Colusa Crossings site-specific archaeological and historical investigation was not completed for the project.
Because a site specific cultural resources survey was not completed for the project, further analysis of project impacts to cultural, historic, and archaeological resources cannot be competed at this time. The reader is referred to Table 5.2.2 which identifies areas requiring additional information to complete a thorough environmental analysis. Standards of significance that were found to result in a potential impact with project implementation are discussed under the individual impact statements.

VISUAL RESOURCES/LIGHT AND GLARE
The reader is referred to Section 4.10 of this MEIR for background information pertaining to the existing setting for visual resources/light and glare for the City of Colusa.

Colusa General Plan City of Colusa
Draft Master Environmental Impact Report July 2007

5.2 COLUSA CROSSINGS

Standards of Significance
Section 4.10 of the MEIR identifies the standard of significance for visual resources/light and glare. All of these standards were evaluated for the Colusa Crossings project as to the potential
impact levels the project may cause.

Methodology
The visual resource analysis is based on field visits of the Colusa crossings project area, review of existing City documents, and review of the land use map. This analysis is based on anticipated changes within the project area from implementation of the land use map.
Impacts Dismissed from Further Discussion
The proposed project is considered to have either no impact or a less than significant impact on following standards based on reasoning listed and therefore are not further analyzed in this EIR for the Colusa Crossings project.
1) Substantial damage to scenic resources, including, but not limited to, trees, rock outcroppings, and historic buildings within a state scenic highway - the Colusa Crossings project will not cause substantial damage to scenic resources. No buildings exist on the project site therefore it will not affect any historic buildings. Additionally, no state scenic highways are within the General Plan Planning Area. This impact is further discussed as it relates to the General Plan Planning Area in Section 4.10 under Impact
4.10.2.

Standards of significance that were found to result in a potential impact with project implementation are discussed under the individual impact statements.
Loss of Scenic Views and Visual Character

Impact 5.2.6 Implementation of the project would result in the loss of views of scenic area
and change the visual character within the project vicinity. This is considered
a signific ant impact.

The standard of significance for this impact has been established in CEQA Guidelines Appendix G as follows:

1. Will the project have a substantial adverse affect on a scenic vista.

2. Will the project create substantial degradation of the existing visual character or quality of a site and its surroundings.
Impacts to scenic views are subjective by nature and dependent on the personal opinion of the viewer. Views of surrounding natural resources are important to some and not so important to others Furthermore, the potential change in character from vacant/agricultural lands to urban/residential development is also subjective. What one viewer may see and an empty lot with no aesthetic value, another may see as an open space area supplying habitat for nature which adds to the aesthetic quality of the area.
City General Plan policies declare that scenic areas such as river banks, the Highway 20 corridor and the Sacramento River waterfront as well as views of Sutter Buttes and the Coastal Range

should be protected. The project site is currently used in agricultural production, and existing views of this area just outside the current urban boundaries are predominantly of agricultural fields. Views from public vantage points and surrounding existing development of Sutter Buttes and the Coastal Range may be impaired due to construction of the Colusa Crossings project. Additionally, construction of the project would change the existing character of the Highway 20 corridor, as it is now surrounded, where it runs adjacent to the project's location, by agricultural uses and the fair grounds. Construction of the project would not affect views of the Sacramento River as it is not located near the site. This impact is further discussed as it relates to the General
Plan Planning Area in Section 4.10 under Impact 4.10.1 and Impact 4.10.3.
Applicable General Plan Policies and Implementing Actions
City of Colusa Policy PRC - 12.1 requires new development in scenic areas (e.g., river banks, Highway 20 corridor, and Sacramento River waterfront) to use planning design, construction and maintenance techniques designed to protect the views of the area. Policy PRC-12.2 requires the City to develop and implement specific design standards intended to accomplish the goal of protecting scenic viewsheds. Implementation Program PRC-12.2.a requires the City to develop and implement specific criteria, consisting of design guidelines and development standards, to maximize protection of the City's scenic viewsheds. Implementation Program PRC-12.2.b: requires each development proposal to provide an environmental/visual constraint map, based on the findings of a project-specific site assessment that identifies significant viewsheds for the Sacramento River, Sutter Buttes and Coastal Range that could be potentially impacted by the project. Policy PRC - 12.4 states that the City should work to ensure that new roads, parking and utilities be designed to minimize visual impacts. Unless limited by geological or engineering constraints, utilities shall be installed underground and roadways and parking areas shall be landscaped and designed to accommodate the natural terrain.
While the City General Plan incorporates a number of policies and implementing actions to
remove potential impacts to scenic resources of the City including a policy for strict design guidelines to produce aesthetically pleasing project, development of a parcel of land that iS currently agricultural uses or vacant into uses that would place buildings in the viewshed of existing uses would invariably change the existing character of the landscape and impact views of scenic resources. There is no feasible mitigation for the loss of these views from existing development or the alteration in visual character of the site. Therefore; project implementation will result in significant and unavoidable impacts.

Mitigation Measures

None available.

COMMUNITY SERVICES

The community services section considers those services that supply fire and police protection, educational and parks and recreation facilities in the City. The reader is referred to Section 4.11 of this MEIR for background information pertaining to the existing setting for community services
for the City of Colusa.

Standards of Significance

Section 4.11 of the MEIR identifies the standard of significance for park and recreational services. All of these standards were evaluated for the Colusa Crossings project as to the potential impact leveis the project may cause.

5.2 COLUSA CROSSINGS

Methodology
The primary source of information for fire protection services in the Colusa area was discussions with the Colusa Fire Department as well as service standards provided in the General Plan.
Other information came from research of other public documents and discussions with
appropriate agencies.
Impacts Dismissed from Further Discussion
The proposed project is considered to have either no impact or a less than significant impact on following standards based on reasoning listed and therefore are not further analyzed in this EIR
for the Colusa Crossings project.
1) Result in a substantial adverse physical impact associated with the provision of new or physically altered governmental facilities, the construction of which could cause significant environmental impacts, in order to maintain acceptable park acreage
ratios, or other performance objectives for parks. The Colusa Crossings project includes
the provision for 21 to 51 acres of parkland. This parkland will be required to be developed at the applicant's expense. The Colusa Crossings project does not include the provision of any new or altered governmental facilities; therefore, there would be
no impact. This impact is further discussed as it relates to the General Plan Planning Area in Section 4.11 under Impact 4.11.1.1 through Impact 4.11.4.2.
2) Require new recreational facilities or expansion of recreational facilities, which might have an adverse physical effect on the environment. The Colusa Crossings project proposes approximately 21 to 51 acres of new parkland. Through implementation of the General Plan Policy PRC-2.3 and Implementing Actions PRC-2.3.a, PRC-2.3.b, and PRC-2.3.c, along with CEQA review of individual projects, would reduce or eliminate potential environmental impacts associated with the construction of new parks and
recreational facilities. Impacts after implementation would be less than significant. This
impact is further discussed as it relates to the General Plan Planning Area in Section
4.11.4 under Impact 4.11.4.2.
3) will the project create substantial adverse physical impacts associated with the provision of new or physically altered school facilities, need for new or physically altered school facilities, the construction of which could cause significant environmental impacts, in order to maintain acceptable service ratios, response times or other performance objectives for educational services. The Colusa Crossings project
includes the set aside of 10 acres for the development of an elementary school.
Additionally, Government Code Section 65995(h) states that the payment or satisfaction of a fee, charge, or other requirement levied or imposed pursuant to provisions of SB 50 and Section 17620 of the Education Code is deemed to be fuil and complete mitigation of the impacts of any legislative or adjudicative act related to the provision of adequate school facilities. As, the Colusa Unified School District imposes impact fees for new development, this mitigates any impacts from the development of school facilities incurred as a result of project development. This impact is further discussed as it relates to the General Plan Planning Area in Section 4.11.3 under Impact
4.11.3.1.

Standards of significance that were found to result in a potential impact with project implementation are discussed under the individual impact statements.

Result in Additional Fire Protection Facilities

Impact 5.2.7 The proposed project would increase the demand for fire protection services, and may lead to longer response times to emergency calls. This is considered a potentially significant impact.
The standard of significance for this impact has been established in CEQA Guidelines Appendix G as follows: will the project create substantial adverse physical impacts associated with the provision of new or physically altered governmental facilities, need for new or physically altered governmental facilities, the construction of which could cause significant environmental impacts, in order to maintain acceptable service ratios, response times or other performance objectives for fire protection.
The project proposes a maximum of 1,380 residential units, along with 381,150 square feet of commercial floor space. Assuming approximately 2.85 persons per unit, the resulting population increase would be approximately 3,933 persons. The Colusa Fire Department attempts to maintain a ratio of paid fire personnel to population of 1 to 1,000. Based on that ratio, the
project would create an additional demand for approximately four paid firemen. Additionally, the Fire Department has established a ratio of one pumper per three personnel. Given the estimated number of firemen generated by the project, the Fire Department would require one additional pumper.

According to the Fire Chief, the Fire Department can provide an average 3-4 minute response
time to anywhere within the current service area. Access problems are slight throughout the City of Colusa, as most of the City's streets are configured in a grid pattern that facilitates emergency vehicle movement. Traffic is the primary issue the Fire Department considers when answering a service call (Colusa LAFCO, 2005).

Response times would not be affected severely, as the fire station at 750 Market Street is within approximately 1.28 miles from the proposed project. The Department has stated that projects outside a 2.5-mile radius of the station may require a longer response time, thereby jeopardizing public safety. While the project site is within the 2.5-mile radius, future development ihroughout the City, especially in the southern region, would increase the number of calls for service. The existing station in the northern portion of the City is not capable of adequately responding to the anticipated number of calls from this future development. As a result, the Department has identified the need for a fire station in the southern half of Colusa. A fire station in that area
would reduce response times to the project site and would ensure the Fire Department meets proposed standards and iSO levels in proposed General Plan policies. Additionally, service to
existing residents in the in the City would not be marginalized due to an overburdened fire
department.

The City of Colusa Fire Department would provide fire protection for the project site upon annexation. However, infrastructure for water lines does not currently exist and will require construction. Water lines would be installed such that the proposed project will meet the minimum flows specified by the Uniform Fire Code.
The Fire Department provides input regarding proposed development through the Planned Development Review Committee, which in turn sends a report to the Planning Commission and the City Council.

Applicable General Plan Policies and Implementing Actions
City of Colusa General Plan Policy MFS-1.1 states that the City shall ensure that new development does not exceed the capacity of the City to provide adequate municipal facilities and does not overly burden the capacity of existing service levels. New growth shall pay for the facilities and services it requires without an additional burden to existing residents. Implementing Action MFS-1.1.b and 1.1c requires Development Impact Fees and AB 1600 Analysis. Policy MFS- 3.1 states that the City shall maintain its own fire protection services for City residents and businesses through the provision of adequate facilities and equipment. Implementing Action MFS-3.1.a requires Monitor Facilities and Equipment Needs. Policy MFS-3.3 states that the City shall require that the construction and staffing of fire station facilities be scheduled such that they are ready to serve new development as it occurs and is implemented by Implementing Action MFS-3.3.a, 3.3.b and 3.3.c requiring Capital Improvement Program, Specific Plans and Development Review.

Mitigation Measures

MM 5.2.7 The project applicant will coordinate directly with the Colusa Fire Department, City staff, and adjacent project developers to prepare a fire services plan for the project. The plan will determine service requirements for all project land uses and ratios for public/private fire services that are acceptable to the Fire Department. The plans must meet current City performance standards for response times, personnel, equipment and infrastructure needs.

Timing/Implementation: Prior to annexation to the City of Colusa.

Enforcement/Monitoring: City of Colusa Fire Department and City of
Colusa Planning Department.
Implementation of mitigation measure MM 5.2.7, along with the General Plan policies and implementing actions, would ensure adequate provision of fire protection services that meet the anticipated demand by the project, without adversely affecting service to other areas of the City. Impacts after mitigation would be less than significant.
Result in Additional Police Protection Facilities

Impact 5.2.8 The project would increase the demand for police protection services, which would require additional staff and facilities. This is considered a potentially
significant impact.
The standard of significance for this impact has been established in CEQA Guidelines Appendix G as follows: will the project create substantial adverse physical impacts associated with the provision of new or physicaily altered governmental facilities, need for new or physically altered governmental facilities, the construction of which could cause significant environmental impacts, in order to maintain acceptable service ratios, response times or other performance
objectives for police protection.
As previously noted, project development proposes a maximum of 1,380 residential units and approximately 381,150 square feet of commercial space. The Colusa Police Department attempts to maintain a ratio of paid police personnel to population of 2 to 1,000. The proposed project would create an additional demand for approximately eight paid law enforcement

5.2 COLUSA CROSSINGS

officers, based on an estimated resident population of 3,933. Additionally, the Department prefers to maintain one patrol car for every two officers. The proposed project would require an additional eight officers and four patrol cars to maintain service and staffing levels with development of the project.
Response times would not be affected severely, as the police station is approximately 1.2 miles from the project site. However, implementation of the Colusa Crossings project may generate the need for expanding the existing police facilities to accommodate the additional officers required to serve the project.
Additionally, future development throughout the City will increase the number of calls for service. The existing station would not be capable of meeting the number of calls generated by new development. Because of the numerous proposed developments in the southern half of Colusa, and the inadequacy of the existing facility, the Department has identified the need for a station in the southern half of the City. Should a police station be constructed, response times tO
the development would be quicker.
This impact is further discussed as it relates to the General Plan Planning Area in Section 4.11.2
under Impact 4.11.2.1.

General Plan Policy SAF-6.1 states that the City shall strive to provide high-quality police services for City residents and businesses with adequate facilities, modern technology and current training to maximize job performance. To implement this Policy, Implementing Action SAF-6.1.a, 6.1.b, 6.1.c states that Law Enforcement Technology and Service Level, Mutual Aid Agreements, and City Budget and Rate Review. Policy SAF-6.2 states that the City shall incorporate police protection considerations into City and community activities through Implementing Action SAF- 6.2.a by Development Review. Policy MFS-2.1 states that the City shall maintain acceptable law enforcement services for City residents and businesses through the provision of adequate
facilities and equipment through Implementing Action MFS-2.1.a Monitor Facilities and Equipment Needs. Policy MFS-2.2 states that the City shall require that the construction and staffing of police facilities be scheduied such that they are ready to serve new development as it occurs and will be implemented through Implementing Action MFS-2.2.a and 2.2.b Capital Improvement Program and Development Review. Policy MFS-2.3 states that all development shall pay City-adopted impact fees for fair-share contributions to police facilities and equipment
improvements.

Mitigation Measures

MM 5.2.8 The project applicant will coordinate directly with the Colusa Police
Department, City staff, and adjacent project developers to prepare a police services plan for the project. The plan will determine service requirements for all projected land uses and ratios for public/private police services that are acceptable to the Police Department. The plan must meet current City performance standards for response times, personnel, equipment and
infrastructure needs.

Timing/Implementation: Prior to annexation to the City of Colusa.

Enforcement/Monitoring: City of Colusa Police Department and City of
Colusa Planning Department.

5.2 COLUSA CROSSINGS

Implementation of the mitigation measure MM 5.2.8, along with the General Plan policies and implementing actions, would ensure adequate police protection services for the project and for the City overall. Impacts after mitigation would be less than significant.

Result in Additional Park and Recreational Facilities

Impact 5.2.9 The project would encourage an increase in the local population, thereby leading to an increase in the demand for park and recreation services. This is considered a potentially significant impact.

The standard of significance for this impact has been established in CEQA Guidelines Appendix
G as follows: will the project result an increase in the use of existing neighborhood and regional parks or other recreational facilities such that substantial physical deterioration of the facility would occur or be accelerated.

General Plan Policy PRC - 2.3 sets a park development ratio of at least five acres of parkland for
every 1,000 Colusa residents. Project development would generate a total of 3,933 new residents, based on development of a maximum 1,380 residential units. This would translate into a need for almost 20 acres of parkland for residents in the new development. The project proposes development of approximately 21 to 51 acres of parkland. Either acreage would exceed the recommended ratio. While there are no specific details about the future parks, the project would appear to provide adequate parkland for new residents.
This impact is further discussed as it relates to the General Plan Planning Area in Section 4.11.4 under Impact 4.11.4.1 and Impact 4.11.4.2.
Applicable General Plan Policies and Implementing Actions
The General Plan Policies include Policy PRC-2.2 which states that the City shall provide sufficient parkland and recreational facilities to meet the needs of all residents while new development continues to occur and implemented through Implementing Action PRC-2.2.a and 2.3 which includes a Parks and Recreation Master Plan and Park Standards and Guidelines. Policy PRC 2.3 states that the City shall ensure that a park development ratio is met of no less than five acres of parkland for every 1,000 Colusa residents, which is implemented through Implementing Action PRC-2.3.a, 2.3.b, and 2.3.c Development Review, Dedications, Fees and Exactions, and
Development Agreements. Policy MFS-1.1 states that the City shall ensure that new development does not exceed the capacity of the City to provide adequate municipal facilities and does not overly burden the capacity of existing service levels. New growth shall pay for the facilities and services it requires without an additional burden to existing residents. This Policy is implemented through Implementing Action MFS-1.1.b and 1.1.c: Development Impact Fees and
AB 1600 Analysis.
The Colusa Crossings project will provide adequate park facilities on-site. While there are no specific details about the future parks, the project would appear to provide adequate parkland for new residents.

PUBLIC SERVICES AND UTILITIES

Public services and utilities considers to those services which supply water, wastewater, storm drainage, and solid waste facilities and infrastructure. The reader is referred to Section 4.12 of this MEIR for background information pertaining to the existing setting for public services and utilities for the City of Colusa.

Standards of Significance
Section 4.12 of the MEIR identifies the standards of significance for public services and utilities. These standards were evaluated for the Colusa Crossings project as to the potential impact
levels the project may cause.

Methodology
Generally, evaluation of potential impacts on water, wastewater, solid waste and storm water facilities and services is based on consultation with City staff and review of City documents and utility master plans, a AB 610 analysis, information available through the California Integrated Waste Management Board, whose website contains the Solid Waste Information System (SWIS) database, and other various informational documents. Because of the preliminary nature of the Colusa Crossings project, project specific water, wastewater and stormwater demands and need to improve existing facilities have not been determined at this time.
Impacts Dismissed from Further Discussion
The proposed project is considered to have either no impact or a less than significant impact on following standards based on reasoning listed and therefore are not further analyzed in this EIR for the Colusa Crossings project.
1) Comply with federal, state and local statues and regulations related to solid waste the Colusa Crossings project will be required to comply with City regulations for the reduction of solid waste as implemented by General Plan Policy PRC 10.1. This impact is further it discussed as it relates to the General Plan Planning Area in Section 4.12.4 under
Impact 4.12.4.1.

2) Meet or exceed wastewater treatment requirements of the applicable Regional Water Quality Control Board. The City of Colusa holds the RWQCB permit for their WWTP. The expansion of the City's WWTP is a separate project from the Colusa Crossings project and will require its own environmental review under CEQA. Therefore, this impact is not further evaluated in this section. This impact is further discussed as it relates to the General Plan Planning Area in Section 4.12.3 under Impact 4.12.3.1.
Because a project specific utility analysis was not completed for the project, further determination of project public services and utilities impacts cannot be competed at this time. The reader is referred to Table 5.2.2 which identifies areas requiring additional information to
complete a thorough environmental analysis.

5.3 BROOKINS RANCH

This section analyzes the potential environmental impacts of the Brookins Ranch project. This section is intended to evaluate the environmental impacts of the Brookins Ranch project to the greatest extent possible. This section addresses environmental impacts to the extent information is available and details of project are known. Environmental issues to be addressed through subsequent environmental review are identified, consistent with the requirements of CEQA Guidelines Section 15176(c).

5.3.1 EXISTING SETTING

PROJECT LOCATION

As described in Section 3.0, Project Description, Brookins Ranch is a residential project on 161 acres just southwest of City limits. The project site is bounded to the north by Colusa High School and a large lot residential area. The west of the project site is bounded by Will S. Green Avenue. Beyond Will S. Green Avenue are agricultural lands as well as a light industrial complex. The project is bounded by agricultural lands to the south and agricultural lands and residential areas to the east. Wescott Road is located approximately one-quarter mile to the east. The City of Colusa Wastewater Treatment Facility is located southwest of the southwestern corner of the project. See Figure 5.3-1 for project vicinity.
will S. Green Avenue is the primary access road to the site. Will S. Green Avenue is a two-lane, paved rural road that becomes a gravel road prior to reaching the Colusa Wastewater Treatment Plant. Regional access to and from this area is provided by SR 20 and SR 45.
SURROUNDING USES

Nearby land uses include agricultural lands, single-family homes, a light industrial complex, a public high school, and a wastewater
SROOIINS treatment facility. Figure 5.3-3 shows an aerial view of the project and surrounding land uses. Bordering the northwest corner of the project is a light industrial complex. This
RANOT complex is separated from the project site by Will S. Green Avenue and surrounded by agricultural lands. Bordering the east of the project are residential neighborhoods and agricultural lands. Beyond these uses is
Wescott Road. Wescott Road is a north- south, two-lane collector that extends south
from Bridge Street (SR 45). It serves the residential area located in southeastern Colusa. The southwest corner of the project site is bordered by the City of Colusa Wastewater Treatment Plant. Beyond the treatment plant lays more agricultural lands. The Colusa County Airport is located approximately one mile to the southeast of the project site. The Colusa County Airport is located on SR 20, south of the City of Colusa and within the City of Colusa sphere of influence.

EXISTING CONDITIONS

A single-family residence and associated farm buildings are currently located at the northeast corner the site. The project site has been used for agricultural uses in the past yet has not been farmed recently. The vegetation of the site consists of predominately of agriculturai crops. During

City of Colusa Colusa General Plan
July 2007 Draft Master Environmental Impact Report
5.3-1

5.3 BROOKINS RANCH

the winter months, this habitat is typically left fallow. In a fallow state, the project site is primarily covered with ruderal (weedy) vegetation including species such as dandelion, redstemed filaree, soft chess, and cranesbill geranium. Crop species expected to occur on the site will vary with the changing seasons. Some of the crops known to grow in the area include barley, oats, wheat, alfalfa, and rice.

The topography of the project site and vicinity is typical of the region, consisting of flatlands. The site generaily slopes in a southwesterly direction towards the wastewater treatment facility which is adjacent to the southwest corner of the project. The topography is moderately flat and ranges from approximately 52 feet above sea level to 48 feet above sea level. Surface runoff likely flows toward and enters the drainage ditches that run along the western and southern portions of the site. All of the drainage ditches are unlined and there is emergent vegetation growing in them. According to the Biological Resources Assessment completed on the project site, these drainage ditches are active with water during the wet months of the year yet are primarily dry during dry months.
CURRENT AND PROPOSED GENERAL PLAN LAND USE DESIGNATIONS
The site is designated in the Colusa County General Plan as Agriculture-Transition {A-T) and as shown in Figure 5.3-2, the site is currently zoned Exclusive Agriculture by Colusa County and located in Special Planning Area (SPA) #2. The proposed General Plan Update would designate the site for low density residential use (4-8 dwelling units per acre). The proposed General Plan requires SPAs to develop under a Specific Plan or Planned Unit Development (PUD); since Brookins Ranch is proposed exclusively for residential use rather than a mix of uses, this project is anticipated to be developed as a PUD.
5.3.2 PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The Brookins Ranch project is located at the southeastern corner of the City of Colusa, just outside of the City Limits and within unincorporated Colusa County (County) and would require annexation by the City. The Brookins Ranch project proposes to construct 600 low-density residential single-family detached homes on 127.5 acres (Table 5.3-1). The existing residence would remain on the site within a 4.3-acre parcel. Approximately 19 acres of the project site would be developed for parks, greenways, a detention basin, or would be kept as open space. Approximately one acre would be set aside for a fire station and 2.4 acres would be used to develop a public parking lot adjacent to Colusa High School. All necessary public improvements within the subdivision will be constructed by the developer. Off-site improvements will be constructed as agreed upon with the service provider. Approximately 11.8 acres at the southwest corner of the site and southwest of the old railroad right-of-way would be reserved for future residential development. Brookins Ranch would be developed as a Planned Unit Development to provide flexibility in site design and density distribution.

PROJECT BACKGROUND
The City received an application for consideration of the Brookins Ranch project. Because the entire site is not within the City limits, the City may consider annexation of the 161 acre site located between the existing City limits and the project area (see Figures 3.3 and 3-4). The Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCo) is tasked with review and approval of the formation and logical extension of local agency boundaries and will review the City's request for annexation. Currently, the property is located within Colusa County jurisdiction but included within the City of Colusa's Sphere of Influence.

5.3 BROOKINS RANCH

LAND USES

The Brookins Ranch project proposes to annex the approximately 160 acre project site into the City of Colusa from the County of Colusa. The project proposes to construct up to 600 single family detached homes on approximately 127.5 acres of the site. These residential lots would be clustered into four separate areas with varying densities to create diversity and avoid the feel of a homogenized community. A variety of open space features have been integrated throughout the project. The northern boundary of the new community would consist of a 3.8-acre park. Two other half acre parks would be developed, one near the center of the project and the other near the eastern boundary. A total of 5.2 acres would be provided for community greenways, which would contribute to recreational amenities and enhanced pedestrian access within the
project, as well as access to uses beyond the project site such as the adjacent high school. A 3.6 acre detention basin at the south end of the project would provide the required storage area for storm water during the rainy season. An open space buffer would be placed at the western boundary of the site adjacent to the light industrial uses bordering the northwest corner of the project and the City wastewater treatment facility near the southwest corner of the site. One acre of the site would be dedicated as a lot for a fire station site. This site would be located in the northern portion of the Brookins Ranch project near the eastern boundary. Finally, 2.4 acres of the site are designated as a public parking area. This parking area would be established at the northwest corner of the site adjacent to Colusa High School. See Figure 5.3-4, Site Map.

CIRCULATION PLAN

The vehicular circulation system consists of a modified grid street pattern that provides access throughout the community while emphasizing slower speeds leading to potentially safer streets. The project would provide an access point at the north by extending 5th Street as well as two connections to Will S. Green Avenue on the west side. Tennant Drive on the east side of the
project would also provide an access point. As part of the Design Review process under Implementing Action CIR-1.1-b, the project would be required to dedicate adequate right-of- way for the circulation system shown on the Circuiation Map of the General Plan subject to the

reimbursement for dedications in excess of the project's fair share contribution to such
improvements.

The roadways would be designed to meet the standards of the City of Colusa and the pattern
has been designed to ensure safe speeds and minimize conflicts with pedestrians and cyclists.

PHASING

Development of the project area will be phased to meet the following objectives:
Protection of public health, safety and welfare.

Provision for adequate infrastructure and public facilities concurrent with development
of each phase.

Orderly build-out of the community based upon market and economic conditions.

Ultimate development phasing of the Brookins Ranch project will be determined by the
landowner and or builder/developer based upon real estate market conditions. Phasing will
coincide with appropriate levels of infrastructure. Phasing sequence may change over time depending on these various factors, and individual phases could overlap or develop
concurrently. The developer, as required by the City, will install phased infrastructure
improvements to support each phase.

RECREATIONAL OPEN SPACE/NATURAL OPEN SPACE

A total of 15.5 acres are to be reserved for open space and parks. Open space buffers totalling 5.5 acres would provide separation between the residential neighborhoods and light industrial uses bordering the northwest corner of the project and the City wastewater treatment facility near to the southwest corner of the site. Additionally, 4.8 acres of the site would be reserved for
a total of three neighborhood parks. A total of 5.2 acres would be provided for community greenways, which would contribute to recreational amenities. In addition to this total, 3.6 acres of land would be reserved for a detention basin.

ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN

Architectural standards would be incorporated into the project in the form of minimum construction standards. These standards would address items such as foundations, siding material, accessory structures, roofing materials, gables and overhangs, and architectural
treatments.

PUBLIC FACILITIES AND SERVICES

The following are the public utilities and public services required to serve the Brookins Ranch project including sewer, water, storm drain, gas, electricity and solid waste. Public services include police and fire protection. Please refer to the Community Services section of this document beginning at page 5.3-41 as well as the Public Services and Utilities section beginning
on page 5.3.46 for a more extensive discussion for each of these services listed:

Domestic Water will be provided to the project site by the City of Colusa. The project site would require the extension or upgrade of existing City of Colusa-owned water lines.

5.3 BROOKINS RANCH

Sanitary Sewer will be served to the project site through connection into the existing City of Colusa system. Construction of a lift-station and a pressure sewer may be required for portions of the site, and construction of off-site infrastructure will be required to connect to existing sewer infrastructure.
Storm Water management will be conducted by the City of Colusa Department of Public Works. Storm water will be detained in a City operated drainage system for the purpose of maintaining the pre-development peak rate of discharge during storm events to and including a 100-year event. In the southern end of the site a detention pond facility will be constructed just north of the old railroad right-of-way.
Gas and Electricity will by provided by Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E), through gas and electricity transmission lines constructed underground within public right-of-ways or public utility easements. These facilities are available at the boundaries of the project site.
The City of Colusa Police Department will provide police protection services to the
project area.
The City of Colusa Fire Department will provide fire protection services to the project
area.

5.3.3 SUBSEQUENT CEQA REVIEW

ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW FOR PROJECT UNDER CEQA

This MEIR is intended to provide environmental analysis of the Brookins Ranch project to the
maximum extent allowable, consistent with the requirements of State CEQA Guidelines Section
15175. Therefore, subsequent CEQA review of the Brookins Ranch project shall occur as applications for entitlements are submitted and shall be subject to and limited by the provisions for review of subsequent projects previously described in a Master EIR set forth in CEQA Guidelines Sections 15177 and Section 15178.

AREAS OF INSUFFICIENT AVAILABLE INFORMATION REQUIRING FURTHER STUDY

CEQA Guidelines Section 15176 discusses the required contents of a Master EIR. Section
15176(c) requires that a description of potential impacts of anticipated projects for which there is not sufficient information reasonably available to support a full assessment of potential impacts be disclosed in an MEIR. For the Brookins Ranch project, areas of insufficient information do exist which would require further analysis to determine the potential for specific environmental impacts of the project. Potential impacts not addressed in the MEIR and associated areas of insufficient information are identified in Table 5.3-2.

5.3.4 IMPACTS AND MITIGATION MEASURES

LAND USE AND AGRICULTURAL RESOURCES

The reader is referred to Section 4.1 of the MEIR for background information pertaining to the
existing setting for land use in the City of Colusa.

Standards of Significance
Section 4.1 of the MEIR identifies the standard of significance for land use and agriculture. All of these standards were evaluated for the Brookins Ranch project as to the potential impact levels
the project may cause.

Methodology

Evaluation of potential land use impacts of the Brookins Ranch project was based on review of planning documents pertaining to the City of Colusa, including the City of Colusa General Plan, City of Colusa Zoning Ordinance, a field review of the City and surrounding areas, and consultation with appropriate agencies. Potential impacts to the Brookins Ranch project area outside the City limits were based on a review of planning documents relevant to those areas, including the Colusa County General Plan, consultation with appropriate agencies, and field review. The analysis contained is herein is based on buildout conditions for the General Plan, as
described in Section 4.0.

The agricultural analysis utilized information from the California Department of Conservation Farmiand Conversion Report 1998-2000, the California Department of Conservation Important Farmland Map of Colusa County, the Soil Survey of Colusa County prepared by the NRCS in 2002, and the Summary of County Agricultural Commissioners' Reports, 2003-2004 by the National Agricultural Statistics Service. Based on this information, the analysis assessed the potential value of agricultural lands in the project area, and utilized the Brookins Ranch project land uses to determine potential impacts.

The focus of this land use analysis is on physical environmental impacts that would result from the changes in land use requested for the project.
Specific impacts and project consistency issues associated with biological resources, hydrology and water quality, geology, visual resources, noise, traffic, public services, and utilities are addressed in the respective technical sections and the reader is referred to those sections for detailed analysis of other relevant environmental effects as a result of project development.
Impacts Dismissed from Further Discussion
The project is considered to have either no impact or a less than significant impact on following standards based on reasoning listed and therefore are not further analyzed in this EIR for the
Brookins Ranch project.
1) Physical division of an established community -- the Brookins Ranch project is located on the southern border of the City of Colusa. There is urban development adjacent to the eastern and northern borders of the project site and open space/agricultural land on the remaining three sides. The project site is not surrounded by an established community, therefore the Brookins Ranch project will not divide a community and the project is

considered to have no impact. Please refer to Impact 4.1.1 in Section 4.1 (Land Use and Agricultural Resources) for additional information.
2) Conflict with any applicable land use plan, policy or regulation of an agency with jurisdiction over the project (including, but not limited to, the general plan, specific plan, or zoning ordinance) adopted for the purpose of avoiding or mitigating an
environmental effect - the Brookins Ranch project is in compliance with the General Plan Update land use designations. The Zoning Ordnance is required to be updated to comply with these land use designations. Therefore, the Brookins Ranch project is in compliance with all applicable land use plans and considered to have no impact. Please refer to Impact 4.1.3 in Section 4.1 (Land Use and Agricultural Resources) for additional information.

3) Conflict with any applicable habitat conservation plan or natural community conservation plan. No applicable habitat conservation or natural community pians exist on the project site, therefore the Brookins Ranch project is considered to have no
impact. Please refer to Impact 4.1.4 in Section 4.1 (Land Use and Agricultural Resources)
for additional information.

Standards of significance that were found to result in a potential impact with project implementation are discussed under the individual impact statements.

Agricultural Land Conversion

Impact 5.3.1 The project would convert land from agricultural use to urban uses. This is considered a significant impact.

The standard of significance for the conversion of farmland to urban uses has been established
in CEQA Guidelines Appendix G aIs follows: the conversion of Prime Farmland, Unique Farmland,
or Farmland of Statewide Importance as shown on the maps prepared pursuant to the Farmland
This impact was evaluated for the proposed General Plan Update, which includes the Brookins
Ranch project, in Impact 4.1.3 in Section 4.1 (Land Use and Agricultural Resources), which identified mitigation for the impact (MM 4.1.5) and concluded that implementation of proposed General Plan policies and implementing actions would reduce the impact to less than
significant.

The Important Farmland Map for Colusa County classifies the entire site as Prime Farmland (see General Plan Figure 6.3). The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) categorizes farmland throughout the nation. One important factor used in the determination of farmland type by the USDA is the soil (along with growing season, and moisture supply). According to the Biological Resources Assessment for the site, there are three separate types of soil on the site: Moonbend silt loam, Scribner silt loam, and Vina loam. The Moonbend silt loam and Vina loam are rated an
Excellent soil for irrigated crops by the Storie Index in the Soil Survey of Colusa County. This means that these soils are well suited to intensively cultivated crops that are climatically adapted to the region. The Scribner silt loam is rated less high for irrigated crops as soils that are only fairly well suited to agriculture because of moderate soil depth; moderate to steep slopes, restricted permeability in the subsoil; a clayey, sandy, or gravelly surface layer; somewhat restricted drainage; acidity; low fertility; or a hazard of flooding.
The project site has previously been used for agricultural operations. Development of the site into for residential and public uses would remove this area from potential agricultural production and

July 2007 Draft Master Environmental Impact Report
5.3-9

5.3 BROOKINS RANCH

result in the permanent loss of 160 acres of prime and locally important farmland to urban development. This is considered a significant impact.
Applicable General Plan Policies and Implementing Actions
General Plan Policy LU-4.1 requires that the City shall support efforts to preserve existing agricultural land uses in areas outside the City's sphere of influence. The Implementing Action LU-4.1.b Public/Private Partnerships states that the City will work with Colusa County, nonprofit organizations and landowners to establish policies that will protect prime agricultural areas around the sphere of influence, including a process to implement techniques such as transfer of development rights, agricultural easements and farmland trusts.
General Plan Policy LU-5.1 states that development patterns shall tier off of existing development and avoid leap-frogging, including areas intended for annexation that are presently outside the City limits. The Implementing Action LU-5.4.a: Annexation Phasing Plan requires that the City will prepare and adopt an Annexation Phasing Plan to ensure a logical progression of annexations that meet the City's economic and planning needs and do not strain City services, resources, and infrastructure. The plan will also include criteria, consistent with the Cortese-Knox-Hertzberg Reorganization Act of 2000, that promote the preservation of open space and agricultural lands.

Mitigation Measures

MM 5.3.1 The project applicant shall mitigate for loss of Prime Farmland, Farmland of Statewide Importance or Farmland of Local Importance by either (1) granting a farmland conservation easement to or for the benefit of the City and/or an entity approved by the City, at a 1:1 ratio for each acre developed, or (2) if the City adopts a farmland conservation program, by payment of an in lieu fee as established by the farmland conservation program, which shall be reviewed and adjusted periodically to ensure that the fee is adequate to offset the cost of purchasing farmland conservation easements at a 1:1 ratio.

Timing/Implementation: Prior to issuance of grading permits.
Enforcement/Monitoring: City of Colusa Planning Department.
Implementation of MM 5.3.1 would help reduce the impact of the loss of important farmland by conserving comparable agricultural lands. However, because the project will remove Prime Farmland and Farmland of Local Importance from existing agricultural production without the assurance of replacement with like lands, the project would still result in the direct loss of Prime Farmland and Farmland of Local Importance. Therefore, this impact is considered significant and unavoidable.

Agricultural/Urban Interface

Impact 5.3.2 The project would result in the placement of urban uses adjacent to agricultural uses, creating is potential conflicts. This is considered a potentially significant impact.

The standards of significance for this impact discussion are established in CEQA Guidelines Appendix G as follows: conflict with existing zoning for agricultural use, or a Williamson Act contract, and/or changes in the existing environment which, due to their location or nature, could result in conversion of farmland to non-agricultural use. This impact was evaluated for the
Colusa General Plan City of Colusa Draft Master Environmental Impact Report July 2007
5.3-10

5.3 BROOKINS RANCH

proposed General Plan Update, which includes the Brookins Ranch project, in Impact 4.1.3 in Section 4.1 (Land Use and Agricultural Resources), which identified mitigation for the impact (MM 4.1.5) and concluded that implementation of proposed General Plan policies and implementing actions would reduce the impact to less than significant.
The project proposes the development of residential, commercial and professional uses at the western edge of the Colusa Sphere of Influence. The Colusa County General Plan designations adjacent to the project boundary include Agriculture-General (A-G) to the south, Agriculture- Transition (A-T) and the City limits to the east, the City limits and a small portion of Urban Residential (UR) to the north, and the City limits and a small portion of Industrial (I) to the west. NO Williamson Act contract properties are located adjacent or in the vicinity of the Brookins
Ranch project site.
The project would place more urban development adjacent to agricultural operations to the west, which could create conflicts between these land uses. These conflicts have the potential to result in adjacent agricultural land conversion to a non-agricultural use.
Generally, residential uses generate the most conflicts with agricultural operations. Agriculture/urban interface conflicts vary depending on the type of agricultural use, but generally include, although are not limited to, the following:
Inconveniences or discomforts associated with dust, smoke, noise, and odor from
agricultural operations.
Restrictions on agricultural operations (such as pesticide application) along interfaces
with urban uses.

Conflicts with farm equipment and vehicles using roadways.
Trespassing and vandalism on active farmlands.
Increased pressure to convert adjacent agricultural land to urban uses as a result of above-mentioned conflicts and increases in property values.

Applicable General Plan Policies and Implementing Actions
City of Colusa General Plan Policy LU-2.1 requires that development projects are to be reviewed on a case-by-case basis to ensure adequate urban/agriculture buffers are included as part of project design. Implementing Action LU-2.1.a requires the mitigation of significant urban/agriculture impacts be included as conditions of approval. Policy PRC-8.1 requires the City to evaluate the impacts of a development project on agricultural operations, specifically projects adjacent to agricultural lands and to take measures to reduce conflicts with those lands. This is be implemented through the development review process described in Implementing Actions LU-2.1.b and PRC-8.1.a, including provision of a buffer between new development and agricultural uses and notification of the County's right-to-farm ordinance. Mitigation measures are identified below to require an urban/agriculture buffer and notification of adjacent farming activities.

Mitigation Measures

MM 5.3.2a An urban/agriculture buffer between existing agriculture and proposed project development along the along the southern boundaries of the project

City of Colusa Colusa General Plan
July 2007 Draft Masfer Environmental Impact Report
5.3-11

5.3 BROOKINS RANCH

shall be included as a part of project design and shown on the tentative map and improvement plans. The urban/agriculture buffer area shall separate
existing agricultural uses and future project development and shall be a minimum of 250 feet in width or, based on the specific proposed a uses, a width acceptable to the City that provides an adequate transition between the proposed uses and the adjacent agricultural uses. The buffer may include roadways, infrastructure easements, parkland, and open space.
Prior to approval of the final map, the project applicant shall identify and implement a financing mechanism to fund maintenance of the buffer.

Timing/Implementation: Buffer shall be shown on the tentative map and
improvement pians and a financing mechanism entered into prior to final map approval. The
buffer shali be maintained as long as
agricuitural uses remain adjacent to the project

Enforcement/Monitoring: City of Colusa Planning Department

MM 5.3.2b Concurrent with recordation of the Final Map, the project applicant shall
cause to be recorded a disclosure to potential buyers of the dwelling units of the adjacent agriculture uses. This disclosure shal be in a form acceptable to the City and generally consistent with those required under Colusa County's Right to Farm Ordinance.
Timing/Implementation: Disclosure statement to be reviewed and
approved by the City prior to tentative map
approvai and shail be recorded concurrently
with the Final Map

Enforcement/Monitoring: City of Colusa Planning Department
Implementation of the mitigation measures MM 5.3.2a and MM 5.3.2b would provide a buffer between proposed project development and adjoining agricultural uses, reducing potential odor, noise, and nuisance conflicts and would also ensure that future buyers within the proposed project are notified of the adjacent agricultural uses. Implementation of these mitigation measures would reduce agriculture/urban interface conflicts to less than significant.
POPULATION, HOUSING AND EMPLOYMENT

existing setting for population, housing, and employment of the City of Colusa.
Standards of Significance
Section 4.2 of the MEIR identifies the standard of significance for population and housing. All of these standards were evaluated for the Brookins Ranch project as to the potential impact levels
the project may cause.

Methodology
City staff conducted research on demographic and housing conditions, utilizing existing documents and other information sources. Information was obtained from governmental
agencies through their websites. Among these agencies were the U.S. Bureau of the Census, the California Department of Finance, and the California Employment Development Department. The recently adopted City of Colusa Housing Element was an additional source of information on housing and socioeconomic conditions as well as housing policies.

Impacts Dismissed from Further Discussion

The project is considered to have either no impact or a less than significant impact on following standards based on reasoning listed and therefore are not further analyzed in this EIR for the Brookins Ranch project.
1) Displacement of substantial numbers of existing housing, necessitating the construction of replacement housing elsewhere the Brookins Ranch project site does have one existing rural residential house which will remain, therefore the project would have no impact. Please refer to Impact 4.2.3 in Section 4.2 (Population, Housing, and Employment) for additional information.
2) Displacement of substantial numbers of people, necessitating the construction of replacement housing elsewhere - the Brookins Ranch project site will not remove any existing housing or population, therefore the project would have no impact. Please refer to Impact 4.2.3 in Section 4.2 (Population, Housing, and Employment) for additional
information.

Standards of significance that were found to result in a potential impact with project implementation are discussed under the individual impact statements.
Population and Housing Growth

Impact 5.3.3 Development of the project has the potential to result in a substantial increase in population and the number of housing units, with its attendant
environmental impacts. This is a considered a potentially significant impact.

The standard of significance for the introduction of a substantial number of people into an area has been established in CEQA Guidelines Appendix G as follows: a project will introduce substantial growth or concentration of population in an area either directly or indirectly (e.g., through projects in an undeveloped area or extension of major infrastructure) that results in a physical effect on the environment. This impact was evaluated for the proposed General Plan Update area in Impact 4.2.1 in Section 4.2 (Population, Housing, and Employment), which identifies that population and housing growth and the attendant environmental impacts would result in a significant and unavoidable impact.
The Brookins Ranch project includes the potential development 600 total housing units. Based on housing densities identified by the California Department of Finance of 2.85 persons per

City of Colusa Colusa General Plan
July 2007 Draft Master Environmental Impact Report
5.3-13

5.3 BROOKINS RANCH

household, the projected resident population would be 1,710. This is an increase of 30 percent over the estimated existing City population of 5,6891.
Although the project site is not currently within the City of Colusa, the project is located entirely within the Sphere of Influence and corresponding Planning Area as identified within the General Plan Update. The General Plan land use diagram is used as the "blueprint" to guide future development in the Planning Area. It is anticipated that future development projects in the unincorporated portion of the Planning Area would annex to the Cily prior to development. The land use diagram identifies the Brookins Ranch site as a future urban growth area. Projected growth for the site is illustrated in Table 2.2 of the General Plan Update. The Brookins Ranch project is consistent with General Plan land use designations identified in the land use diagram and Table 2.2.

A substantial increase in population has the potential to impact a variety of services and utilities in the area. These impacts are discussed in the Community Services and Public Services and Utilities Sections below.

As the Brookins Ranch project is consistent with the General Plan Land Use Diagram and therefore considered in the future population projections for the City. The Brookins Ranch development would be consistent with development analyzed under Impact 4.2.1 associated with the General Plan Update and would not contribute to any additional environmental effects beyond those disclosed under Impact 4.2.1; therefore, at the project level this impact would be less than significant.
Applicable General Plan Policies and Implementing Actions
The Land Use Element policies LU-1.1, LU-5.1, LU-5.2, LU-5.3, LU-5.4, LU-6.3, LU-6.4, LU-8.2, and LU- 9,2 and implementing actions LU-2.1.c, and LU-9.2.a seek to direct housing development in a manner that provides sufficient housing for the anticipated population, while reducing some of the adverse environmental impacts such as conflicts with agricuitural operations, inadequate service systems, and loss or alteration of historic homes and areas.

Mitigation Measures

None Required.

Methodology
Generally, the methodology for analyzing the potential traffic and roadway impacts a large project may have is the preparation of a project specific traffic study. As part of the Design Review process under Implementing Action CIR-1.1-b, the project would be required to dedicate adequate right-of-way for the circulation system shown on the Circulation Map of the General Plan. The traffic study would identify the potential project specific traffic and roadway impacts. As a project-specific traffic study has not been completed for the Brookins Ranch project at this time, project specific impacts and mitigations measures cannot be determined. Therefore, the methodology to determine the traffic and roadway impacts of the Brookins Ranch project is to analyze the General Plan Circulation Element, the project's proposed interaction with the existing roadway system, the City Level of Service standards and the potential for General Plan policies and implementing actions to mitigate the project's potential
impacts.
Impacts Dismissed from Further Discussion
The Brookins Ranch project is considered to have either • less than significant impact or no
impact on the following standards based on reasoning listed and therefore is not further analyzed in this EIR for the Brookins Ranch project.
1) Changes in air traffic patterns, including either an increase in traffic levels Or a change in location that results in substantial safety risks - the Brookins Ranch project is considered to
have a less than significant impact because it would not necessitate changes to the operations nor require expansion of the Colusa County Airport and the project would not interfere with air traffic patterns. Please refer to impact 4.3.8 in Section 4.3 (Transportation and Circulation) for additional information.
Because project specific traffic and circulation information is not available for the project, further analysis of project traffic impacts cannot be competed at this time. The reader is referred to Table 5.3.2 which identifies areas requiring additional information to complete a thorough environmental analysis.

NOISE

The reader is referred to Section 4.4 of the MEIR for background information pertaining to the existing setting for noise in the City of Colusa.
Standards of Significance
Section 4.4 of the MEIR identifies the standard of significance for noise impacts. All of these
standards were evaluated for the Brookins Ranch project as to the potential impact levels the
project may cause.

Methodology

Project specitic potential noise impacts were determined using a combination of the General Plan Noise Element and Section 4.4 of the General Plan MEIR, and application of accepted noise prediction and sound propagation algorithms. A site specific noise study was not completed for the Brookins Ranch project. Therefore, project specific noise impacts could not be fully evaluated.

5.3 BROOKINS RANCH

Impacts Dismissed from Further Discussion
The Brookins Ranch project is considered to have either no impact or a less than significant impact on following standards based on reasoning listed and therefore are not further analyzed
in this EIR for the Brookins Ranch project.
1) Exposure of persons to, or generation of, excessive groundborne vibration or groundborne noise levels - the Brookins Ranch project is not located near a source of groundborne vibration, such as a railroad, therefore is expected to have no impact.
2) For a project within the vicinity of a private airstrip, exposure of people residing or working in the project area to excessive noise levels - there are no private airstrips within the project vicinity, therefore the Brookins Ranch project is considered to have no impact.
3) For a project located within an airport land use plan, or within two miles of a public airport or public use airport if such a plan has not been adopted, exposure of people residing or working in the area to excessive noise - noise contours for the Colusa County
Airport are identified in Figure 4.4-1 of the Noise section of the Colusa General Plan EIR.
This figure illustrates that the Brookins Ranch project site is located outside of the noise
contours for the Colusa County Airport and therefore, the project would not subject
future residents or workers to noise impact from the Colusa County Airport.
Because a project specific noise survey was not completed for the project, further analysis of project noise impacts cannot be competed at this time. The reader is referred to Table 5.3.2 which identifies areas requiring additional information to complete a thorough environmental
analysis.

AIR QUALITY

The reader is referred to Section 4.5 of the MEIR for background information pertaining to the
existing setting for air quality in the City of Colusa.

Standards of Significance
Section 4.5 of the MEIR identifies the standard of significance for air quality. All of these standards were evaluated for the Brookins Ranch project as to the potential impact levels the project may
cause.

Methodology
Estimates of regional emissions generated by project traffic and other sources can be identified
by air emissions software programs such as URBEMIS-2002, EMFAC2007, or CALINE4. A project specific air emissions evaluation has not been completed at this time.
Impacts Dismissed from Further Discussion
The proposed project is considered to a have either no impact or a less than significant impact on following standards based on reasoning listed and therefore are not further analyzed in this EIR
for the Brookins Ranch project.

1) Create objectionable odors affecting a substantial number of people the Brookins Ranch project consists of residential, public, and recreational uses. Uses of this type are

5.3-16

5.3 BROOKINS RANCH

generally not considered TO cause objectionable orders. During construction various diesel-powered vehicles and equipment in use on the site would create odors. These
sources are mobile and transient in nature, and the emissions would occur at a
substantial distance from nearby receptors (which provides for dilution of odor-producing constituents). These odors would be temporary and unlikely to be noticeable beyond the project boundaries. Therefore the project is expected to a have a less than significant
impact. Please refer to Impact 4.5.3 in Section 4.5 (Air Quality) for additional information.
Because a project specific air emissions analysis was not completed for the project, further determination of project air quality impacts cannot be competed at this time. The reader is
referred to Table 5.3.2 which identifies areas requiring additional information to complete a
thorough environmental analysis.

GEOLOGY, SEISMICITY, SOILS AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS

The reader is referred to Section 4.6 of the MEIR for background information pertaining to the existing setting for geology, soils, and hazardous materials in the City of Colusa.
Standards of Significance

Section 4.6 of the MEIR identifies the standard of significance for geology, soils, and hazardous materials. All of these standards were evaluated for the Brookins Ranch project as to the potential impact levels the project may cause.

Methodology
This analysis of geology, soils, hazards, human health and risk of upset included the review of existing documentation, field review of the project site and consultation with applicable local, state, and federal agencies. Documentation included a preliminary geotechnical report (Wallace-Kuhl and Associates, 2004), an Environmental Site Assessment (Wallace-Kuhl, 2004), a quarterly report on leaking underground storage tank sites by the Central Valley RWQCB, and a review of hazardous material site information on the website of the California Department of
Toxic Substances Control.

Impacts Dismissed from Further Discussion
The Brookins Ranch project is considered to have either no impact or a less than significant impact on following standards based on reasoning listed and therefore are not further analyzed in this EIR for the Brookins Ranch project.

1) Exposure of people or structures to potential substantial adverse effects, including the risk of loss, injury or death, involving:
Rupture of a known earthquake fault, as delineated on the most recent Alquist- Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Map issued by the State Geologist for the area or
based on other substantial evidence of a known fault.

i) Strong seismic ground shaking.

i) Seismic-related ground failure, including liquefaction; and

iv) Landslides.

City of Colusa Colusa General Plan
July 2007 Draft Master Environmental Impact Report
5.3-17

5.3 BROOKINS RANCH

As identified in the General Plan Safety Element, no active or potentially active faults
underlie the City of Colusa, based on published geologic maps. Surface evidence of
faulting has not been observed. However, the City of Colusa may experience ground shaking from earthquakes outside the area. Still, the best geologic evidence indicates that Colusa would experience only low-intensity shaking from faults outside the County. Additionally, all buildings constructed would be required to comply with the City's construction seismic standards. Based upon known soil, groundwater, and ground shaking conditions within the Planning Area, the potential for liquefaction beneath the Planning Area is considered low. The potential for ground lurching, differential
settlement, or lateral spreading occurring during or after seismic events in the Planning Area is also considered low. The project site is relatively flat, no landslides would occur.
Please refer to Impact 4.6.3 in Section 4.6 (Geology, Soils, and Hazardous Materials) for
additional information.

2) Substantial soil erosion or the loss of topsoil - the Brookins Ranch project is not expected
to result in impacts to soil erosion of the loss of topsoil, as the project site is located in a relatively flat location. Please refer Impact 4.6.1 in Section 4.6 (Geology, Soils, and Hazardous Materiais) for additional information and discussion implementation of existing regulations, General Plan policies and implementing actions that would ensure this impact is less than significant.

3) Location of development on a geologic unit or soil that is unstable, or that would
become unstable as a result of development, and potentially result in on- or off-site
landslide, lateral spreading, subsidence, liquefaction or collapse. As described n Section 4.6, there are no identified active faults within the Planning Area or in Colusa County and as such, the project would not be located on an unstable geologic unit or cause the geologic unit to become unstable. Please refer to Impact 4.6.3 in Section 4.6 (Geology,
Soils, and Hazardous Materials) for additional information.

4) Have soils incapable of adequately supporting the use of septic tanks or alternative
waste water disposal systems where sewers are not available for the disposal of waste water - Sanitary Sewer will be served to the project site through connection into the existing City of Colusa system. No alternative wastewater systems will be used on the project site.
5) Creation of a significant hazard to the public or the environment through the routine transport, use, or disposal of hazardous materials - the Brookins Ranch project will result in residential, public, and recreational uses. These are uses that are not associated with
transport or use of large quantities of hazardous materials. Therefore, this project is not expected to have an impact. Please refer to Impact 4.6.4 in Section 4.6 (Geology, Soils, and Hazardous Materials) for additional information.
6) For a project within the vicinity of a private airstrip, a safety hazard for people residing or working in the project area - there are no private airstrips in the Brookins Ranch project area. Therefore there will be no impact.
7) Impairment of the implementation of, or physical interference with, an adopted emergency response plan or emergency evacuation plan - the Brookins Ranch project effectiveness of an evacuation route can be adversely impacted it adopted Level of
Service (LOS) is not maintained on the evacuation route (please see the Transportation and Circulation section above). Impacts to emergency evacuation are considered less than significant.

Colusa General Plan City of Colusa

5.3 BROOKINS RANCH

8) Exposure of people or structures to a significant risk of loss, injury or death involving wildland fires, including where wildlands are adjacent to urbanized areas or where residences are intermixed with wildlands the Brookins Ranch project is located
adjacent to the downtown area of the City and will be annexed. City fire department services will be provided to the project area. Therefore, this is not expected to is have an impact.

9) Result in the loss of availability of a known mineral resource that would be of value to the
region and residents of the state. Neither the City's existing General Plan nor the County's General identifies any mineral resources in the proposed Planning Area, including the project site.
10) Result in the loss of availability of a locally-important mineral resource recovery site delineated on a local general plan, specific plan or other land use plan. Neither the City's existing General Plan nor the County's General identifies any mineral resources in the proposed Planning Area.

Standards of significance that were found to result in a potential impact with project implementation are discussed under the individual impact statements.

Expansive Soils

Impact 5.3.4 The project proposes construction on soils that are considered expansive. This is a potentially significant impact.
The standard of significance for this impact has been established in CEQA Guidelines Appendix G as follows: Location of development on expansive soil, as defined in Table 18-1-B of the Uniform Building Code (1994), creating substantial risks to life or property. This impact was evaluated for the proposed General Plan Update area in Impact 4.6.1 in Section 4.6 (Hydrology, Soils, and Hazardous Materiais) and determined to be less than significant as a result of compliance with existing regulations and implementation of the proposed General Plan policies
and implementing actions.
A preliminary geotechnical investigation by Wallace Kuhl and Associates indicated that the surface and near-surface soils are variable and contain significant concentrations of clays. Laboratory tests indicate these clays are moderately expansive, and therefore considered capable of developing moderate to high swelling with variations in moisture. This could have an adverse impact on building floor slabs, foundations and flatwork, unless measures are taken to
mitigate soil expansiveness.

Applicable General Plan Policies and Implementing Actions
Policy SAF-1.1 requires that the City shall continue to mitigate the potential impacts of seismic and geologic hazards through Implementing Action SAF-1.1.a, Development Review, SAF-1.1.b, Subdivision Ordinance Review and SAF-1.1.c, Un-reinforced Masonry Plan. Additionally, Policy SAF-1.2 requires the City will continue to maintain current information on seismic hazards and to take appropriate action upon discovery of significant seismic hazards. The associated Implementing Action SAF-1.2.a requires monitoring of California Geological Survey studies for potentially active faults in the vicinity of Colusa. As part of the Development Review process identified under Implementing Action SAF-1.lb, the project applicant provided a preliminary geotechnical report which identified the presence of expansive soils, which would require
mitigation.

City of Colusa Colusa General Plan
July 2007 Draft Master Environmental Impact Report
5.3-19

5.3 BROOKINS RANCH

Mitigation Measure

MM 5.3.4 Prior to tentative map approval, the project applicant shall submit a plan describing measures to minimize or eliminate the identified expansive soil hazard. Measures may include, but are not limited to, increasing foundation
depths, reinforcement, and saturation/pre-swelling of soils prior to slab placement. The City Engineer shall review and approve the plan.

Timing/Implementation: Prior to tentative map approval.

Enforcement/Monitoring: City of Colusa Public Works Department.
Implementation of the above mitigation measure, along with the General Plan update policies and implementing actions, would reduce or eliminate potential expansive soil problems. Impacts after mitigation would be less than significant.
Contamination of Project Site

Impact 5.3.5 The project would encourage development on lands that may have been contaminated from past activities. This is a potentially significant impact.

The standard of significance for this impact has been established in CEQA Guidelines Appendix G as follows: would the project be developed in on a site which is included on a list of hazardous materials sites compiled pursuant to Government Code Section 65962.5 and, as a result, would it create a significant hazard to the public or the environment. This impact was evaluated for the proposed General Plan Update area in Impact 4.6.7 in Section 4.6 (Hydrology, Soils, and Hazardous Materials).

Wallace Kuhl and Associates conducted an Environmental Site Assessment of the project site in 2004. The assessment included field reconnaissance and reviews of governmental agency databases. Research indicated that the project site has been used for the production of various crops, including most recently beans and wheat. These types of land use typically do not require applications of pesticides that are environmentally persistent. Likewise, the project site is unlikely to contain an area for the mixing, storage or application of pesticides. The assessment
concluded that there is a very low potential for any significant concentrations of residual agricultural chemicais existing in onsite soils. In addition, the assessment stated that the project site has no known history of having underground storage tanks, sumps, oil/water separators, agricultural chemical mixing facilities, or any other features of a hazardous materials nature. An aboveground storage tank and agricultural chemical mixing/storage location is on the 11.8- acre section of the project site south of the old railroad right of way. This would have no impact on other portions of the project site. Overall, potential impacts related to agricultural chemical
residues would be less than significant.

Mitigation Measures

None required.

Airport-Related Hazards

Impact 5.3.6 The Brookins Ranch project would be located less than 2 miles from a public airport and could result in safety risks for people residing or working in the project area. This is considered a potentially significant impact.

Colusa General Plan City of Colusa
Draft Master Environmental Impact Report July 2007

5.3 BROOKINS RANCH

The standard of significance for this impact has been established in CEQA Guidelines Appendix G as follows: For a project located within an airport land use plan or, where such a plan has not been adopted, within two miles of a public airport, would the project result in a safety hazard for people residing or working in the project area. This impact was evaluated for the proposed General Plan Update area in Impact 4.1.2 in Section 4.1 (Land Use).
The Colusa County Airport is approximately 1.5 miles southeast of the project site. The airport is located adjacent to and west It of State Route 20. It is surrounded on the south, west and north by commercial and industrial facilities, business and personal services, and public services. As previously noted, the east side of the airport is agricultural land, currently pasture and orchard. Residences, businesses and other activities located adjacent to or near the Colusa County Airport could be exposed to hazards arising from airport operations. Land use activities located within the flight path of aircraft could be exposed to potential accidents involving aircraft. Nearby buildings could interfere with airport operations as well as be exposed to accidents.
The Colusa County Airport Land Use Commission adopted the Colusa County Airport Comprehensive Land Use Plan (CLUP) on June 5; 1995. The CLUP provides the land use compatibility guidelines on which compatibility of land uses with airport operations are
determined. It also establishes the planning boundaries around the airport. These boundaries are
established for height, noise and safety.
Areas around airports are exposed to the possibility of aircraft accidents, even with well maintained aircraft and highly trained pilots. Airport safety areas are established to minimize the number of people exposed to aircraft crash hazards. This is accomplished by placing restrictions
in on land uses in various designated safety areas.

The CLUP for the Colusa County Airport designates three safety areas: the clear zone, the
approach/departure zone, and the over flight zone. The clear zone is near the end of the runway and is the most restrictive of the safety areas. The approach/departure zone is located under the takeoff and landing slopes and is less restrictive. The over flight zone is the area under the air traffic pattern and is the least restrictive of the safety areas. Figure 5-2 of the City General Plan Safety Element shows the safety areas established around Colusa County Airport. The project site is beyond the range of the three safety areas and therefore is free of restrictions associated with airport activities. Airport-related hazards would have a less than significant impact to the project.
Applicable General Plan Policies and Implementing Actions
Policy SAF-5.1 and Implementing Actions SAF-5.1.a would require the City to consult with the Colusa County Airport Land Use Commission on development projects within the overflight zone. As Policy SAF-5.1 requires development projects within the overflight zone of the Colusa County Airport to consider all applicable safety policies, City standards, and land use compatibility guidelines, it is anticipated that future development in the parks/recreation/open space, industrial, and commercial/professional designations within the clear, approach/departure, and
overflight zones would be consistent with the airports land use and safety restrictions. All land
use designations within these zones would support a range of uses that would be consistent with
the CLUP.

HYDROLOGY AND WATER QUALITY
The reader is referred to Section 4.7 of the MEIR for background information pertaining to the existing setting for hydrology and water quality in the City of Colusa.
Standards of Significance

Section 4.7 of the MEIR identifies the standard of significance for hydrology and water quality. All of these standards were evaluated for the Brookins Ranch project as to the potential impact levels the project may cause.
Methodology

This analysis is based on a review of City documents, including the City of Colusa Subdivision Standards Resolution, along with meetings and discussions with City staff. The analysis reviewed U.S. Geological Survey topographic maps and aerial photographs, and considered various comments from letters received in response to the Notice of Preparation for this MEIR. Data from the Western Regional Climate Center (WRCC) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) provided background information on the local climate. Information on flooding came from FEMA maps covering the Planning Area and FEMA's Flood Insurance Study for Colusa County, California and incorporated Areas.
Information also was obtained from the City of Colusa Water Supply Evaluation, prepared by Tully and Young. The report evaluated potential water demand as a result of General Plan buildout, and available water supply. Since groundwater is the source of water in the Planning Area, the report focused on available groundwater supply and potential impacts of
groundwater usage resulting from development.

Impacts Dismissed from Further Discussion
The project is considered to have either no impact or a less than significant impact on following standards based on reasoning listed and therefore are not further analyzed in this EIR for the
Brookins Ranch project.

1) Exposure of people or structures to a significant risk of loss, injury or death involving flooding, including flooding as a result of the failure of a levee or dam the Brookins
Ranch project is within the influence of five reservoirs, which retain water from the Sacramento River or its tributaries, which could cause damage in the City of Colusa if their dams were to fail: Lake Oroville, Shasta Lake, Whiskeytown Lake, Black Butte Lake, and East Park Reservoir. However, the probability of dam failure at any given time is very remote and is considered less than significant. Please refer to Impact 4.7.4 in Section 4.7 (Hydrology and Water Quality) for additional information.
2) Inundation by seiche, tsunami, or mudflow the Brookins Ranch project will not be
impacted by seiche, tsunami or mudflow due to the relatively flat location, underlying and surrounding soils, its distance from an ocean or large body of water, and lack of
nearby volcanoes.

Because a project specific drainage report was not completed for the project, further determination of project potential impacts to water quality, drainage patterns or drainage system cannot be competed at this time. The reader is referred to Table 5.3.2 which identifies
areas requiring additional information to complete a thorough environmental analysis.

Flood Hazard

Impact 5.3.7 Implementation of the Brookins Ranch project could expose development to potential flooding from the Sacramento River and Colusa Basin. This is considered a potentially significant impact.
The standard of significance for this impact has been established in CEQA Guidelines Appendix
G as follows:

a. Placement of housing within a 100-year flood hazard area as mapped on a Federal
Flood Hazard Boundary or Flood Insurance Rate Map or other flood hazard delineation
map.

b. Placement within a 100-year flood hazard area structures which would impede or
redirect flood flows.

C. Exposure of people or structures to a signiticant risk of loss, injury or death involving flooding, including flooding as a result of the failure of a levee or dam.
This impact was evaluated for the proposed General Plan Update in Impact 4.7.4 in Section 4.7 (Hydrology and Water Quality).
The Brookins Ranch project is within the influence of five reservoirs, which retain water from the
Sacramento River or its tributaries, which could cause damage in the City of if Colusa if their dams
were to fail: Lake Oroville, Shasta Lake, Whiskeytown Lake, Black Butte Lake, and East Park
Reservoir. However, the probability of dam failure at any given time is very remote.

According to FEMA Map 0601 10C0535F, the west and south half of the project site is designated Zone AE Floodplain. Zone AE is defined as areas with a one percent annual chance of flooding and a 26 percent chance of flooding over a period of 30 years. Zone AE is further defined as a floodplain in which the base flood elevation has been determined. A flood elevation of 50 feet is
indicated on the FEMA map for the project site. Proximity to the Colusa Drain results in a semi- frequent controlled flooding of the undeveloped areas in times of high storm water events upstream in the Colusa Basin, and when the Basin acts as a detention basin for back waters
from downstream waterways and emergency drainage channels. Future development within the portion of the project site within Zone AE would be subject to a potential 100-year flood, which could damage structures and potentially endanger people's lives.

The project applicant has proposed to construct a flood barrier to protect the project site from water that accumulates west of the project site during major storm events. The barrier will be composed of combination of earthen levees, elevated street sections constructed to levee standards, and reinforced concrete flood walls. Portions of the floodwall will incorporate
elements of sound/privacy wall along the boundaries of the subdivision.

The barrier system will be composed of a flood barrier/raised roadway along the Will S. Green Avenue alignment from the high ground at the intersection at State Route 20, south to the
intersection at Colus Avenue. From Colus Avenue southward a reinforced concrete floodwall will
be constructed along the western boundary of the project, then along the alignment of the existing railroad berm, then eastward along the southern boundary of the project and Walnut Ranch Estates to an earthen barrier that will tie the barrier system into the high ground at
Wescott Road.

City of Colusa Colusa General Plan
July 2007 Draft Master Environmental Impact Report
5.3-23

5.3 BROOKINS RANCH

The elevation of the flood barrier is proposed to be designed such that the top elevation will provide three feet of freeboard above the 100-year water surface over the length of the barrier with the exception of the terminations of the barrier where the barrier will taper down to one foot above the 100-year water surface to meet the existing high ground at State Route 20 and Wescott Road. This concept will provide standard practice freeboard to protect against windage and settlement on the signiticant majority of the barrier. The minimum height of the
barrier at the tie-ins to high ground will be one foot above the 100-year water surface. It should be noted that the one foot freeboard is equivalent to is the safety margin that is provided when building pads are designed to be one foot above the 100-year surface per FEMA standards.
Applicable General Plan Policies and Implementing Actions
The City of Colusa General Plan Policy SAF-2.1 regulates all uses and development in areas subject to potential flooding through land use planning, zoning and other appropriate actions. Implementing Action SAF-2.1a refers all development proposals to the Fire and Building Department/Building Division, Public Works Department, and City Engineer to address potential flooding. Where necessary, the environmental review for projects is to include a full inventory of flood concerns and require the applicant to provide specitic data pertaining to flooding hazards. Where necessary, the City also requires development projects in areas subject to flood hazards to reduce or alleviate flood hazards conditions through hydrological studies and mitigation measures. Implementing Action SAF-2.1c pursues mechanisms to finance flood prevention and storm maintenance programs, including local, state and federal sources. If necessary, the City considers alternative funding sources, including development impact fees and the establishment of a drainage utility and assessment district.
Implementation of the proposed flood barrier in conjunction with General Plan policies and implementing actions would result in a less than significant impact.

Mitigation Measures

None required.

BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES

The reader is referred to Section 4.8 of the MEIR for background information pertaining to the existing setting for biology in the City of Colusa.
Standards of Significance
Section 4.8 of the MEIR identifies the standard of significance for biological resources. All of these standards were evaluated for the Brookins Ranch project as to the potential impact levels the
project may cause.

Methodology

Available information pertaining to the natural resources of the City and the project site was reviewed. Documents included, but were not limited to, the California Natural Diversity Data Base (CDFG 2006a); the Soil Survey of Colusa County (NRCS); a list of special-status plant and wildlite species from the USFWS for Colusa and the City of Colusa General Plan.
Foothill Associates completed a Biological Resources Assessment for Brookins Ranch on October 8, 2004. A Foothill Associates' biologist conducted field surveys on the site on March 24 and
Colusa General Plan of City of Colusa
Draft Master Environmental Impact Report July 2007
5.3-24

5.3 BROOKINS RANCH

September 7, 2004. The entire site was systematically surveyed on foot with binoculars or by using public roadways and dirt access roads to ensure total search coverage of the project site on the days of the site visit. Special attention was given to identifying those portions of the site with the potential for supporting special-status species and sensitive habitats. During the field surveys, the biologist recorded plant and animal species observed and characterized biological communities occurring on the site.
Foothill Associates also completed a Wetlands Delineation Report for Brookins Ranch. Foothill Associates wetland biologists reviewed aerial photographs, topographic and soiis maps before conducting site visits in March and August 2004. The wetland delineation utilized the Army Corps of Engineers' 1987 three-parameter methodology to delineate jurisdictional water of the U.S. This methodology requires the collection of data on hydric soils, hydrophytic vegetation, and hydrology to establish the jurisdictional edge of water of the U.S., including wetlands.
Throughout the site observations were made on the types of vegetation, soils, and the presence of hydrologic indicators: Data points were evaluated to determine the percent dominance of
hydrophytic vegetation, as determined by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National List of Plant Species that Occur in Wetlands: 1988 California (Region 0). Soils were examined for hydric attributes and observations were made and recorded for both direct evidence of hydrology and for hydrologic indicators.

Impacts Dismissed from Further Discussion

The Brookins Ranch project is considered to have either no impact or a less than significant impact on following standards based on reasoning listed and therefore are not further analyzed in this EIR for the Brookins Ranch project.
1) Conflicts with the provisions of an adopted Habitat Conservation Plan, Natural Community Conservation Plan, or other approved local, regional or state habitat conservation plan - the Brookins Ranch project would have no impact because there is no adopted Habitat Conservation Plan, Natural Community Conservation Plan, or other approved local, regional or state habitat conservation plan. Please refer to Impact 4.8.7 in Section 4.8 (Biological Resources) for additional information.

Standards of significance that were found to result in a potential impact with project implementation are discussed under the individual impact statements.
Special-Status Plant Species

Impact 5.3.8 The project site contains potential habitat for several special-status plant species. This is considered a potentially significant impact.
The standard of significance for this impact has been established in CEQA Guidelines Appendix G as follows: will the project have a substantial adverse effect, either directly or through habitat modifications, on any species identified as a candidate, sensitive, or special status species in local or regional plans, policies or regulations, or by the CDFG or USFWS. This impact was evaluated for the proposed General Plan Update in Impact 4.8.1 in Section 4.8 (Biological
Resources).

Four special status plant species are recorded in the California Natural Diversity Data Base as occurring within five miles of the project site. These special status plant species include brittlescale, Ferries's milk-vetch, palmate-bracted bird's beak, and rose-mallow. These species,

City of Colusa Colusa General Plan
July 2007 Draft Master Environmental Impact Report
5.3-25

5.3 BROOKINS RANCH

except for rose-mallow, were also listed on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service list for special-status species for the Colusa quadrangle. According to the Biological Resources Assessment, suitable habitat for brittlescale, Ferris's milk-vetch, palmate-bracted bird's beak, and rose-mallow does
not exist on the project site. Therefore, the project is not anticipated to impact these special-
status plant species.
Applicable General Plan Policies and Implementing Actions

General Plan Policies include Policy PRC-6.1, which states that the City shail protect and preserve the area's biological resources, to the greatest extent feasible. Implementing Actions
PRC-6.1.a and PRC-6.1.b requires Development Review and Interagency Coordination. Policy PRC-6.2 states that the City shall ensure that projects identify alternative site designs where sensitive habitat areas may be adversely affected.

Because no listed or special status plant species are known to exist on the site and the site does
not provide suitable habitat for these species, the Brookins Ranch project will result in a less than significant impact.

Mitigation Measures

None required.

Special-Status Wildlife Species

Impact 5.3.9 The project site may contain potential habitat for special-status wildlife species. This is considered a potentially significant impact.
The standard of significance for this impact has been established in CEQA Guidelines Appendix G as follows: will the project have a substantial adverse effect, either directly or through habitat modifications, on any species identified as a candidate, sensitive, or special status species in local or regional plans, policies or regulations, or by the CDFG or USFWS. This impact was evaluated for the proposed General Plan Update area in Impact 4.8.2 in Section 4.8 (Biological
Resources).

Foothill Associates completed a Biological Resources Assessment in 2004 on the Brookins Ranch
project site which included a review of databases and field surveys. The following description is
a list of special-status species that may potentially occur within the area or may be present on
the project site;

Amphibians/Reptiles

The assessment noted the presence of drainage ditches along the southern and western boundaries of the project site. These ditches have been identified as marginal habitat for two
special-status reptile species. One is the giant garter snake, listed as threatened under both the State and federal Endangered Species Act. The other is the northwestern pond turtle, designated a "species of concern" by both federal and State agencies. The assessment considered the potential occurrence of both species on the project site as low, but possible due
to the small amount of emergent vegetative cover in portions of the ditches. The ditches on the
site connect to adjacent ditches southwest of the site which contain potential habitat for pond turtles. In addition, Foothill Associates assessed potential impacts of offsite improvements to the channel along Wil S. Green Road. The assessment concluded that the channel is potential habitat for giant garter snake, and improvements therefore could have an impact.

5.3 BROOKINS RANCH

Birds

The assessment identified the project site as potential foraging habitat for Swainson's hawk, a species listed as threatened by the State of California. The site also has been identified as potential nesting and foraging habitat for several raptor species such as white-tailed kite and the Biological Resources Assessment stated that the project site could provide wintering habitat
for the ferruginous hawk. These raptor species are all protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty
Act and the California Fish and Game Code.

The main concern related to Swainson's hawk is the loss of foraging habitat. While the assessment did not observe Swainson's hawk on the project site, records indicate nests within a five-mile radius. Loss of foraging habitat could have adverse impacts on Swainson's hawk populations, as well as those of other raptors and the loggerhead shrike. The California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) recommends mitigation for impacts on suitable Swainson's hawk habitats within 10 miles of an active nest.

The Foothill Associates field survey observed a loggerhead shrike on the western portion of the property in annual grassland habitat between the drainage ditch and the access road that borders the property to the west. Active nests of this species would be protected by the
Migratory Bird Treaty Act and Fish and Game Codes. The loggerhead shrike is listed as a Federal Species of Concern as well as a California Species of Special Concern. A northern harrier was observed foraging over the agricultural fields of the site during field reconnaissance. The level of vegetation disturbance within the agricultural fields most likely precludes northern harrier from breeding on the project site, but the annual grasslands and agricultural fields do provide
foraging habitat for the species. The northern harrier is listed as a California Species of Special Concern and is protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the California Fish and Game
Code.

The main concern related to loggerhead shrike and other raptors are their nests. Construction
activities that occur too closely to active nests could disrupt the breeding and fledging of these
species, thereby reducing their populations.
Applicable General Plan Policies and Implementing Actions
City of Colusa General Plan Policy PRC-1.1 ensures that the development process respects the unique characteristics and functions of sensitive local resources. The preferred treatment is first: avoidance, second: onsite restoration; third: in-kind replacement; and lastly: impact fees. Sensitive local resources include wetlands, riparian corridors, floodplains, and woodlands. Implementing Action PRC-1.1a states that through the development review process, the City will use the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) process to evaluate the impacts of new development on natural resources. The CEQA process specifies that the City will refer any development proposal with the potential for direct or indirect impacts on open space and sensitive local resources to the City Planner, City Engineer, and other local agencies, as applicable, for review and comment.
City of Colusa General Plan Policy PRC-6.1 protects and preserves the area's biological
resources, to the greatest extent feasible. Implementing Action PRC-6.1a states that through the development review process, the City will require developers to preserve the integrity of existing terrain and natural vegetation in all sensitive areas to the fullest extent possible.

Mitigation Measures

MM 5.3.9a For construction activities that will occur within 250 feet of the drainage ditches, or have the potential to affect the drainage ditches, no more than 30 days prior to the onset of construction activities a biologist qualified to identity northwestern pond turtle (Actinemys marmorata) and giant garter snake
(Thamnophis gigas), shall conduct a thorough inspection of the project site for the presence of these two species. Follow-up inspections shall occur every thirty days, and additional surveys shall be conducted as deemed necessary by the biologist.

At the start of the project, the biologist shall educate construction personnel as to the possible occurrence and identification of these species. If the biologist or construction workers within the project site encounter either a northwestern pond turtle or a giant garter snake, construction shall cease immediately, and the applicant shall notify the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the California Department of Fish and Game, and the City of Colusa staff.
Construction shall not recommence until the recommendations of U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service staff and/or California Department of Fish and Game staff have been implemented.

Timing/Implementation: As a condition of project approval and implemented throughout project construction.

Enforcement/Monitoring: City of Colusa Planning Department, California Department of Fish and Game, U.S. Fish and

MM 5.3.9c The applicant shall conduct tree and vegetation removal activities between September Ist and January 31st, where feasible. For all tree removal activities that will occur between February 1st and August 31$t, a qualified biologist shall conduct surveys within 300 feet of the site of
proposed tree or vegetation removal, to determine the activity of any raptor nests or other bird nests subject to protection under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. The surveys shall be conducted at least one week apart, with the second survey to occur no more than two days prior to tree or vegetation removal. If nests are observed and considered active (incubating), the applicant shall immediately notify the California Department of Fish and Game, and the tree or vegetation shall not be removed until the young have fledged or until recommendations from the Department of Fish and Game have been implemented. No tree or vegetation removal activities shall occur within 300 feet of an active raptor nest or 50 feet of other bird nests.
For all construction activities that will occur between February 1st and August 31st, no more than 30 days from the onset of construction a qualitied biologist shall conduct pre-construction surveys within 300 feet of
the construction site to determine the activity status of any raptor nests or other bird nest subject to protection under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. If active nests (incubating) are observed, the applicant shall immediately notify the California Department of Fish and Game, and no construction activities shall occur within 300 feet of any active raptor nest or 50 feet of any other bird nest, until the young have fledged or until recommendations of the Department of Fish and Game have been
implemented.

During all tree removal, vegetation removal, and pre-construction surveys, should any Swainson's hawks be observed, remaining surveys shall be conducted within 600 feet of the area, or as determined appropriate by the wildlife biologist, where tree removal, vegetation removal or construction activities are proposed to occur. All remaining surveys shall be conducted in accordance with the Swainson's Hawk Technical Advisory Committee's Recommended Timing and Methodology for Swainson's Hawk Nesting Surveys in California's Central Valley (2000). If a Swainson's hawk nest is observed and considered to be active, the applicant shall immediately notify the Department of Fish and Game and no tree or vegetation removal or construction activities shall occur within
600 feet of an active nest until the young have fledged or until the recommendations of the Department of Fish and Game have been implemented.

Timing/Implementation: As a condition of project approval and
implemented throughout project construction.

MM 5.3.9d The applicant shall prepare and implement a Swainson's hawk mitigation plan. The plan shall be reviewed and approved by the California Department of Fish and Game prior to approval of the applicant's tentative map. The mitigation plan shall, among other requirements, require the applicant to acquire a conservation easement or fee title on
suitable Swainson's hawk foraging habitat within the region, at a
mitigation ratio approved by the Department of Fish and Game before construction activities commence.

Timing/Implementation: As a condition of project approval and implemented throughout project construction.
Enforcement/Monitoring: City of Colusa Planning Division; California
Department of Fish and Game.
Implementation of these mitigation measures along with the General Plan policies and implementing actions listed above would avoid or minimize direct impacts on special-status species and their habitat. Impacts after implementation would be less than significant.

Wetlands

Impact 5.3.10 Development of the proposed project may affect wetlands and other waters of the U.S., including those regulated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. This is considered a less than significant impact.
The standard of significance for this impact has been established in CEQA Guidelines Appendix G as follows: will the project have a substantial adverse effect on federally protected wetlands as defined by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (including, but not limited to, marsh, vernal pool, coastal, etc.) through direct removal, filling, hydrological interruption, or other means. This impact was evaluated for the proposed General Plan Update area in impact 4.8.4 in Section 4.8 (Biological Resources).

Foothill Associates conducted a wetland delineation of the project site in 2004. Jurisdictional water of the U.S. are classified into multiple types based on hydrologic regime, topography, and vegetation. Wetland types found within the site include depressional seasonal wetland and riverine seasonal wetland. This impact analysis anticipates that all wetland features may be disturbed as part of project construction and/or operation.

A total of 0.03 acres of depressional seasonal wetlands have been mapped within the site. Depressional seasonal wetlands are defined by a hydrologic regime that is dominated by saturation, rather than inundation. Depressional seasonal wetlands inundate for short periods of
time following a storm event but the hydrologic regime is primarily one of the seasonal saturation. Plant species found within depressional seasonal wetlands are adapted to withstand
short periods of inundation; however, they generally will not withstand long periods of inundation
as vernal pool species typically do.
A total of 0.19 acres of riverine seasonal wetlands have been mapped within the site. Riverine seasonal wetlands are defined by a hydrologic regime dominated by unidirectional flow of water. These features typically occur in topographic folds or swales and represent natural drainages that convey sufficient water to support wetland vegetation. As in depressional seasonal wetlands, plant species found within riverine seasonal wetlands typically have adapted to withstand variable periods of inundation. According to the wetland delineation prepared for

Colusa General Plan City of Colusa
Draft Master Environmental Impact Report July 2007
5.3-30

5.3 BROOKINS RANCH

the project, the entire 0.19 acres of riverine seasonal wetlands are subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps).
These wetlands are located in the southwestern portion of the project site. Future development could physically affect these wetlands, which are potentially subject to the jurisdiction of the Corps. The Corps must authorize any activities expected to affect wetlands under its jurisdiction. In addition, the drainage ditch along the north side of the railroad right-of-way, as well as the ditch along the southern boundary of the project site, may be connected hydrologically to offsite waters. Because of this, the ditches also may subject to Corps regulation. Additionally, any proposed impacts to jurisdictional waters will require a Clean Water Act permit and Water
Quality Certification from the Regional Water Quality Control Board.
Applicable General Plan Policies and Implementing Actions
City of Colusa General Plan Policy PRC-1.1 ensures that the development process respects the unique characteristics and functions of sensitive local resources. The preferred treatment is first - avoidance, second - onsite - restoration, third - in-kind replacement, and fourth impact fees. Sensitive local resources include wetlands, riparian corridors, floodplains, and woodlands.
Implementing Action PRC-1.1a states that through the development review process, the City will use the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) process to evaluate the impacts of new development on natural resources. Policy PRC-1.2 requires that new development be designed and constructed to preserve the following types of areas and features as open space to the maximum extent feasible: high erosion hazard areas, scenic corridors, wetlands and riparian vegetation, drainage corridors, Colusa-Sacramento River State Recreation Area, and other areas of federal, state or local significance.
City of Colusa General Plan Policy PRC-6.1 protects and preserves the area's biological resources to the greatest extent feasible. Implementing Action PRC-6.1a states that through the development review process, and consistent with the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), the City will require development projects to avoid disturbing biological resources within the City, to the greatest extent feasible. Policy PRC-9.1 requires natural drainage flows be maintained in new development projects to the greatest extent feasible. Implementing Action PRC-9.1a states that the City will review individual projects to determine the setback requirements that will adequately buffer natural drainage corridors from development. The City will require new development to ensure that natural drainage corridors and other watercourses are protected from the adverse effects of construction activities and
urban runoff.

Mitigation Measures

MM 5.3.10a The draft waters of the U.S. delineation report shall be finalized, submitted 1o the USACE for verification, and written verification of the delineation(s) by the USACE.

Timing/implementation: Prior to Section 404 Permit Application and Prior
to Issuance of a grading permit.
Enforcement/Monitoring: City of Colusa Planning Department and
USACE.

MM 5.3.10b To the extent practicable, the discharge or dredged or fill material into waters of the U.S. and waters of the State shall be avoided (this also includes waters

5.3 BROOKINS RANCH

not subject to USACE jurisdiction, but subject to RWQCB, CDFG jurisdiction). This includes avoiding activities that would obstruct the flow of, or alter the bed, channel, or bank of any intermittent or ephemeral creeks. If complete avoidance is implemented, no further measures are necessary. If complete avoidance is not practicable, the following measures shall be implemented:
Prior to any discharge of dredged or fill material into "waters of the U.S.",
including wetlands, authorization under a Nationwide Permit or Individual Permit shall be obtained from the USACE. For any features determined to not be subject to USACE jurisdiction during the verification process,
authorization to discharge (or a waiver from regulation) shall be obtained
from the RWQCB. For fill requiring a USACE permit, water quality certification shall be obtained from the RWQCB prior to discharge of dredged or fill material.
Construction activities that will impact "waters of the U.S." shall be
conducted during the dry season to minimize erosion.

Appropriate sediment control measures to protect avoided "waters of
the U.S." shall be in place prior to the onset of construction and shall be
monitored and maintained until construction activities have ceased.
Temporary stockpiling of excavated or imported material shall occur only
in approved construction staging areas. Excess excavated soil shall be
used on site or disposed of at a regional landfill or other appropriate
facility. Stockpiles that are to remain on the site through the wet season
shall be protected to prevent erosion (e.g. silt fences, straw bales).
All pedestrian and vehicular entry into "waters of the U.S.", including wetlands, shall be prohibited during construction.
The applicant shall ensure that the mitigated project will result in no net
loss of wetlands.

Loss of non vernal seasonal wetlands shall be compensated at a minimum of a 1:1 creation ratio (i.e. one acres created for each acre
destroyed). Loss of vernal pools or vernal swales shall be compensated at a minimum of 1:1 creation and 2:1 preservation at an USACE approved mitigation bank or 2:1 creation and 3:1 preservation at an approved off- site mitigation bank. Indirect effects to vernal pools shall be
compensated at a ratio of 2:1 preservation. This can be accomplished
through purchase of appropriate credits at an approved mitigation bank, appropriate payment into a USACE and/or USFWS approved in-lieu fee fund (California Natural Lands Management mitigation bank for individual projects being permitted under a Nationwide Permit), acquiring suitable mitigation property through fee-title or purchase of conservation easement, or on-site or off-site creation, monitoring, and
maintenance (as approved by the USACE, USFWS and RWQCB).

Loss of "other waters" shall be compensated through purchase of appropriate credits at a USACE approved mitigation bank, appropriate payment into a USACE approved in-lieu fee fund (California Natural Lands Management mitigation bank for individual projects being

permitted under a Nationwide Permit), or through placement of avoided
waters and associated riparian buffers into a conservation easement or
similar protective mechanism. The amount of avoided waters and riparian buffers to be permanently protected shall be sufficient to offset the impact and shall be determined by the USACE and the applicant during the permitting process.
Any monitoring, maintenance, and reporting required by the regulatory agencies (i.e. USACE, RWQCB, CDFG) shall be implemented and completed. All measures contained in the permits or associated with agency approvals shall be implemented.
Timing/Implementation: Prior to issuance of a grading permit.
Enforcement/Monitoring: City of Colusa Planning Department, USACE,
RWQCB, and CDFG.

Implementation of these mitigation measures along with the General Plan policies and implementing actions listed above would avoid or minimize direct impacts on wetlands. Impacts after implementation would be less than signiticant.

Loss of Trees

Impact 5.3.11 The project site contains on-site trees that could be affected by project development. This is considered a potentially significant impact.
The standard of significance for this impact has been established in CEQA Guidelines Appendix G as follows: will the project conflict with any local policies or ordinances protecting biological
resources, such as tree preservation policy or ordinance. This impact was evaluated for the
proposed General Plan Update area in Impact 4.8.6 in Section 4.8 (Biological Resources).
Sierra Nevada Arborists prepared an inventory of trees on the project site. The inventory included trees that measured 19 inches or more in diameter at breast height (dbh). Twenty-five onsite trees met the criterion. Most of these trees were Fremont cottonwood or Pacific willow,
native species found along streams or channels. All but five of the trees were located along the boundaries of the project site. The other five trees were located in the area of the existing residence. The inventory looked specifically for oak trees, but none were identified on the project site.
Existing onsite trees that are not Fremont cottonwood, Pacific willow, Oregon ash, or California black walnut are common non-native species, so their removal would not be significant. Although no specific policies by the City or State protect Fremont cottonwood, Pacific willow, Oregon ash, or California black walnut, these are native species and their loss would contribute to a decline in native biological resources, both within the Planning Area and throughout the Sacramento Valley. Each of these tree species is generally associated with riparian habitats. While most trees would be retained in the areas proposed for landscaping and the existing residence parcel, some these trees may be removed because of project development, including infrastructure and utility improvements as well as development associated with the future residential parcel. However, trees not removed also may be affected if development encroaches on their root zones, damaging roots and adversely affecting the health of the trees. In addition, the inventory identified a few cottonwood and willow trees whose longevity and
structural integrity are questionable. These trees could present a potential safety hazard.

Applicable General Plan Policies and Implementing Actions
As previously described, Policy PRC-1.1 would encourage the preservation of specific biological resources such as riparian corridors and woodlands. Policy PRC-1.2 would make it City policy that future development should preserve various types of areas and features to the extent feasible, including riparian areas. Policy PRC-6.1 would make protection and preservation of biological resources a policy of the City.

Mitigation Measures

MM 5.3.11a Project development, including construction of structures and pads and street construction, shall not encroach upon more than 20 percent of the critical
root zone area of an existing tree identified in the Sierra Nevada Arborists inventory. The "critical root zone area" is defined as the radius measurement taken from the tree trunk to the tip of the farthest reaching branch. In limited situations, encroachment of more than 20 percent of the critical root zone area may be allowed if it is demonstrated that potential root damage would
not be severe. Utility lines shall avoid the critical root zone area of trees
wherever possible. However, if utility lines cannot avoid the root area, alternative methods of installation that may reduce impacts on trees shall be considered, including boring.

Avoidance of the critical root zone area, as discussed above, shall be shown
on all improvement and grading plans.
Timing/Implementation: Shown on all improvement and grading plans.
Enforcement/Monitoring: City of Colusa Planning Department.

MM 5.3.11b Prior to the issuance of a grading permit, a qualified arborist shall conduct pre-construction survey of trees identified as "questionable" in the Sierra Nevada Arborists inventory. If the trees are identified as a potential safety hazard to future residents, these trees shall be removed, notwithstanding any policies or implementing actions designed to preserve existing native trees whenever possible. Any identified trees shall be removed prior to any construction activities within 100 feet of the identified tree.

Timing/Implementation: Survey conducted prior to issuance of a grading permit; trees to be removed shall be shown on
grading and improvement plans/

Enforcement/Monitoring: City of Colusa Planning Department.

MM 5.3.11c Existing Fremont cottonwood, Pacific willow trees, Oregon ash, and California black walnuts shall be preserved to the extent feasible. However, if it is necessary to remove any of these trees, prior to issuance of a grading permit or improvement plans, the project applicant shall submit a tree replacement plan to the City that identities what trees will be removed and where the replacement trees will be located. The replaced trees shall be replanted at a ratio of 2 to 1, with a minimum 15-gallon box size. Onsite replanting is preferred, but the City may allow offsite replanting if onsite replanting is determined not feasible. The tree replacement plan will identify the

maintenance entity and include their written agreement to provide care and irrigation of the trees for a 3-year establishment period, and to replace any of the replacement trees which do not survive that period and will be replanted at a 2 to 1 ratio. This mitigation measure does not apply to trees removed for safety reasons under MM 5.3.26b.

Timing/Implementation: Prior to issuance of a grading permit or improvement plans, whichever occurs first.

Enforcement/Monitoring: City of Colusa Planning Department.

Implementation of these mitigation measures along with the General Plan policies and implementing actions listed above would preserve existing trees whenever possible. They also would compensate for the loss of some native species, while allowing for the removal of trees for safety reasons. Impacts after implementation would be less than significant.
Migratory Corridors and Nursery Sites

Impact 5.3.12 implementation of the project could result in substantial interference with the movement of any native resident or wildlife species with established native resident or migratory wildlife corridors, or impede the use of native wildlife nursery sites. This is considered a potentially significant impact.
The standard of significance for this impact has been established in CEQA Guidelines Appendix G as follows: will the project have substantial interference with the movement of any native resident or migratory fish or wildlife species or with established native resident or migratory wildlife corridors, or impede the use of native wildlife nursery sites. This impact was evaluated for the proposed General Plan Update area in Impact 4.8.5 in Section 4.8 (Biological Resources). The Biological Resources Assessment conducted for the project did not identify any migratory corridors or nursery sites within the project site.
Although the Brookins Ranch project is within the Pacific Flyway, implementation of the project would not result in the obstruction of the movement of migratory birds. Migratory birds may however use the wetlands and irrigation ditches during migration. The two drainage ditches on the site provides adequate cover and vegetation to be used as a migratory corridor for common and special-status wildlife species. Implementation of the project would result in disturbance, degradation, and removal of portions of this habitat. The project also could result in habitat degradation due to additional traffic, increased human presence, and degradation of water quality.
Applicable General Plan Policies and Implementing Actions
Policy PRC-6.1 would make protection and preservation of biological resources a policy of the
City. This policy would be implemented through the development review process (Implementing Action PRC-6.1.a) and increased public awareness of the value of biological resources (Implementing Action PRC-6.1.b). Policy PRC-6.2 would encourage future development to avoid sensitive biological resources by alternative site designs. Policy PRC-9.1 would encourage natural drainage flows to be maintained to the extent feasible, mainly through City requirements to buffer natural drainage corridors, which would be imposed during the development review process as set forth in Implementing Action PRC-9.1.a.

City of Colusa Colusa General Plan
July 2007 Draft Master Environmental Impact Report 5.3-35

5.3 BROOKINS RANCH

Policy PRC-1.1 would encourage the preservation of specific biological resources such as riparian corridors and woodlands. These resources provide potential migratory corridors and nursery sites. Implementing Action PRC-1.1.a would allow the City to impose mitigation measures or conditions of approval on development projects to preserve these areas. Policy PRC-1.2 would make it City policy that future development should preserve various types of areas and features to the extent feasible, including riparian areas. Implementing Action PRC- 1.2.b would provide mechanisms to preserve such areas, including easements, dedications and fee programs. In addition, the following mitigation measures shall be implemented, which would further protect migratory coridors and nursery sites.

Mitigation Measures

Implement MM 5.3.9b, 5.3.9c, 5.3.9d and MM 5.3.11a and MM 5.3.11c. Implementation of these mitigation measures and the above General Plan policies and implementing actions would reduce potential impacts on migratory corridors and nursery sites by minimizing direct impacts on special-status species, including nursery and nesting sites, and preserving existing trees as feasible. Impacts after mitigation would be less than significant.

HISTORIC AND CULTURAL RESOURCES

The reader is referred to Section 4.9 of the MEIR for background information pertaining to the existing setting for historic and cultural resources in the City of Colusa.

Standards of Significance
Section 4.9 of the MEIR identifies the standard of significance for cultural resources. All of these standards were evaluated for the Brookins Ranch project as to the potential impact levels the
project may cause.

Methodology

Peak and Associates conducted a cultural resource assessment of the project site in 2004. The review consisted of records and literature searches, consultation with the Native American Heritage Commission and appropriate tribes, and a field visit.

The project has been evaluated for all of the following standards of significance, as they may have a signiticant impact if the following could result from the implementation of the Brookins Ranch project:

1) A substantial adverse change in the significance of a historical resource as defined in CEQA Guidelines Section 15064.5. Please refer to Impact 4.9.1 in Section 4.9 (Cultural Resources) for additional information.
2) A substantial adverse change in the significance of an archaeological resource pursuant to CEQA Guidelines Section 15064.5 or direct or indirect destruction of a unique paleontological resource or site or unique geologic feature. Please refer to Impact 4.9.2 in Section 4.9 (Cultural Resources) for additional information.

Cultural and Historic Resources

Impact 5.3.12 The project contains a site identified as a potential historic resource. This is considered a potentially significant impact.

Colusa General Plan City of Colusa
Draft Master Environmental Impact Report July 2007
5.3-36

5.3 BROOKINS RANCH

The standard of significance for this impact has been established in CEQA Guidelines Appendix
G as follows: will the project have a substantial adverse change in the significance of a historical or archaeological resource as defined in CEQA Guidelines Section 15064.5. This impact was evaluated for the proposed General Plan Update area in Impact 4.9.1 in Section 4.9 (Cultural
Resources).

Peak and Associates conducted a cultural resource assessment of the project site in 2004. The
assessment included a review of literature at the Northwest Information Center of the California
Historical Resources Information System, consultation with the Native American Heritage Commission, and a field investigation. The literature review found no known prehistoric or historic resources within a one-eighth mile radius of the project site. In correspondence dated March 10, 2004, the Native American Heritage Commission stated that there was no presence of Native American cultural resources in the immediate project area.

The field investigation found no evidence of prehistoric period activity. It did identify and record an earthen berm in the southern portion of the project site. The berm is a remnant of the former Sacramento Northern Railroad line. No rails remain on the berm, used currently as a road. A siding also appears to have been present once at this location, but no evidence of this siding
remains. Based on its current condition, the assessment concluded that the former railroad
grade does not appear to be eligible for listing on the California Register of Historical Resources. However, no determination of eligibility has been made by a federal agency or the State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO). The loss of this resource is not considered significant.

There is a potential for future development to encounter currently undiscovered prehistoric and
historic resources. As noted in the Section 4.9 of the MEIR, a substantial Native American
population existed in the Colusa area. There are eight known archaeological sites in the Planning Area. The archaeological and historical review conducted for the General Plan update concluded that the Planning Area is archaeologically sensitive for both prehistoric and historic sites and artifacts.

Applicable General Plan Policies and Implementing Actions

City of Colusa General Plan Policy PRC-4.1 encourages the inclusion of significant sites or districts
in the Federal or State Historical Register. Policy PRC-4.2 preserves identified cultural and historic
landmarks and buildings and ensures that new development, redevelopment, alterations and
remodeling projects are sensitive to the historic context. Implementing Action PRC-4.2a states
that as a part of the development review process, discretionary development projects will be required to identify any important historic and cultural sites the development may impact and avoid disturbance to or degradation of these resources.
Mitigation Measures

MM 5.3.12a The project shall, in the event of the discovery or recognition of prehistoric or historic resources during development project construction, the project applicant shall require no further excavation or disturbance of the project site within 50 feet of the discovery until a professional archaeologist is consulted. Upon completion of the site examination, the archaeologist shall submit a report to the City describing the significance of the find and making recommendations as to its disposition. Mitigation measures, as recommended by the archaeologist and approved by the City in accordance with Section 15064.5 of the CEQA Guidelines, shall be

implemented prior to recommencement of construction activity within the 50- foot perimeter.

Timing/Implementation: As a condition of project approval, and implemented during project construction.
Enforcement/Monitoring: City of Colusa Planning Department.

MM 5.3.12b If any paleontological resources are found during ground-disturbing activities, all work in the immediate vicinity must stop and the City shall be immediately notified. A qualified paleontologist shall be retained to evaluate the find and recommend appropriate mitigation measures for the disposition of the paleontological resources.

Timing/implementation: As a condition of project approval, and implemented during construction activities.
Enforcement/Monitoring: City of Colusa Planning Department.
Implementation of MM 5.3.12a and MM 5.13.12b, along with the General Plan policies and implementing actions, would avoid or minimize adverse physical impacts on uncovered cultural resources, and ensure their proper disposition with minimal loss of resource value. Impacts after mitigation would be less than significant.

Human Remains

Impact 5.2.13 Future development associated with implementation of the project could result in the inadvertent discovery of human remains. This is considered a potentially signiticant impact.
The standard of significance for this impact has been established in CEQA Guidelines Appendix G as follows: will the project have disturbance of any human remains, including those interred outside of formal cemeteries. This impact was evaluated for the proposed General Plan Update area in Impact 4.9.2 in Section 4.9 (Cultural Resources).

The Colusa area contained a high concentration of Native Americans prior to settlement by Euroamericans. Although no burial sites have been explicitly identified, it is possible that Native American remains may be located within the project area. These remains could be encountered during future construction work. It is also possible that gravesites containing non- Native American remains could be encountered.

Applicable General Plan Policies and Implementing Actions
Implementing Action PRC-4.2a states that as a part of the development review process, discretionary development projects will be required to identify any important historic and cultural sites the development may impact, and avoid disturbance to or degradation of these
resources.

Mitigation Measures

MM 5.3.15 If human remains are discovered, all work must stop in the immediate vicinity of the find, and the County Coroner must be notified, according to Section

Colusa General Plan City of Colusa
Draft Master Environmental Impact Report July 2007
5.3-38

5.3 BROOKINS RANCH

7050.5 of California's Health and Safety Code. If the remains are determined to be Native American, the coroner will notify the Native American Heritage Commission, and the procedures outlined in CEQA Section 15064.5(d) and (e) shall be followed.

Timing/Implementation: As a condition of project approval, and implemented during construction activities.
Enforcement/Monitoring: City of Colusa Planning Department.

Implementation of this mitigation measure would minimize impacts on uncovered human
remains and ensure a proper and respectful disposition of these remains. Impacts after
mitigation would be less than significant.

VISUAL RESOURCES/LIGHT AND GLARE

The reader is referred to Section 4.10 of the MEIR for background information pertaining to the existing setting for visual resources in the City of Colusa.
Standards of Significance
Section 4.10 of the MEIR identifies the standard of significance for visual resources/light and glare. All of these standards were evaluated for the Brookins Ranch project as to the potential impact levels the project may cause.
Methodology

The visual resource analysis is based on field visits of the project site, review of existing City documents, and review of the land use map. Photographs were taken from several vantage points within the project site and public view areas in the project site. This analysis is based is on anticipated changes within the project area from implementation of the Brookins Ranch project.
Impacts Dismissed from Further Discussion
The project is considered to have either no impact or a less than significant impact on following standards based on reasoning listed and therefore are not further analyzed in this EIR for the
Brookins Ranch project:

I) Substantial damage to scenic resources, including, but not limited to, trees, rock
outcroppings, and historic buildings within a state scenic highway the Brookins Ranch
project will not cause substantial damage to scenic resources, as i† will not affect any historic buildings and is not within a state scenic highway. Please refer to Impact 4.10.2 in Section 4.10 (Visual Resources/Light and Glare) for additional information.
Standards of significance that were found to result in a potential impact with project implementation are discussed under the individual impact statements.
Loss of Scenic Views and Visual Character

Impact 5.3.14 Implementation of the project would result in the loss of views of scenic area and change the visual character within the project vicinity. This is considered a significant impact.

City of Colusa Colusa General Plan
July 2007 Draft Master Environmental Impact Report
5.3-39

5.3 BROOKINS RANCH

The standard of significance for this impact has been established in CEQA Guidelines Appendix G as follows:

1) Will the project have a substantial adverse affect on a scenic vista;

2) Will the project create substantial degradation of the existing visual character or quality
of a site and its surroundings.

This impact was evaluated for the proposed General Plan Update area in Impact 4.10.1 and Impact 4.10.3 in Section 4.10 (Visual Resources/Light and Glare).
City General Plan policies declare that scenic areas such as views of Sutter Buttes and the Coastal Range should be protected. The project site is currently used in agricultural production, and existing views of this area just outside the current urban boundaries are predominantly of agricultural fields. Views of Sutter Buttes and the Coastal Range from nearby public vantage points and surrounding existing development may be impaired due to construction of the Brookins Ranch project. Additionally, construction of the project would change the existing character of the open, agricultural areas located to the south of the project.
Applicable General Plan Policies and Implementing Actions
City of Colusa Policy PRC -- 12.1 requires new development in scenic areas to use planning design, construction and maintenance techniques designed to protect the views of the area. Policy PRC-12.2 requires the City to develop and implement specific design standards intended
to accomplish the goal of protecting scenic viewsheds. Implementation Program PRC-12.2.a
requires the City to develop and implement specific criteria, consisting of design guidelines and development standards, to maximize protection of the City's scenic viewsheds. Implementation Program PRC-12.2.b: requires each development proposal to provide an environmental/visual constraint map, based on the findings of a project-specific site assessment that identifies significant viewsheds for the Sacramento River, Sutter Buttes and Coastal Range that could be
potentially impacted by the project. Policy PRC - 12.4 states that the City should work to ensure that new roads, parking and utilities be designed to minimize visual impacts. Unless limited by
geological or engineering constraints, utilities shall be installed underground and roadways and
parking areas shall be landscaped and designed to accommodate the natural terrain.
While the City General Plan incorporates a number of policies and implementing actions to remove potential impacts to scenic resources of the City, impacts to the change of visual characteristics is subjective by nature. Development of a parcel of land that is currently agricultural uses or vacant into uses that would place buildings in the viewshed of existing uses would invariably change the existing character of the landscape and impact views of scenic
resources. While the changes in the views of the project site will be different in character, strict design guidelines can result in construction of a project that could be aesthetically pleasing. However, the overall change in the character of the area will be considerable. There is no feasible mitigation for the loss of these views from public vantage points and existing
development therefore; project implementation will result in significant and unavoidable
impacts.

Mitigation Measures

None available.

Community Services

The community services section considers those services which supply fire and police protection, educational and parks and recreation facilities in the City. The reader is referred to Section 4.11 of this MEIR for background information pertaining to the existing setting for community services for the City of Colusa.
Standards of Significance

Section 4.11 of the MEIR identities the standard of significance for community services. This
standard was evaluated for the Brookins Ranch project as to the potential impact levels the
project may cause.

Methodology

The primary sources of information for fire protection services and police protection services in the Colusa area were the Colusa Fire Department, the Sacramento River Fire Protection District and the Colusa Police Department, primarily from personal communications. Other information came from research of public documents, including the LAFCO 2005 Draft Municipal Services Review and website information. Evaluation of potential public school impacts was based on review of applicable public documents and consultations with Colusa Unified School District staff. Additionally, this section was prepared and evaluated based on consultation with City staff and review of applicable public documents.
Impacts Dismissed from Further Discussion
The project is considered to have either no impact or a less than significant impact on following standards based on reasoning listed and therefore are not further analyzed in this EIR for the
Brookins Ranch project:

1) Result in a substantial adverse physical impact associated with the provision of new or
physically altered governmental facilities, the construction of which could cause significant environmental impacts, in order to maintain acceptable park acreage ratios, or other performance objectives for parks, the Brookins Ranch project includes the provision for approximately 25 acres of open space and parkland. This open space and parkland will be required to be developed at the applicant's expense. The Brookins Ranch project includes the provision of one acre for the development of a fire station near the eastern boundary of the northern portion of the site. This fire protection facility will be operated by the City of Colusa Fire Department, which will provide fire protection for the project site upon annexation. This is further discussed below under Impact 5.3.15. There are not any other provisions for additional or altered governmental facilities; therefore, there would be no impact. Please refer to Impact 4.11.4.1 through Impact 4.11.4.2 in Section 4.11 (Community Services) for additional information.
2) Result in substantial adverse physical impacts associated with the provision of new or physically altered governmental facilities, need for new or physically altered governmental facilities, the construction of which could cause significant environmental impacts, in order to maintain acceptable performance objectives for schools. Buildout of the Brookins Ranch project would result in the addition of new residents, which likely would mean an additional number of students in the Colusa Unified School District.
However, this impact iS considered less than significant because the construction and
maintenance of the additional facilities needed to serve projected growth will be

funded by developer impact fees SB 50 constitutes full and complete school facilities mitigation. Please refer to Impact 4.11.3.1 in Section 4.11 (Community Services) for additional information.

Fire Protection Services

Impact 5.3.15 The project would increase the demand for fire protection services, which would require additional personnel. This is considered a potentially significant impact.
The standard of significance for this impact has been established in CEQA Guidelines Appendix G as follows: will the project create substantial adverse physical impacts associated with the provision of new or physically altered governmental facilities, need for new or physically altered governmental facilities, the construction of which could cause significant environmental impacts, in order to maintain acceptable service ratios, response times or other performance objectives for fire protection. This impact was evaluated for the proposed General Plan Update area in Impact 4.11.1.1 in Section 4.11 (Community Services).
Development of the project potentially would result in a maximum of 600 low-density residential units. Based on housing densities identified by the California Department of Finance of 2.85 persons per household, the projected resident population would be 1,676. Based on estimates provided for the former Riverbend Estates project in the area, development at project buildout would generate approximately 545 calls for service to the Fire Department. The Colusa Fire Department attempts to maintain a ratio of paid fire personnel to population of to 1,000. Therefore, the project would generate a demand for approximately two paid full-time firefighters. Department policy requires one pumper per three personnel; thus, the project would nearly generate a demand for one additional pumper.
The new personnel and new equipment would exceed the Fire Department's current capacity to house staff and equipment. The Fire Department would need to construct additional facilities to accommodate the additional staff and engines to maintain acceptable service ratios. The construction of new facilities could result in a significant environmental impact.
The fire station at 750 Market Street is approximately 1.5 miles or more from the project. The Fire Department has stated that projects outside a 2.5-mile radius of the station may require a longer response time, thereby jeopardizing public safety. While the existing firehouse is within iS the 2.5- mile radius, response times may increase due to future development in the area. Because of the numerous developments in the southern half of Colusa, the Fire Department has identified the need for a station in the southern half of the City. The existing fire station does not have the capacity to house an additional pumper and personnel. The Brookins Ranch project would provide one acre for the development of a fire station near the eastern boundary of the northern portion of the site. The Brookins Ranch project also proposes to construct this fire station. This fire protection facility will be operated by the City of Colusa Fire Department, which will provide fire protection for the project site upon annexation. However, infrastructure for water lines does not currently exist and will require construction. Water lines would be installed such that the project will meet the minimum flows specified by the Uniform Fire Code.

MFS-1.1 states that the City shall ensure that new development does not exceed the capacity of the City to provide adequate municipal facilities and does not disproportionately impact the capacity of existing service levels. New growth shall pay it's fair share cost of facilities and services without creating an additional burden to existing residents. Implementing Action MFS- 1.1.b and 1.1c requires Development Impact Fees and Assembly Bill (AB) 1600 Analysis. Policy
MFS-3.1 states that the City shall maintain its own fire protection services for City residents and businesses through the provision of adequate facilities and equipment. Implementing Action MFS-3.1.a requires Monitor Facilities and Equipment Needs. Policy MFS-3.3 states that the City shall require that the construction and staffing of fire station facilities be scheduled such that
they are ready to serve new development as it occurs and is implemented by Implementing
Action MFS-3.3.a, 3.3.b and 3.3.c requiring Capital Improvement Program, Specific Plans and Development Review.

Mitigation Measures

Implementation of these General Plan policies and implementing actions, along with the
dedication of one acre of the project site for the construction of a fire station would ensure adequate provision of fire protection services that meet the anticipated demand by the project, without adversely affecting service to other areas of the City. Impacts would be less than
significant.

Police Protection Services

Impact 5.3.16 The project would increase the demand for police protection services, which would require additional staff and facilities. This is considered a potentially signiticant impact.
The standard of significance for this impact has been established in CEQA Guidelines Appendix
G as follows: will the project create substantial adverse physical impacts associated with the provision of new or physically altered governmental facilities, need for new or physically altered
governmental facilities, the construction of which could cause significant environmental impacts, in order to maintain acceptable service ratios, response times or other performance
objectives for police protection. This impact was evaluated for the proposed General Plan Update area in Impact 4.11.2.1 in Section 4.11 (Community Services).
Development of the project potentially would result in a maximum of 600 low-density residential units. Based on housing densities identified by the California Department of Finance of 2.85 persons per household, the projected resident population would be 1,676. This population would generate the demand for approximately four paid ful-time police officers. Additionally, the Department prefers to have one patrol car per two officers. Therefore, department would require four additional officers and two additional patrol cars to maintain service and staffing levels with development of the project.
The projected population on the project site would generate approximately 2,731 calls for service to the Police Department. Response times may be affected, as the project site is approximately 1.5 miles from the kisting police station. The Department has identified that projects within a 2.5-mile radius of the station may require a longer response time, thereby
jeopardizing public safety. While the existing police station is within the 2.5-mile radius, future
development throughout the City, will increase response times and calls for service due to potential traffic problems.

City of Colusa Colusa General Plan
July 2007 Draft Master Environmental Impact Report
5.3-43

5.3 BROOKINS RANCH

Additionally, the population generated by the project will require more police staff and equipment than can be accommodated at the existing facility. The Police Department has noted that the police station is currently overcrowded, and does not have the ability to house additional staff needed to serve and protect projects in the southern half of the City of Colusa. Because of the numerous developments in Colusa, the Department has identified the need for a station in the southern half of the City. Should a police station be constructed, response times to the development will be quicker than response times from the northern station.
Applicable General Plan Policies and Implementing Actions
General Plan Policy SAF-6.1 states that the City shall strive to provide high-quality police services for City residents and businesses with adequate facilities, modern technology and current training to maximize job performance. To implement this Policy, Implementing Action SAF-6.1.a, 6.1.b, 6.1.C states that Law Enforcement Technology and Service Level Update, Mutual Aid Agreements, and City Budget and Rate Review. Policy SAF-6.2 states that the City shall incorporate police protection considerations into City and community activities through
Implementing Action SAF-6.2.a by Development Review. Policy MFS-2.1 states that the City shall
maintain acceptable law enforcement services for City residents and businesses through the provision of adequate facilities and equipment through Implementing Action MFS-2.1.a Monitor Facilities and Equipment Needs. Policy MFS-2.2 states that the City shall require that the construction and staffing of police facilities be scheduled such that they are ready to serve new development as it occurs and will be implemented through Implementing Action MFS-2.2.a and 2.2.b Capital Improvement Program and Development Review. Policy MFS-2.3 states that all development shall pay City-adopted impact fees for fair-share contributions to police facilities
and equipment improvements.

Mitigation Measures

MM 5.3.16a The project applicant will coordinate directly with the Colusa Police Department, City staff, and adjacent project developers to prepare a police services plan for the project. The plan will determine service requirements for
all projected land uses and ratios for public/private police services that are acceptable to the Police Department. The plan must meet current City performance standards for response times, personnel, equipment and infrastructure needs.

Timing/Implementation: Prior to annexation to the City of Colusa.
Enforcement/Monitoring: City of Colusa Police Department and project
proponent.

MM 5.3.16b The project applicant will coordinate directly with the Colusa Police Department, other developers in the City of Colusa Planning Area, and City
staff to negotiate appropriate monetary contributions to and for a new police
station, personnel and equipment. The Police Department shall receive
adequate fiscal compensation to provide police services to the project, while maintaining or improving services to the existing residents of the City of
Colusa.

Timing/Implementation: Prior to annexation to the City of Colusa.

Enforcement/Monitoring: City of Colusa Police Department, City Manager, and project proponent.
Implementation of the mitigation measures would ensure adequate police protection services for the project and for the City overail. Impacts after mitigation would be less than significant.
Result in Additional Park and Recreational Facilities

Impact 5.3.17 The project would encourage an increase in the local population, thereby leading to an increase in the demand for park and recreation services. This is considered a potentially significant impact.
The standard of signiticance for this impact has been established in CEQA Guidelines Appendix G as follows: will the project result an increase in the use of existing neighborhood and regional parks or other recreational facilities such that substantial physical deterioration of the facility would occur or be accelerated. This impact was evaluated for the proposed General Plan Update area in Impact 4.11.4.2 in Section 4.11 (Community Services).
General Plan Policy PRC - 2.3 sets a park development ratio of at least five acres of parkland for every 1,000 Colusa residents. The project proposes development of approximately 161 acres with 600 housing units. Based on housing densities identified by the California Department of Finance of 2.85 persons per household, the projected resident population would be 1,710. This would translate into a need for 8.55 acres of parkland for residents in the new development.
A total of 15.5 acres are to be reserved for open space and parks. The project applicant proposes development of approximately 4.8 acres of parks and recreation facilities on the project site, as well as 5.5 acres of open space, 5.2 acres community greenways, which would contribute TO recreational amenities. This would exceed the Quimby Act ratio of 5 acres per 1,000 residents for this project. Additionally, the project proposes a 3.6 acre detention basin that can contribute to recreational amenities especially in dry months. Since the project site has been used for agricultural operations, development of a park would not adversely affect natural resources or have other adverse environmental impacts. An onsite park could provide beneficial impacts related to issues such as aesthetics and storm water drainage.
Applicable General Plan Policies and Implementing Actions
The General Plan Policies include Policy PRC - 2.3 states that the City shall ensure that a park development ratio is met of no less than five acres of parkland for every 1,000 Colusa residents, is which is implemented through Implementing Action PRC-2.3.a, 2.3.b, and 2.3.c Development Review, Dedications, Fees and Exactions, and Development Agreements. Policy MFS-1.1 states that the City shall ensure that new development does not exceed the capacity of the City to provide adequate municipal facilities and does not disproportionately impact the capacity of existing service levels. New growth shall pay it's fair-share cost of facilities and services without creating an additional burden to existing residents. This Policy is implemented through Implementing Action MFS-1.1.b and 1.1.c: Development Impact Fees and Assembly Bill (AB) 1600 Analysis.

Mitigation Measures

MM 5.3.17 Prior to tentative map approval, the project applicant shall submit a preliminary park plan for the City's review and approval. The park plan shall specify the park and open space areas on the project site, and shall discuss

City of Colusa Colusa General Plan July 2007 Draft Master Environmental Impact Report
5.3-45

5.3 BROOKINS RANCH

their construction, maintenance and financing of operations. The provision of adequate park and open space land that meets the NRPA guidelines for parkland per 1,000 residents is strongly encouraged. The preliminary park plan shall be consistent with any Master Park Plan adopted by the City and final park development specifications shall be submitted as part of the proposed improvement plans.

Timing/Implementation: Prior to tentative map approval
Enforcement/Monitoring: City of Colusa Planning Department
Implementation of mitigation measure MM 5.3.17 would reduce potential impacts related to a lack of parkland for future residents. Impacts after mitigation would be less than significant.
PUBLIC SERVICES AND UTILITIES

The reader is referred to Section 4.12 of this MEIR for background information pertaining to the existing setting for public services and utilities for the City of Colusa.

Standards of Significance
Section 4.12 of the MEIR identifies the standards of significance for public services and utilities. These standards were evaluated for the Brookins Ranch project as to the potential impact levels the project may cause.
Methodology

Evaluation of potential impacts on water facilities and services was based on consultation with City staff and review of City documents. A major source of information was the Water Supply Evaluation completed for the City in 2007 by Tully and Young. Section 4.7, Hydrology and Water Quality, describes the analysis and findings of the Water Supply Evaluation. Other sources included surveys forms completed by City staff and returned to Pacific Municipal Consultants in 2005, and correspondence with City staff.
Impacts Dismissed from Further Discussion
The project is considered to have either no impact or a less than significant impact on following standards based on reasoning listed and therefore are not further analyzed in this EIR for the Brookins Ranch project.
1) Comply with federal, state and local statues and regulations related to solid waste the Brookins Ranch project will be required to comply with City regulations for the reduction of solid waste as implemented by General Plan Policy PRC 10.1. Please refer to Impact 4.12.2.1 in Section 4.12 (Public Services) for additional information.
Because of the preliminary nature of the Brookins Ranch project, project-specific water, wastewater and stormwater demands and need to improve existing facilities have not been determined at this time. Therefore further analysis of project impacts to these facilities cannot be competed at this time. The reader is referred to Table 5.3.2 which identifies areas requiring additional information to complete a thorough environmental analysis.

6.0 CUMULATIVE IMPACTS

6.0 CUMULATIVE IMPACTS

This section contains all of the cumulative impacts associated with the proposed project for each of the environmental issue areas contained in Sections 4.1 through 4.13. The cumulative impact analysis contained in this section considers all projects that are existing, approved, proposed and reasonably foreseeable in the Planning Area, including Colusa Crossings, Colusa Riverbend, and Brookins Ranch.

6.1 INTRODUCTION

The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) requires that an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) contain an assessment of the cumulative impacts that could be associated with the
proposed project. According to CEQA Guidelines Section 15130(a), "an EIR shall discuss cumulative impacts of a project when the project's incremental effect is cumulatively considerable." "'Cumulatively considerable' means that the incremental effects of an individual project are significant when viewed in connection with the effects of past projects,
the effects of other current projects, and the effects of probable future projects (CEQA Guidelines Section 15065(a)(3))." As defined by the CEQA Guidelines, "cumulative impacts" refers to two or more effects that, when combined, are considerable or which compound or increase other environmental impacts (CEQA Guidelines Section 15355). A cumulative impact
occurs from:

...the change in the environment which results from the incremental impact of the project when added to other closely related past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future projects. Cumulative impacts can result from individually minor but collectively significant projects taking place over a period of time (CEQA Guidelines Section
15355(b)].
In addition, CEQA Guidelines Section 15130(b) identifies that the following four elements are necessary for an adequate cumulative analysis:
1) Either:
(A) A list of past, present, and probable future projects producing related or cumulative impacts, including, if necessary, those projects outside the control of the agency; or,
(B) A summary of projections contained in an adopted general pian or related
planning document, or in a prior environmental document which has been adopted or certified, which described or evaluated regional or area wide conditions contributing to the cumulative impact. Any such planning document shall be referenced and made available to the public at a
location specified by the lead agency.
2) A definition of the geographic scope of the area affected by the cumulative effect and a reasonable explanation for the geographic limitation used;
3} A summary of the expected environmental effects to be produced by those projects with specific reference to additional information stating where that information is available; and

4) A reasonable analysis of the cumulative impacts of the relevant projects. An EIR shall
examine reasonable, feasible options for mitigating or avoiding the project's contribution to any significant cumulative effects.
Where a lead agency is examining a project with an incremental effect that is not "cumulatively considerable," a lead agency need not consider that effect significant, but shall briefly describe

City of Colusa Colusa General Plan

its basis for concluding that the incremental effect is not cumulatively considerable. CEQA
Guidelines Section 15130(a).

6.2 CUMULATIVE SETTING, IMPACTS AND MITIGATION MEASURES
The City of Colusa has used both the list and summary of projections approaches ((1)(A) and (1)(B) above) to consider cumulative impacts in this Draft MEIR. The general cumulative setting conditions are based on the existing land use plans in the Colusa area and on consideration of
currently known large-scale proposed or approved development projects in the Planning Area
(see Table 4.0-1). A more detailed description of the buildout conditions that would occur with implementation of the General Plan Update, which iS consistent with the cumulative setting in many instances, is contained in Section 4.0 (Introduction to the Environmental Analysis and
Assumptions Used).
This cumulative analysis also considers projects in adjacent jurisdictions, which would contribute to cumulative impacts. Staff from the City of Williams, Sutter County, and Colusa County provided lists of projects that would be considered approved, proposed or reasonably foreseeable. There are six approved projects and five proposed/reasonably foreseeable projects in the City of Williamns that would result in 2,848 single-family residential units. There are two proposed/reasonably foreseeable projects in Sutter County that would result in a mix of residential, commercial, industrial and 540 RV resort accommodations (e.g., RV slips, park model trailers, cottages, a recreation/entertainment center, RV storage area, maintenance and
parking). There are six approved residential projects and three proposed/reasonably foreseeable projects that would add 671 residences to Colusa County. There is also a proposed gas-fired electrical power plant and a proposed ethanol plant in Colusa County. These projects are described in Table 4.0-1.

The discussion below provides an analysis of cumulative impacts for each issue area. There are several issue areas that would not result in cumulative impacts that would exceed the buildout impacts addressed in the MEIR (Sections 4.1 through 4.13). In these instances, the reader will be informed that the impacts are the same as the buildout impacts and referred to the relevant section of the MEIR. Each cumulative impact is determined to have one of the following levels
of significance: less than cumulatively considerable, cumulatively considerable and significant and unavoidable. The specific cumulative impacts for each environmental issue area are also identified and analyzed in the corresponding technical sections of the Draft MEIR (Sections 4.1
through 4.13).

6.2.1 LAND USE AND AGRICULTURAL RESOURCES

CUMULATIVE SETTING

Land Use

Land use impacts are typically isolated to a jurisdiction, except where land uses may interact or conflict with adjacent jurisdictions. The cumulative setting for land use includes existing, approved, proposed and reasonably foreseeable development within the Planning Area and the unincorporated portion of Colusa County in the vicinity of Colusa. There are known development projects in the City of Williams, Sutter County and Colusa County that will contribute to cumulative changes in the landscape and land uses within each planning area.

6.0 CUMULATIVE IMPACTS

Agricultural Resources
The cumulative setting for agricultural resources includes existing, approved, proposed and reasonably foreseeable development within the Planning Area and Colusa County. The City and County contain Prime Farmland and Farmland of Local Importance. An issue of concern in California is the conversion of farmland, especially prime farmland, to non-agricultural land uses. The primary concern is the conversion of farmland to urban uses, such as residential development. Once farmland is used for urban development, it is essentially lost as an agricultural resource. Farmland also may be converted for uses such as open space and habitat conservation. Since the Sacramento Valley is more dependent on agriculture than California as a whole, changes in agricultural production and sales would have a greater economic impact. It also means that the conversion of agricultural lands to other uses would have greater impact on the economy in the Sacramento Valley (including Colusa) than in California overall. Under cumulative conditions agricultural land will continue to be converted to urban uses as the population increases in Colusa County and the Sacramento Valley.
The reader is referred to Section 4.1, Land Use and Agricultural Resources, for a discussion of the buildout setting for land use and agricultural impacts. The reader is referred to Section 4.2, Population and Housing, and subsection 6.2.2 of this section for a setting discussion of population and housing in Colusa and the surrounding region.

CUMULATIVE IMPACTS AND MITIGATION MEASURES

Cumulative Land Use Conflicts

Impact 6.1 Implementation of the proposed General Pian Update, in addition to existing, proposed, approved, and reasonably foreseeable development in Colusa County, would contribute to cumulative land conflicts. This would be a less than
cumulatively considerable impact.
The reader is referred to Section 4.1, Land Use and Agricultural Resources, for a discussion of conflicts with planning documents and land use incompatibilities that would occur with implementation of the General Plan Update. Under cumulative conditions, the General Plan Update and subsequent development would not contribute to signiticant impacts associated with land use conflicts beyond those discussed in Impact 4.1.2 and 4.1.3. Conflicts between planning documents, such as the Colusa County Airport Comprehensive Land Use Plan and the General Plan land use map, would be specific to the General Plan Update and specific development projects and would not have an increased significance in the aggregate under cumulative conditions. Similarly, land use conflicts, particularly those between urban and agricultural resources that would occur under cumulative development conditions would also be site-specific. There are known development projects in the City of Williams, Sutter County and Colusa County that will contribute to cumulative changes in the landscape and land uses within each planning area. However, these projects are not expected to interact or conflict with the land uses in the City of Colusa Planning Area. This impact is less than cumulatively considerable.

Mitigation Measures

None required.

6.0 CUMULATIVE IMPACTS

Cumulative Loss of Agricultural Land

Impact 6.2 Implementation of the proposed General Plan Update, in addition to existing, proposed, approved, and reasonably foreseeable development in Colusa County, would contribute to the cumulative loss of Prime Farmland and other valuable farmland in Colusa County, the Sacramento Valley and the State. This impact would be significant and the proposed General Plan Update would have a cumulatively considerable contribution.
As discussed under Impact 4.1.6 in Section 4.1, Land Use and Agricultural Resources,, implementation of the proposed General Plan Update and development of subsequent projects would lead to the loss of Prime Farmland and Farmland of Local importance. Most of the larger communities in Colusa County are located in the valley region. Development in these communities also would lead to a loss of important farmland. The City of Williams, in its General Plan, proposes development in areas that are currently agricultural. The Colusa County LAFCo is considering an expansion of the Sphere of Influence of the Arbuckle Public Utility District, which
would allow the extension of service onto agricultural lands. The County conducted a feasibility study on an industrial park in the community of Maxwell, which is surrounded by agricultural
lands. Future development in these and other parts of the valley would occur on agricultural lands, which essentially would be lost once converted to urban uses. The proposed General Plan Update would contribute to a cumulative loss of agricuitural land in the County, the Sacramento Valley and the State.
Proposed General Plan Policies and Implementing Actions that Mitigate Potential Impacts
The reader is referred to policies and implementing actions identified under Impact 4.1.6 in Section 4.1, Land Use and Agricultural Resources.

Additional Mitigation Measures

Implementation of mitigation measure MM 4.1.6, along with the proposed General Plan policies and implementing actions, would help reduce the project's contribution to the cumulative loss of important farmland in the region by taking steps to protect regional farmlands from
conversion to non-agricultural uses. However, implementation of the proposed General Plan
Update would still contribute to the cumulative loss of Prime Farmland and Farmland of Local
Importance that cannot be fully mitigated. Therefore, this impact is considered significant and unavoidable and the proposed General Plan Update would have a cumulatively considerable
contribution.

6.2.2 POPULATION AND HOUSING

CUMULATIVE SETTING

The cumulative setting for population and housing includes existing, approved, proposed and reasonably foreseeable developments in both the Planning Area and Colusa County. Colusa County has two incorporated areas: Colusa and Williams. It also has several unincorporated communities, which include Maxwell, Princeton, Grimes and Arbuckle among others. There also
is the Colusa Casino area, which is occupied by the Cachil Dehe Band of Wintun. The reader is referred to Section 4.2, Population and Housing, for a discussion of the buildout setting for
population and housing impacts associated with this General Plan Update and identification of approved, proposed and reasonably foreseeable projects. Additionally, the projects in Colusa County, Sutter County and the City of Williams would contribute to cumulative population and

6.0 CUMULATIVE IMPACTS

housing conditions including: six approved projects and five proposed/reasonably foreseeable projects in the City of Williams that would result in 2,848 single-family residential units; two
proposed/reasonably foreseeable projects in Sutter County that would result in a mix of residential, commercial, industrial and 540 RV resort accommodations (e.g., RV slips (152), park model trailers (206), cottages (182) and a recreation/entertainment center, RV storage area and maintenance and parking); and six approved residential projects and three proposed/reasonably foreseeable projects that would add 671 residences to Colusa County.
CUMULATIVE IMPACTS AND MITIGATION MEASURES

Cumulative Population and Housing Growth

Impact 6.3 Implementation of the proposed General Plan Update, in addition to existing, proposed, approved, and reasonably foreseeable development in the area, could result in a cumulative increase in population and housing growth in the County and associated environmental impacts. This is a significant and unavoidable impact and the proposed General Plan Update would have a cumulatively considerable contribution.
As discussed under Impact 4.2.1 in Section 4.2, Population and Housing.. development under the proposed General Plan would lead to a substantial increase in population and housing in the
Colusa area. Subsection 6.2 above mentions potential development in the Williams, Maxwell and Arbuckle that may encourage population growth. The projects in the City of Williams, Colusa County and Sutter County listed in Table 4.0-1 would create new residences and employment opportunities in the areas surrounding the City of Colusa and contribute to the
cumulative impacts on population and housing growth in the region. The environmental effects of the approved projects in Williams, Colusa County and Sutter County have already been considered. The respective jurisdictions will evaluate the environmental effects of the proposed and reasonably foreseeable projects on population and housing growth as the projects are
processed. Future expansion of the Colusa Casino would increase employment opportunities, which may lead to more residents noving to the County. These projected expansions would lead to an increase in population that would be cumulatively considerable within Colusa
County. As the added population would require housing, this would also lead to a cumulatively considerable increase in housing stock, with the associated environmental impacts discussed under Impacts 4.2.1 and 4.2.2 in Section 4.2 (Population and Housing).
Proposed General Plan Policies and Implementing Actions that Mitigate Potential Impacts

The reader is referred to policies and implementing actions listed in Section 4.2 (Population and
Housing).
Additional Mitigation Measures

The MEIR contains mitigation measures where appropriate to reduce or eliminate potentially significant impacts associated with employment and population growth in the Planning Area. While the General Plan contains policies that would help offset the effects of population growth, there are no measures that would completely mitigate the environmental effects of population growth under cumulative conditions. Even with implementation of General Plan policies and mitigation measures, environmental impacts would remain significant, as population growth will inevitably occur and housing and other services would need to be provided to accommodate this growth. Therefore, impacts related to population growth would be significant and unavoidable and the proposed project would have a cumulatively considerable contribution.

6.2.3 TRANSPORTATION AND CIRCULATION

CUMULATIVE SETTING

The cumulative setting for transportation and circulation includes existing, approved, proposed and reasonably foreseeable development in the proposed Planning Area and Colusa County. Because traffic impacts are regional in nature, the cumulative setting also includes increased traffic on SR 20 and SR 45 resulting from development in the City of Williams and in the Yuba City- Marysville metropolitan area to the east. Projects in Sutter County and Colusa County (see Table 6.0-1) could also contribute to traffic impacts under cumulative conditions. Additionally, the cumulative setting includes the roadways and transportation improvements outlined in the 2004 Colusa County Regional Transportation Plan (RTP). The 2004 RTP assessed current and future transportation needs in Colusa County and the cities of Colusa and Williams. It included a
prioritized list of short-term and long-term projects, and the funding for those projects, including programmed improvements for State Routes 20 and 45 in and near Colusa. The RTP lists projects
for new and continued transit service in Colusa and for bicycle transportation improvements, and improvement projects at the Colusa County Airport. The reader is referred to Section 4.3, Transportation and Circulation, for a discussion of the buildout setting for transportation and circulation impacts.

CUMULATIVE IMPACTS AND MITIGATION MEASURES

Cumulative Impacts to State Highways

Impact 6.4 Implementation of the proposed Generai Plan Update, in addition to existing, proposed, approved, and reasonably foreseeable development in the area,
could result in a cumulative increase in interregional traffic on state highways. This is a signiticant impact and the project would have a cumulatively considerable contribution.

Most of the potential cumulative impacts to state highways are similar to the impacts associated with buildout of the proposed General Plan Update as described in Section 4.3 (Transportation and Circulation). One potential cumulative impact would be increased traffic on SR 20 and SR
45 resulting from development outside the Planning Area, particularly in Sutter County, Colusa County, the City of Williams, and in the Yuba City-Marysville metropolitan area to the east. This would affect the level of service of the roadways and intersections connecting to the roadways. The projects listed in Table 4.0-1 have the potential to contribute to regional transportation and circulation impacts. The increase in housing and employment centers in these adjacent jurisdictions would add more interregional traffic to state highways, and contribute to significant environmental impacts. The environmental effects of the approved projects in Williams, Colusa County and Sutter County have already been considered. The respective jurisdictions will evaluate the environmental effects of the proposed and reasonably foreseeable projects on population and housing growth as the projects are processed.

Proposed General Plan Policies and Implementing Actions that Mitigate Potential Impacts

6.0 CUMULATIVE IMPACTS

Additional Mitigation Measures

Implementation of mitigation measures MM 4.3.1a, 4.3.2a and 4.3.2b along with the General
Plan policies and implementing actions, would reduce the proposed project's contribution to impacts on the LOS of state highways in the Planning Area. However, the City does not have a feasible mitigation measure to reduce interregional transportation impacts on SR 20 to a level
that is less than significant. Also, it would be difficult to provide a four-lane section of SR 20 in the
developed areas along the 10th Street corridor from Market Street south to the fairgrounds and on the Bridge Street corridor from Market Street south to Wescott Avenue. LOS on these SR 20 segments would be below the Caltrans LOS threshold of D. Therefore, while some impacts can be mitigated, the cumulative impact on state highways would be significant and unavoidable and the project's contribution to this impact is cumulatively considerable.

6.2.4 NOISE

CUMULATIVE SETTING

The cumulative noise conditions would be the same as the buildout conditions for both non-
transportation noise because the noise impacts would be limited to the Planning Area and the area immediately surrounding the City. All noise-generating land uses and sources will continue to be located within the Planning Area. Under cumulative conditions, increased regional development would result in additional traffic on SR 20 and 45, as discussed above in 6.2.3, Transportation and Circulation. The related traffic noise may result in increased levels over those anticipated solely with implementation of the General Plan Update and also may extend outside of the Planning Area along state highways. Section 4.4, Noise, contains an analysis of noise impacts associated with all existing and proposed noise generators inside of the Planning Area and outside of the Planning Area that would affect noise levels of noise-sensitive land uses.

CUMULATIVE IMPACTS AND MITIGATION MEASURES

Increased Traffic Noise

Impact 6.5 Implementation of the General Plan Update, in combination with existing, approved, proposed, and reasonably foreseeable development, would contribute to a cumulative increase in traffic noise on regional roadways. This
considered a signiticant impact and the proposed project would have a
cumulatively considerable contribution.
Under cumulative conditions, increases in regional travel, particularly along SR 20 and SR 45, would result in increased transportation noise. It is anticipated that noise levels in excess of those shown in Table 4.4-5 for state highways would occur under cumulative conditions. Sensitive receptors within the proposed Planning Area as well as sensitive receptors, such as residences, outside the Planning Area would be exposed to increased noise levels.

Proposed General Plan Policies and Implementing Actions that Mitigate Potential Impacts

Refer to discussion under Impact 4.4.5 in Section 4.4 (Noise) of the MEIR.

Additional Mitigation Measures

While implementation of mitigation measure MM 4.4.5 in addition to the proposed General Plan policies and implementing actions would result in a reduction of traffic noise levels at affected
City of Colusa Colusa General Plan
July 2007 Draft Master Environmental Impact Report
6.0-7

6.0 CUMULATIVE IMPACTS

sensitive receptor locations within the proposed Planning Area, it would be infeasible to ensure that all sensitive receptors and residential uses would not be exposed to future traffic noise levels in excess of applicable standards. As a result, this impact is considered significant and unavoidable and the proposed General Plan Update would have a cumulatively considerable contribution.

6.2.5 AIR QUALITY

CUMULATIVE SETTING

Air Quality

The cumulative setting for air quality includes existing, approved, proposed and reasonably foreseeable development within the Northern Sacramento Valley Air Basin (NSVAB), which is a seven-county region. All but two of the counties in the NSVAB are in nonattainment status of state standards for ozone. Glenn and Colusa Counties are in "nonattainment-transitional"
status. Butte, Yuba and Sutter Counties are in nonattainment status for federal 1-hour ozone
standards, while Butte County and southern Sutter County are in nonattainment status for the federal 8-hour ozone standard. All other counties are in attainment or unclassified status for the
federal ozone standards.

All of the seven counties in the NSVAB are in nonattainment status for state standards for PMno.
All counties in the NSVAB are in unclassified status for federal PM10 standards. All counties also
are in unclassified status for state PM2.5 standards except for Butte County, which is in nonattainment status. The entire NSVAB is in attainment or unclassified status for all other federal
and state criteria pollutants. Because the timing of attainment status for NSVAB is unknown, the
cumulative setting for air quality assumes nonattainment status of ozone and PM10. The reader is referred to Section 4.5 (Air Quality) for a discussion of the buildout setting for air quality impacts. The projects listed in Table 4.0-1 would contribute to cumulative air quality impacts.
CUMULATIVE IMPACTS AND MITIGATION MEASURES

Cumulative Regional Air Basin Impacts

Impact 6.6 Implementation of the proposed General Plan Update, in combination with existing, approved, proposed and reasonably foreseeable development, would exacerbate existing NSVAB problems with ozone and particulate
matter. This is considered a significant impact and the proposed project
would have a cumulatively considerable contribution.

Implementation of the proposed General Plan would result in an increased population and substantial new development, which would adversely affect regional air quality within the NSVAB. The growth in population, vehicle usage and business activity within the NSVAB, when considered with growth proposed under the General Plan, would contribute TO cumulative regional air quality impacts.
The projected population growth rates under the proposed General Plan appear to be inconsistent with those utilized in the current regional air plan. The Northern Sacramento Valley Air Basin 2003 Air Quality Attainment Plan (NSVAB, 2004) projects emissions within the northern Sacramento Valley based on California Department of Finance projections. The four-fold increase in population by 2030 envisioned under the proposed General Plan is much greater than that anticipated by the air quality attainment plan. This may make the plan's goal of
Colusa General Plan City of Colusa

6.0 CUMULATIVE IMPACTS

bringing the NSVAB into compliance with the PM10 and ozone standards more difficult to attain and may contribute to the area's non-conformance with the standards.
Proposed General Plan Policies and Implementing Actions that Mitigate Potential Impacts
The reader is referred to policies and implementing actions listed in Section 4.5 (Air Quality).

Additional Mitigation Measures

Implement mitigation measures MM 4.5.1 and MM 4.5.2. Implementation of these mitigation measures, along with the proposed General Plan policies and implementing actions, would assist in reducing emissions contributing to adverse air quality in the NSVAB. However, build-out of the City as proposed in the General Plan Update would still contribute high levels of criteria pollutants, specifically ozone precursors and PMio, that could delay attainment of air quality standards in the NSVAB under the air basin's air quality attainment plan. These emissions would result in a cumulatively considerable net increase in ozone precursors and PM 10, for which the region is in non-attainment under state air quality standards.. Therefore, the cumulative impact is considered significant and unavoidable and the proposed General Plan Update would have a cumulatively considerable contribution.
6.2.6 GEOLOGY, SEISMICITY, SOILS AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
The cumulative geology, seismicity soils and hazardous materials conditions would be the same as the buildout conditions for these environmental issue areas. Generally, impacts related to geology, soils and hazardous materials are site-specitic and do not extend to a regional level. As such, the cumulative impacts of the General Plan on geology, soils and hazardous materials would not exceed buildout conditions. Impacts associated with buildout of the General Plan on geology, soils and hazardous materials have been analyzed and mitigation measures recommended where appropriate. The reader is referred to Section 4.6 (Geology, Soils and
Hazardous Materiais).

6.2.7 HYDROLOGY AND WATER QUALITY

CUMULATIVE SETTING

The cumulative setting for hydrology and water quality includes existing, approved, proposed and reasonably foreseeable developments in the Planning Area. Additionally, because the Planning Area is within the Sacramento-Stone Corral Watershed and draws water from the Colusa Subbasin, these are also part of the cumulative setting for hydrology and water quality. The Sacramento-Stone Corral Watershed contains parts of five counties and encompasses approximately 1,879 square miles. Approximate boundaries of this watershed are Stony Creek in the north, Cache Creek in the south, the Sacramento River in the east, and the Coast Range
foothills in the west. The Planning Area is within the Colusa Subbasin of the Sacramento Valley
Groundwater Basin. Therefore, the cumulative water supply analysis focuses on the Sacramento-Stone Corral Watershed for surface water issues and the Colusa Subbasin for groundwater issues. Cumulative development throughout the Watershed and Subbasin within would contribute to water quality impacts. As the proposed General Plan Update would result in a reduction in the amount of groundwater used, would a not have a cumulative effect on groundwater supply. The reader is referred to Section 4.7 (Hydrology and Water Quality) for a discussion of the buildout setting for hydrology and water quality impacts.

Impact 6.7 implementation of the proposed General Plan Update, in addition to existing, approved, proposed and reasonably foreseeable development in the Sacramento-Stone Corral Watershed and the Colusa Subbasin, could contribute to cumulative effects on water quality of surface waters and groundwater. This is considered a less than cumulatively considerable impact.

As described previously, the proposed General Plan Update anticipates development of an additional 2,6,32 acres within the proposed Planning Area. This includes areas for which
development projects have been proposed (see Sections 5.1 through 5.3). Development within the Planning Area, along with anticipated development within the Sacramento-Stone Corral Watershed and the Colusa Subbasin area would result in cumulative water quality impacts,
which include impacts on surface water and groundwater quality. The discussion under Impacts 4.7.1, 4.7.2 and 4.7.3 in Section 4.7 (Hydrology and Water Quality) describes potential impacts on water quality. Development elsewhere in the Waterhsehd and Subbasin would have similar effects and would result in an increase in the overall impact under cumulative conditions. In particular, there could be a cumulatively adverse impact on water quality in the Sacramento River, which is already classified as an impaired stream under the Section 303(d) program.
Proposed General Plan Policies and Implementing Actions that Mitigate Potential Impacts
The reader is referred to policies and implementing actions identified under Impacts 4.7.1, 4.7.2
and 4.7.3.

Additional Mitigation Measures
Implement MM 4.6.1a, MM 4.6.1b in Section 4.6, Geology, Soils and Hazardous Materials,, MM 4.7.3a and MM 4.7.3b in Section 4.7, Hydrology and Water Quality,. Implementation of these mitigation measures, along with compliance with the General Plan policies and implementing actions described in this section, would reduce the City's contributions to cumulative water quality impacts less than cumulatively considerable.
Cumulative Flood Hazards

Impact 6.8 Implementation of the proposed General Plan Update, along with existing, approved, proposed and reasonably foreseeable development within the Sacramento-Stone Corral Watershed, would increase impervious surfaces and
alter drainage conditions and rates in the Planning Area, which could contribute to cumulative flood conditions in the Sacramento River and area creeks. This is considered a less than cumulatively considerable impact.
The majority of the Planning Area is cated outside of the 100-year floodplain, as designated by FEMA maps. However, the western portion of the Planning Area, which is proposed for development, is within a 100-year floodplain. This development would also increase impervious surfaces and alter drainage conditions and rates. In addition, future development within the Sacramento-Stone Corral Watershed, such as development in the vicinity of Stony Creek in the
north, Cache Creek in the south, the Sacramento River in the east, and the Coast Range foothills
in the west, would also increase impacts to drainage and impervious surface coverage. While

there would be an increase in impervious surfaces within the Sacramento-Stone Corral Watershed, it would remain predominantly rural. Therefore, the amount of runoff generated by the new development within the watershed would not significantly increase, and potential flood hazards in the watershed would not noticeably increase. The Colusa Crossing project would provide berm/levee improvements to reduce flooding impacts. It is anticipated that these improvements would benefit areas adjacent to those projects as well and decrease flooding potential of those areas.
Proposed General Plan Policies and Implementing Actions that Mitigate Potential Impacts
The reader is referred to policies and implementing actions listed under Impact 4.7.4.
Additional Mitigation Measures

Implement mitigation measures MM 4.7.4a and MM 4.7.4b. Implementation of these mitigation measures, along with the proposed seneral Plan policies and implementing actions identified in this MEIR, would reduce the potential flooding problems associated with implementation of the General Plan Update and subsequent development within the proposed Planning Area. This would reduce the City's cumulative contribution to flooding problems in the watershed to less
than cumulatively considerable.

6.2.8 BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES

CUMULATIVE SETTING

The cumulative setting for biological resources includes existing, approved, proposed and reasonably foreseeable development in the Planning Area, Colusa County, and areas along the Sacramento River basin to the south of the Planning Area. The cumulative setting for biological resources is extensive due to the fact that these resources occur in the Planning Area, Colusa County, and in a broader regional context. The viability of species populations, as well as quality and functions of habitat, is dependent on the conditions of these resources in a regional and often statewide context. Thus, the cumulative setting takes into account impacts that are localiy related to the General Plan (e.g., vernal pool and associated biological resources in the Planning Area) as well as biological resource impacts for the larger region (e.g., oak tree loss and Swainson's hawk impacts). The reader is referred to Section 4.8, Biological Resources, for a discussion of the buildout setting for biological resources impacts.

CUMULATIVE IMPACTS AND MITIGATION MEASURES

Cumulative Biological Resource Impacts

Impact 6.9 Implementation of the proposed General Pian Update, in addition to existing, approved, proposed and reasonably foreseeable development in the Planning Area and larger regional context would result in a cumulative loss of biological resources in the region. This is considered a significant impact and the proposed project would a have a cumulatively considerable contribution.
As identified under Impacts 4.8.1 through 4.8.7 in Section 4.8, Biological Resources, development accommodated by the General Plan Update would result in direct and indirect impacts to listed and non-listed special status species, as well as impacts to jurisdictional waters of the U.S., streams and drainages and non-special status species, trees, habitat, and movement corridors. Additional indirect impacts to the Sacramento River basin to the south of the Planning Area

could occur. The contribution to these impacts by the General Plan Update combined with cumulative development levels would be cumulatively considerable as many special status species rely on specific cover types found in the proposed Planning Area for movement and forage, while not necessarily using cover types in the Planning Area on a permanent basis. Migrating birds fall within this category, as well as Swainson's hawk and other raptors that have been known to use the southern portions of the Planning Area as foraging habitat while nesting and breeding in areas south of the Planning Area such as within the City of Colusa and along
the Sacramento River.

Proposed General Plan Policies and Implementing Actions that Mitigate Potential Impacts.
The reader is referred to policies and implementing actions identified in Impacts 4.8.1 through
4.8.7.

Additional Mitigation Measures
Implementation of General Plan policies and implementing actions would reduce the General Plan's contribution to cumulative biological impacts in the region. However, the General Plan's contribution would remain cumulatively considerable, as implementation of the proposed General Plan Update along with cumulative development throughout the region would contribute to special-status plant and wildlite species and habitat loss. The only mitigation for such impacts - restricting the majority of development proposed in the General Plan Update - is not considered feasible, given that it would fundamentally conflict with the goals of the General
Plan. Therefore, cumulative biological resource impacts are considered significant and unavoidable and the proposed General Plan Update would have a cumulatively considerable
contribution.

6.2.9 HISTORIC AND CULTURAL RESOURCES

CUMULATIVE SETTING

The cumulative setting for cultural resources includes existing, approved, proposed and reasonably foreseeable developments in the Planning Area, Colusa County, and the surrounding region. This portion of the State is rich in culturai resources. While many prehistoric and historic sites and resources have been identified in the Planning Area, the probability is high that other resources remain undiscovered. Future development projects in the Planning Area, Colusa County and surrounding region that involve grading, excavation, or construction may encounter cultural resources. The cumulative effect of projects in the Planning Area and Colusa County could result in a net loss of prehistoric and historic resources. These resources include archaeological resources associated with Native American activities and historic resources associated with settlement, farming, and economic development. Similarly, proposed projects in vicinity of the Planning Area and Colusa County could impact undiscovered paleontological resources. The reader is referred to Section 4.9, Historic and Cultural Resources, for a discussion of the buildout setting for historic and cultural resources impacts.

impacts on prehistoric and historic resources in Colusa County and northern California. This is considered a less than cumulatively considerable impact.
Implementation of projects within the proposed Planning Area, in combination with cumulative development in Colusa County and the surrounding region, would likely increase the potential to disturb known and undiscovered cultural resources in this part of the State. The proposed Planning Area and surrounding region has a high potential for cultural resources, as discussed under Impact 4.9.2. While the area is not sensitive for paleontological resources, these could occur. Disturbance of these resources could alter or destroy their cultural value, and reduce the overall amount of cultural and paleontological resources in Colusa County and northern California.

Proposed General Plan Policies and Implementing Actions that Mitigate Potential Impacts
The reader is referred to policies and implementing actions discussed under Impact 4.9.2.

Additional Mitigation Measures

Implement mitigation measure MM 4.9.2. Implementation of this mitigation measure, along with the applicable General Plan policies and implementing actions, would reduce potential cumulative impacts to cultural resources. Cumulative impacts after mitigation would be less than cumulatively considerable.
6.2.10 VISUAL RESOURCES/LIGHT AND GLARE

The cumulative visual resources and light and glare conditions would be the same as the is buildout conditions, which is considered a less than significant impact. The Planning Area does not contain any scenic highways or scenic resource areas. The Sutter Buttes are considered a scenic vista; however, development as proposed by the General Plan Update is not anticipated to have significant impacts on this scenic vista as it is visible from most parts of the Planning Area. Additionally, the Planning Area and region do not have light pollution issues or dark sky ordinances. Because the visual resources and light and glare impacts do not extend to a regional level, the cumulative setting for this environmental issue area is the same as the buildout setting. Impacts associated with buildout of the General Plan on visual resources and light and glare have been analyzed and mitigation measures recommended where appropriate. The reader is referred to Section 4.11, Visual Resources/Light and Glare.

6.2.11 COMMUNITY SERVICES

6.2.11.1 FIRE PROTECTION AND EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES

Because fire protection and emergency medical services do not extend to a regional level, the cumulative setting for fire protection and emergency medical services would be the same as buildout conditions. Under buildout conditions, the City of Colusa Fire Department would provide firefighting services within the incorporated area of the City (e.g., fire protection, fire suppression, inspection, plan checking, basic life support, rescue services and public education). The Fire Department would participate in a countywide mutual aid program with seven other fire protection districts in Colusa County. The Sacramento River Fire Protection District would provide fire protection services in the area outside the Colusa city limits. The cumulative impacts of the proposed General Plan Update on fire protection and emergency medical services are the same as those identitied under impacts specific to buildout of the General Plan Update and the project is considered to have a less than cumulatively considerable impact. The reader is

6.2.11.2 POLICE PROTECTION

Because police protection services do not extend to a regional level, the cumulative setting for police protection services would be the same as buildout conditions. The Police Department would extend its services to areas beyond the City limits on an as-needed basis, through a mutual aid agreement with the Colusa County Sheriff's Department as required by the Office of Emergency Services. Under buildout conditions, the Colusa Police Department would provide police protection services 24 hour per day to residents of the City of Colusa and the project is considered to have a less than cumulatively considerable impact. The reader is referred to Section 4.11, Community Services, subsection 4.11.2 for a discussion of impacts associated with police protection.

6.2.11.3 SCHOOLs

CUMULATIVE SETTING

The cumulative setting for schools includes existing, approved, proposed and reasonably foreseeable development in the Planning Area and the boundaries of the Colusa Unified School District. The boundaries of the Colusa Unified School District encompass most of the east central
portion of Colusa County. The projects in Colusa County that would add to cumulative impacts are provided in Table. 6.0-1. There are six approved residential projects and three proposed/reasonably foreseeable projects that would add 671 residences to Colusa County and contribute to cumulative impacts on schools. Under buildout and cumulative conditions, the Colusa Unified School District would continue to serve the residents of the City of Colusa and
Colusa County, within the district boundaries, by providing public education services for children in grades K-12. Because growth is anticipated under the General Plan, the buildout and cumulative setting for schools would likely inciude school expansions and/or new schools to
service the increase in student population and to serve the new growth areas in the southern portion of the City where the majority of growth is occurring. Additionally, the school district may need to provide additional schools to accommodate increases in student population in the unincorporated areas of Colusa County served by the district. The reader is referred to Section 4.11, Community Services, subsection 4.11.3 for a discussion of the setting associated with
schools.

CUMULATIVE IMPACTS AND MITIGATION MEASURES

Cumulative Schools Impacts

Impact 6.12 Implementation of the General Plan, in combination with existing, approved, proposed, and reasonably foreseeable development, are not expected to result in an increase in school impacts over buildout conditions. Therefore, the General Plan's contribution to schools. This would be less than cumulatively
considerable.
While population growth in the City of Colusa and the east central portion of Colusa County would likely increase the student population in the Colusa Unified School District, the impacts are not expected to result in an increase in school impacts over buildout conditions. The cumulative impacts of the proposed General Plan Update on schools are the same as those identified under impacts specific to buildout of the General Plan. School impacts were found to be less

than significant under buildout conditions. Under both buildout and cumulative conditions, the District would attempt to utilize several funding sources to facilitate the construction and
maintenance of the additional facilities needed to serve projected growth. Sources include but are not limited to Proposition 47 funds, developer impact fees, and any local general obligation bond funds. The environmental effects of constructing additional school facilities in the City and proposed Planning Area would be similar to other types of development and have been generally have been considered in Sections 4.1 through 4.13. In addition, provisions of SB 50 state that payment of fees provide full and complete school facilities mitigation. The reader is referred to Section 4.11, Community Services, subsection 4.11.3.

Additional Mitigation Measures

None required.

6.2.11.4 PARKS AND RECREATION

Because parks and recreation services and impacts do not extend to a regional level, the cumulative setting for parks and recreation would be the same as buildout conditions. Under buildout conditions, the City's Parks and Community Development Department would operate and maintain the City's parks and recreation facilities. The proposed General Plan Update would add 71 acres of park lands, bringing the total parks and open space land to 225.6 acres at General Plan buildout conditions. With an estimated Planning Area population of 34,731 at General Plan buildout, the ratio of parkland to population would be approximately 6.5 acres per 1,000 persons, which would exceed the NRPA general guideline for parklands. Parks and recreation impacts were also found to be less than signiticant under buildout conditions. The
reader is referred to Section 4.11 (Community Services) subsection 4.11.4 for a discussion of the
impacts to parks and recreation impacts.

6.2.12 PUBLIC SERVICES AND UTILITIES

6.2.12.1 WATER SERVICE

Because water service does not extend to a regional level, the cumulative conditions would be the same as the buildout conditions. The water service setting includes water distribution and water demand. Under buildout conditions the City of Colusa would provide potable water for
residential, commercial and industrial uses within the City limits and the following areas outside the City limits: the Walnut Ranch development, the Lurline Avenue area, the area east of Bridge Street, and restrooms at Moon Bend Road. The City's municipal water would come from deep wells that tap aquifers within underground geological formations. Land uses in the
unincorporated portion of the Planning Area not served by City water would rely on individual wells for their water supply. Water distribution and water distribution facilities and water demand impacts were found to be less than signiticant under buildout conditions. The reader is referred to subsection 4.12.1 in Section 4.12, Public Services, for a discussion of the impacts associated with water services. Subsection 6.2.7, Hydrology and Water Quality, in this section defines a broader setting for cumulative impacts regarding water resources.

6.2.12.2 WASTEWATER SERVICE

Because wastewater service does not extend to a regional level, the cumulative conditions
would be the same as the buildout conditions. Under buildout conditions, the City of Colusa would provide wastewater collection and treatment services to all of its residents within the City limits, as well as the Walnut Ranch development outside the City limits. Land uses in other unincorporated portions of the Planning Area not provided with sewer service would rely on individual septic systems for wastewater disposal. The buildout conditions would also include improvements to the wastewater collection as treatment system as outlined in the City's Wastewater Facilities Plan, amended in August 2004. Wastewater treatment capacity and wastewater infrastructure impacts were both found to be less than significant under buildout conditions. The reader is referred to subsection 4.12.2 in Section 4.12, Public Services, for a discussion of the impacts associated with wastewater service.

6.2.12.3 STORM WATER DRAINAGE

Because storm water drainage service does not extend to a regional level, the cumulative conditions would be the same as the buildout conditions. Under buildout conditions, the City of Colusa Department of Public Works would manage the storm water drainage system in the City of Colusa. The buildout conditions would include improvements to the City's drainage system such as the proposed 51.9-acre parcel of land on the north side of SR 20, approximately one-half mile west of the Planning Area boundary that may be used as a terminal detention basin to serve as a drainage outfall for new development in the western portion of the Planning Area. If this improvement occurs, storm runoff from new development could utilize this site for storage with metered discharge into the Colusa Drain occurring via the future installation of a pump
station by the City. Storm water runoff and localized flooding impacts were both found to be less than significant under buildout conditions. The reader is referred to subsection 4.12.3 in Section 4.12, Public Services, for a discussion of impacts associated with storm water drainage.

6.2.12.4 SOLID WASTE SERVICE

CUMULATIVE SETTING

The cumulative setting for solid waste service includes existing, approved, proposed and reasonably foreseeable developments in the Planning Area, as well as Yuba, Sutter, Butte, Nevada, and Colusa Counties. Because the service area of the Ostrom Road Landfill includes Yuba, Sutter, Butte, Nevada, and Colusa Counties, these jurisdictions and their planned and projected growth would be part of the cumulative setting for solid waste. The Ostrom Road
Landfill has approximately one-quarter of its total disposal capacity still available. The City has a contract with the landfill that is reviewed and renewed annually. It is anticipated that the City will continue to be served by Ostrom Road Landfill, which is not anticipated to reach capacity until 2066. The City of Colusa would continue to provide solid waste collection service for the City and Planning Area under cumulative conditions. The reader is referred to subsection 4.12.4 in Section 4.12 (Public Services) for a discussion of the buildout setting for solid waste service

As mentioned in the discussion under Impact 4.12.4.1 in Section 4.12 (Public Services), the Ostrom Road Landtill currently has approximately one-quarter of its total capacity available to accommodate additional solid waste. With significant residential development anticipated in Yuba, Sutter, Butte, Nevada, and Colusa Counties, along with development proposed in the Colusa General Plan Update, there would be an increased amount of solid waste generated. The additional solid waste may more rapidly take Up the remaining capacity at the Ostrom Road Landfill. Therefore, development under the proposed General Plan Update may contribute cumulatively to a limited landfill capacity. This analysis assumes that the City would continue to use the Ostrom Road Landfill for disposal of its solid waste.

6.2.13 CLIMATE CHANGE

Cumulative Climate Change Setting

Greenhouse Gases and Climate Change

To fully understand global climate change it is important to recognize the naturally occurring "greenhouse effect" and to define the greenhouse gases that contribute to this phenomenon. The temperature on Earth is regulated by this "greenhouse effect," which is so named is because the Earth's atmosphere acts like a greenhouse, warming the planet in much the same way that an ordinary greenhouse warms the air inside its glass walls. Like glass, the gases in the atmosphere let in light yet prevent heat from escaping.
Greenhouse gases (GHG) are naturally occurring gases such as water vapor, carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) that absorb heat radiated from the Earth's surface. Greenhouse gases - carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and others are
transparent to certain wavelengths of the Sun's radiant energy, allowing them to penetrate deep into the atmosphere or all the way to Earth's surface (NASA, 2007). Clouds, ice caps, and particles in the air reflect about 30 percent of this radiation, but oceans and land masses absorb the rest (70 percent of the radiation received from the Sun) before releasing it back toward space as infrared radiation. The greenhouse gases and clouds effectively prevent some of the infrared radiation from escaping; they trap the heat near Earth's surface where it warms it the lower atmosphere. If this natural barrier of atmospheric gases were not present, the heat would escape into space, and Earth's average global temperatures could be as much as 61 degrees Fahrenheit cooler (NASA, 2007).

In addition to natural sources, human activities are exerting a major and growing influence on climate by changing the composition of the atmosphere and by modifying the land surface. Particularly, the increased consumption of fossil fuels (natural gas, coal, gasoline, etc.) has
City of Colusa Colusa General Plan
July 2007 Draft Master Environmental Impact Report
6.0-17

6.0 CUMULATIVE IMPACTS

substantially increased atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases. Measured atmospheric levels of certain greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide have risen substantially in recent decades (Miller, 2000). This increase in atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases unnaturally enhances the "greenhouse effect" by trapping more infrared radiation as it rebounds from the Earth's surface and thus trapping more heat near the Earth's surface.
According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Earth's average surface temperature has increased by about 1.2 to 1.4°F since 1900. The warmest global average temperatures on record have all occurred within the past 15 years, with the warmest two years being 1998 and 2005. Eleven of the last 12 years rank among the hottest years on record (since 1850, when reliable worldwide temperature measurements began) (IPCC, 2007). Most of the warming in recent decades is likely the result of human activities. Other aspects of the climate are also changing such as rainfall patterns, snow and ice cover, and sea level.
Many complex mechanisms interact within Earth's energy budget to establish the global average temperature. For example, a change in ocean temperature would be expected to lead to changes in the circulation of ocean currents, which, in turn would further alter ocean temperatures. There is uncertainty about how some factors could affect global climate change because they have the potential to both enhance and neutralize future climate warming. For instance aerosols, including particulate matter, reflect sunlight back to space. As particulate matter attainment designations are met, and fewer emissions of particulate matter occur, the cooling effect of anthropogenic aerosols would be reduced, and the greenhouse effect would be further enhanced. Similarly, aerosols act as cloud condensation nuclei, aiding in cloud formation and increasing cloud lifetime. Clouds can efficiently reflect solar radiation back to space (see discussion of the cloud effect below). As particulate matter emissions are reduced, the indirect positive effect of aerosols on clouds would be reduced, potentially further amplifying the greenhouse effect.
Another mechanism effecting climate is cloud cover. As global temperature rises, the ability of the air to hold moisture increases, facilitating cloud formation. If an increase in cloud cover occurs at low or middle altitudes, resulting in clouds with greater liquid water content such ais stratus or cumulus clouds, more radiation would be reflected back to space, resulting in a negative feedback mechanism, wherein the side effect of more cloud cover resulting from global warming acts to balance further warming. If clouds form at higher altitudes in the form of cirrus clouds, however, these clouds actually allow more solar radiation to pass through than they reflect, and ultimately they act as a GHG themselves. This results in a positive feedback mechanism in which the side effect of global warming acts to enhance the warming process. This feedback mechanism, known as the "cloud effect" contributes to uncertainties associated with projecting future global climate conditions.
Other mechanisms include permafrost and polar and sea ice. As global temperature continues
to rise, CH4 gas currently trapped in permafrost, would be released into the atmosphere when areas of permafrost thaw. Thawing of permafrost attributable to global warming would be expected to accelerate and enhance global warming trends. Additionally, as the surface area of polar and sea ice continues to diminish, the Earth's albedo, or reflectivity, is also anticipated to decrease. More incoming solar radiation will likely be absorbed by the Farth rather than being reflected back to space, further enhancing the greenhouse effect. The scientific community is still studying these and other positive and negative feedback mechanisms to better understand their potential effects on global climate change.

6.0 CUMULATIVE IMPACTS

IMPACTS OF GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE

Global Implications
Recognizing the problem of global climate change, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) established the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 1988. It is open to all members of the United Nations and WMO. The role of the IPCC is to assess on a comprehensive, objective, open and transparent basis the scientific, technical and socio-economic information relevant to understanding the scientific basis of risk of human-induced climate change, its potential impacts and options for adaptation and mitigation. According to climate models, the IPCC projects that the Earth's average surface temperature should rise 1.8 - 6.3 °F before the year 2100. If the atmospheric concentration of CO2 doubles from its late 1700's level of 280 parts per million to 560 parts per million, the most likely rise in temperature would be about 3.6 °F. This may not seem like a significant increase, yet even at the lowest projected increase of 1.8 °F, the Earth would be warmer than it has been for 10,000 years (Miller, 2000).
AS previously stated, 11 of the last 12 years rank among the hottest years on record. The IPCC Fourth Assessment Report's Working Group Summary for Policymakers (Report) synthesizes current scientific understanding of global climate change and projects future climate change using the most comprehensive set of well-established global climate models. The Report incorporates findings of the current effects of global climate change. These finding include:
The intensity of tropical cyclones (hurricanes) in the North Atlantic has increased over the past 30 years, which correlates with increases in tropical sea surface temperatures.
Droughts have become longer and more intense, and have affected larger areas since the 1970s, especially in the tropics and subtropics.
Since 1900 the Northern Hemisphere has lost seven percent of the maximum area covered by seasonally frozen ground.

Mountain glaciers and snow cover have declined worldwide.
Satellite data since 1978 show that the extent of Arctic sea ice during the summer has
shrunk by more than 20 percent.
Since 1961, the world's oceans have been absorbing more than 80 percent of the heat added to the climate, causing ocean water to expand and contributing to rising sea levels. Between 1993 and 2003 ocean expansion was the largest contributor to sea-level
rise.

Melting glaciers and losses from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have also
contributed to recent sea-level rise.

An enhanced greenhouse effect will generate new patterns of microclimate and will have significant impacts on the economy, environment, and transportation infrastructure and operations due to increased temperatures, intensity of storms, sea level rise, and changes in precipitation. Impacts may include flooding of tunnels, coastal highways, runways, and railways; buckling of highways and railroad tracks, submersion of dock facilities, and shift in agriculture to areas that are now cooler. Such prospects will have strategic security as well as transportation
implications.

6.0 CUMULATIVE IMPACTS

Climate change affects public health and the environment. Increased smog and emissions, respiratory disease, reduction in the State's water supply, extensive coastal damage, and changes in vegetation and crop patterns have been identified as effects of climate change. The impacts of climate change are broad-ranging and interact with other market failures and economic dynamics, giving rise to many complex policy problems. If global greenhouse gas emissions continue rising on their current trajectory, the costs of climate change could eventually total 5 - 20 percent of the annual global gross domestic product (GDP) (Caltrans, page 4). The findings are the latest in a string of reports warning that the rate of carbon dioxide accumulating in the atmosphere is increasing at an alarming pace.

California Implications
Climate change is a global problem, and GHGs are global pollutants, unlike criteria air pollutants and TACS, which are pollutants of regional and local concern. Worldwide, California is the 12th to 16th largest emitter of CO2, and is responsible for approximately two percent of the world's CO2 emissions (CEC, 2006a, 2006b). In 2004, California produced 492 million gross metric tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent (CEC, 2006a).
Increased global average temperature increases ocean temperatures and the Pacific Ocean strongly influences the climate within California. If the temperature of the ocean warms, it is anticipated that the winter snow season would be shortened. Snowpack in the Sierra Nevada provides both water supply (runoff) and storage (within the snowpack before melting), which is a major source of supply for the state. According to a California Energy Commission (CEC) report, the snowpack portion of the supply could potentially decline by 70 to 90 percent by the end of the 21st century (CEC, 2006c). This phenomenon could lead to significant chalienges securing an adequate water supply for a growing state population.
Further, the increased ocean temperature could result in increased moisture flux into the state; however, since this would likely increasingly come in the form of rain rather than snow in the high elevations, increased precipitation could lead to increased potential and severity of flood events, placing more pressure on California's levee/flood control system. Sea level has risen approximately seven inches during the last century and, according to the CEC report, it is predicted to rise an additional 22-35 inches by 2100, depending on the future GHG emissions levels (CEC 2006c). If this occurs, resultant effects could include increased coastal flooding, saltwater intrusion and disruption of wetlands (CEC, 2006c). As the existing climate throughout California changes over times, mass migration of species, or worse, failure of species to migrate in time to adapt to the perturbations in climate, could also result.
According to the California Environmental Protection Agency, the climate changes for giobal warming could affect agriculture, the fishing industry, California's coastline, forests, and ecosystems, increase air pollution, and energy production (CalEPA, 2002).

Agriculture
Potential impacts, such as reduced water supply, more severe droughts, more winter floods, and drier growing seasons will affect California's agriculture. Many farms, especially in the fruit and nut business require long-term investments making fast adaptation difficult, and could thus experience serious losses if decisions continue to be made with no regard to expected climate
changes.

6.0 CUMULATIVE IMPACTS

Fishing
Studies found that as a result of changes in ocean conditions, the distribution and abundance of major fish stocks will change substantially. Impacts to fisheries related to El Nino/ Southern Oscillation illustrate how climate directly impacts marine fisheries on short term scales. Higher sea surface temperatures in 1997-1998 during the El Nino had a great impact on market squid, California's largest fishery by volume. The California Regional Assessment reports that landings fell to less than 1,000 metric tons in that season, down from 110,000 tons in the 1996-1997 season. Other unusual events also occurred such as poor salmon returns, a series of plankton blooms,
and seabird die-offs.

Coastline

with climate changes, recreational facilities and developed coastlines will also be more vulnerable to hurricanes, storm surges, flooding increases. Increasing population growth in coastal areas is a reason for further concern, since these areas could be more vulnerable to climate change impacts. Impacts of expected sea level rise and increased storm surges are numerous. Beachfront homes and harbors as well as wetlands may flood. Sewage systems may be overwhelmed by storm runoff and high tides. Coastal airports are vulnerable to flooding (San Francisco, Oakland and Santa Barbara). Jetties and seawalls may have to be raised and strengthened to protect harbors which are used for shipping, recreation, and tourism.

Forests

The California Regional Assessment notes that an increase in the number and extent of areas burned by wildfires in recent years, and modeling results under changing climate conditions suggest that fires may be hotter, move faster, and be more difficult to contain under future climate conditions. The factors which contribute to the risk of catastrophic fires (fuel loads, high temperatures, dry conditions, and wind) are typically present already in summer and fall seasons in California, but can exist at other times of the year, especially in drought conditions. Public safety is an issue as more home and tourism developments on coastal hills and mountains and the foothills and higher elevations in the Sierra Nevada are highly susceptible to catastrophic
wild fires.

Ecosystems

The current distribution, abundance, and vitality of species and habitats are strongly dependent on climatic (and microclimatic) conditions. Climate is change is expected to result in warmer temperatures year-round, accompanied by substantially wetter winters. Rising sea level will significantly affect coastal wetlands because they are mostly within a few feet of sea level. As the sea rises, these wetlands will move inland. The overall acreage of wetlands will be reduced due to constraints by existing urban development and steeper slopes immediately inland of existing wetlands. Tidal rivers, estuaries, and relatively flat shoreline habitats will be more subject to damage by flooding and erosion. More severe storm surges from the ocean, due to higher sea levels, combined with higher river runoff could significantly increase flood levels by more than the rise in sea level alone. Erosion of beaches would decrease habitat for beach- dependent species, such as seals, shorebirds, and endangered species (for example, snowy plover and least tern). Aquatic habitats are also likely to be significantly affected by climatic changes. Most fish have limits to how hot or cold the water can be before they must either find more hospitable temperatures or die. As temperatures warm, many fish will have to retreat to cooler waters.

6.0 CUMULATIVE IMPACTS

Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns would also shift California's current climate zones, and thus habitats associated with these zones, northward by approximately 100 - 400 miles, ais well as upwards in elevation by 500-1500 feet. Global climate change would alter the composition, structure and arrangement of the vegetation cover of the state (forest and wildland). Species distribution would move geographically as the climate changes, with forest stands, woodlands and grassland species predicted to move northward and higher in elevation. The entire vegetative community may be affected if non-native invasive species occupy sites and replace native plants. Outbreaks of insects and diseases could compromise forest health and the capability of the forest stands reproduce and to store carbon on a landscape basis. Forest fires are likely to become more frequent and severe if soils become drier. Changes in pest populations could further increase the stress on forests.

Air Quality

Projected climate changes will impact the quality of California's air, public health, and environment. Higher temperatures increase the formation of ground level ozone and particulate
it matter, making it more difficult to meet the health-base air quality standards for these pollutants. Ground-level ozone has been shown to aggravate existing respiratory ilinesses such as asthma, reduce lung function, and induce respiratory inilammation. Ambient ozone also reduces agricultural crop yields and impairs ecosystem health.
The particulate matter of most concern - PM10 has a diameter smaller than 10 micrometers and can easily pass into the lung, contributing to the development of lung tissue damage. PM10 has been implicated in exacerbation of cardiovascular disease, asthma, other respiratory diseases, and associated with increased mortality. Air pollution is also made worse by increases in natural hydrocarbon emissions and evaporative emissions of fuels and solvents which leads to higher levels of ozone and PMio during hot weather. Warmer temperatures that cause increased use of air conditioners can cause increased air pollutants from power plants and from vehicle operation. In addition, warming, drying, and increased winds could mean hotter, harder-to- control wildfires. These wildfires could result in increased levels of fine particulate matter that could also exceed State and federal standards and harm public health.

Electricity Generation
California's electricity generation is currently relatively efficient when it comes to emissions of greenhouse gases. The national average for the electricity generation share of total greenhouse gas emissions is approximately 40 percent, while California electricity accounts for only 16 percent of statewide emissions. This is in part due to California's significant amount of imported electricity, mild climate, and lack of energy-intensive industry. Over the past two decades, California has developed one of the largest and most diverse renewable electricity generation industries in the world. However, changes in climate of the magnitude predicted by the Intergovemmental Panel of Climate Change would substantially affect electricity generation throughout California and the entire Western States grid, particularly for hydroelectric facilities.
Less snowpack would result in lower levels of hydro generation in the summer and fall seasons due to reduced runoff in those seasons. Additional hydropower may be available during the winter and the spring. However, on balance hydropower is more useful and valuable within the grid mix of generation sources when it is available throughout the peak summer and fall seasons. The Natural gas distribution system may also be damaged because of landslides and fires. Flooding could also impact pipelines, wells and related petroleum extraction equipment. Warmer weather would result in an increased demand for electricity for cooling appliances in homes, and businesses.

REGULATORY FRAMEWORK

STATE

Assembly Bill 1493
In 2002, then-Governor Gray Davis signed Assembly Bill (AB) 1493. AB 1493 requires that the California Air Resources Board (ARB) develop and adopt, by January 1, 2005, regulations that achieve "the maximum feasible reduction of greenhouse gases emitted by passenger vehicles and light-duty truck and other vehicles determined by the ARB to be vehicles whose primary use is noncommercial personal transportation in the state."

Executive Order S-3-05

Executive Order S-3-05, which was signed by Governor Schwarzenegger in 2005, proclaims that California is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. It declares that increased temperatures could reduce the Sierra's snowpack, further exacerbate California's air quality problems, and potentially cause a rise in sea levels. To combat those concerns, the Executive Order established total greenhouse gas emission targets. Specifically, emissions are to be reduced to the 2000 level by 2010, the 1990 level by 2020, and to 80 percent below the 1990
level by 2050.
The Executive Order directed the Secretary of the California Environmental Protection Agency (CalEPA) to coordinate a multi-agency effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to the target levels. The Secretary will also submit biannual reports to the governor and state legislature describing: (1) progress made toward reaching the emission targets; (2) impacts of global warming on California's resources; and (3) mitigation and adaptation plans to combat these impacts. To comply with the Executive Order, the Secretary of the CalEPA created a Climate Act Team (CAT) made up of members from various state agencies and commission. CAT released its first report in March 2006. The report proposed to achieve the targets by building on voluntary actions of California businesses, local government and community actions, as well as through state incentive and regulatory programs.
Assembly Bill 32, the California Climate Solutions Act of 2006
In September 2006, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed AB 32, the California Climate Solutions Act of 2006. AB 32 requires that statewide GHG emissions be reduced to 1990 levels by the year 2020. This reduction will be accomplished through an enforceable statewide cap on GHG emissions that will be phased in starting in 2012. To effectively implement the cap, AB 32 directs ARB to develop and implement regulations to reduce statewide GHG emissions from stationary sources. AB 32 specifies that regulations adopted in response to AB 1493 should be used to address GHG emissions from vehicles. However, AB 32 also includes language stating
that if the AB 1493 regulations cannot be implemented, then ARB should develop new regulations to control vehicle GHG emissions under the authorization of AB 32.
AB 32 requires that ARB adopt a quantified cap on GHG emissions representing 1990 emissions levels and disclose how it arrives at the cap; institute a schedule to meet the emissions cap; and
develop tracking, reporting, and enforcement mechanisms to ensure that the state achieves reductions in GHG emissions necessary to meet the cap. AB 32 also includes guidance to institute emissions reductions in an economically efficient manner and conditions to ensure that businesses and consumers are not unfairly affected by the reductions.

Senate Bill 1368

SB 1368 is the companion bill of AB 32 and was signed by Governor Schwarzenegger in September 2006. SB 1368 requires the California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to establish a greenhouse gas emission performance standard for baseload generation from investor owned utilities by February 1, 2007. The California Energy Commission (CEC) must establish a similar standard for local publicly owned utilities by June 30, 2007. These standards cannot exceed the greenhouse gas emission rate from a baseload combined-cycle natural gas fired plant. The legislation further requires that all electricity provided to California, including imported electricity, must be generated from plants that meet the standards set by the PUC and CEC.

LOCAL

Colusa General Plan

The adopted City of Colusa General Plan currently is used as the "blueprint" to guide future development within the City limits and in unincorporated portions of the existing Planning Area. The existing General Plan has no policies applicable to global warming and climate change issues. The proposed General Plan Update would establish policies and implementing actions associated with air quality and energy efficiency which would reduce the production of GHGs. Specific proposed policies and implementing actions are discussed in the impact analyses
below.

CUMULATIVE IMPACTS AND MITIGATION MEASURES

STANDARDS OF SIGNIFICANCE

While AB 32 requires ARB to develop thresholds of significance for GHGs by 2008, no air district in California, including the Colusa County Air Pollution Control District, has identified a significance threshold for GHG emissions or a methodology for analyzing air quality impacts related to greenhouse gas emissions at this time. The state has identified 1990 emission levels as a goal through adoption of AB 32. To meet this goal, California would need to generate lower levels of GHG emissions than current levels. However, no standards have yet been adopted quantifying 1990 emission targets. It is recognized that for most projects there is no simple is metric available to determine if a single project would help or hinder meeting the AB 32 emission goals. In addition, at this time AB 32 only applies to stationary source emissions. Consumption of fossii fuels in the transportation sector accounted for over 40 percent of the total GHG emissions in California in 2004. Current standards for reducing vehicle emissions considered under AB 1493 call for "the
maximum feasible reduction of greenhouse gases emitted by passenger vehicles and light-duty trucks and other vehicles," and do not provide a quantified target for GHG emissions reductions
for vehicles.

Emitting CO2 into the atmosphere is not itself an adverse environmental affect. It is the cumulative increased concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere resulting in global climate change and the associated consequences of climate change that results in adverse environmental affects (e.g., sea level rise, loss of snowpack, severe weather events). Although it iS possible to generally estimate a project's incremental contribution of CO2 into the atmosphere, it typically not possible to determine whether or how an individual project's relatively small incremental contribution might translate into physical effects on the environment. Given the complex interactions between various global and regional-scale physical, chemical, atmospheric, terrestrial, and aquatic systems that result in the physical expressions of global

6.0 CUMULATIVE IMPACTS

climate change, it is impossible to discern whether the presence or absence of CO2 emitted by the project would result in any altered conditions.
Given the challenges associated with determining a project specific significance criteria for GHG emissions when the issue must be viewed on a global scale, a quantitative significance criteria is not proposed for the Colusa General Plan project. For this analysis, a project's incremental contribution to global climate change would be considered significant if due to the size or nature of the project it would generate a substantial increase in GHG emissions relative to existing conditions.

METHODOLOGY

GHG emissions associated with the Colusa General Plan project were estimated using CO2 emissions as a proxy for all GHG emissions. This is consistent with the current reporting protocol of the California Climate Action Registry (CCAR). Calculations of GHG emissions typically focus on CO2 because it is the most commonly produced GHG in terms of both number of sources and volume generated, and because it is among the easiest GHGs to measure. However, it is important to note that other GHGs have a higher global warming potential than CO2. For example, 1 pound of methane has an equivalent globai warming potential of 21 pounds of CO2 (California Climate Action Registry 2006).
While there are various methods for determining the potential GHG emissions of a specific
project determining, at this time, there is not an approved ARB method. For the Colusa General Plan project, two different methods were used, based on the emission source (buildings or vehicles) to ascertain the potential CO2 emissions at project buildout. Discussed below are the estimated CO2 emissions for residential buildings, non-residential buildings, residential vehicles and non-residential vehicles. The methodology used to determine the CO2 emissions of each of
these categories i discussed within that category analysis.

CUMULATIVE IMPACTS AND MITIGATION MEASURES FOR THE PROPOSED GENERAL PLAN UPDATE

Cumulative Increase in GHG Emissions

Impact 6.14 Buildout of the proposed General Plan Update would result in the cumulative increase of greenhouse gases including CO2 emitted into the atmosphere.
This is considered a significant impact and the proposed project would have a cumulatively considerable contribution.

The amount of GHGS emissions produced from residential and commercial buildings are related to the amount of energy that is used to operate the building such as electricity, natural gas and fuei oil.

GHG emissions from the industrial sector are produced from many industrial activities. For example, CO2 is produced from fossil fuels, with the major contributions from oil and natural gas extraction; crude oil refining; food processing; stone, clay, glass, and cement manufacturing; chemical manufacturing; and cement production. Other industrial activities produce methane emissions, with the major contributions from petroleum and natural gas supply systems and wastewater treatment. Still other industrial activities produce nitrous oxide emissions with the major contributions from nitric acid production and municipal wastewater treatment.

6.0 CUMULATIVE IMPACTS

Residential Buildings
Under buildout conditions the implementation of the proposed General Plan Update will result in an estimated total CO2 emission for residential buildings of 401,009,310 lbs/yr. This is an increase of 247,172,130 lbs/yr over existing conditions.
The method used to determine CO2 emissions from buildings is based on the EPA Personal GHG
Calculator which is available at http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/emissions/ind_ calculator.html. The following attributes were inputted into the GHG calculator to determine the
amount of CO2 emissions of single home in Colusa:

• All residential building types were treated the same. The CO2 emissions for residential buildings were produced solely by the EPA Personal Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Calculator Annual Househoid Estimator and include CO2- equivalent amounts as well as other sources of emissions other than electricity use.
Assumptions used in EPA Personal GHG Calculator include:
0 miles vehicle per week traveled (vehicle travel will be analyzed separately) and
No recycling.

This emission was then multiplied by the existing and projected number of homes in the City of Colusa under the proposed project's buildout conditions as identified in Section 4.0 Table 4.0-4 of this EIR. Table 6.13-1 illustrates the CO2 emissions under existing and buildout conditions.

parameters were used to calculate the amount of CO2 emitted by the non-residential buildings in the Planning Area:

• All non-residential building types were treated the same (ie. same energy intensity, percentage from coal/natural gas, and emission factors).
The CO2 emissions for non-residential buildings are not COz-equivalent emissions but only
CO2 emissions.

0 CO2 emissions estimates for non-residential buildings are based solely on electricity use
and no other energy source. These estimates are weighted according to coal and natural gas based electricity generation in California.
Non-residential building annual energy intensity is based on the year 2002 for the PG&E service area as a whole and are estimated to be 12.95 kWh/ft2 as identified in Table 9-1 of the California Commercial End-Use Survey reporti.
CO2 emissions factors for non-residential uses are based the EPA Power Profiler for
commercial uses available at http://www.epa.gov/cleanenergy/powerprofiler.htm
Table 6.13-2 illustrates the estimated CO2 emissions for non-residential uses in Colusa under existing and buildout conditions. This calculation does not include vehicle trips for non- residential uses. is It is estimated that buildout of the proposed General Plan Update will result in the production of 77,337,884 lbs/year of CO2 for non-residential uses. This is an increase of 59,948,536 lbs/year over existing conditions.

Traffic

The traffic analysis conducted for the project (Appendix B) provides data that can be used to estimate CO2 emissions from project generated residential vehicle trips. Buildout of the project would result in 200,795 residential and non-residential daily vehicle trips per day (see Table 4.3-6). Assuming a trip rate of 4.21 miles per trip2, the proposed project at fuil buildout would generate an average of 845,347 vehicle miles traveled (VMT) per day, or approximately308.50 million VMT annually. Assuming an emissions factor for future CO2 emissions from vehicles of approximately 366 grams of CO2 per mile (California Air Resources Board 2002), approximately 124,449 tons (179,878,784 Ibs) of CO2 per year would be generated by residential vehicle trips under buildout

Note that although this future CO2 emissions factor does assume certain reductions in vehicle emissions due to future vehicle models operating more efficiently, it does not take into account additional vehicle emission reductions that might take place in response to AB 1493, if mobile source emission reductions are ultimately implemented through this legislation.

Total General Plan Buildout CO2 Emissions

Table 6.13-4 illustrates the total buildout amount of CO2 emissions as a result of implementation General Plan Update. According to the methodologies listed previously for the identification of CO2 emissions, buildout of the General Pian will result in an increase in CO2 emissions of .298 million metric tons (MMT) annually. In comparison, the amount of CO2 emitted in California in
2004 was 334.9 MMT (369.2 million tons).

The analysis methodology used for the emissions estimate assumes that all emissions sources are new sources and that emissions from these sources are 100 percent additive to existing
conditions. This is a standard approach taken for air quality analyses. In many cases, such an assumption is appropriate because it is impossible to determine whether emissions sources associated with a project move from outside the air basin and are in effect new emissions sources, or whether they are sources that were already in the air basin and just shifted to a new
location. However, because the effects of GHGs are global, a project that merely shifts the location of a GHG-emitting activity (e.g., where people live, where vehicles drive, or where companies conduct business) would result in no net change in global GHG emissions levels.

Colusa General Plan City of Colusa
Draft Master Environmental Impact Report July 2007

6.0 CUMULATIVE IMPACTS

For example, if a substantial portion of California's population migrated from the South Coast Air Basin to the Sacramento Valley Air Basin, this would likely result in decreased emissions in the South Coast Air Basin and increased emissions in the Sacramento Valley Air Basin, but little change in overall global GHG emissions. However, if a person moves from one location where the land use pattern requires substantial vehicle use for day-to-day activities (commuting, shopping, etc.) to a new development that promotes shorter and fewer vehicle trips, more walking, and overall less energy usage, then it could be argued that the new development would result in a potential net reduction in global GHG emissions.
It is impossible to know at this time whether residents in the City of Colusa will have longer or shorter commutes relative to their existing homes; whether they will walk, bike, and use public
transportation more or less than under existing circumstances; and whether their overall driving habits will result in higher or lower VMT. Much of the vehicle generated CO2 emissions attributed to the project could simply be from vehicles currently emitting CO2 at an existing location moving to the project site, and not from new vehicle emissions sources relative to global climate change. Additionally, buildout of the General Plan is not anticipated to occur for many years. Future changes in building energy efficiency standards as well as higher production of non CO2 emitting energy sources (i.e. wind and solar power) would decrease the amount of CO2
emissions from buildings than those calculated today. As a result, although it is possible to calculate the estimated contribution of building and vehicle generated CO2 emissions from buildout of the General Plan Update, the actual CO2 contribution during the life of the General Plan would likely be much less than the 0.298 million metric tons of CO2 per year calculated
above.

provided they meet ali public, safety, health, and design requirements and are proven to be
reliable.

Implementation Action PRC-11.2.b: Capital improvement Program
The City will consider incorporating into its Capital Improvement Program a green fleet that includes the City's purchase of fuel-efficient and alternative-fuel vehicles.
The above policies and implementing actions will assist in the reduction of GHGs. However, at this time, due to the lack of a threshold of significance, it is not possible to determine at what level of impact the increase in GHGs would occur as a result of implementation of the General Plan Update. It is generally believed that climate changes are now and will continue to occur
because of the increase of greenhouse gasses throughout the world. AB 32 requires that statewide GHG emissions be reduced to 1990 levels by the year 2020. This will require an overall reduction GHGs emitted in the state. Buildout of the General Plan Planning Area would most
likely, with present technology, increase the City's contribution to GHG emissions beyond the
1990 levels.

The City can and does require energy efficient design in building construction within the City. This requirement and the General Plan policies and implementing actions listed previously can effectively reduce GHG emissions from building operations (energy use). Whether or not these requirements will reduce emissions effectively enough to mitigate the City's contribution to GHGs is unknown. The only entity which has jurisdiction over vehicle emissions in California is the state or federal government. Therefore, until such time that there are thresholds of significance for which to compare the City's GHGs contribution, must be assumed that any increase in GHGs will
lead to a change in climate. Therefore, this impact is considered significant and unavoidable and the proposed General Plan Update would have a cumulatively considerable contribution.

According a to a report on the effects of climate change in California by the California Climate Change Center (CCCC), based on state-of-the art climate models, if global heat-trapping emissions proceed at a medium to high rate, temperatures in California are expected to rise 4.7 to 10.5°F by the end of the century. In contrast, a lower emissions rate would keep the projected warming to 3 to 5.6°F. These temperature increases would have widespread cumulative consequences including substantial loss of snowpack, increased risk of large wildfires, reductions
in the quality and quantity of certain agricultural products and health effects. Refer to the Existing Setting section for a description of effects of climate change.
These consequences would potentially affect the residents of the City. For instance, a substantial loss in snowpack may reduce river volumes in the Sacramento River and potentially the amount of groundwater available for use as a water supply. Also, the potential for flooding and drought conditions are increased. Decreasing snowmelt and spring stream flows coupled with increasing demand for water resulting from both growing population and hotter climate could lead to increasing water shortages. By the end of the century, if temperatures rise to the medium warming range and precipitation decreases, late spring stream flow could decline by up to 30 percent. Agricultural areas could be hard hit, with California farmers losing as much as 25
percent of the water supply they need (CCCC, page 7).
Higher temperatures are expected to increase the frequency, duration, and intensity of conditions conducive to air pollution formation. For example, if temperatures rise to the medium
warming range, there will be 75 to 85 percent more days with weather conducive to ozone formation in Los Angeles and the San Joaquin Valley, relative to today's conditions. This is more than twice the increase expected if temperature rises are kept in the lower warming range.
Global warming scenarios provided by CCCC in their report Our Changing Climate Assessing the Risk to California, indicate that by 2100, if temperatures rise to the higher warming range,
there could be up to 100 more days per year with temperatures above 95°F in Sacramento
which means that temperatures in Colusa will certainly rise as well. This is a striking increase over historical patterns. As temperatures rise, residents of Colusa will face greater risk of death from
dehydration, heat stroke/exhaustion, heart attack, stroke, and respiratory distress caused by
extreme heat.

Proposed General Plan Policies and Implementing Actions that Mitigate Potential Impacts
All policies and implementing actions listed under Impact 6.14 would assist in the reduction of
GHGs. Please refer to Impact 6.14 for these policies and implementing actions. Policies and action items discussed in 4.7 would reduce impacts associated with water supply and flooding.
While the General Plan policies and implementing actions would reduce the potential GHG emissions in the City, climate change is a result of global GHG emissions. A complete elimination of GHG emissions in the City would not significantly change GHG emissions on a global scale nor decrease the effects of global climate change on the City's residents. Therefore, this impact is considered signiticant and unavoidable and the proposed General Plan Update would have a cumulatively considerable contribution.

7.0 PROJECT ALTERNATIVES

7.0 PROJECT ALTERNATIVES

7.1 INTRODUCTION

CEQA Guidelines Section 15126.6{a) states that an environmental impact report shall describe and analyze a range of reasonable alternatives to a project. These alternatives a should feasibly attain most of the basic objectives of the project (see Section 3.4 for project objectives), while avoiding or substantially lessening one or more of the significant environmental impacts of the project. An EIR need not consider every conceivable alternative to a project, nor is it required to consider alternatives that are infeasible. The discussion of alternatives shall focus on those which are capable of avoiding or substantially lessening any significant effects of the project, even if they impede the attainment of the project objectives to some degree or would be more costly [CEQA Guidelines Section 15126.6(b)].
CEQA requires an EIR to identify project alternatives and to indicate the manner in which a project's significant effects may be mitigated or avoided, but does not mandate that the EIR itself contain an analysis of the feasibility of the various project alternatives or mitigation measures that it identifies. (Pub. Resources Code, Sections 21002.1, subd. (a); 21100, subd. (b)(4); Sierra Club v. County of Napa (2004) 121 Cal.App.4th 1490, 1503, citing San Franciscans Upholding the Downtown Plan V. City and County of San Francisco (2002) 102 Cal.App.4th 656, 689-690.) As the lead agency, the City of Colusa bears the responsibility for the decisions that must be made before a project can go forward, including determinations of feasibility and whether the benefits of a project outweigh the significant effects the project will have on the environment. (Pub. Resources Code Sections 21002.1, subds. (b) & (c), 21081.) In addition, CEQA specifically provides that in making these determinations, the City shall base its findings on substantial evidence in the record, a provision reflecting an understanding that the City Council will not limit its review to matters set forth in the EIR, but will base its decision on evidence found anywhere in the record. (Sierra Club v. County of Napa, 121 Cal.App.4th at p. 1503; citing Pub. Resources Code, Section 21081.5.)
According to the State CEQA Guidelines, an EIR need only examine in detail those alternatives that could feasibly meet most of the basic objectives of the project. When addressing feasibility, the State CEQA Guidelines Section 15126.6 states that "among the factors that may be taken into account when addressing the feasibility of alternatives are site suitability, economic viability, availability of infrastructure, general plan consistency, jurisdictional boundaries, and whether the applicant can reasonably acquire, control or otherwise have access to alternative sites." The State CEQA Guidelines also specity that the alternatives discussion should not be remote or speculative; however, they need not be presented in the same level of detail as the assessment of the proposed project.
State CEQA Guidelines indicate that several factors need to be considered in determining the range of alternatives to be analyzed in an EIR and the level of analytical detail that should be provided for each alternative. These factors include: (1) the nature of the significant impacts of the proposed project; (2) ability of alternatives to avoid or lessen the significant impacts associated with the project; (3) the ability of the alternatives to meet the objectives of the project; and (4) the feasibility of the alternatives. These factors would be unique for each project.
The significant environmental impacts of the project that the alternatives will seek to eliminate or reduce were determined and based upon the findings contained within each technical section evaluated in Sections 4.1 through 4.12 of this DEIR. These impact areas are identified as:

7.2 ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED BUT NOT SELECTED FOR ANALYSIS

The following alternatives were considered as a possible option to the proposed project. However, upon further evaluation these alternatives were not selected as viable based on the reasoning indicated under each alternative.

ALTERNATIVE LOCATION

CEQA Guidelines Section 15126.6(f) (2) discusses criteria for evaluating the feasibility of an
alternative location for a project. a However, the project evaluated in this document is a General Plan for an existing city. Given the nature of the project, an alternative location is considered
infeasible.

PROPOSED GENERAL PLAN UPDATE ONLY/NO DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS
Under this alternative, the proposed Colusa General Plan and its associated Land Use Policy
Map would be adopted, however the three individual projects; Colusa Crossings, Colusa Riverbend and Brookins Ranch, would not be developed. Future development in the Planning Area would occur as set forth in the Land Use Map. For the Brookins Ranch and Colusa
Riverbend sites, development would occur in accordance within the underlying designation on the Land Use Map, which is Low Density Residential. For the Colusa Crossings site, while the General Plan land use designation are identified as a variety of uses, this site will also be analyzed a Low Density Residential. The analysis assumes that Low Density Residential areas would develop with an average of six dwelling units per acre, with a development area equal to 80 percent of the gross acreage. These are the same assumptions used in calculating the projected number of housing units in the Planning Area at General Plan buildout (see Table 4.2-7 in Section 4.2, Population and Housing).

City of Colusa Colusa General Plan
July 2007 Draft Master Environmental Impact Report
7.0-3

7.0 PROJECT ALTERNATIVES

Based on the assumptions described above, buildout under this alternative could result in approximately 8,764 residential dwelling units and an associated population of 24,890. This is slightly less than development under the proposed General Plan update and the specific development projects. This is because two of the development projects (Brookins Ranch and Colusa Riverbend) were assumed to develop in accordance with their proposed underlying designation in the proposed General Plan update analysis. The only change under this alternative would occur on the Colusa Crossings site, which would not have the proposed medium-density and high-density development. Instead, all residential development would be low-density, leading to a decrease of approximately 324 housing units on the Colusa Crossings
site.

Since the total number of housing units and residents under this alternative is similar to those
under the proposed project, the environmental impacts would be similar. Impacts identified as
potentially significant under the proposed General Plan update would occur under this
alternative. Since it would not duce any potentially significant environmental impacts identified with the proposed project, this alternative was not selected for further analysis.

7.3 PROJECT ALTERNATIVES EVALUATED

In accordance with the provisions of CEQA Guidelines Section 15126.6, this document evaluates
the following alternatives:

• Alternative 1 - No Update/No Development Projects

• Alternative 2 - No Update/Development Projects

• Alternative 3 - Increased Density of Development
Alternative 4 - Revised Circulation Alternative
According to CEQA Guidelines Section 15126.6(d), an EIR shall include sufficient information about each alternative to allow meaningful evaluation, analysis and comparison with the proposed project. This means that the analysis of each alternative does not necessarily have to be as detailed as the analysis for the proposed project. However, it does mean that the evaluation of each alternative must have enough information for a meaningful comparison with the proposed project. Therefore, the evaluation of each alternative in this MEIR will not be as comprehensive as the evaluation of the proposed General Plan, but it will provide adequate detail for a comparison of potential environmental impacts. In accordance with the
recommendation of CEQA Guidelines Section 15126.6, the end of this chapter contains a matrix that summarizes the potential impacts of each alternative relative to the proposed project.
7.3.1 ALTERNATIVE 1 - NO UPDATE/NO DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS

Characteristics

Under Alternative 1, the proposed Colusa General Plan and its associated Land Use Map would not be adopted. The existing City of Colusa General Plan policy document and Land Use Map would remain in effect. The City would utilize its existing zoning and other regulations regarding development within the City limits. Alternative 1's land use planning area would be defined as those areas within the existing city limits. No expansion of the City's Sphere of Influence and Planning Area would take place. Infrastructure would be installed under existing plans, if applicable.

7.0 PROJECT ALTERNATIVES

None of the specitic projects discussed in Section 3.0, Project Description and further evaluated in Section 5.0 (Colusa Riverbend, Colusa Crossings, Brookins Ranch), would be developed. Instead, all unincorporated areas outside the City limits would develop in accordance with the General Plan designations and zoning of Colusa County and not be annexed by the City.
Table 7.0-1 illustrates Alternative 1 land uses by acreage within the existing Planning Area. Alternative 1 would include the conversion of approximately 1,173.6 acres into urban uses under
buildout conditions.

7.0 PROJECT ALTERNATIVES

This analysis of Alternative is consistent with the requirements for analysis of a No Project Alternative, as set forth in CEQA Guidelines Section 15126.6(e). More specifically, CEQA Guidelines Section 15126.6(e) (3)(A) states that, when the project under evaluation is the revision of an existing land use or regulatory plan, the No Project Alternative will be the continuation of the existing plan.

Comparative Impacts

Land Use

Conflicts with Land Use Plans/Policies - Impact 4.1.2
Implementation of the proposed General Plan update could lead to inconsistency with other land use pians and ordinances, particularly the Comprehensive Land Use Plan for the Colusa
County Airport.
The Comprehensive Land Use Plan (CLUP) for the Colusa County Airport defines compatible land uses for parcels near the airport. The overflight zone covers an extensive portion of the southeastern area of the proposed Land Use Diagram. The CLUP states that single-family residential is a compatible land use only if the density is five acres or more per residence. Implementation of the General Plan Update would allow from four to eight units per acre, exceeding the density identified as compatible by the CLUP. No feasible mitigations were identified for this inconsistency, therefore this impact would be considered significant and unavoidable.

Alternative 1 land use designations allow for Rural Residential as well as areas of Medium Density Residential development, all within the overflight zone. The Rural Residential land use designation allows up to 1.5 units per acre, while the Medium Density designation allows up to 10 units per acre. Neither of these designations fall within the density parameters of the CLUP overflight zone. Development under Alternative 1 would result in less residential uses, mainly due to the unit potential differences between Rural Residential and Low Density Residential. However
Alternative is still considered to be inconsistent with the CLUP and would result in the same
impact level as the proposed project.

Incompatibilities Between Land Uses - Impact 4.1.3

Implementation of the proposed General Plan could create conflicts between land uses within
the proposed Planning Area and with land uses adjacent to the proposed Planning Area. Impacts after implementation of the General Plan policies and actions would be less than
significant.

Alternative 1 is a continuation of the adopted General Plan goals, policies, actions and land uses. In Colusa, there are some areas where land uses considered incompatible currently exist. In the unincorporated area along 14th Street, residences exist alongside industrial uses. These
residences were built before zoning was enacted prohibiting such land uses. Additionally,
Alternative allows for residential uses within airport overflight zones as discussed under Impact 4.1.2 above. Alternative would allow these land use incapability to continue. Therefore, Alternative 1 is similar to the proposed project for this impact.

Colusa General Plan City of Colusa
Draft Master Environmental Impact Report July 2007
7.0-6

7.0 PROJECT ALTERNATIVES

Loss of Agricultural Land - Impact 4.1.5 and Cumulative Loss of Agricultural Land - Impact 6.2
The proposed General Plan project would result in the conversion of agricultural land to urban uses. This conversion would result primarily due to the designation of agricultural uses to residential, industrial and commercial uses. Under Alternative 1, the re-designation of agricultural land to urban uses would not occur, as those lands would remain as agricultural under Colusa County jurisdiction, thereby preserving these lands would avoid this significant impact.

Population and Housing

Population and Housing Growth - Impact 4.2.1 and Cumulative Population and Housing Growth
- Impact 6.3

Implementation of the proposed General Plan project would result in significant and unavoidable impacts 1o population and housing growth. As noted previously, Alternative would result in a maximum of 3,725 housing units and 10,617 residents, substantially less than the proposed project, which proposes a maximum of 9,089 housing units and 25,904 residents. Figures for both Alternative 1 and the proposed project are based on applicable General Plan land use designations at buildout.

The impacts on future population growth and housing development may vary, depending on factors such as the housing market, job availability, type of housing built and economic conditions. Under Alternative 1, fewer housing units would be built than under the proposed project. The population projections in this analysis assume a constant relationship between population and housing stock, which likely will not occur. However, as discussed elsewhere in this section, the lower number of housing units under Alternative 1 would result in less significant impacts on the physical environment than the proposed project.
Transportation and Circulation

Local Roadway System - Impact 4.3.1, State Highways - Impact 4.3.2, Intersections - Impact 4.3.3, Cumulative Roadway Impacts Impact 6.4 and Roadway Safety - Impact 4.3.4
The proposed General Plan project would incur impacts to the local roadway system including State Highways 20 and 45, resulting in significant and unavoidable impacts. Alternative is expected to lead to fewer significant impacts on transportation than the proposed project. since there would be less development, and consequently fewer residents, under Alternative 1, there would be fewer motorists and therefore less traffic. It is possible that the growth in population under this alternative could lead to LOS and safety issues at specific intersections and road segments within the City. It is expected that such impacts would be less extensive and would require less mitigation than under the proposed project.
However, implementation of Alternative 1 may result in an increase in commuter traffic on roads,
as residents go to other communities for jobs. The more limited amount of land available for commercial and industrial development under Alternative couid lead to lower job generation. Under Alternative 1, it is estimated that development of commercial, industrial and mixed use
areas could generate up to 2,863 employees. This would lead to a jobs-housing balance of 0.77, which is less is than the 0.96-1.24 range under the proposed project and below a typically desired minimum ratio of 1.00. This could indicate that more people will have to find work outside the City, adding to traffic on roads to other employment centers.

City of Colusa Colusa General Plan
July 2007 Draft Master Environmental Impact Report
7.0-7

7.0 PROJECT ALTERNATIVES

However, this impact would be confined mainly to the State highways, which are the main roads going out of Colusa. The potential increase in commuter traffic on the State highways would be offset by the smaller increase in traffic volume under Alternative 1, although the extent of this offset cannot be determined. Local streets and roads are likely to experience less traffic under Alternative 1, due to the smaller population. This would resuit in less significant impacts on the physical environment than the proposed project.

Noise

Construction Noise - Impact 4.4.3

The proposed project would result in construction noise impacts, which would be reduced to a
less than significant level with the incorporation of proposed mitigation measures.
As with the proposed project, Alternative 1 would result in construction activities, although not at the same intensity because of a smaller amount of developable land. Alternative 1 would have short-term construction noise with could be mitigated to a less than significant impact as with the proposed project, resulting in a comparable level of environmental impact.

Airport Noise - Impact 4.4.4

The General Plan Land Use Diagram indicates that some residential areas may be placed near the Colusa County Airport. As indicated in Figure 4.4-1, areas near the airport may be exposed to noise levels of at least 55 dB CNEL. While mitigation measures may reduce noise levels, it is not anticipated that aircraft noise levels would be mitigated to a less than significant level through implementation of mitigation measures through the Design Review process for all development that may be accommodated under the proposed General Plan. As a result, this impact is significant and unavoidable.
Alternative 1 would 1 also allow sensitive receptor uses to be developed in areas which may be impacted by airport noise. As with the proposed project, while mitigation measures may reduce noise levels, is not anticipated that aircraft noise levels would be mitigated to a less than significant level. The impacts to sensitive receptors for airport related noise may not be fully mitigated, however Alternative would result in less development in the airport noise contours. Therefore, Alternative
proposed project. is considered to have an environmentailly better outcome than the

Cumulative Traffic Noise - Impact 6.5

The proposed project would result in cumulative traffic noise impacts, which would result in a significant and unavoidable impact.
The future population of the City under Alternative 1 and its resulting traffic would be substantially less than the proposed project. As described in the Transportation and Circulation section above, Alternative 1 is expected to generate less traffic than the proposed project, thereby decreasing the potential amount of noise generated by traffic. While there may be some noise impacts in localized areas under Alternative 1, the total amount of noise generated by traffic would decrease and therefore, this alternative is considered to an environmentally better alternative when compared to the proposed project.

7.0 PROJECT ALTERNATIVES

Air Quality

Construction-Related Emissions - Impact 4.5.1

The proposed General Plan project would result in construction-related air quality impacts. Emissions from individual development construction sites would be short term and temporary, but would occur through buildout of the General Plan. At any given times, several construction projects may be under way, which may result in substantial construction-related emissions.
Intensification of individual development projects would account for most development, and consequently most construction-related emissions. However, with incorporation of proposed mitigation measures and General Plan policies and implementing actions, this impact was considered less than signiticant.

Alternative 1 would also allow the new development which would result in construction-related air quality impacts. Construction-related air quality impacts could be reduced to a less than significant level with proper mitigation, as with the proposed project. However, because the difference in the potential developable area between Alternative 1 and the proposed project, from 1,773 acres to 3,805 acres, construction air emissions would be substantially less, Alternative
1 would have less overall construction air emissions than the proposed project. This would result
in an environmentally better outcome.

Operations-Related Emissions - Impact 4.5.2

Table 4.5-3 identifies the daily operational emissions for the proposed project as: 1,085.1 lbs/day for ROG, 316.3 Ibs/day for NOx and 1,326.1 Ibs/day for PMio. Impact 4.5.2 concludes that even with General Plan policies and implementing actions and the proposed mitigation measures
listed under this impact, the proposed project would have a significant and unavoidable impact
in this area.

Alternative 1 would have less operation-related emissions because of the reduced development potential as a result of a smaller area. Alternative 1 land area is approximately 1/3 the size of the proposed project and it can be assumed that this alternative would produce approximately 2/3 less air emissions. However, the differences in land use designations between Alternative 1 and the proposed project would affect this assumption as the proposed project has a much higher ratio of residential land designations (41 percent and 1,621 acres) than that of Alternative 1 (23 percent and 664 acres). As residential uses usually result in the highest proportion of air quality impacts, so Alternative 1 may have more than a reduction of 66.6 percent in air quality impacts. However, 1 Alternative 1 would most likely result in signiticant and unavoidable impacts to air quality as a result of operational emissions because of the substantial growth Alternative represents (approximately 10,617 persons). In any case, any substantial reduction in air emissions, as with the Alternative 1 when compared to the proposed project, even knowing the alternative may result in significant and unavoidable impacts, would be considered an environmentally better solution.

Carbon Monoxide Emissions from Traffic - Impact 4.5.4

Development accommodated under the proposed General Plan Update would increase traffic
volumes on streets throughout the proposed Planning Area, and therefore would increase local carbon monoxide concentrations. Concentrations of this pollutant are related to the levels of traffic and congestion along streets and al intersections. Due to the lack of feasible mitigation, the proposed General Plan project resulted in a significant and unavoidable impact.

City of Colusa Colusa General Plan
July 2007 Draft Master Environmental Impact Report
7.0-9

7.0 PROJECT ALTERNATIVES

Alternative ] would continue existing conditions. The state-wide carbon monoxide protocol document identifies signalized intersections operating at Level of Service (LOS) E or F as having F potential to result in localized exceedances of the state/federal ambient air quality standards (Garza et al, 1997). Colusa can be expected to have very low concentrations of this pollutant, and signalized intersections affected by project traffic currently operate at good levels of service, with the exception of the intersection at Bridge St (SR 20)/Wescott Road/Tuttle Lane. This intersection currently operates at LOS F under PM peak hour conditions. However, Alternative 1 would allow for the development of approximately 3,725 housing units or an estimated future population of 10,617 persons. This is an increase of 4,844 persons over the existing population of the Cityl. An increase in population generally increases roadway traffic. However, this increase is not as substantial as the proposed project and therefore impacts to City intersection will be less and result in a better LOS. Alternative would have a better environmental impact than the proposed project in this area.
Cumulative Regional Air Basin Impacts - Impact 6.6
Implementation of the proposed General Plan project would result in an increased population and substantial new development, which would adversely affect regional air quality. The growth in popuiation, vehicle usage and business activity within the NSVAB, when considered with growth proposed under the General Plan, would contribute to cumulative regional air quality impacts. It also could potentially delay attainment of standards for which counties in the NSVAB currently are in nonattainment status, mainly ozone and PM10. This would result in a cumulatively considerable and significant and unavoidable impact.
Alternative 1 would have fewer air quality impacts than the proposed project. Since traffic is a major source of pollutant emissions, and since traffic would be reduced under Alternative 1, fewer emissions from traffic would occur. Also, with less industrial development occurring under this alternative, pollutants from industrial sources would be less. However, these reductions in
emissions may be offset to an extent by emissions from increased commuter traffic on roads leading out of the City due to less employment generating development allowed under Alternative 1. As with the discussion expressed under Operations-Related Emissions - Impact 4.5.2 above, any substantial reduction in air emissions would be considered an environmentally better solution. However, the potential decrease in employment opportunities in the City resulting in higher commuter traffic may offset any potential reduction in local air emissions. As a result, Alternative 1 is considered to have a similar impact on the regional air basin as the proposed project.

Implementation of the proposed General Plan project may lead to development on or adjacent to hazardous material contamination sites. Located in the City are identified areas of potential hazardous material contamination sites. Implementation of the mitigation measures identified under this impact would reduce to a less than significant level.
Alternative 1 would not change the existence of hazardous material contamination sites nor the potential for health and safety hazards occurring. The contamination sites identified in Section

4.6 are all located within Alternative 1's Planning Area and therefore this impact would not be reduced by a smaller planning area than that of the proposed project. Alternative does not include the development of mitigation measures to reduce potential hazardous materials sites impacts but is rather a continuation of the adopted General Plan, which does not have policies or actions regarding the potential health and safety hazards of hazardous materials contamination sites. As such, protection of persons from potential health and safety hazards as a result of the existence of hazardous materials contamination sites in the City is not guaranteed through policies, actions or mitigations in Alternative 1. As a result, Alternative 1 would be considered to have a worse impact.

Contamination on Agricultural Lands - Impact 4.6.7

Implementation of the proposed General Plan would encourage development on lands
currently or previously used for agriculture, which may contain hazardous material contamination from substances used in past operations. Implementation of mitigation measure identified under Impact 4.6.7 would reduce or eliminate potential health hazards associated with development of former agricultural lands to a less than significant level.
As with hazardous materials sites, Alternative 1 does not include the development of mitigation
measures to reduce potential agricultura-related hazardous materials but is rather a continuation of the adopted General Plan, which does not have policies or actions regarding the potential health and safety hazards of these materials. As such, protection of persons from potential health and safety hazards as a result of the existence of these agricultural-related hazardous materials in the City is not guaranteed through policies, actions or mitigations in Alternative 1. As a result, Alternative 1 would be considered to have a worse impact.

Hydrology and Water Quality

Groundwater Supply - Impact 4.7.5
Implementation of the proposed General Plan would increase demand for water, requiring increased groundwater production. Future development allowed by the proposed General Plan would place an increasing demand on the City's existing water supplies. An increased
demand would at the least require additional pumping from existing wells, and possibly require more wells to be drilled. This would increase the amount of groundwater withdrawn from the local aquifer. Implementation of the proposed mitigation measures listed under Impact 4.7.5, along with the General Plan policies and implementing actions, would reduce the impacts to groundwater supply to a less than significant level.
Section 4.7 of this MEIR discusses water usage for the general City of Colusa area. According to Tully and Young, hydrological consultants for the MEIR, agricultural uses tend to use more water
that urban uses. According to Table 4.7-2, which provides an estimate of the water demand for
the City and surrounding area, under current conditions areas currently within the City Sphere of
Influence would actually have a higher water demand than the proposed project through year
2027, mainly due to existing agricultural uses. Alternative (existing General Plan in the table)
would actually have a higher water demand than the proposed project through year 2027. This is due primarily to the removal of land from agricultural uses under the proposed project which would not occur under the adopted General Plan.
The City currently provides its municipal water via wells. An increased demand would at the least require additional pumping from these wells, and possibly require more wells to be drilled.
This would increase the amount of groundwater withdrawn from the local aquifer. Because

Biological Resources

Cumulative Biological Resource Impacts - Impact 6.9

implementation of the General Plan Update with it resulting development would result in direct and indirect impacts to listed and non-listed special-status species as well as impacts to jurisdictional waters of the U.S., non-special status species, trees, habitat and movement corridors. This results in a cumulatively considerable and significant and unavoidable impact.
The majority of land area within Alternative 1 is already developed as urban uses, however special-status species have been recorded within close proximity of the City (see Figure 4.8-2). While, most of the land within Alternative 1 is already developed thereby reducing the potential for impacts to special-status species, there area areas such as the Colusa Riverbend project site which have the potential for special-status species and their habitats as well as potential
jurisdictional waters of the United States.
The resultant less than significant level for the proposed project is due to the policies, implementing actions and mitigation measures identified in the General Plan and MEIR.
Alternative does not include the policies or actions or mitigation measures to reduce the potential of impacts special-status species. As such, protection of special-status species is not guaranteed. However, because the majority of land in Alternative is developed, the probability of impacting a special-status species in much less than the proposed project. Additionally, environmental review for discretionary projects, such as a subdivision, is still required
as part of state CEQA law and if the occurrence of a special-status species or its habitat should be identified at that time. As a result, Alternative 1 would be considered to have a better impact to special-status species and its habitat than the proposed project mainly due to the much larger land area of the proposed project and higher potential for occurrence in this area.

Historic and Cultural Resources

Disturbance of Cultural and Paleontological Resources - Impact 4.9.2
Future development associated with implementation of the proposed General Plan project may encounter currently unknown cultural resources and paleontological resources, thereby disturbing their sites. Implementation of the mitigation measure, along with the proposed General Plan policy, would avoid or minimize adverse physical impacts on undiscovered cuitural resources, and ensure their proper disposition with minimal loss of resource value. Impacts after mitigation would be less than significant.
Under Alternative 1, impacts on cultural resources would be similar to those under the proposed project. Most of the known cultural resources are located within the City limits, which is where activity under Alternative 1 would be concentrated. Therefore, Alternative 1 potentially would have a similar impact on these resources as would development under the proposed project.
However, since less land area would be developed under Alternative 1, there would be a lower probability of encountering currently unknown cultural resources in undeveloped areas. Therefore, Alternative would have a better outcome on impacts related to unknown cultural
resources.

Scenic Vistas - Impact 4.10.3

Implementation of the proposed General Plan Update may result in the obstruction of scenic vistas at the existing edges of urban development. Policies and implementing actions would protect scenic vistas to the extent feasible. However, the only way to avoid or reduce this impact to a less than significant impact would be to prohibit development that would affect views of scenic resources. This would be inconsistent with the objectives of the proposed
General Plan Update and the proposed land use map. No feasible mitigation measures can be applied and results in a significant and unavoidable impact.
Alternative 1 would result in less urban development than under the proposed project and as such, more views of scenic vistas would be retained. Therefore, this alternative would result in less potential obstruction of scenic views and would be considered a better alternative for the
protection of scenic vistas.

Public Services and Utilities

Extension of energy and communication infrastructure - Impact 4.12.5.2
Implementation of the General Plan Update would require the extension of energy and communication infrastructure. This would potentially impact the environment by increase air pollutants during construction, create impacts to biological resources, create noise and vibration during construction, create visual impacts, etc. Mitigation measures provided in the MEIR reduce this impact to a less than significant level.

Alternative may also require the extension of energy and communication infrastructure. However, this would occur at a much smaller scale due to the smaller land area of Alternative 1
that would be developed in comparison to the proposed project. This is considered to be a better alternative.

Climate Change
Cumulative increase in global greenhouse gas emissions and cumulative effects of global climate change (Impacts 6.14 and 6.15)
Implementation of the General Plan Update would result in an increase in greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to cumulative climate change impacts, including rising temperatures. The effects of climate change may expose the City to increased flooding, uncertain water supply, health effects and other impacts under cumulative conditions as described under Impact 6.15.

1 Alternative 1 would also result in increased development and both contribute to cumulative climate change impacts and expose the City to the effects of climate change. However, the reduction in development that would occur under this alternative would reduce these impacts in comparison to the proposed project. This is considered to be a better alternative.

7.3.2 ALTERNATIVE 2 - NO UPDATE/DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS ONLY

Characteristics

Alternative 2 is similar to Alternative 1 in that the proposed Colusa General Plan and its associated Land Use Policy Map would not be adopted. The adopted General Plan and its Land Use Map would guide future development within the City limits. However, under Alternative 2, the three specific projects (Colusa Riverbend, Colusa Crossings, Brookins Ranch) would be developed as described in Sections 3.0, 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3. The City would utilize its existing zoning and other regulations regarding development within the City limits and on the project sites, Infrastructure would be installed under existing plans, if applicable. However, infrastructure on the project sites would be installed as described in Sections 3.0, 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3 of the MEIR. Table 7.0-3 illustrates the land uses for Alternative 2.

Comparative Impacts

Land Use

Conflicts with Land Use Plans/Policies - Impact 4.1.2

Implementation of the proposed General Plan update could lead to inconsistency with other land use plans and ordinances, particularly the Comprehensive Land Use Plan for the Colusa
County Airport.
The Comprehensive Land Use Plan (CLUP) for the Colusa County Airport defines compatible land uses for parcels near the airport. The overflight zone covers an extensive portion of the southeastern area of the proposed Land Use Diagram. The CLUP states that single-family residential is a compatible land use only if the density is five acres or more per residence. Implementation of the General Plan Update would allow from four to eight units per acre, exceeding the density identified as compatible by the CLUP. No feasible mitigations were identified for this inconsistency, therefore this impact would be considered significant and
unavoidable.

Alternative 2 land use designations allow for Rural Residential as well as areas of Medium Density Residential development, all within the overflight zone. The Rural Residential land Use
designation allows up to 1.5 units per acre, while the Medium Density designation allows up to 10 units per acre. Neither of these designations fall within the density parameters of the CLUP overflight zone. The Colusa Riverbend project proposes residential development within the noise contours of the Colusa County Airport (see Section 5.1, Impact 5.1.9 for a complete discussion of

this impact). This is contradictory to the CLUP. The Colusa Crossings and Brookins Ranch projects
are not within the overflight zone

Development under Alternative 2 would result in less residential uses, mainly due to the unit potential differences between Rural Residential and Low Density Residential. However
Alternative 2 is still considered to be inconsistent with the CLUP and would result in the same
impact level as the proposed project.

Incompatibilities Between Land Uses - Impact 4.1.3

Implementation of the proposed General Plan could create conflicts between land uses within the proposed Planning Area and with land uses adjacent to the proposed Planning Area. Impacts after implementation of the General Plan policies and actions would be less than
significant.

Alternative 2 is a continuation of the adopted General Plan goals, policies, actions and land uses with the exception of the annexation of the three proposed development projects. In Colusa, there are some areas where land uses considered incompatible currently exist. In the unincorporated area along 14th Street, residences exist alongside industrial uses. These
residences were built before zoning was enacted prohibiting such land uses. However, current
zoning and development review procedures limit potential inconsistent land uses.
Development of those areas currently outside the City's jurisdiction (i.e. Colusa Crossings, portions of Colusa Riverbend, and Brookins Ranch) would be located adjacent to land within the County of Colusa's jurisdiction. These areas are currently agricultural uses. Annexation of the proposed development projects would not change land use designations of adjacent agricultural land nor would implementation of 2 it Alternative 2 as it does not include this area for future annexation. This may result in incompatibility between planned residential uses and agricultural uses. As such, Alternative 2 would have the same level of impact, though to a lesser degree because of the smaller land area, as the proposed project.

Loss of Agricultural Land - Impact 4.1.5 and Cumulative Loss of Agricultural Land - Impact 6.2

The proposed General Plan project would result in the conversion of agricultural land to urban uses. This conversion would result primarily due to the designation of agricultural uses to residential, industrial and commercial uses. Under Alternative 2, the re-designation of agricultural land to urban uses would not occur, except for the three project areas resulting in a loss of 910 acres, as those lands would remain as agricultural under Colusa County jurisdiction, thereby preserving these lands would avoid this significant impact.
Since Alternative 2 would allow the construction of the three development projects, approximately 910 acres of agricultural land would be converted to urban uses. However, Alternative 2 would still result in the conversion of less agricultural land than under the proposed
project, since an additional 1,121 acres designated for development under the proposed General Plan wouid remain in County jurisdiction and undeveloped in Alternative 2. These
would primarily be areas in the northwestern and far southern portions of the proposed Planning Area, which mostly are agricultural in use. Therefore, Alternative 2 would be considered the environmentally better scenario of the two.

Population and Housing
Population and Housing Growth - Impact 4.2.1 and Cumulative Population and Housing Growth
- Impact 6.3

Implementation of the proposed General Plan project would result in significant and unavoidable impacts to population and housing growth. As noted previously, Alternative 2 would result in a maximum of 8,219 housing units and 23,424 residents, less than the proposed project, which proposes a maximum of 9,089 housing units and 25,904 residents. Figures for both Alternative 2 and the proposed project are based on applicable land use designations at buildout.

The impacts on future population growth and housing development may vary, depending on factors such as the housing market, job availability, type of housing built and economic conditions. Under Alternative 2, fewer housing units would be built than under the proposed project. The population projections in this analysis assume a constant relationship between
population and housing stock, which likely will not occur. However, as discussed elsewhere in this section, the lower number of housing units under Alternative 2 would result in less significant impacts on the physical environment than the proposed project.

Transportation and Circulation

Local Roadway System - Impact 4.3.1, State Highways - Impact 4.3.2, Intersections - Impact 4.3.3, Cumulative Roadway Impacts Impact 6.4, and Roadway Safety Impact 4.3.4
The proposed General Plan project would incur impacts to the local roadway system including State Highways 20 and 45, resulting in significant and unavoidable impacts. Alternative 2 is expected to lead to fewer significant impacts on transportation than the proposed project. Since there would be less development, and consequently fewer residents, under Alternative 2, there would be fewer motorists and therefore less traffic. It is possible that the growth in population under this alternative could lead to LOS and safety issues at specific intersections and road segments within the City. It is expected that such impacts would be less extensive and
would require less mitigation than under the proposed project.

However, implementation of Alternative 2 may result in an increase in commuter traffic on roads,
as residents go to other communities for jobs. The more limited amount of land available for
commercial and industrial development under Alternative 2 could lead to lower job generation. Under Alternative 2, it is estimated that development of commercial, industrial and mixed use
areas could generate up to 3,408 employees. This would lead to a jobs-housing balance of 0.41, is which is less than the 0.96-1.24 range under the proposed project and below the desired ratio of 1.00. This could indicate that more people will have to find work outside the City, adding to traffic on roads to other employment centers.
However, this impact would be confined mainly to the State highways, which are the main roads going out of Colusa. The potential increase in commuter traffic on the State highways would be offset by the smaller increase in traffic volume under Alternative 2, aithough the extent of this offset cannot be determined. Local streets and roads are likely to experience less traffic
under Alternative 2, due to a projected population approximately 2,387 persons less than the proposed project. This would result in less significant impacts on the physical environment than the proposed project.

7.0 PROJECT ALTERNATIVES

Noise

Construction Noise - Impact 4.4.3

The proposed project would result in construction noise impacts, which would be reduced to a less than significant level with the incorporation of proposed mitigation measures.
As with the proposed project, Alternative 2 would result in construction activities, although not at
the same intensity because of a smaller amount of developable land. Alternative 2 would have short-term construction noise which could be mitigated to a less than significant impact as with the proposed project, resulting in the same level of environmental impact.

Airport Noise - Impact 4.4.4

The General Plan Land Use Diagram indicates that some residential areas may be placed near
the Colusa County Airport. As indicated in Figure 4.4-1, areas near the airport may be exposed
to noise levels of at least 55 dB CNEL. While mitigation measures may reduce noise levels, it is not
anticipated that aircraft noise levels would be mitigated to a less than significant level through
implementation of mitigation measures through the Design Review process for all development that may be accommodated under the proposed General Plan. As a result, this impact is significant and unavoidable.
As with the proposed project, while mitigation measures may reduce noise levels, it is not anticipated that aircraft noise levels would be mitigated to a less than significant level. The impacts to sensitive receptors for airport related noise may not be fully mitigated, however
Alternative 2 would result in less development in the airport noise contours as land uses around
the airport have not been changed and remain as rural residential in this scenario. Therefore, Alternative 2 is considered to have an environmentally better outcome than the proposed project.

Cumulative Traffic Noise - Impact 6.5

The proposed project would result in cumulative traffic noise impacts, which would result in a cumulatively considerable and significant and unavoidable impact.
The future population of the City under Alternative 2 and its resulting traffic would be less than the proposed project. As described in the Transportation and Circulation section above, Alternative 2 is expected to generate less traffic than the proposed project, thereby decreasing the potential amount of noise generated by traffic. While there may be some noise impacts in
localized areas under Alternative 2, the total amount of noise generated by traffic would
decrease and therefore, this alternative is considered to an environmentally better alternative
when compared to the proposed project.
Air Quality

Construction-Related Emissions - Impact 4.5.1

The proposed General Pian project would result in construction-related air quality impacts. Emissions from individual development construction sites would be short term and temporary, but would occur through buildout of the General Plan. At any given times, several construction projects may be under way, which may result in substantial construction-related emissions. Intensification of individual development projects would account for most development, and

Colusa General Plan City of Colusa

7.0-18

7.0 PROJECT ALTERNATIVES

consequently most construction-related emissions. However, with incorporation of proposed mitigation measures and General Plan policies and implementing actions, this impact was
considered less than significant.

Alternative 2 would also allow the new development which would result in construction-related air quality impacts. Construction-related air quality impacts could be reduced to a less than significant level with proper mitigation, as with the proposed project. However, because the difference in the potential developable area between Alternative 2 and the proposed project, from 2,684 acres to 3,805 acres, construction air emissions would be substantially less, Alternative
2 would have less overall construction air emissions than the proposed project. This would result in an environmentally better outcome.

Operations-Related Emissions - Impact 4.5.2

Table 4.5-3 identifies the daily operational emissions for the proposed project as: 1,085.1 Ibs/day for ROG, 316.3 Ibs/day for NOx and 1,326.1 lbs/day for PM1o. Impact 4.5.2 concludes that even
with General Plan policies and implementing actions and the proposed mitigation measures listed under this impact, the proposed project would have a significant and unavoidable impact
in this area.

Alternative 2 would have less operation-related emissions because of the reduced development potential as a result of a smaller area. Alternative 2 land area is approximately 2/3 the size of the proposed project (2,684 acres compared to 3,805 acres) and it can be assumed that this
alternative would produce approximately 1/3 less air emissions. However, the differences in land use designations between Alternative 2 and the proposed project would affect this assumption as Alternative 2 is proposing a substantial amount of residential development (1,373 acres). Residential uses usually result in the highest proportion of air quality impacts, so Alternative 2 may result in similar air emissions to the proposed project. Alternative 2 would most likely result in
significant and unavoidable impacts to air quality as a result of operational emissions because of the substantial growth Alternative 2 represents (approximately 23,424 persons). In any case, any reduction in air emissions, as with the Alternative 2 when compared to the proposed project, even knowing the alternative may result in significant and unavoidable impacts, would be considered an environmentally better solution.

Carbon Monoxide Emissions from Traffic - Impact 4.5.4

Development accommodated under the proposed General Plan Update would increase traffic volumes on streets throughout the proposed Planning Area, and therefore would increase local
carbon monoxide concentrations. Concentrations of this pollutant are related to the levels of
traffic and congestion along streets and at intersections. Due to the lack of feasible mitigation, the proposed General Plan project resulted in a significant and unavoidable impact.
While Alternative 2 would have less traffic than the proposed General Plan project, Alternative 2 would increase the population of the City by 17,651 persons over the estimated 2007 population of 5,7732. This increase would substantially intensify traffic in the City. The proposed project is projected to have multiple intersections where the LOS is E or F (See Section 4.5) and result in a significant and unavoidable carbon monoxide emission impact because of the inability to improve the level of service to City intersections. The difference between the proposed project
and Alternative 2 buildout population is 2,480 persons. While, this slightly smaller buildout

7.0 PROJECT ALTERNATIVES

population for Alternative 2 would decrease the potential for traffic impacts, the ability to incorporate improvements to the City's roadways system to improve the LOS to D or better is unknown at this time. Therefore, Alternative 2 carbon monoxide emission impacts would be similar to that of the proposed project.

Cumulative Regional Air Basin Impacts - Impact 6.6
Implementation of the proposed General Plan project would result in an increased population and substantial new development, which would adversely affect regional air quality. The growth in population, vehicle usage and business activity within the NSVAB, when considered with growth proposed under the General Plan, would contribute to cumulative regional air quality impacts. It also could potentially delay attainment of standards for which counties in the NSVAB currently are in nonattainment status, mainly ozone and PMio. This would result in a cumulatively considerable and significant and unavoidable impact.
Alternative 2 would have fewer air quality impacts than the proposed project. Since traffic is a major source of pollutant emissions, and since traffic would be reduced under Alternative 2, fewer emissions from traffic would occur. Also, with less industrial development occurring under this alternative, pollutants from industrial sources would be less. However, these reductions in
emissions may be offset to an extent by emissions from increased commuter traffic on roads leading out of the City due to less employment generating development allowed under Alternative 2. As with the discussion expressed under Operations-Related Emissions Impact 4.5.2 above, any substantial reduction in air emissions would be considered an environmentally better solution. However, the potential decrease in employment opportunities in the City resulting in higher commuter traffic may offset any potential reduction in local air emissions. As a result, Alternative 2 is considered to have a similar impact on the regional air basin as the proposed project.

Geology, Soils and Hazardous Materials

Hazardous Material Sites • Impact 4.6.5

Implementation of the proposed General Plan project may lead to development on or
adjacent to hazardous material contamination sites. Located in the City are identified areas of potential hazardous material contamination sites. Implementation of the mitigation measures identified under this impact would reduce to a less than significant level.
Alternative 2 would not change the existence of hazardous material contamination sites nor the potential for health and safety hazards occurring. The contamination sites identified in Section 4.6 are all located within Alternative 2's planning area and therefore this impact would not be reduced by a smaller planning area than that of the proposed project. Alternative 2 does not include the development of mitigation measures to reduce potential hazardous materials sites impacts but is rather a continuation of the adopted General Plan, which does not have policies
or actions regarding the potential health and safety hazards of hazardous materials contamination sites. As such, protection of persons from potential health and safety hazards as result of the existence of hazardous materials contamination sites in the City is not guaranteed through policies, actions or mitigations in Alternative 2. As a result, Alternative 2 would be
considered to have a worse impact.

Contamination on Agricultural Lands - Impact 4.6.7

Implementation of the proposed General Plan would encourage development on lands currently or previously used for agriculture, which may contain hazardous material
contamination from substances used in past operations. Implementation of mitigation measure identified under Impact 4.6.7 would reduce or eliminate potential health hazards associated with development of former agricultural lands to a less than significant level.
As with Impact 4.6.5 Hazardous Materials Sites, Alternative 2 does not include the development of mitigation measures to reduce potential agricultural-related hazardous materials but is rather
a continuation of the adopted General Plan, which does not have policies or actions regarding the potential health and safety hazards of these materials. As such, protection of persons from potential health and safety hazards as a result of the existence of these agricultural-related hazardous materials in the City is not guaranteed through policies, actions or mitigations in Alternative 2. As a result, Alternative 2 would be considered to have a worse impact.

Hydrology and Water Quality
Groundwater Supply - Impact 4.7.5
Implementation of the proposed General Plan would increase demand for water, requiring increased groundwater production. Future development allowed by the proposed General Plan would place an increasing demand on the City's existing water supplies. An increased demand would at the least require additional pumping from existing wells, and possibly require more wells to be drilled. This would increase the amount of groundwater withdrawn from the
local aquifer. Implementation of the proposed mitigation measures listed under Impact 4.7.5, along with the General Plan policies and implementing actions, would reduce the impacts to groundwater supply to a less than significant level.
Section 4.7 of this MEIR discusses water usage for the general City of Colusa area. According to Tully and Young, hydrological consultants for the MEIR, agricultural uses tend to use more water that urban uses. According to Table 4.7-2, which provides an estimate of the water demand for
the City and surrounding area, under current conditions areas currently within the City Sphere of
Influence would actually have a higher water demand than the proposed project through year
2027, mainly due to existing agricultural uses. Alternative 2 would continue the adopted General Plan land uses and would also convert 910 acres of agricultural uses to urban uses. Expansion of this area (the Colusa Crossings, Colusa Riverbend and Brookins Ranch project sites) may reduce water usage. However, Alternative 2 would not convert agricultural uses to urban uses to the
extent of the proposed project, as the proposed General Plan project is approximately 1,100 acres larger in size, of which is mostly agricultural land.
The City currently provides its municipal water via wells. An increased demand would at the least require additional pumping from these wells, and possibly require more wells to be drilled. This would increase the amount of groundwater withdrawn from the local aquifer. Because Alternative 2 is estimated to have a higher water demand than the proposed General Plan project, Alternative 2 would have a worse impact on groundwater supply than the proposed project.

Biological Resources

Cumulative Biological Resource Impacts - Impact 6.9
Implementation of the General Plan Update with it resulting development would result in direct and indirect impacts to listed and non-listed special-status species as well as impacts to
jurisdictional waters of the U.S., non-special status species, trees, habitat and movement corridors. This results in a cumulatively considerable and significant and unavoidable impact.
Alternative 2 would have similar cumulative impacts on special-status species and their habitat
as would the proposed project. In particular, development of the Colusa Riverbend project would have impacts on existing elderberry bushes, the habitat of the listed valley elderberry longhorn beetle. The project also would have impacts on the pond and connecting water channels, which are potential jurisdictional waters of the United States and potential habitat for
special-status species. The Brookins Ranch project site also contains potential jurisdictional waters and habitat for special-status species, which may be affected under Alternative 2. Potential foraging and/or nesting habitat for special-status bird species at all three development project sites would be affected. However, since less agricultural land would be developed, the impacts on these habitats would not be as extensive under Alternative 2 as under the proposed
project.

Historic and Cultural Resources

Disturbance of Cultural and Paleontological Resources - Impact 4.92

Future development associated with implementation of the proposed General Plan project may encounter currently unknown cultural resources and paleontological resources, thereby disturbing their sites. Implementation of the mitigation measure, along with the proposed General Plan policy, would avoid or minimize adverse physical impacts on undiscovered cultural resources, and ensure their proper disposition with minimal loss of resource value. Impacts after mitigation would be less than significant.

Under Alternative 2, impacts on cultural resources would be similar to those under the proposed project. Alternative 2 would continue the existing land use designations for the area currently within the city boundaries. Most of the known cultural resources are located within the City limits. However, Alternative 2 would allow for the development of large areas adjacent to the city for which there may be unknown cultural and paleontological resources. Development of these lands into urban Uses may impact these resources. However, since less land area would be developed under Altemnative 2, there would be a lower probability of encountering currently unknown cultural resources in undeveloped areas.

Visual Resources

Scenic Vistas • Impact 4.10.3

Implementation of the proposed General Plan Update may result in the obstruction of scenic vistas at the existing edges of urban development. Policies and implementing actions would protect scenic vistas to the extent feasible. However, the only way to avoid or reduce this impact to a less than significant impact would be to prohibit development that would affect views of scenic resources. This would be inconsistent with the objectives of the proposed General Plan Update and the proposed land use map. No feasible mitigation measures can be applied and results in a significant and unavoidable impact.

7.0 PROJECT ALTERNATIVES

Alternative 2 would result in less urban development than under the proposed project. Therefore, this alternative would result in less potential obstruction of scenic views. Therefore, this
alternative would result in less potential obstruction of scenic views and would be considered a better alternative for the protection of scenic vistas.

Public Services and Utilities

Extension of energy and communication infrastructure - Impact 4.12.5.2

Implementation of the General Plan Update would require the extension of energy and communication infrastructure. This would potentially impact the environment by increase air pollutants during construction, create impacts to biological resources, create noise and vibration during construction, create visual impacts, etc. Mitigation measures provided in the MEIR reduce this impact to a less than significant level.
Alternative 2 may also require the extension of energy and communication infrastructure. However, this would occur a at a much smaller scale due to the smaller land area of Alternative 2
than the proposed project. This is considered to be a better alternative.

Climate Change

Cumulative increase in global greenhouse gas emissions and cumulative effects of global climate change (Impacts 6.14 and 6.15)
Implementation of the General Plan Update would result in an increase in greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to cumulative climate change impacts, including rising temperatures. The effects of climate change may expose the City to increased flooding, uncertain water supply, health effects and other impacts under cumulative conditions as described under
Impact 6.15.

Alternative 2 would also result in increased development and both contribute to cumulative climate change impacts and expose the City to the effects of climate change. However, the reduction in development that would occur under this alternative would reduce these impacts in comparison to the proposed project. This is considered to be a better alternative.

7.3.3 ALTERNATIVE 3 - INCREASED DENSITY OF DEVELOPMENT

Characteristics

Alternative 3 would have a similar buildout scenario to that under the proposed General Plan, in terms of population and number of dwelling units. However, this alternative would designate more acreage for medium-density and high-density residential development. The result would accommodate the same anticipated population at buildout of the proposed General Plan, but on less land. One example of how Alternative 3 could be implemented is presented in Table 7.0-5 below. Figures are based on the methodology used to estimate the number of housing units and population at buildout of the proposed General Plan. In this scenario, more intensive residential development would occur at the three development project sites (Colusa Riverbend,
Colusa Crossings, Brookins Ranch).

With the increased residential development density, the anticipated population in the proposed General Plan could be accommodated on approximately 1,851 acres, a decrease of approximately 446 acres from the proposed General Plan. Some land designated as Urban Reserve under the proposed General Plan that is currently designated by Colusa County as Agriculture-General (AG) and Agriculture-Transitional (AT) would not need to be developed. All other land within the Planning Area would retain the same designations and uses as under the proposed General Plan. There would be the same acreage designated for commercial, industrial and public uses 3 under Alternative 3 as under the proposed project.
Policies and implementing actions in the proposed General Plan would apply under Alternative
3. Proposed infrastructure would be the same as that under the proposed General Plan, except that lands in the Urban Reserve removed from development would be left undeveloped.
Comparative Impacts

Land Use

Conflicts with Land Use Plans/Policies - Impact 4.1.2

Implementation of the proposed General Plan update could lead to inconsistency with other land use plans and ordinances, particularly the Comprehensive Land Use Plan for the Colusa
County Airport.

The Comprehensive Land Use Plan (CLUP) for the Colusa County Airport defines compatible land uses for parcels near the airport. The overflight zone covers an extensive portion of the southeastern area of the proposed Land Use Diagram. The CLUP states that single-family residential is a compatible land use only if the density is five acres or more per residence.

Colusa General Plan City of Colusa
Draft Master Environmental Impact Report July 2007
7.0-24

7.0 PROJECT ALTERNATIVES

Implementation of the General Plan Update would allow from four to eight units per acre, exceeding the density identified as compatible by the CLUP. No feasible mitigations were
identified for this inconsistency, therefore this impact would be considered significant and
unavoidable.

Alternative 3 land Use designations may increase the amount of Medium Density Residential
development within the overflight zone. This designation does not fall within the density parameters of the CLUP overflight zone. This is contradictory to the CI.UP.

Development under Alternative 3 may result in more persons within the overflight zone. Because
Alternative 3 may allow uses within the overflight zone at a denser development range than the proposed General Plan Update, Alternative 3 would result in the worse impact level than the proposed project.

Incompatibilities Between Land Uses - Impact 4.1.3

Implementation of the proposed General Plan could create conflicts between land uses within the proposed Planning Area and with land uses adjacent to the proposed Planning Area.
Impacts after implementation of the General Plan policies and actions would be less than
significant.

3 Alternative 3 would continue to allow for the development of those areas currently outside the
City's jurisdiction (i.e. Colusa Crossings, portions of Colusa Riverbend, and Brookins Ranch), however these areas would be developed at a much higher density. Because new
development may be located adjacent to land within the County of Colusa's jurisdiction which is currently used for agricultural production purposes, the potential for incompatibilities does exist. Implementation of Alternative 3 would result in the same number of persons as the proposed project in a smaller area. This would result in less incompatibility between planned residential uses and agricultural uses than the proposed project due to less developed areas located adjacent to existing agricultural uses. As such, Alternative 3 would have a better level of impact, because of the smaller land area, than the proposed project.
Loss of Agricultural Land - Impact 4.1.5 and Cumulative Loss of Agricultural Land - Impact 6.2

The proposed General Plan project would result in the conversion of agricultural land to urban uses. This conversion would result primarily due to the designation of agricultural uses to residential, industrial and commercial uses. Under Alternative 2, the re-designation of
agricultural land to urban uses would not occur, except for the three project areas resuiting in a loss of 910 acres, as those lands would remain as agricultural under Colusa County jurisdiction, thereby preserving these lands would avoid this significant impact.

As illustrated by Table 7.0-5, Alternative 3 would result in less land being developed than under the proposed project. With more intensive residential development, potentially 446 acres of land currently designated for agriculture may be retained for such use. Therefore, Alternative 3 would result in the conversion of less agricultural land overall. The loss of agricultural land would
still occur at the development project sites, but the cumulative impact of this loss would be less
than under the proposed project.

7.0 PROJECT ALTERNATIVES

Population and Housing

Population and Housing Growth - Impact 4.2.1 and Cumulative Population and Housing Growth
- Impact 6.3

Implementation of the proposed General Plan project would resuit in significant and unavoidable impacts to population and housing growth.

The number of housing units and residents would remain the same under Alternative 3 as under the proposed project. Therefore, population and housing impacts would be similar. However, the greater availability of medium-density and high-density housing units could lead to more affordable housing overall, particularly for lower-income households. This may lead to less overcrowding of housing units, thereby reducing deterioration of these units and improving the physical appearance and soundness of the housing stock.

Transportation and Circulation

Local Roadway System - Impact 4.3.1, State Highways Impact 4.3.2, Intersections - Impact 4.3.3, Cumulative Roadway Impacts Impact 6.4, and Roadway Safety - Impact 4.3.4
The proposed General Plan project would incur impacts to the local roadway system including State Highways 20 and 45, resulting in significant and unavoidable impacts.

Overall traffic volumes would remain the same under Alternative 3, as there would be no change in the number of residents, and therefore no change in the anticipated number of vehicles. However, more intensive residential development at the development project sites could lead to greater impacts on LOS at intersections and streets near these areas. This may require more modifications to these intersections and streets than would have occurred under
the proposed project. On the other hand, because of the more compact development, the use of alternative transportation may increase which in turn may improve the LOS of impacted streets. Public transit stops may become more economically feasible at the more intensively developed residential areas.

Noise

Construction Noise - Impact 4.4.3

The proposed project would result in construction noise impacts, which would be reduced to a less than significant level with the incorporation of proposed mitigation measures.
Alternative 3 would result in construction activities similar to the proposed project. While these activities may affect a smaller land area, the increase in the use of higher density units will require larger and potentially taller buildings. This would result in the use of larger construction equipment needed to build a multi-story building. However as with the proposed project, Alternative 3 would have short-term construction noise that could be mitigated to a less than significant impact, resulting in the same level of environmental impact as the proposed project.

Airport Noise - Impact 4.4.4

The General Plan Land Use Diagram indicates that some residential areas may be placed near the Colusa County Airport. As indicated in Figure 4.4-1, areas near the airport may be exposed to noise levels of at least 55 dB CNEL. While mitigation measures may reduce noise levels, it is not
Colusa General Plan City of Colusa
Draft Master Environmental Impact Report July 2007
7.0-26

7.0 PROJECT ALTERNATIVES

anticipated that aircraft noise levels would be mitigated to a less than significant level through
implementation of mitigation measures through the Design Review process for all development that may be accommodated under the proposed General Plan. As a result, this impact is significant and unavoidable.
Alternative 3 may result 3 in locating more persons in the airport noise contours as a result of denser development standards. Therefore, Alternative 3 is considered to have an environmentally worse outcome than the proposed project. As with the proposed project, while mitigation measures imposed under Alternative 3 may reduce noise levels, it is not anticipated that aircraft noise levels would be mitigated to a less than significant level. The impacts to sensitive receptors for airport related noise may not be fully mitigated under Alternative 3.

Cumulative Traffic Noise - Impact 6.5

The proposed project would result in cumulative traffic noise impacts, which would result in a cumulatively considerable and significant and unavoidable impact.
Overall, traffic noise impacts under Alternative 3 would be similar to those under the proposed project, as the amount of vehicle traffic would remain the same. It is possible that more developed residential areas could be placed near noise sources such as arterial and collector streets, thereby increasing the number of residents exposed to noise. Also, some streets near the more intensively developed residential areas may experience increases in traffic volumes, thereby increasing the noise levels along these streets.

Air Quality

Construction-Related Emissions - Impact 4.5.1

The proposed General Plan project would result in construction-related air quality impacts. Emissions from individual development construction sites would be short term and temporary,
but would occur through buildout of the General Plan. At any given times, several construction projects may be under way, which may result in substantial construction-related emissions. Intensification of individual development projects would account for most development, and
consequently most construction-related emissions. However, with incorporation of proposed mitigation measures and General Plan policies and implementing actions, this impact was considered less than significant.

Alternative 3 would also allow the new development which would result in construction-related
air quality impacts. Construction-related air quality impacts could be reduced to a less than significant level with proper mitigation, as with the proposed project. However, because Alternative 3 would have less potential developable area than the proposed project resulting in less grading and construction of infrastructure and streets, construction air emissions would be substantiaily less, Alternative 3 would have less overall construction air emissions than the proposed project. This would result in an environmentally better outcome.
Operations-Related Emissions - Impact 4.5.2

Table 4.5-3 identifies the daily operational emissions for the proposed project as: 1,085.1 Ibs/day for ROG, 316.3 lbs/day for NOx and 1,326.1 lbs/day for PM1o. Impact 4.5.2 concludes that even with General Plan policies and implementing actions and the proposed mitigation measures listed under this impact, the proposed project would have a significant and unavoidable impact
in this area.

City of Colusa Colusa General Plan
July 2007 Draft Master Environmental Impact Report
7.0-27

7.0 PROJECT ALTERNATIVES

Alternative 3 would have less operation-related emissions because of the reduced development potential as a result of a smaller area and denser development. Additionally, a more compact development scenario may lead to a higher use in alterative transportation which will reduce operational-related emissions. Alternative 3 would most likely result in significant and unavoidable impacts to air quality as a result of operational emissions because of the substantial growth Alternative 3 represents (approximately 25,904 persons). In any case, any reduction in air emissions, as with the Alternative 3 when compared to the proposed project, even knowing the alternative may result in significant and unavoidable impacts, would be considered an environmentally better solution.

Carbon Monoxide Emissions from Traffic - Impact 4.5.4

Development accommodated under the proposed General Plan Update would increase traffic volumes on streets throughout the proposed Planning Area, and therefore would increase local carbon monoxide concentrations. Concentrations of this pollutant are related to the levels of
traffic and congestion along streets and at intersections. Due to the lack of feasible mitigation, the proposed General Plan project resulted in a significant and unavoidable impact.
Alternative 3 would have the same population as the proposed General Plan Update. However, because Alternative 3 is a more compact development scenario, the likelihood of an increase in the use of alternative transportation and a more viable public transit system would occur, thereby reducing carbon monoxide emissions in the City.

Cumulative Regional Air Basin Impacts - Impact 6.6

Implementation of the proposed General Plan project would result in an increased population and substantial new development, which would adversely affect regional air quality. The growth in population, vehicle usage and business activity within the NSVAB, when considered with growth proposed under the General Plan, would contribute to cumulative regional air quality impacts. It also could potentially delay attainment of standards for which counties in the NSVAB currently are in nonattainment status, mainly ozone and PMi0. This would result in a cumulatively considerable and significant and unavoidable impact.
While Alternative 3 would have the same number of housing units and population as the proposed General plan Update, Alternative 3 would potentially have fewer air quality impacts as a result of a more compact design. Since traffic is a major source of pollutant emissions, and since traffic would be potentially reduced under Alternative 3, fewer emissions from traffic would occur. As a result, Alternative 3 is considered to have a better impact on the regional air basin than the proposed project.
Geology, Soils and Hazardous Materials
Hazardous Material Sites Impact 4.6.5
Implementation of the proposed General Plan project may lead to development on or adjacent to hazardous material contamination sites. Located in the City are identified areas of
potential hazardous material contamination sites. Implementation of the mitigation measures identified under this impact would reduce to a less than signiticant level.
Alternative 3 would not change the existence of hazardous material contamination sites nor the potential for health and safety hazards occurring. The contamination sites identified in Section 4.6 are all located within Alternative 3's planning area and therefore this impact would not be

7.0 PROJECT ALTERNATIVES

reduced by a smaller planning area than that of the proposed project. As a result, Alternative 3 considered to have the same impact for the exposure to hazardous materials as the proposed project.

Contamination on Agricultural Lands - Impact 4.6.7
Implementation of the proposed General Plan would encourage development on lands currently or previously used for agriculture, which may contain hazardous material
contamination from substances used in past operations. Implementation of mitigation measure identified under Impact 4.6.7 would reduce or eliminate potential health hazards associated with development of former agricultural lands to a less than significant level. a
The development of urban uses on lands that have been used for agricultural activities have similar impacts with regard to hazardous materials as the proposed project. Agricultural activities may have involved the use of chemicals such as pesticides, fertilizers and herbicides. Residues of these chemicals may be in the soils of these project sites. Potential impacts of these residues on development under Alternative 3 would be similar to those identified with the proposed project, albeit to a lesser degree since less land would be developed.
Hydrology and Water Quality

Groundwater Supply - Impact 4.7.5

Implementation of the proposed General Plan would increase demand for water, requiring increased groundwater production. Future development allowed by the proposed General Plan would place an increasing demand on the City's existing water supplies. An increased demand would at the least require additional pumping from existing wells, and possibly require more wells to be drilled. This would increase the amount of groundwater withdrawn from the local aquifer. Implementation of the proposed mitigation measures listed under Impact 4.7.5, along with the General Plan policies and implementing actions, would reduce the impacts to groundwater supply to a less than significant level.
Section 4.7 of this MEIR discusses water usage for the general City of Colusa area. According to Tully and Young, hydrological consultants for the MEIR, agricultural uses tend to use more water that urban uses. According to Table 4.7-2, which provides an estimate of the water demand for the City and surrounding area, under current conditions areas currently within the City Sphere of Influence would actually have a higher water demand than the proposed project through year 2027, mainly due to existing agricultural uses.
Alternative 3 would not convert agricultural uses to urban uses to the extent of the proposed project, as the proposed General Plan project is approximately 466 acres larger in size, of which is mostly agricultural land.

The City currently provides its municipal water via wells. An increased demand would at the least require additional pumping from these wells, and possibly require more wells to be drilled. This would increase the amount of groundwater withdrawn from the local aquifer. Alternative 3 is estimated to have the same water demand as the proposed General Plan Update. However, because Alternative 3 converts less agricultural land to urban uses than the proposed project, Alternative 3 would have a worse impact on groundwater supply than the proposed project due the higher use of water for agricultural uses than for urban uses.

Biological Resources

Cumulative Biological Resource Impacts - Impact 6.9
Implementation of the General Plan Update with it resulting development would result in direct and indirect impacts to listed and non-listed special-status species as well as impacts to jurisdictional waters of the U.S., non-special status species, trees, habitat and movement corridors. This results in a cumulatively considerable and significant and unavoidable impact.
Alternative 3 would have similar cumulative impacts on special-status species and their habitat as would the proposed project. in particular, development of the Colusa Riverbend project would have impacts on existing elderberry bushes, the habitat of the listed valley elderberry longhorn beetle. The project also would have impacts on the pond and connecting water channels, which are potential jurisdictional waters of the United States and potential habitat for special-status species. The Brookins Ranch project site also contains potential jurisdictional waters and habitat for special-status species, which may be affected under Alternative 3. Potential foraging and/or nesting habitat for special-status bird species at all three development project sites would be affected. However, since less agricultural land would be developed, the
impacts on these habitats would not be as extensive under Alternative 3 as under the proposed project.

Historic and Cultural Resources

Disturbance of Cultural and Paleontological Resources - Impact 4.9:
Future development associated with implementation of the proposed General Plan project may encounter currently unknown cultural resources and paleontological resources, thereby disturbing their sites. Implementation of the mitigation measure, along with the proposed General Plan policy, would avoid or minimize adverse physical impacts on undiscovered cultural resources, and ensure their proper disposition with minimal loss of resource value. Impacts after mitigation would be less than significant.

Under Alternative 3, impacts on cultural resources would be similar to those under the proposed project. Alternative 3 would continue the existing land use designations for the area currently within the city boundaries. Most of the known cultural resources are located within the City limits. However, Alternative 3 would allow for the development of large areas adjacent to the city for which there may be unknown cultural and paleontological resources. Development of these lands into urban uses may impact these resources. However, since less land area would be developed under Alternative 3, there would be a lower probability of encountering currently unknown cultural resources in undeveloped areas. Therefore, Alternative is considered to be
the better alternative regarding cultural and paleontological resources.

Visual Resources

Scenic Vistas - Impact 4.10.3

Implementation of the proposed General Plan Update may result in the obstruction of scenic vistas at the existing edges of urban development. Policies and implementing actions would protect scenic vistas to the extent feasible. However, the only way to avoid or reduce this impact to a less than significant impact would be to prohibit development that would affect views of scenic resources. This would be inconsistent with the objectives of the proposed

General Plan Update and the proposed land use map. No feasible mitigation measures can be applied and results in a significant and unavoidable impact.
Alternative 3 would result in a similar number of housing units than under the proposed project. However, these units would require less acreage to construct, since there would be more
medium-density and high-density units. More high-density residential buildings could lead to partial obstruction of scenic vistas from certain parts of the City, especially if such buildings are more than one story in height. However, existing height limitations in the City's Zoning Ordinance would reduce potential impacts. Also, since the higher-density buildings would be
concentrated on the development project sites, other parts of the Planning Area would not experience any potential obstruction of scenic views. Therefore, this alternative would result in
less potential obstruction of scenic views and would be considered a better alternative for the
protection of scenic vistas.

Public Services and Utilities

Extension of energy and communication infrastructure - Impact 4.12.5.2

Implementation of the General Plan Update would require the extension of energy and communication infrastructure. This would potentially impact the environment by increase air pollutants during construction, create impacts to biological resources, create noise and vibration during construction, create visual impacts, etc. Mitigation measures provided in the MEIR reduce this impact to a less than significant level.

Alternative 3 may also require the extension of energy and communication infrastructure. However, this would occur at a much smaller scale due to the smaller land area of Alternative 3 than the proposed project. This is considered to be a better alternative.

Climate Change

Cumulative increase in global greenhouse gas emissions and cumulative effects of global climate
change (Impacts 6.14 and 6.15)

Implementation of the General Plan Update would result in an increase in greenhouse gas
emissions and contribute to cumulative climate change impacts, including rising temperatures.
The effects of climate change may expose the City to increased flooding, uncertain water
supply, health effects and other impacts under cumulative conditions as described under
Impact 6.15.

Alternative 3 would also result in increased development and both contribute to cumulative climate change impacts and expose the City to the effects of climate change. Total levels of development would be the same as the proposed project, resulting in comparable emissions
associated with residential and non-residential buildings. Similarly, the number of persons exposed to the effects of climate change would be comparable. However, as development would be more compact, it is anticipated that there would be a reduction in trip length that would result in reduced vehicle miles traveled and associated greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, this is considered to be a better alternative.

7.3.4 ALTERNATIVE 4 - REVISED CIRCULATION ALTERNATIVE

Characteristics

Alternative 4 would: 1) revise implementing Action CIR-1.1.a to establish LOS D as the minimum acceptable LOS for City streets and intersections and 2) provide for an alternative circulation pattern that would include two features. The alternative includes the development of a four- lane arterial street within the existing boundaries of the old railroad right-of-way localed along the southern boundary of the City. This new roadway would connect to Highway 20 and run south to Wescott Road. The new roadway will then turn east and eventually connect to with Farinon Road, which would be constructed to four lanes, and would terminate at the Farinon Road/Highway 20-45 intersection (Figure 7.0-1). This roadway would be developed similarly under the General Plan Update. However, the roadway would provide a more direct route to Highway 20/45 as it would not include the southern portion of Wescott Road. Development of this roadway will provide an alternative route for travelers connecting Highway 20 to Highway 20/45 and negating the current need to pass through the City. The second feature would be the development of Sioc Street and Fremont Street as a two lane one-way street couplet. Sioc Street would be a two lane eastbound street and Fremont would be two lanes westbound.
All other aspects of Alternative 4, including other elements of the proposed General Plan
circulation plan, would be the same as the proposed project. Alternative 4 would have the same land use designations, buildout population and housing units as the proposed General Plan Update. Certain assumptions were made the traffic analysis completed for Alternative 4. These include:

Various routes are used by through traffic today, and these routes will be supplemented by the new Railroad Collector-Farinon Road Collector. The General Plan Update analysis assumed that ¼ of the traffic increase will use each of Market Street, Fremont Street, Sioc Street and the new collector, or approximately 700 ADT on each route. If the Farinon Road connection is a direct link to the Railroad corridor, it was assumed that Market Street, Fremont Street and Sioc Street would each carry 1/8 of the increase, or 350 ADT on each
route

• The General Plan Update analysis assumed use of various roads by future traffic attracted by the expansion of the Colusa Casino. The original distribution pattern was based on the trip assignment presented in the Expansion's traffic study. This alternative analysis assumes no change to the pattern presented in that traffic study based on the assumption that the Farinon-Railroad corridor route will not be signed as the casino access route.
While this new roadway will not reduce local traffic within the City, it will provide for an alterative route for those passing through the City and thereby reducing traffic on certain streets. Table 7.0-6 identifies year 2030 daily traffic volumes on Colusa streets and presents resulting Levels of Service assuming implementation of the GP Circulation diagram but no improvements to existing streets.

Comparative Impacts

Land Use

Conflicts with Land Use Plans/Policies - Impact 4.1.2

Implementation of the proposed General Plan update could lead to inconsistency with other land use plans and ordinances, particularly the Comprehensive Land Use Plan for the Colusa County Airport.

The Comprehensive Land Use Plan (CLUP) for the Colusa County Airport defines compatible land uses for parcels near the airport. The overflight zone covers an extensive portion of the southeastern area of the proposed Land Use Diagram. The CLUP states that single-family residential is a compatible land use only if the density is five acres or more per residence. Implementation of the General Plan Update would allow from four to eight units per acre, exceeding the density identified as compatible by the CLUP. No feasible mitigations were identified for this inconsistency, therefore this impact would be considered significant and unavoidable.

Alternative 4 land use designations will be the same as the proposed project and therefore will have the same potential conflicts with the CLUP. Alternative 4 would result in the same impact level as the proposed project.

Incompatibilities Between Land Uses - Impact 4.1.3

Implementation of the proposed General Plan could create conflicts between land uses within the proposed Planning Area and with land uses adjacent to the proposed Planning Area. Impacts after implementation of the General Plan policies and actions would be less than
significant.

4 Alternative 4 land use designations will be the same as the proposed project and therefore will have the same potential conflicts with the CLUP. Alternative 4 would result in the same impact level as the proposed project.
Loss of Agricultural Land - Impact 4.1.5 and Cumulative Loss of Agricultural Land - Impact 6.2
The proposed General Plan project would result in the conversion of agricultural land To urban uses. This conversion would result primarily due to the designation of agricultural uses to residential, industrial and commercial uses. Under Alternative 2, the re-designation of agricultural land to urban uses would not occur, except for the three project areas resulting in a loss of 910 acres, as those lands would remain as agricultural under Colusa County jurisdiction, thereby preserving these lands would avoid this significant impact.
Alternative 4 land 4 use designations will be the same as the proposed project and therefore will have the same potential conflicts with the CLUP. Alternative 4 would result in the same impact level as the proposed project.

Population and Housing

Population and Housing Growth - Impact 4.2.1 and Cumulative Population and Housing Growth
- Impact 6.3

Implementation of the proposed General Plan project would result in significant and unavoidable impacts to population and housing growth.

The number of housing units and residents would remain the same under Alternative 4 as under
the proposed project and therefore would have the same potential to cause impacts as a result of population and housing growth.
Transportation and Circulation

Local Roadway System Impact 4.3.1, State Highways Impact 4.3.2, Intersections - Impact 4.3.3, Cumulative Roadway Impacts Impact 6.4, and Roadway Safety - Impact 4.3.4
The proposed General Plan project would incur impacts to the local roadway system including State Highways 20 and 49, resulting in significant and unavoidable impacts.
A traffic analysis was competed for Alternative 4 by kdAnderson. See Appendix F for this analysis. Table 7.0-7 presents a synopsis of the impacted roadways for Alternative 4 and compares this alternative's roadway LOS levels with that of the proposed General Plan, Four roadway segments LOS levels would remain the same, two would be worse and two would result in a better LOS than the General Plan Update.

SR 20 Traffic volumes on SR 20 result in Levels of Service in excess of X
minimum standards. The volume of traffic forecast for SR 20 through Colusa will exceed the LOS D threshold for a 2 lane arterial. Exceeding the City's LOS D threshold in these areas is a
significant impact, and implementing the circulation option does
not eliminate this impact.

Tenant Drive will exceed the LOS C threshold for a two lane collector without
left turn lanes. Adding left turn lanes would deliver LOS C in the
area between SR 20 and Cynthia Avenue. To deliver LOS C
between Cynthia Avenue and Tenant Drive the road would have to
be constructed to two lane arterial standards.

Railroad Connector Traffic Volumes on the Railroad Connector between Wescott Road X
between Wescott and SR 20 are indicative of LOS D conditions. The volume of
Road and SR 20 traffic on the Railroad Connector will exceed the LOS C threshold
for a collector street. To deliver LOS C it would be necessary to acquire right of way and improve the road to an Arterial standard.
Will S Green Traffic volumes on Will S Green Ave are indicative of LOS
Avenue conditions in the area between SR 20 and Colus Avenue and
immediately north of SR 20. As under the GP, the volume of traffic on these portions of Will S Green will exceed the LOS C threshold for 2 lane collectors under the Circulation alternative. To deliver LOS C it will be necessary to add auxiliary lanes in the area between Colus Avenue and the SR 20 / will S Green Avenue intersection and on the northern leg of the intersection (i.e., separate right turn, through, and left turn lanes approaching SR 20).
SR 45 north of
Market Street Traffic volumes on SR 45 north of Market Street are indicative of LOS F. As under the base Circulation plan, the projected volume on this state highway will exceed the LOS D threshold established by the General Plan. To deliver LOS D it would be necessary to
widen the roadway to a four lane section.
SR 20 east and Traffic volumes on SR 20 east and west of the Colusa sphere of west of the Colusa influence are indicative of LOS F conditions. Regionally, sphere of influence development in Colusa will contribute to conditions in excess ol the LOS D standard with either circulation option.
East Collector Traffic volumes on the East Collector are indicative of LOS D
conditions. As under the base circulation plan, the volume of traffic on the southern half of the new East Collector will exceed the LOS C threshold. To deliver LOS C it would be necessary to
designate this roadway as a 2 lane arterial and improve the road to
arterial standards.
Source: kdAnderson
Notes: 1) Comparison of LOS levels identified in Table 4.3-10 and 7.0-6

Overall number of trips would remain the same under Alternative 4, as there would be no change in the number of residents, and therefore no change in the anticipated number of vehicles. However, a re-routing of traffic may occur due to the new roadway. The fraffic analysis completed for Alternative 4 does not indicate a substantial decrease in traffic volumes or a significant improvement of levels of service form impacted roadways. As presented in Table 7.0-
7, while there would be an improvement in traffic conditions on some streets, traffic conditions
on other streets would worsen.

However, the establishment of LOS D as the minimum acceptable level of service for roadway operations under this alternative, would result in acceptable levels of service on the following segments and avoid the need to mitigate impacts on these segments:

7.0 PROJECT ALTERNATIVES

Wescott Road from SR 20 to Tenant Drive,

Will S Green Street from Wilson Avenue to SR 20, and

East Collector from Fremont Street to Sunrise Boulevard.

Therefore, Alternative 4's impact on City and State roadways would be better than the proposed project.

Noise

Construction Noise - Impact 4.4.3

The proposed project would result in construction noise impacts, which would be reduced to a less than significant level with the incorporation of proposed mitigation measures.
Alternative 4 land use designations will be the same as the proposed project and therefore will result in construction activities similar to the proposed project. Alternative 4 would result in the same impact level as the proposed project.

Airport Noise - Impact 4.4.4

The General Plan Land Use Diagram indicates that some residential areas may be placed near the Colusa County Airport. As indicated in Figure 4.4-1, areas near the airport may be exposed to noise levels of at least 55 dB CNEL. While mitigation measures may reduce noise levels, it is not anticipated that aircraft noise levels would be mitigated to a less than significant level through implementation of mitigation measures through the Design Review process for all development that may be accommodated under the proposed General Plan. As a result, this impact is significant and unavoidable.

Alternative 4 land use designations will be the same as the proposed project and therefore will have the same potential conflicts with the CLUP, including airport noise impacts. Alternative 4 would result in the same impact level as the proposed project.

Cumulative Traffic Noise - Impact 6.5

The proposed project would result in cumulative traffic noise impacts, which would result in a cumulatively considerable and significant and unavoidable impact.
Overall, traffic noise impacts under Alternative 4 would be similar to those under the proposed project, as the amount of vehicle traffic would remain the same. It is possible that Alternative 4 would remove through traffic in residential areas, thereby decreasing the number of residents exposed to noise. However, the cumulative noise level would most likely remain the same as the proposed project.

Air Quality

Construction-Related Emissions - Impact 4.5.1
The proposed General Plan project would result in construction-related air quality impacts. Emissions from individual development construction sites would be short term and temporary, but would occur through buildout of the General Plan. At any given times, several construction
City of Colusa Colusa General Plan
July 2007 Draft Master Environmental Impact Report 7.0-39

7.0 PROJECT ALTERNATIVES

projects may be under way, which may result in substantial construction-related emissions. Intensification of individual development projects would account for most development, and consequently most construction-related emissions. However, with incorporation of proposed mitigation measures and General Plan policies and implementing actions, this impact was considered less than significant.

Alternative 4 land use designations will be the same as the proposed project and therefore will have the same potential construction-related air emissions. Alternative 4 would result in the same
impact level as the proposed project.
Operations-Related Emissions - Impact 4.5.2
Table 4.5-3 identifies the daily operational emissions for the proposed project as: 1,085.1 Ibs/day for ROG, 316.3 lbs/day for NOx and 1,326.1 lbs/day for PMio. Impact 4.5.2 concludes that even with General Plan policies and implementing actions and the proposed mitigation measures listed under this impact, the proposed project would have a significant and unavoidable impact in this area.

Alternative 4 land use designations will be the same as the proposed project and therefore will have the same potential operational-related air emissions. Alternative 4 would result in the same
impact level as the proposed project.
Carbon Monoxide Emissions from Traffic - Impact 4.5.4
Development accommodated under the proposed General Plan Update would increase traffic volumes on streets throughout the proposed Planning Area, and therefore would increase local carbon monoxide concentrations. Concentrations of this pollutant are related to the levels of traffic and congestion along streets and at intersections. Due to the lack of feasible mitigation, the proposed General Plan project resulted in a significant and unavoidable impact.
Alternative 4 would have the same population as the proposed General Plan Update. While Alternative 4, may decrease traffic on local residential streets, those streets which have the potential for substantial carbon monoxide emissions would still operate at a level where carbon monoxide hazards would occur (LOS E or worse).

Cumulative Regional Air Basin Impacts - Impact 6.6

Implementation of the proposed General Plan project would result in an increased population and substantial new development, which would adversely affect regional air quality. The growth in population, vehicle usage and business activity within the NSVAB, when considered with growth proposed under the General Plan, would contribute to cumulative regional air quality impacts. It also could potentially delay attainment of standards for which counties in the NSVAB currently are in nonattainment status, mainly ozone and PMIo. This would result in a cumulatively considerable and significant and unavoidable impact.
Alternative 4 land use designations will be the same and result in the same levels of traffic, housing units, commercial and industrial growth as the proposed project. Therefore, Alternative 4 would result in the same impact level as the proposed project.

Geology, Soils and Hazardous Materials

Hazardous Material Sites - Impact 4.6.5

Implementation of the proposed General Plan project may lead to development on or adjacent to hazardous material contamination sites. Located in the City are identified areas of potential hazardous material contamination sites. Implementation of the mitigation measures identified under this impact would reduce to a less than significant level.
Alternative 4 would not change the existence of hazardous material contamination sites nor the potential for health and safety hazards occurring. The contamination sites identified in Section 4.6 are all located within Alternative 4's planning area. As a result, Alternative 4 is considered to have the same impact for the exposure to hazardous materials as the proposed project.
Contamination on Agricultural Lands • Impact 4.6.7

Implementation of the proposed General Plan would encourage development on lands currently or previously used for agriculture, which may contain hazardous material contamination from substances used in past operations. Implementation of mitigation measure identified under Impact 4.6.7 would reduce or eliminate potential health hazards associated with development of former agricuitural lands to a less than significant level.
The development of urban uses on lands that have been used for agricultural activities have similar impacts with regard to hazardous materials as the proposed project. Agricultural activities may have involved the use of chemicals such as pesticides, fertilizers and herbicides. Residues of these chemicals may be in the soils of these project sites. Potential impacts of these residues on development under Alternative 4 would be the same as those identified with the proposed project.

Hydrology and Water Quality

Groundwater Supply - Impact 4.7.5

Implementation of the proposed General Plan would increase demand for water, requiring increased groundwater production. Future development allowed by the proposed General Plan would place an increasing demand on the City's existing water supplies. An increased demand would at the least require additional pumping from existing wells, and possibly require more wells to be drilled. This would increase the amount of groundwater withdrawn from the local aquifer. Implementation of the proposed mitigation measures listed under Impact 4.7.5, along with the General Plan policies and implementing actions, would reduce the impacts to groundwater supply to a less than significant level.
Section 4.7 of this MEIR discusses water usage for the general City of Colusa area. According to Tully and Young, hydrological consultants for the MEIR, agricultural uses tend to use more water that urban uses. According to Table 4.7-2, which provides an estimate of the water demand for the City and surrounding area, under current conditions areas currently within the City Sphere of Influence would actually have a higher water demand than the proposed project through year 2027, mainly due to existing agricultural uses.

The City currently provides its municipal water via wells. An increased demand would at the least require additional pumping from these wells, and possibly require more wells to be drilled. This would increase the amount of groundwater withdrawn from the local aquifer. Alternative 4 is

will the same buildout potential as the proposed General Plan Update and therefore the same
water demand.

Biological Resources

Cumulative Biological Resource Impacts - Impact 6.9
Implementation of the General Plan Update with it resulting it development would result in direct and indirect impacts to listed and non-listed special-status species as well as impacts to
jurisdictional waters of the U.S., non-special status species, trees, habitat and movement
corridors. This results in a cumulatively considerable and significant and unavoidable impact.
4 Alternative 4 land use designations will be the same as the proposed project and therefore will have the same potential to impact biological resources an the General Plan Update.. Alternative 4 would result in the same impact level as the proposed project.
Historic and Cultural Resources

Disturbance of Cultural and Paleontological Resources Impact 4.92
Future development associated with implementation of the proposed General Pian project may encounter currently unknown cultural resources and paleontological resources, thereby disturbing their sites. Implementation of the mitigation measure, along with the proposed General Plan policy, would avoid or minimize adverse physical impacts on undiscovered cultural resources, and ensure their proper disposition with minimal loss of resource value. Impacts after mitigation would be less than significant.
4 Alternative 4 land use designations will be the same as the proposed project and therefore will have the same potential impacts to cultural and paleontological resources. Alternative 4 would result in the same impact level as the proposed project.

Visual Resources

Scenic Vistas - Impact 4.10.3

Implementation of the proposed General Plan Update may result in the obstruction of scenic
vistas at the existing edges of urban development. Policies and implementing actions would protect scenic vistas to the extent feasible. However, the only way to avoid or reduce this impact to a less than significant impact would be to prohibit development that would affect views of scenic resources. This would be inconsistent with the objectives of the proposed General Plan Update and the proposed land use map. No feasible mitigation measures can be applied and results in a significant and unavoidable impact.
Alternative 4 land use 4 designations will be the same as the proposed project and therefore will have the same potential to impact scenic vistas. Alternative 4 would result in the same impact level as the proposed project.

Public Services and Utilities

Extension of energy and communication infrastructure - Impact 4.12.5.2
Implementation of the General Plan Update would require the extension of energy and communication infrastructure. This would potentially impact the environment by increase air pollutants during construction, create impacts to biological resources, create noise and vibration during construction, create visual impacts, etc. Mitigation measures provided in the MEIR reduce this impact to a less than significant level.
Alternative 4 will also require the extension of energy and communication infrastructure to the same degree of the proposed project. Alternative 4 would result in the same impact level as the proposed project.

Climate Change

Cumulative increase in global greenhouse gas emissions and cumulative effects of global climate
change (Impacts 6.14 and 6.15)

Implementation of the General Plan Update would result in an increase in greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to cumulative climate change impacts, including rising temperatures. The effects of climate change may expose the City to increased flooding, uncertain water supply, health effects and other impacts under cumulative conditions as described under Impact 6.15.

Alternative 4 would also result in increased development and both contribute to cumulative
climate change impacts and expose the City to the effects of climate change. Development levels under this alternative would be comparable to the proposed project. While traffic patterns would change, vehicle miles traveled are anticipated to be comparable. This alternative would have impacts similar to those of the proposed project.

7.4 SUMMARY MATRIX

Table 7.0-8 provides a summary of the potential impacts of the alternatives evaluated in this
section, as compared with the potential impacts of the proposed General Plan. impacts under alternatives are evaluated on whether they had better, worse or similar environmental impacts than the proposed project.

7.5 ENVIRONMENTALLY SUPERIOR ALTERNATIVE

CEQA Guidelines Section 15126.6(e) (2) indicates that an environmentally superior alternative must be identified in an EIR. Based on the summary of information presented in Table 7.0-8 above, the environmentally superior alternative to the proposed project is Alternative - No Update/No Development Projects. Alternative 1 generally has lesser adverse impacts on the environment than the proposed project. However, Alternative

8.0 OTHER SECTIONS REQUIRED BY CEQA

This section discusses the additional topics statutorily required by CEQA. The topics discussed include significant irreversible environmental changes/irretrievable commitment of resources, significant and unavoidable environmental impacts, and growth-inducing impacts.

8.1 SIGNIFICANT IRREVERSIBLE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS

Public Resources Code Sections 21100(b)(2) and 21100.1 (a) require that an EIR prepared for the adoption of a plan, policy, or ordinance of a public agency must include a discussion of significant irreversible environmental changes of project implementation. CEQA Guidelines Section 15126.2(c) describes irreversible environmental changes as follows:
Uses of nonrenewable resources during the initial and continued phases of the project may be irreversible since a large commitment of such resources makes removal or nonuse thereafter unlikely. Primary impacts and, particularly, secondary impacts (such as highway improvement which provides access to a previously inaccessible area) generally commit future generations to similar uses. Also irreversible damage can result from environmental accidents associated with the project. Irretrievable commitments of resources should be evaluated to assure that such current consumption is justified.
Implementation of the proposed City of Colusa General Plan would result in the conversion of undeveloped open space and agricultural lands, including 2,072 acres of farmland and grazing land, to residential, commercial, industrial, office, public and recreational uses. Development of the proposed Planning Area would constitute a long-term commitment to urban land uses. It is unlikely that circumstances would arise that would return any developed land to its original undeveloped condition. Development of undeveloped and agricultural lands would result in the permanent loss of wildlife habitat. Therefore, conversion of undeveloped and agricultural lands to urban development is considered a significant irreversible environmental effect.
Development of the City would irretrievably commit building materials and energy to the construction and maintenance of buildings and infrastructure proposed. Renewable, nonrenewable, and limited resources that would likely be consumed as part of development would include oil, gasoline, lumber, sand and gravel, asphalt, water, steel, and other similar materials. Many of these materials would be consumed during development activities, and therefore cannot be reused or recycled. It is possible that some building materials could be recycled or salvaged, such as glass and aluminum. Currently, neither the City nor Colusa County has requirements for the recycling or reuse of building materials.
Development under the proposed General Plan would require a permanent allocation of water supply to serve the proposed uses. Air pollutants associated with development under the proposed General Plan would have a long-term effect on air quality.
In addition, implementation of development under the updated General Plan would result in an increased demand on utilities for energy such as electricity and natural gas (see Section 4.12, Public Services and Utilities). Energy conservation measures would reduce the potential demand from each land use, but overall energy consumption would likely still increase with development. Most electricity in California comes from generating plants utilizing fossil fuels such as coal and natural gas. These fuels are consumed during electricity generation and cannot be retrieved. Other sources of electricity include hydroelectric, nuclear and renewable sources (e.g., wind, solar). Hydroelectric and renewable electricity relies on power sources that are not consumed during electricity generation. Electricity from nuclear plants requires radioactive materials for power generation. These materials, along with other materials that come in contact with them (e.g., fuel rods), generally cannot be used for other purposes. Natural gas

and propane are used to heat buildings. These gases are burned to provide heat, and thus
cannot be reused.

8.2 SIGNIFICANT AND UNAVOIDABLE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS

CEQA Guidelines Section 15126.2(b) requires an EIR to discuss unavoidable significant environmental effects, including those that can be mitigated but not reduced to a level of insignificance. in addition, Section 15093(a) of the CEQA Guidelines allows the decision-making agency to determine the benefits of a proposed project outweigh the unavoidable adverse environmental impacts of implementing the project. The City can approve a project with unavoidable adverse impacts if it prepares a "Statement of Overriding Considerations" setting forth the specific reasons for making such a judgment.
The following significant and unavoidable impacts are specifically identified in Section 4.0 of this EIR. The reader is referred to the various environmental issue areas of Section 4.0, 5.0 and 6.0 for further details and analysis of the significant and unavoidable impacts identitied below.

SECTION 4.1 LAND USE AND PLANNING

Conflicts with Land Use Plans/Policies

Impact 4.1.2 Implementation of the proposed General Plan Update could lead to inconsistency with other land use plans and ordinances, particularly the Comprehensive Land Use Plan for the Colusa County Airport. While
development consistent with the Low Density Residential designation would be incompatible with the CLUP, the only mitigation measure would be to change the proposed land use that is incompatible with the Colusa County Airport CLUP. However, such a mitigation measure would be inconsistent with
the project as proposed. This impact is considered significant and
unavoidable.

Loss of Agricultural Land

Impact 4.1.5 Implementation of the proposed General Plan Update would result in the loss of Prime Farmland and Farmland of Local Importance, as designated under the Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Program. Implementation of MM 4.1.5 would reduce the impact of the loss of important farmland by compensating
for any loss due to development. However, because projects will remove Prime Farmland and Farmland of Local Importance from existing agricultural production without the assurance of replacement with like lands, projects would still result in the direct loss of Prime Farmland and Farmland of Local
Importance. Therefore, this impact is considered signiticant and unavoidable.
SECTION 4.2 POPULATION AND HOUSING

Population and Housing Growth

Impact 4.2.1 Implementation of the proposed General Plan Update could result in a substantial increase in population and the number of housing units, with its attendant environmental impacts. However, even with implementation of General Plan policies and mitigation measures identified in the MEIR, implementation of the General Plan and its associated growth is expected to

Colusa General Plan City of Colusa
Draft Master Environmental Impact Report July 2007
8.0-2

8.0 OTHER SECTIONS REQUIRED BY CEQA

result in several significant and avoidable effects to the environment. Therefore, this impact is considered significant and unavoidable.
SECTION 4.3 TRANSPORTATION AND CIRCULATION
Increased Traffic Volumes on Local Roadways

Impact 4.3.1 Implementation of the proposed General Plan would result in increased traffic volumes and a decrease in LOS on area roadways. Implementation of mitigation measure MM 4.3.1a would reduce potential impacts associated with development considered prior to adoption of the Street and Roadways Master Plan and prior to the updates to the CIP and development impact fee programs. However, due to right-of-way constraints for some improvements, such as portions of Wescott Road, some improvements may be determined to not be feasible by the City. While implementation of the improvements identified in mitigation measures MM 4.3.1b through MM 4.3.1i would result in acceptable LOS as identified above, the timing of the adoption of the Capital Improvement Program is unknown, no funding has been identified for these improvements and the schedule for these improvements is unknown. Individual development projects would mitigate specific impacts associated with the project as required under proposed Implementing Action CIR-1.1.b: Development review. However, the lack of a Capital Improvement Program and development impact fee program to address traffic impacts associated with buildout of the General Plan, which may be less than significant for individual development projects but result in significant impacts when buildout of the General Plan is considered, would result in residual significant impacts. Therefore, impacts to roadways would be considered significant and unavoidable.

State Highways

Impact 4.3.2 Implementation of the proposed General Plan would result in increased traffic volumes and a decrease in LOS on state highways (SR 20 and SR 45). Given the status of the improvement projects identified by Caltrans and the information available at this time, the City has concluded that there is currently insufficient information and certainty on which to base a feasible and viable mitigation measure to fully address the General Plan Update's impact on SR 20 and SR 45. The necessary improvements are not approved nor are they funded. There is no fee or other funding mechanism currently in place for future funding. Subsequent development projects would be reviewed consistent with CEQA requirements and appropriate mitigation determined for each project. At this time, the City cannot determine the specific improvements that would be implemented nor the cost of the necessary improvements and thus cannot determine fair-share contributions for future development projects that would satisfy the legal requirements for fee-based mitigation under both CEQA (see CEQA Guidelines 15126.4) and constitutional principles that call for a nexus and rough proportionality between a project's impacts and the fee-based mitigation measure.
Implementation of mitigation measures MM 4.3.2a and 4.3.2c would assist in reducing impacts to segments of SR 20 and SR 45 within the City. Mitigation measure MM 4.3.2b commits the City to coordinate with Caltrans to develop
City of Colusa Colusa General Plan July 2007 Draft Master Environmental Impact Report 8.0-3

8.0 OTHER SECTIONS REQUIRED BY CEQA

an SR 20 access management plan and to consult with Caltrans regarding appropriate fair-share contributions for subsequent development projects. However, as the CIP has not yet been developed, specific improvements to be included in the CIP and funding sources for necessary improvements are unknown. Improvements to be undertaken by Caltrans for SR 20 and SR 45 are unknown. Therefore, while these mitigation measures would assist in reducing the impacts to SR 20 and SR 45, the impacts would not be reduced to less than significant.
Finally, the prospects of the proposed state route improvements ever being constructed remains uncertain due to funding priorities and on-going policy developments that may favor other approaches to addressing state route congestion. Consequently, the City has been unable to identify any feasible mitigation measures imposable on this project that could reduce or avoid the impact of the Project on the SR 20 and SR 45 to a less than significant level. The California Environmental Quality Act (Pub. Resources Code, §21000 et seq.) defines "feasible" for these purposes as capable of being accomplished in a successful manner within a reasonable period of time, taking into
account economic, environmental, social, and technological factors (Pub. Resources Code, § 21061.1). Therefore, the impacts of the proposed General
Plan Update on SR 20 and SR 45 facilities would remain a significant and
unavoidable impact.

Intersections

Impact 4.3.3 Implementation of the proposed General Plan would result in increased traffic volumes and a decrease in LOS at street and roadway intersections. While implementation of the improvements identified in mitigation measures MM 4.3.3a through MM 4.3.1i would result in acceptable LOS as identified above, the timing of the adoption of the Capital Improvement Program is unknown, no funding has been identified for these improvements and the schedule for these improvements is unknown. Individual development projects would mitigate specific impacts associated with the project as required under proposed Implementing Action CIR-1.1.b: Development review and mitigation measure MM 4.3.1a. However, due to right-of-way constraints for some improvements, such as portions of Wescott Road and SR 20, some improvements may be determined to not be feasible by the City. Furthermore, the lack of a Capital Improvement Program and development
impact fee program to address traffic impacts associated with buildout of the General Plan, which may be less than significant for individual development projects but result in significant impacts when buildout of the General Plan is
considered, would result in residual significant impacts. Therefore, impacts to intersections would be considered significant and unavoidable.

SECTION 4.4 NOISE

Construction Noise Levels

Impact 4.4.3 Demolition of existing structures and construction activities associated with development under the proposed General Plan Update would temporarily
increase noise levels at existing noise-sensitive receivers. While
implementation of the proposed General Plan policies and action items

Colusa General Plan City of Colusa
Draft Master Environmental Impact Report July 2007
8.0-4

8.0 OTHER SECTIONS REQUIRED BY CEQA

along with mitigation measure MM 4.4.3 would reduce construction noise
impacts, the potential for short-term exposure of noise-sensitive uses to excessive noise levels associated with construction activities would remain. Therefore, while construction noise would be a temporary occurrence, impacts are considered significant and unavoidable.

Airport Noise

Impact 4.4.4 Implementation of the proposed General Plan Update could place new noise-sensitive land uses near the Colusa County Airport. As described in
Section 4.4, Policies N-1.1, N-1.2 and N-1.3, along with Implementing Actions N-1.1.a, N-1.1.b and N-1.2.a, would apply noise standards to development projects and require mitigation for any adverse noise impacts. Implementing Actions N-1.1.c, N-1.1.d and N-1.1.e explicitly apply to noise associated with airport operations. These actions seek to incorporate the provisions of the Colusa County Airport CLUP into City plans and ordinances as they apply to noise exposure. These provisions are designed to reduce the exposure of
noise-sensitive land uses to elevated levels of airport noise. Implementation of
the proposed General Plan policies and implementing actions would minimize airport-related noise impacts on nearby residential land use. However, the City may approve uses inconsistent with the CLUP, as allowed under State
law, which could result in excessive noise exposure. While mitigation measures may reduce noise levels, it is not anticipated that aircraft noise levels would be mitigated to a less than significant level through implementation of
mitigation measures through the Design Review process for all development that may be accommodated under the proposed General Plan. As a result, this impact is significant and unavoidable.

Increased Traffic Noise

Impact 4.4.5 Implementation of the General Plan, in combination with existing, approved, proposed, and reasonably foreseeable development, would contribute to a
cumulative increase in traffic noise. As described in Section 4.4, Policies N-1.1,
N-1.2, N-1.3, N-1.4, N-1.5, N-1.6, and associated implementing actions Implementing Actions would require application of noise standards and
mitigation measures to reduce noise-levels and reduce exposure of noise- sensitive land uses to excessive noise. However, despite the implementation of these measures, it would be infeasible to ensure that all existing residential uses will not be exposed to future traffic noise levels in excess of the City's
noise standards. As a result, this impact is considered significant and
unavoidable.

SECTION 4.5 AIR QUALITY

Operations-Related Emissions

Impact 4.5.2 Implementation of the proposed General Plan Update would increase air pollutant emissions from land use activities within the City. The proposed
General Plan policies and implementing actions would reduce the emissions generated by land use activities at buildout. Proposed new development would be required to incorporate air quality mitigation measures such as Best Management Practices from the Colusa County APCD. However, it cannot

July 2007 Draft Master Environmental Impact Report
8.0-5

8.0 OTHER SECTIONS REQUIRED BY CEQA

be determined at this time that these emissions would be reduced to a level that could be considered less than significant because of the uncertainty of the potential future projects that may be developed in the City and to what extent these projects may impact air quality. Therefore, impacts after mitigation are considered signiticant and unavoidable.

Carbon Monoxide Emissions from Traffic

Impact 4.5.4 Impiementation of the proposed General Plan Update would increase traffic volumes that would potentially increase concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO) along streets and near intersections. Colusa can be expected to have very low concentrations of this pollutant, and signalized intersections affected by project traffic currently operate at good levels of service. However, there are several intersections projected to operate at LOS E or F under future conditions (see Section 4.3). While mitigation measures are incorporated in the MEIR that would improve the LOS at these intersections, the timing of the improvements (as well as feasibility for the SR 20 intersections) is unknown. As such, it must be assumed that improvements to these intersections may not be available and therefore a reduction in CO cannot be assured. The only
realistic mitigation for the reduction of cO emission is a state mandated reduction in vehicle emissions. No other feasible mitigation measures are available on a City level. Therefore, this impact would be significant and unavoidable.

SECTION 4.10 VISUAL RESOURCES

Scenic Vistas

Impact 4.10.3 Implementation of the proposed General Plan Update may result in the obstruction of scenic vistas at the existing edges of urban development. Development under the General Plan Update would result in the obstruction of scenic views, including those of the Coastal Range, Sutter Buttes, and Sacramento River, from both public and private vantage points. Implementation of the General Plan policies and implementing actions would reduce potential impacts on scenic vistas in the area. However, it is likely that obstruction of scenic views would still occur. Therefore, impacts after implementation would remain significant and unavoidable.

SECTION 5.1 COLUSA RIVERBEND

Agricultural Land Conversion

Impact 5.1.1 The Colusa Riverbend project would convert land from agricultural Use to urban uses. Implementation of MM 5.1.1 would reduce the impact of the loss of important farmland by compensating for any loss due to development.
However, because the project will remove Prime Farmland and Farmland of
Local Importance from existing agricultural production without the assurance
of replacement with like lands, the project would still result in the direct loss of Prime Farmland and Farmland of Local Importance. Therefore, this impact is considered signitic ant and unavoidable.

8.0 OTHER SECTIONS REQUIRED BY CEQA

Loss of Scenic Views and Visual Character

Impact 5.1.10 Implementation of the Colusa Riverbend project would result in the loss of views of scenic area and change the visual character within the project vicinity. While the City General Plan incorporates a number of policies and implementing actions to remove potential impacts to scenic resources of the City, development of a parcel of land that is currently agricultural uses or vacant into uses that would place buildings in the viewshed of existing uses would invariably change the existing character of the landscape and impact views of scenic resources. There is no feasible mitigation for the loss of these views from existing development therefore; project implementation will result in significant and unavoidable impacts.

SECTION 5.2 COLUSA CROSSINGS

Agricultural Land Conversion

Impact 5.2.1 The Colusa Crossings project would convert land from agricultural use to urban uses. Implementation of MM 5.2.1 would reduce the impact of the loss of important farmland by conserving comparable existing agricultural lands. However, development of the project would result in an irrevocable decrease in the amount of Prime Farmland and Farmland of Local Importance and a net reduction in important agricultural lands. considered signiticant and unavoidable. Therefore, this impact is

Loss of Scenic Views and Visual Character

Impact 5.2.6 Implementation of the Colusa Crossings project would result in the loss of views of scenic area and change the visual character within the project vicinity. While the City General Plan incorporates a number of policies and implementing actions to remove potential impacts to scenic resources of the City, development of a parcel of land that is currently agricultural uses or vacant into uses that would place buildings in the viewshed of existing uses would invariably change the existing character of the landscape and impact views of scenic resources. There is no feasible mitigation for the loss of these views from existing development or the alteration in visual character of the site. Therefore; project implementation will result in significant and unavoidable impacts.

SECTION 5.3 BROOKINS RANCH

Agricultural Land Conversion

Impact 5.3.1 The Brookins Ranch project would convert land from agricultural use to urban uses. Implementation of MM 5.2.1 would reduce the impact of the loss of important farmland by conserving comparable existing agricultural lands. However, development of the project would result in an irrevocable decrease in the amount of Prime Farmiand and Farmland of Local Importance and a net reduction in important agricultural lands. Therefore, this impact is considered significant and unavoidable.

Loss of Scenic Views and Visual Character

Impact 5.3.14 Implementation of the project would result in the loss of views of scenic area and change the visual character within the project vicinity. While the City General Plan incorporates a number of policies and implementing actions to
remove potential impacts to scenic resources of the City, development of a parcel of land that is currently agricultural uses or vacant into uses that would
place buildings in the viewshed of existing uses would invariably change the existing character of the landscape and impact views of scenic resources. There is no feasible mitigation for the loss of these views from existing development or the alteration in visual character of the site. Therefore;
project implementation will result in significant and unavoidable impacts.

SECTION 6.0 CUMULATIVE IMPACTS

Cumulative Loss of Agricultural Land

Impact 6.2 Implementation of the proposed General Plan Update, in addition to existing, proposed, approved, and reasonably foreseeable development in Colusa
County, would contribute to the cumulative loss of Prime Farmland and other
valuable farmland in Colusa County, the Sacramento Valley and the State. Implementation of mitigation measure MM 4.1.6, along with the proposed
General Plan policies and implementing actions, would help reduce the project's contribution to the cumulative loss of important farmland in the region by taking steps to protect regional farmlands from conversion to non-agricultural uses. However, implementation of the proposed General Plan Update would still
contribute to the cumulative loss of Prime Farmland and Farmland of Local
Importance that cannot be fully mitigated. Therefore, this impact is considered
cumulatively considerable and significant and unavoidable.
Cumulative Population and Housing Growth

Impact 6.3 Implementation of the proposed General Plan Update, in addition to existing, proposed, approved, and reasonably foreseeable development in the area,
could result in a cumulative increase in population and housing growth in the County and associated environmental impacts. The MEIR contains mitigation measures where appropriate to reduce or eliminate potentially significant
impacts associated with employment and population growth in the Planning Area. While the General Plan contains policies that would help offset the effects of population growth, there are no measures that would completely mitigate the
environmental effects of population growth under cumulative conditions. Even with implementation of General Plan policies and mitigation measures, environmental impacts would remain significant, as population growth will
inevitably occur and nousing and other services would need to be provided to
accommodate this growth. Therefore, impacts related to population growth would be cumulatively considerable and signiticant and unavoidable.
Cumulative Impacts to State Highways

Impact 6.4 Implementation of the proposed General Plan Update, in addition to existing, proposed, approved, and reasonably foreseeable development in the area, could result in a cumulative increase in interregional traffic on state highways.
Colusa General Plan City of Colusa
Draft Master Environmental Impact Report July 2007
8.0-8

8.0 OTHER SECTIONS REQUIRED BY CEQA

Implementation of mitigation measures MM 4.3.1a, 4.3.2a and 4.3.2b along with the General Plan policies and implementing actions, would reduce the proposed project's contribution to impacts on the LOS of state highways in the Planning Area. However, the City does not have a feasible mitigation measure to reduce interregional transportation impacts on SR 20 to a level that is less than significant. Also, it would be difficult to provide a four-lane section of SR 20 in the developed areas along the 10th Street corridor from Market Street south to the fairgrounds and on the Bridge Street corridor from Market Street south to Wescott Avenue. LOS on these SR 20 segments would be below the Caltrans LOS threshold of D. Therefore, while some impacts can be mitigated, the cumulative impact on state highways would be cumulatively considerable and significant and unavoidable.
Increased Traffic Noise

Impact 6.5 Implementation of the General Plan Update, in combination with existing, approved, proposed, and reasonably foreseeable development, would contribute to a cumulative increase in traffic noise. While implementation of mitigation measure MM 4.4.5 in addition to the proposed General Plan policies and implementing actions would result in a reduction of traffic noise levels at affected sensitive receptor locations within the proposed Planning Area, it would be infeasible to ensure that ali sensitive receptors and residential uses would not be exposed to future traffic noise levels in excess of applicable standards. As a result, this impact is considered cumulatively considerable and significant and unavoidable.

Cumulative Regional Air Basin Impacts

Impact 6.6 Implementation of the proposed General Plan Update, in combination with existing, approved, proposed and reasonably foreseeable development, would exacerbate existing NSVAB problems with ozone and particulate matter. Implement mitigation measures MM 4.5.1 and MM 4.5.2. Implementation of these mitigation measures, along with the General Plan policies and implementing actions identified in this section, would assist in reducing emissions associated with the proposed General Plan that would contribute cumulatively to adverse air quality in the NSVAB. However, it cannot be stated with certainty that impacts would be reduced to level that is less than significant. Therefore, the cumulative impact is considered cumulatively considerable and signiticant and unavoidable.

Cumulative Biological Resource Impacts

Impact 6.9 Implementation of the proposed General Plan Update, in addition to existing, approved, proposed and reasonably foreseeable development in the Planning Area and larger regional context would result in a cumulative loss of biological resources in the region. Implementation of General Plan policies and implementing actions would reduce the General Plan's contribution to cumulative biological impacts in the region. However, the General Plan's contribution would remain cumulatively considerable, as implementation of the proposed General Plan Update along with cumulative development throughout the region would contribute to special-status plant and wildlife species and habitat loss. The only mitigation for such impacts - restricting the majority of development proposed in the General Plan Update - is not considered feasible, is

8.0 OTHER SECTIONS REQUIRED BY CEQA

given that it would fundamentally conflict with the goals of the General Plan. Therefore, cumulative biological resource impacts are considered cumulatively
considerable and signiticant and unavoidable.
Cumulative Increase in GHG Emissions

Impact 6.14 Buildout of the proposed General Plan Update would result in the cumulative increase of greenhouse gases (GHG) including CO2 emitted into the atmosphere. GHG emissions are associated with vehicle trips, industrial uses, and emissions associated residential and non-residential development. Section 6.0 provides a complete discussion of this impact under Impact 6.14. Table 6.13-4
illustrates the total buildout amount of CO2 emissions as a result of
implementation General Pian Update. According to the methodologies listed previously for the identification of CO2 emissions, buildout of the General Plan will result in an increase in CO2 emissions of .298 million metric tons (MMT) annually. In comparison, the amount of CO2 emitted in California in 2004 was 334.9 MMT (369.2 million tons).

Policies CCD-1, PRC-5.1, PRC-5.2, PRC-5.3, PRC-5.4, PRC-5.5 , PRC-11.1, and PRC-
11.2 and associated implementing actions will assist in the reduction of GHGs as
described in Section 6.0 under Impact 6.14. However, at this time, due to the lack of a threshold of significance, it is not possible to determine at what level of impact the increase in GHGs would occur as a result of implementation of the General Plan Update. It is generally believed that climate changes are now and will continue to occur because of the increase of greenhouse gasses throughout
the world. AB 32 requires that statewide GHG emissions be reduced to 1990 levels by the year 2020. This will require an overall reduction GHGs emitted in the state.
Buildout of the General Plan Planning Area would most likely, with present technology, increase the City's contribution to GHG emissions beyond the 1990 levels. The City can and does require energy efficient design in building construction within the City. This requirement and the General Plan policies and implementing actions listed previously can effectively reduce GHG emissions from building operations (energy use). Whether or not these requirements will reduce emissions effectively enough to mitigate the City's contribution to GHGs is unknown. The only entity which has jurisdiction over vehicle emissions in California
is the state or federal government. Therefore, until such time that there are thresholds of significance for which to compare the City's GHGs contribution, it must be assumed that any increase in GHGs will lead to a change in climate.
Therefore, this impact is considered signiticant and unavoidable and the proposed General Plan Update would have a cumulatively considerable contribution.

Cumulative Effects of Global Climate Change on the City of Colusa

Impact 6.15 The impacts of global climate change would cumulatively result in the potential
decrease in water supply, increase in air pollutants, and increase in health hazards. As described in Section 6.0, the City would be exposed to effects
associated with global warming. Cumulative effects of climate change include
substantial loss of snowpack, increased risk of large wildfires, reductions in the quality and quantity of certain agricultural products and health effects, such as dehydration, heat stroke/exhaustion, heart attack, stroke, and respiratory distress caused by extreme heat. All policies and implementing actions listed under

Colusa General Plan City of Colusa
Draft Master Environmental Impact Report July 2007
8.0-10

8.0 OTHER SECTIONS REQUIRED BY CEQA

Impact 6.14 would assist in the reduction of GHGs. Please refer to Impact 6.14 for these policies and implementing actions. Policies and action items discussed in 4.7 would reduce impacts associated with water supply and flooding. While the
General Plan policies and implementing actions would reduce the potential GHG emissions in the City, climate change is a result of global GHG emissions. A complete elimination of GHG emissions in the City would not significantly change GHG emissions on a global scale nor decrease the effects of global climate
change on the City's residents. Therefore, this impact is considered significant
and unavoidable and the proposed General Plan Update would have a cumulatively considerable contribution.

8.3 GROWTH-INDUCING IMPACTS

INTRODUCTION

The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) Guidelines Section 15126.2(d) requires that an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) evaluate the growth-inducing impacts of a proposed action. A growth-inducing impact is defined by the CEQA Guidelines as follows:
The way in which a proposed project could foster economic or population growth, or the construction of additional housing, either directly or indirectly, in the surrounding
environment. Included in this are projects which would remove obstacles to population
growth..it is not assumed that growth in an area is necessarily beneficial, detrimental, or
of little significance to the environment.
A project can have direct and/or indirect growth inducement potential. Direct growth inducement would result if a project, for example, invoived construction of new housing. A project would have indirect growth inducement potential if it established substantial new permanent employment opportunities (e.g., commercial, industrial or governmental enterprises)
or if it would involve a construction effort with substantial short-term employment opportunities
that would indirectly stimulate the need for additional housing and services to support the new
employment demand. Similarly, a project would indirectly induce growth if it would remove an obstacle to additional growth and development, such as removing a constraint on a required public service. A project providing an increased water supply in an area where water service historically limited growth could be considered a growth-inducing project.
The CEQA Guidelines further explain that the environmental effects of induced growth are considered indirect impacts of the proposed action. These indirect impacts or secondary effects of growth may result in significant, adverse environmental impacts. Potential secondary effects of growth include increased demand on other community and public services and infrastructure, increased traffic and noise, and adverse environmental impacts such as
degradation of air and water quality, degradation or loss of plant and animal habitat, and
conversion of agricultural and open space land to developed uses. Growth inducement also may constitute an adverse impact if the growth is not consistent with or accommodated by the land use plans and policies for the area affected. Local land use plans set forth land use
development patterns and growth policies that allow for the orderly expansion of urban development supported by adequate urban public services.

COMPONENTS OF GROWTH

The timing, magnitude, and location of land development and population growth in a community or region are based on various interrelated land use and economic variables. Key

City of Colusa Colusa General Plan
July 2007 Draft Master Environmental Impact Report
8.0-11

8.0 OTHER SECTIONS REQUIRED BY CEQA

variables include regional economic trends, market demand for residential and non-residential
uses, land availability and cost, the availability and quality of transportation facilities and public services, proximity to employment centers, the supply and cost of housing, and regulatory policies or conditions. Since the general plan of a community defines the location, type and intensity of growth, it is the primary means of regulating development and growth in California.

GROWTH EFFECTS OF THE PROJECT

Based on Government Code Section 65300, the proposed General Plan Update is intended to serve as the overall plan for the physical development of the City of Colusa. While the General Plan does not specifically propose any development projects, it does regulate future population and economic growth of the City that would result in indirect growth-inducing effects.
Implementation of the proposed General Plan Update would refine existing land use designations in the City, establish new policies, actions and design guidelines to guide and manage future development and land uses in the City. This would also include policy direction on roadway facility improvements, public service improvements and the extension and expansion of utilities. The subsections in Section 4.0 discuss the specific environmental effects resulting from the proposed land use patterns and associated extension of public services, by environmental issue. In 2006, the City has a population of 5,698 and 2.099 housing unils. The proposed General Plan Update at buildout would result in 9,386 residential units and a
population of approximately 25,750. Refer to Section 4.0, Introduction to the Environmental Analysis and Assumptions Used, for a more detailed description of buildout conditions that would occur with incorporation of the General Plan and to Section 4.2, Population and Housing, for a discussion of impacts associated with increases in population and housing under the General
Plan Update.

As described above, the proposed General Plan Update would induce further population and job growth in the City as well as potentially induce growth outside of the City. The proposed
General Plan could indirectly induce growth if it would remove an obstacle to additional growth and development, such as removing a constraint on a required public service. Proposed roadway improvements would support such growth within the City and the proposed Planning Area. The General Plan Update also would encourage the development of infrastructure,
including extension of infrastructure into unserved areas, to support the projected development. As a result, the proposed General Plan Update is considered to be growth-inducing. Sections 4.1 through 4.12 and 5.1 through 5.3 of this MEIR address the environmental effects of this growth within the City and in the proposed Planning Area.
It is anticipated that agricultural areas to the west and south of the proposed Planning Area may be pressured to develop, if adjacent lands are developed and infrastructure extended
under the proposed project.

While the City of Colusa General Plan designates lands within the City limits for urbanization, the intensity of development and identification of urbanization of the SOI would exceed the existing and proposed development potential set forth by the City and Colusa County. This MEIR provides an evaluation of environmental effects of project growth.

Annexation of land beyond the City's current borders would add pressure to areas within and surrounding the City's proposed Planning Area. In addition, the extension of infrastructure and would place growth pressure on adjoining land areas. Ultimately, the City would continue to control land use and growth within the City through its General Plan and zoning provisions and

Colusa General Plan City of Colusa
Draft Master Environmental Impact Report July 2007
8.0-12

8.0 OTHER SECTIONS REQUIRED BY CEQA

Colusa County would also continue to control land use and growth through its General Plan and
zoning provisions.

SECONDARY EFFECTS OF GROWTH

This EIR discusses the environmental effects associated with the implementation of the project. Environmental effects of growth on adjacent properties resulting in conversion of existing land uses especially on lands beyond the City's proposed Planning Area would be similar to those associated with the proposed project evaluated in Sections 4.1 through 4.13, which inciudes
impacts associated with traffic, noise, air quality, hydrology and water quality, hazards, public
services and utilities, cultural resources, geological resources, biological resources, land use, agricultural resources and visual resources. However, this growth would further contribute to these local and regional environmental impacts beyond the effects of the project.

APPENDIX A - NOTICE OF PREPARATION

NOTICE OF PREPARATION

DATE: April 5, 2007

TO: Responsible Agencies, Organizations and Interested Parties

LEAD AGENCY: City of Colusa
Contact: Eileen Shaw

SUBJECT: Master Environmental Impact Report for the City of Colusa
General Plan, SCH# 2005072145

I. INTRODUCTION

A. Legal

i. Master Environmental Impact Report

In discharging its duties under Section 15021 of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) Guidelines and Public Resources Code Section 21157 et seq., the City of Colusa (as Lead Agency) intends to prepare a Master Environmental Impact Report (MEIR) for the City of Colusa General Plan update. The preparation and certification of a MEIR may permit subsequent projects analyzed in the MEIR to undergo focused
environmental review.

While CEQA requires that applications for subsequent projects occur within five years of
certification of the MEIR, it provides an exception if the lead agency finds that no
substantial changes have occurred with the project originally evaluated under the MEIR.
In accordance with Section 15082 of the CEQA Guidelines, the City of Colusa has
prepared this Notice of Preparation to provide Responsible Agencies and other interested parties with sufficient information describing the proposal and its potential environmental
effects.

The determination to prepare an Environmental Impact Report was made by the City of
Colusa. As specified by the CEQA Guidelines, the Notice of Preparation will be circulated for a 30-day review period. The City of Colusa welcomes agency and public input during this review. If no response or request for additional time is received from a Responsible Agency by the end of the review period, the Lead Agency may presume that
Responsible Agency has no comment.

Additional copies of the Notice of Preparation are available at Colusa City Hall, located
at 425 Webster Street, Colusa, CA 95932. Written comments may be submitted during
the review period to: Eileen Shaw, City Planner, City of Colusa, 425 Webster Street, Colusa, CA 95932. The comment period closes on Wednesday, May 9, 2007.

Notice of Preparation, April 5, 2007 City of Cotusa General Plan Masfer EIR

ii. Re-release of the NOP

This Notice of Preparation is a re-release of the NOP prepared for this project, dated July
12, 2005, State Clearing House number 2005072145. Changes to the project description
have occurred since the original publication of the NOP, summarized below: Project changes have been made to the subsequent developments Colusa Riverbend (formerly Riverbend Estates), Colusa Crossings, and Brookins Ranch; Halsey Property is now part of the Colusa Riverbend project, and will be analyzed as part of that project;
Tennant Estates and Colusa Industrial Park will not be analyzed at a project-
specific level in the MEIR; and
The Urban Reserve land use designation has been added to the General Plan, and
will be included in the land use analysis in the MEIR.

A complete updated project description of the proposed General Plan update is included in this NOP.

iii. General Plan Update

The City of Colusa will complete a legally adequate General Plan update of all elements, excluding the Housing Element (adopted by the City Council in March 2004), so that the City meets the mandatory requirements of the State of California General Plan Guidelines
(Government § Code § 65300 et seq.). A General Plan update is needed because the last update occurred in 1994, the City has changed since then, and it anticipates substantial new development which is not adequately addressed through policies and programs in the
current General Plan. Annexation and new development, both commercial and
residential, is anticipated with expansion of the City's Sphere of Influence. The General
Plan update will include an update of all legally required General Plan Elements and preparation of two optional elements, including:

Land Use
Community Character and Design (optional)
Circulation
Safety
Parks, Recreation and Resource Conservation (includes required open space and
conservation policies and programs)
Noise
Municipal Facilities and Services (optional)
The MEIR will be prepared following completion of the draft General Plan update, which will follow the process in the table below. The MEIR will address environmental impacts of the updates to the draft General Plan as well as the development proposals
summarized below.

Notice of Preparation, April 5, 2007 City of Colusa General Plan Masfer EIR

City of Colusa General Plan Update Process

Remaining Steps Following a series of community workshops and meetings already in Update Process held by the Planning Commission and City Council, the General Plan update will be accomplished in the steps below.

Step 1: The draft General Plan will include proposed goals, policies, and
Prepare Draft implementing actions. The draft MEIR will evaluate the
General Plan & environmental effects of implementing the draft General Plan.
MEIR
Step 2: The draft General Plan and draft MEIR will be distributed through
Conducting
Public Review the State Clearinghouse, to local agencies, and made available for
& Adopting the public review. A General Plan Implementation Program will be prepared and presented to the public and City Council during the
Plan public review period that outlines programs, responsible parties and timing for implementation. At the close of the public circulation period, a public hearing will be scheduled on the draft General Plan and draft MEIR before the Planning Commission and City Council.

Step 3: Once the General Plan is adopted, the task of implementing the
Implementing Plan begins. General Plan implementation will require amendments
the Plan to existing zoning and other land use regulations (e.g., subdivision
ordinance). New regulations, guidelines and programs may also be proposed. All of these will be carried out under separate public
processes.

B. Purpose and Intent

The purpose and intent of the Colusa General Plan update is to address changes in the
City of Colusa since the last General Plan update in 1994. It is also to plan for substantial new residential and commercial development anticipated by the City. The following sub- sections provide summary descriptions of key issues that have emerged since the adoption of the 1994 General Plan. Each description includes highlights of the General Plan update, including new planning concepts that will be incorporated into the Plan.
Key issues are discussed below for the following City elements: Downtown/Riverfront Area; Traffic/Circulation; Community Character; and Special Planning Areas, including
New Growth Areas, and Sphere of Influence expansion. The broadest changes are seen in the Special Planning Areas, which reflect several proposed changes to land use within the Sphere of Influence.
A description of key goals, policies, and implementing actions for each General Plan Element is provided in Section IV: General Plan Goals, Policies, and Implementing Actions, of this NOP.

Notice of Preparation, April 5, 2007 City of Coiusa General Plan Master EIR

i. Downtown/Riverfront Area

The Downtown/Riverfront area is the geographic and commercial center of Colusa. The General Plan update will include a Community Character and Design Element that will establish a design review process and direction for community design guidelines to ensure new development is compatible with the existing traditional community character, while ensuring that it does not diminish the City's economic viability.
The General Plan update will propose two changes to the downtown/riverfront areas.
First is the preparation of a Riverfront Specific Plan, generally characterized by vertically or horizontally integrated retail, office, professional and residential uses for residents and visitors. The second change involves the designation of proposed Mixed Use land use districts, as shown in Figure 3. These mixed use districts would be characterized by vertically and/or horizontally integrated mix of retail, office, professional, and service uses, with retail uses dominating. Examples of uses would include residential over retail,
banks, theaters, neighborhood markets, restaurants, and public offices.

i. Traffic/Circulation

Providing a safe and efficient transportation network is essential to the movement of people and goods within the planning area of the City. In particular, the City has identified a need for traffic improvements along SR 20/45 and SR 20 leading into the City. Substantial residential and commercial development proposed on the east, west,
and south sides of town would require traffic improvements.

Another circulation need identified by the City is a comprehensive bicycle path system. The General Plan update will include policies on bicycle paths as well as pedestrian paths in and around the City. The Circulation Element will include policy approaches to addressing current and future circulation issues.

ili. Community Character

Colusa's traditional downtown core, its proximity to the Sacramento River, and its historic architecture contribute positively to Colusa's image and form. In the General Plan update these characteristics will serve as the basis for policies to preserve and
enhance natural and human-made features of the City. Design goals, policies, and implementing actions in the Community Character and Design Element will be especially important in addressing design issues related to the proposed commercial and residential development described below.

iv. Special Planning Areas

The General Plan update will identify goals, policies and implementing actions to guide development within six Special Planning Areas (SPAs) in the Sphere of Influence. These SPAs are recognized as unique planning areas that will provide substantial new growth and redevelopment opportunities for the City. At the same time, these areas present

4

Notice of Preparation, April 5, 2007 City of Coiusa General Plan Mastor EIR

challenges that will require a comprehensive planning approach. A map of the Special Planning Areas is included as Figure 3.
Specific proposed development projects (Special Planning Areas) are described below. The MEIR will include a program-level analysis of the impacts of all proposed land use at buildout, assuming buildout at mid-range densities. The MEIR will also include a project-level analysis of the following subsequent development projects; this analysis will discuss the projects as actually proposed, rather than at the mid-range density assumed for the program-level analysis. If and when these subsequent projects move forward through the development review process, subsequent focused environmental review will be required, tiering off the MEIR.

1. Colusa Riverbend

Colusa Riverbend is a 442-acre development project in the northeastern portion of the planning area. The project would convert land currently in agricultural use to
residential uses, parks and open space, and school facility, as described below. A Colusa Riverbend Specific Plan is currently being proposed that would include (in accordance with California Government Code §65450-65457), landscaping and design guidelines, development standards, and a financing plan that identifies funding for new infrastructure and public services.
The proposed Colusa Riverbend project Land Use Plan provides for a range of residential housing types at density ranging from six to ten dwelling units per
acre. Under the specific plan's buildout scenario, the project would add approximately 2,530 single-family, detached units to the City, in both currently incorporated and newly incorporated areas. The plan also includes an elementary school, parks, and open space land uses for the 442-acre area. City streets, storm drainage, water, and sewer facilities would be upgraded as needed prior to
development in order for the City to serve the new residents.

The development proposal will be analyzed at a project-level in the MEIR, to the extent feasible. The Specific Plan will be analyzed in a later environmental document, and the development proposal will be subject to later focused environmental review, when more details of the project proposal are available. The later focused environmental review will tier off this MEIR.

2. Colusa Crossings (Vann Property)
Colusa Crossings is a 310-acre project proposed for development outside the existing City limit, northwest of SR 20 and across from the Colusa County Fairgrounds. The project would convert land currently used for agriculture to the following land uses:

Note: The project proponent has not yet determined if 30 acres on the project site would be designated for low-density residential or park use. Figures in parentheses assume the
30 acres would be designated for low-density residential use.

3. Brookins Ranch

Brookins Ranch is 161-acre site proposed for development outside the existing City limit, south of Colusa High School and east of Will S. Green Avenue. The
site is currently used for agriculture (row crops) and contains a single-family residence and associated farm buildings. The project would convert the site to the following land uses:

Brookins Ranch

PROPOSED LAND Acres Proposed Maximum
USE Development Development Density
Low Density | 127.5 588 units 1,064 units (8
Residential units/acre)
Parks 11.5
Park/Detention
Greenways 17%
Open Space 5.5
Fire Station 1.5 588 units 1,064 units
Existing Residence 4.3
TOTAL 161.4

As reflected in the proposed General Plan Land Use Diagram (Figure 3), portions of the proposed developments fall outside the City limits but inside the Sphere of Influence. The MEIR will evaluate impacts of these developments on agriculture, public services, traffic and circulation, air quality, biological resources, schools, population growth,
infrastructure, and other areas as necessary.

6

Notice of Preparation, April 5, 2007 City of Cotusa General Plan Master EIR

v. Sphere of Influence Expansion

The General Plan update includes expansion of the existing Sphere of Influence from approximately 2,842 acres to approximately 3,876 acres (Figure 1). The Sphere of Influence expansion would require approval by the Colusa County Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO). According to Colusa County LAFCO policies, the following four factors are reviewed in consideration of a City's proposed Sphere of Influence:

1. The present and planned land use in the area, including agricultural and open-
space lands;
2. The present and probable need for public facilities and services in the area;
3. The present capacity of public facilities and adequacy of public services provided by the agency; and
4. Any social or economic communities of interest in the area that the Commission determines are relevant to the agency.

II. PROJECT LOCATION AND SETTING

The City of Colusa is a city of approximately 1,174 acres, located on a generally flat, agricultural plain. The Sacramento River forms the natural northern border of the City, while levees along the river provides the City with flood protection. The City is located approximately 60 miles north of Sacramento, and approximately six miles east of Interstate 5.

The City of Colusa is home to just over 5,500 residents and hosts a variety of industrial and commercial land uses, as well as many different types of housing developments. The Historic Downtown acts as a hub for commercial activity and provides many historical
resources, such as commercial buildings and residences. Figure 2 depicts current land
uses in the City.

The setting of Colusa reflects a rural community that prides itself on its relatively quiet character and tranquil quality of life. Lining the streets throughout the City are several thousand trees. The City has an abundance of recreation activities, the most prominent being hunting and fishing on and around the Sacramento River. Located within the City
are several parks, which provide open space, recreation, and social opportunities. The City also supports vast agricultural lands that surround its borders. Just north of the City is the Colusa Casino, which acts as a major source of employment, entertainment, and a
draw for out-of-town visitors. The City anticipates future development to occur in
various areas within and outside its borders.

III. PROJECT DESCRIPTION

A. Proposed Land Use Designations
A variety of new land use designations are proposed for the General Plan update. The City's current General Plan Land Use Diagram is shown in Figure 2. New definitions for the Land Use designations on the Land Use Diagram are also proposed. The most significant new designation and definition is for Mixed-Use (MU), which is generally defined as the complementary integration of commercial, residential, and professional land uses; and Urban Reserve (UR), which are areas outside the urban service area in which future development and extension of municipal services are contemplated but not
imminent.

i. Residential Land Use Designations

The General Plan update will also include new definitions for Estate, Low Density, Medium Density, and High Density Residential, which may be further refined as the General Plan is drafted. The new definitions are as follows:

1. Estate Residential (ER). Large-lot residential development that provides for small-scale agriculture and livestock. Density range is 1-3 units per acre.
2. Low-Density Residential (LDR). Single-family, detached dwelling units on lots of sufficient size for private recreation activities. Density range is 4-8
units per acre.
3. Medium-Density Residential (MDR). Detached or attached residential units that would promote home ownership affordable to lower- and middle-income households. Density range is 9-12 units per acre.
4. High-Density Residential (HDR). Typically characterized by garden apartments, condominiums, and residential-over-retail in mixed-use areas that are affordable to a range of income levels. Density range is 13-20 is units per acre.
Land use designations under the Colusa County Airport over-flight zone shall be governed by the Airport Land Use policies under the Airport Land Use Plan.
ii. Mixed Use Land Use Designations
As reflected on the preliminary Land Use Diagram (Figure 3), the General Plan update will include a "Mixed Use" designation. Four definitions of mixed-use are proposed in the General Plan update to reflect the Mixed Use priorities for each area. Development within each mixed-use area would be tailored to their respective locales, generally providing for a pedestrian-oriented live/work/play package, where the business community, residents, and visitors mingle in a 24/7 environment, walking from offices to restaurants to shops to home. The proposed Mixed Use descriptions are as follows:

11

Notice of Preparation, April 5, 2007 City of Colusa Genoral Pian Master EIR

1. Main Street Mixed Use District - Preservation of historic features, building design, streetscape design, signage, and the use of creative parking strategies (and less restrictive parking requirements) would be integral components of development in this area along Main Street. Generally characterized by vertically or horizontally integrated retail, office, professional and residential uses for residents and visitors to downtown Colusa such as:

Restaurants and hotels
Specialty markets and retail shops
Services
Visitors Center and gateway to Riverwalk Promenade
Public park, amphitheatre Residential over first-floor retail or stand-alone loft-style
apartments/condominiums
2. Downtown Commercial Mixed Use District - South of the Riverfront District
to Oak Street, generally characterized by a vertically and/or horizontally integrated mix of retail, office, professional, and service uses that serve daily shopping needs. Retail uses will generally predominate. Uses could include:

Neighborhood Market
Neighborhood drug store
Banks
Restaurants
Clothing stores Services (e.g., hair salon, barber, florist, pet store, etc.)
Theatre
Dentists, doctor, legal, accountant offices
Public offices
High-density and condominiums (ownership), as residential-over-retail
3. Bridge Street Mixed Use District - Along the east side of town (south of Oak Street), generally characterized by transit-oriented development that provides a
horizontally integrated mix of retail, professional, and service uses that are directed toward area residents and travelers along Bridge Street. Suggested uses
include:

Shopping centers
Dentists, doctor, legal, accountant offices
Medium Density and High Density
Child care/preschools
Family restaurants and fast food Small-scale neighborhood markets & bakeries

4. Residential Mixed Use District South of Oak Street, generally characterized by a vertically integrated mix of residential, retail, professional and service uses.

12

Notice of Preparation, April 5, 2007 City of Colusa General Plan Master EIR

Residential uses will predominate and be built at low-to-medium densities.
Suggested used include:
Single-family homes
Low-to-medium density multi-family units
Parks and Community Center
Child care/pre-schools Small-scale businesses, schools & services complementary to residential
neighborhoods
For purposes of the MEIR analysis, the assumption for all mixed-use definitions above is that there will be 500 square feet of residential development for every
1,000 square feet of non-residential development.

iii. Non-Residential Land Use Designations

1. Commercial Professional (CP) - This designation includes mini-storage, hotels/motels, building materials sales, veterinarians, auto dealers and automotive services, and professional offices. Lands classified Commercial
should be within or contiguous to developed areas; should be served by the publicly maintained circulation network and should be situated in locations where future growth is anticipated.

2. Parks/Recreation/Open Space (P/OS) - This designation includes lands suitable for park development, which can be integrated into Commercial or Residential areas, and provide indoor and outdoor recreation opportunities for Colusa residents and visitors. This designation is also intended to apply to open space lands, which include lands not suited for development or to lands
most valuable in their undeveloped natural state.

3. Public Facility (PF) This designation is intended to be applied to land in public ownership not appropriately included in some other classification. The designation is also intended to be applied to lands held and managed for public recreation or appropriate for acquisition for public purposes.
4. Office Professional/Light Industrial (OP/LI) - This designation includes an integrated mix of professional offices with light industrial uses. Office
Professional includes medical, legal, financial and other professional and administrative offices and services. Small, accessory-level commercial uses that support the principal office use are allowed, such as day care operations and small cafeterias. Light Industrial uses include research and development facilities, and less intensive warehousing, manufacturing, fabrication, assembly and distribution of consumer goods or other uses which do not create excessive noise, smoke, odors, or other objectionable nuisances to adjacent non-industrial zoned areas. Commercial uses in light industrial area should be incidental to the primary use.

13

Notice of Preparation, April 5, 2007 City of Colusa General Plan Master EIR

5. Industrial (IND) - This designation is intended to be applied to lands suited for major industrial uses, where necessary services such as transportation systems and utilities exist or can be efficiently provided, where disruption of proximate uses will be least, and where the potential for environmental disruptions are minimal or can be adequately controlled and mitigated.
iv. Urban Reserve (UR) Land Use Designation
The Urban Reserve land use district is proposed for three areas of the City, as follows: 1) on the east side of the City, south of Moon Bend Road, 2) in the southern portion of the City south Walnut Ranch on both sides of Wescott Road, and 3) west of the 14th Street, north of Wilson Avenue.

The UR designation identifies areas outside of the urban service area in the
unincorporated County area, but within the Sphere of Influence (SOI) of the City, in which future development and extension of municipal services are contemplated but not
imminent. By identifying land within the SOI suitable for future development, the UR district also serves as a "special interest area": proposals for development within this area will be subject to joint review by both the County and City.
Until such time that the UR land is pre-zoned and annexed by the City, the intent is for
UR land to develop with land uses at the densities/intensities specified in Colusa
County's General Plan and Zoning Ordinance.

IV. GENERAL PLAN GOALS, POLICIES, AND IMPLEMENTING ACTIONS

The intent of the following goals, policies, and implementation summaries is to provide an overview of these components, which will be included in the General Plan update. The summaries provide only a sampling of what will appear in the General Plan update. Detailed goals, policies, and implementations measures related to each of the Elements will be published in a public review draft of the General Plan update that will undergo scrutiny by the Planning Commission, City Council, and the community at publicly- noticed meetings.
The General Plan update will include goals, policies, and implementing actions for the seven elements below. The City is facing a substantial amount of new residential and commercial growth with several developers proposing large housing and commercial development. Consequently, the General Plan update will include policies that promote comprehensive, logical land use planning that ensures adequate public facilities and
infrastructure. It will also include funding programs such as fee schedules, grant applications, and other fiscal measures to provide adequate funding for City services. The General Plan update will promote a strong sense of community identity that preserves Colusa's unique community features and tranquil quality of life.

14

Notice of Preparation, April 5, 2007
City of Colusa General Pian Master EIR

A. General Plan Elements

i. Land Use

The Land Use Element will include a variety of goals, policies, and implementing actions regarding residential, commercial, industrial and public land uses. In broad terms, goals will focus on preserving and enhancing Colusa's quality of life and hometown character, including the downtown and riverfront areas, historic neighborhoods, and the key commercial/residential gateways into the community - SR 20 and SR 20/45. Policies will ensure Residential and Commercial improvements are sensitive to their surroundings with respect to size, scale, scope, context, and compatibility. A key implementing action will be the updating of the City's Zoning Ordinance to reflect new City priorities.

ii. Circulation

Goals, policies, and implementing actions in the Circulation Element will focus on building and maintaining a safe and efficient local street and highway system. Among other issues, the Circulation Element will include policies to improve pedestrian access on Highway 20 as it transitions into town, and policies to improve traffic circulation and pedestrian safety at the intersection of Wescott Road and SR 20/45. Implementing actions will include maintaining a reasonable Level of Service (LOS); the assessment of development impact fees for street construction, repair, and maintenance; and working with Caltrans to resolve traffic circulation issues at the above intersections.

iii. Safety

Police Department goals, policies, and implementing actions will focus on maintaining a professional law enforcement agency that strives to proactively prevent crime; control crime that cannot be prevented; and provide an enhanced sense of security in Colusa. Policies will focus on community outreach and education, land use decisions that facilitate surveillance from public places, and providing an adequate level of funding to support the law enforcement division. Implementing actions will include developing a City emergency plan; ensuring new development is designed to permit visual access from public streets and rights of way; and promoting safety and security through public
education programs.

Similarly, Fire Department goals, policies, and implementing actions will aim to protect against the loss of life, property, and the environment by appropriate education, prevention, and suppression measures. Policies will focus on fire prevention programs and standards, linking the construction of new fire stations to new development as necessary, and monitoring Fire Department service levels to ensure the City maintains an adequate Insurance Service Organization (ISO) rating. Implementing actions will include requirements for non-combustible roofs; ensuring adequate water pressure and peak load storage capacity for fire emergencies; and access requirements for emergency vehicles.

15

Notice of Preparation, April 5, 2007 City of Colusa General Plan Master EIR

The General Plan update will also provide goals, policies, and implementation programs
for seismicity. Policies will include construction standards that meet the Uniform
Building Code, including requirements for seismic design, and required geotechnical study where hazards from soil subsidence may exist. Implementing actions will include project and site modifications to site-specific hazards and conditions where and when present; design features that reduce potential impacts from geologic hazards; and develop and periodically update City maps and information on seismic and landslide hazards for use in evaluating development proposals.

iv. Municipal Facilities and Services Element
The Municipal Facilities and Services Element will include goals, policies, and implementing actions that focus on maintaining sufficient service and treatment capacities for water, wastewater, and storm drainage. Additional goals and policies will address maintaining structurally and spatially adequate schools, public safety buildings, City offices, and recreation structures. Implementing actions will include maintaining and upgrading current and future facilities with development impact fees, utility fees, assessment districts, grants, and other funding mechanism; and adopting a capital
improvement program (CIP).

v. Noise

The Noise Element will include goals, policies, and implementing actions that aim to protect noise-sensitive land uses from new noise-generating uses that would be incompatible with such sensitive receptors. Policies will address issues of noise impacts on sensitive receptors, minimizing noise impacts of air flight paths over the City, and reducing noise impacts from construction activities. Implementing actions will require noise studies for certain projects, including developments along SR 20 and SR 20/45; evaluate new developments based upon new noise standards adopted in the General Plan; and may require updates of the City's Noise Ordinance.

vi. Community Character and Design

Goals, policies, and implementing actions in the Community Character and Design Element will identify design guidelines and standards for new development and redevelopment. These components will be based upon characteristics of existing structures, natural landforms, entryways, community landmarks, and streets and streetscapes. Policies will focus on subjects, such as environmental design, residential housing, commercial development, mixed-use development, lighting and signage, rehabilitation and remodeling, and special districts (downtown, riverfront, SR 20 corridor, SR 20/45 corridor, etc.). Implementing actions will include establishing of a variety of environmental, commercial, and residential design criteria.

16

Notice of Preparation, April 5, 2007
City of Colusa General Pian Master EIR

vii. Parks, Recreation and Resource Conservation

The Parks, Recreation and Resource Conservation will focus on goals, policies, and
implementing actions to preserve, protect, and enhance an interconnected system of significant open spaces, including sensitive local resource areas, i.e., wetlands, agricultural lands, and lands adjacent to the Sacramento River. Policies will explore natural habitat protection, park dedication and development standards, and greenbelts/bikeways. Implementing actions will include maintaining open space areas in their natural state; promoting conservation in areas containing important habitat, wetlands and any special-status species; and developing partnerships for funding purposes with other local jurisdictions and agencies to further the goals of environmental enhancement.
The General Plan update will also propose Quimby Act standards (five acres per 1,000 residents) that govern the ultimate size of proposed parks, and any others proposed in the future. Under the Quimby Act, new development is required to provide land for parks. Development impact fees are used for maintenance and improvement of parklands. The General Plan will provide for "mini-parks" which typically range from 2,500 square feet to two acres and service a "sub-neighborhood" area; "neighborhood" parks which are generally 5 to 10 acres that provide scenic, aesthetic and recreational value within neighborhoods; and "community" parks, which usually fall within the range of 20 to 50
acres, with full public access intended to provide recreation opportunities beyond those
supplied by neighborhood parks.

V. ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENT TO BE PREPARED

CEQA permits preparation of a single, comprehensive document called a Master Environmental Impact Report (MEIR). A MEIR is intended to streamline the CEQA process by allowing for an environmental document that will evaluate cumulative, growth-inducing, and irreversible significant environmental effects of subsequent projects to the greatest extent possible. Preparation of a MEIR also reduces the environmental review of subsequent projects to the extent that their impacts were
evaluated in the MEIR. Figure 4 graphically displays the MEIR process.
The CEQA Guidelines identify severa types of EIRs, each applicable to different project circumstances. As discussed below, a program EIR is appropriate for land use decision- making at broad level that contemplates further, site-specific review of individual development proposals. A project EIR is appropriate for a specific proposed project that will not require additional site-specific environmental review. However, note that in a MEIR, a subsequent Initial Study is required, and additional environmental review may be necessary if a project studied in a MEIR substantially changes or is not completed within five years of adopting the study. This MEIR includes program-level analyses of the General Plan update, as well as project-level analyses of the specific development proposals for the Colusa Riverbend, Colusa Crossings, and Brookins Ranch projects.

City of Colusa General Pian Master EIR

A. Program-level Analysis

The MEIR will include a program-level EIR analysis for the General Plan update. The analysis will evaluate the broad environmental impacts associated with long-term implementation of the General Plan update, and will allow the City to consider broad policy alternatives and programmatic mitigation measures.

B. Project-level Analysis
The MEIR will include project-level EIR analyses for the Colusa Riverbend, Colusa Crossings, and Brookins Ranch projects. The concept plans for these projects contain enough specificity to conduct site-specific, project-level environmental review and identify project-specific mitigation measures.

VI. ENVIRONMENTAL TOPICS TO BE ADDRESSED IN THE MEIR

The MEIR will evaluate and address environmental impacts on lands within the City limits as well as lands currently proposed as part of the City's Sphere of Influence (the "plan area"). Based on a preliminary review, the City anticipates evaluating the
following topics in the MEIR:

A. Visual Resources

Buildout of the plan area would result in additional growth of urban uses along the outer portions of the plan area, altering the visual character from rural and agricultural to urbanized. Additionally, potential visual impacts from plan area buildout could result from the placement of new lighting for streets, parking, businesses and residences, which could affect nighttime views in the project vicinity. The construction of additional structures and infrastructure could also result in an increase in glare from reflective surfaces used in construction. Implementation measures in the Community Character and Design Element that would reduce impacts to visual resources will be identified, and additional mitigation measures for these impacts will be formulated as appropriate.

B. Agricultural Resources
The General Plan update proposes to extend the City's Sphere of Influence to include an additional 2,300 acres. The new General Plan would provide land use designations for lands anticipated to develop over the next 15 to 20 years. The MEIR will include an analysis of the environmental impacts of development in three proposed
residential/mixed-use developments. The MEIR will also analyze the impact of converting farmland to non-agricultural use. The General Plan will be reviewed for compatibility between agricultural and urban uses, including potential problems due to the possible generation of periods of dust and noise, or application of pesticides or herbicides through aerial spraying or other means. Mitigation measures for these impacts
will be identified as appropriate.

19

Notice of Preparation, April 5, 2007
City of Colusa General Plan Master EIR

C. Air Quality

Based on an air quality impact assessment prepared by a qualified expert, the MEIR will address individual and cumulative effects upon local and regional air quality. This analysis will include impacts created by vehicles and proposed land uses, as well as impacts associated with construction activities that could create dust impacts to residential areas in the vicinity. The potential for emissions to exceed the thresholds of the Colusa County Air Pollution Control District will also be evaluated through computer modeling. Mitigation measures for air quality impacts will be identified as appropriate.
D. Biological Resources
The proximity of the City of Colusa to the Sacramento River encourages waterfowl and raptor nesting in the area. The Colusa National Wildlife Refuge is located south of the City, and the City itself includes many mature trees. The MEIR will include an analysis of the consistency of buildout of the plan area with federal, State, and local polices and regulations protecting special status or sensitive species and habitat areas, and will assess buildout impacts related to identified biological resources. Mitigation measures for impacts to biological resources will be identified as appropriate.

E. Community Services

Buildout of the plan area could have an impact on service ratios or performance ratios for
community services, including fire protection, police protection, and parks. Changes compared to current conditions will be assessed, and additional demand determined. Mitigation measures will be incorporated as appropriate.
Public education services in the City of Colusa are provided by Colusa Unified School District. The MEIR will discuss student generation rates, mandatory impact fees required by current state law (SB 50 and Proposition 1A), and recent provisions of the State of California Education Code permitting children to attend schools near their parents' workplaces. Mitigation measures related to school impacts will be incorporated as
appropriate.

F. Recreation

In addition to impacts to parks, the MEIR will consider impacts related to existing and planned recreational resources. Changes compared to current conditions will be assessed, and additional demand determined. Mitigation measures will be incorporated as
appropriate.
G. Energy and Mineral Resources

In the past, sand and gravel resources have been extracted in City of Colusa. The MEIR
will consider potential impacts to mining resources and incorporate mitigation measures
as appropriate. Additionally, the MEIR will consider potential impacts of buildout of the
plan area on energy resources.

Notice of Preparation, April 5, 2007 City of Colusa General Plan Master EIR

H. Geology and Soils

Based on a report prepared a by a qualified geotechnical engineer, the MEIR will evaluate potential impacts and hazards due to existing geologic and soils conditions. The analysis will focus on the potential for liquefaction, response to ground shaking, erosion potential, and the presence of expansive or compressible soils, with mitigation measures identified
as appropriate.

I. Hazards and Hazardous Materials:

The potential presence of on-site and area hazards will be researched, including a database search and consultation with the Colusa Fire Department, to identify hazardous waste sites within the plan area. Mitigation measures will be identified as appropriate.
J. Historic and Cultural Resources

The City of Colusa contains known historic resources. The MEIR will include a
discussion of the prehistory and history of the plan area and the general area surrounding it. The MEIR will incorporate archaeological data to aid in planning future development in the plan area. In addition, archaeological review protocols will be recommended to facilitate environmental review of projects in the plan area. Mitigation measures will be identified as appropriate.
K. Hydrology and Water Quality
According to FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Map Panels, 535, 550, 555, and 575 covering Colusa County, California and Incorporated Areas (Effective Date: May 15, 2003),
significant areas contiguous to the City of Colusa and within the City's planning area are
located within the 100-year floodplain under federal regulatory authority.
Based on a report prepared by a qualified hydrologist, the potential hydrology and drainage impacts associated with buildout of the plan area will be addressed. The discussion of water quality will address potential impacts resulting from buildout of the plan area during both construction and implementation. Impacts and mitigation measures will be based upon the best available information, and to the extent necessary, descriptions will be provided to define issues that will require subsequent, focused technical review prior to development in certain flood-prone portions of the City's planning area.

L. Land Use

The MEIR will evaluate the consistency of the buildout scenario in terms of its
compatibility with surrounding land uses (including appropriateness of density) and potential future adjacent uses. Particular attention will be given to potential agricultural/urban interface impacts and appropriate mitigation strategies to minimize conflicts. Mitigation for potential land uses impacts will rely primarily upon General Plan policies and programs, but other mitigation measures will be recommended where
appropriate.

21

G
Notice of Preparation, Aprdl 5, 2007
City of Colusa General Pian Master EIR

M. Noise

Based on a report prepared by a qualified acoustical engineer, the MEIR will evaluate the potential noise impacts of buildout of the plan area. The MEIR will determine if the General Plan maximum interior and exterior noise levels can be met for residential and
commercial uses constructed in the plan area. In addition, buildout will increase noise
levels in the area, in the short term due to construction activities, and more generally from intermittent aircraft activity, and additional traffic and commercial uses. Based on the recommendations of the noise report, the MEIR will identify noise mitigation measures as appropriate.
N. Population/Housing/Employment
The region is experiencing growth pressures and has a substantial demand for affordable and employee housing for area residents. Socioeconomic impacts of buildout of the plan area, such as increases in the total City population, housing stock and employment opportunities, will be analyzed. Impacts will be assessed in terms of the General Plan's ability to provide an adequate jobs/housing balance and meet the City's affordable
housing goals for new development.

O. Public Services and Utilities

Buildout of the plan area will require the installation of infrastructure to serve the plan
area, including water supply, wastewater collection and treatment, and solid waste
disposal service.

The City of Colusa operates a domestic water delivery system through their Public Works Department. The City has five groundwater wells, with a total capacity of 7.78 million gallons per day (MGD). Water storage is contained in two elevated storage tanks, each
a with a capacity of 250,000 gallons.
Buildout of the plan area may require a significant expansion of water facilities. The recent passage of Senate Bill 610 (SB 610) requires specific evaluations by the local water provider assessing whether water is available for large projects. SB 610 augments the CEQA process to help establish water availability. As required by CEQA, the City is
requesting a water demand assessment to determine the City's ability to deliver water to the proposed project and future users. The MEIR will identify water supply impacts, and propose mitigation measures for any significant impacts associated with the provision of water services, including those impacts to the environment resulting from upgrades to
water service infrastructure.

The City of Colusa operates a wastewater collection system, which provides sewer
service to properties located within the City limits and in some urbanized areas
contiguous to Colusa's City limits. The MEIR will identify impacts in terms of wastewater collection and propose mitigation measures for any significant impacts associated with the provision of sewer service, including those impacts to the environment resulting from upgrades to wastewater service infrastructure. Finally, any

22

Notice of Preparation, April 5, 2007 City of Colusa General Plan Master EIR

provisions proposed in the General Plan for recycling and solid waste reduction will be
addressed.

P. Transportation/Traffic
A qualified transportation engineer will create a traffic assignment model for the MEIR that includes the major streets in Colusa and addresses the locations of potential growth. Future traffic projections will be evaluated to determine the projected Level of Service on major roadways in the City. Projected Levels of Service will be compared to proposed City standards to determine the extent of roadway improvements needed to support anticipated development in the community. Future roadway improvements will be identified to ensure that study intersections and major roadways in the City will operate at
an acceptable Level of Service based on the future traffic projections.

0. CEQA-Mandated Discussions

In addition to the above environmental topic discussions, the MEIR will include the following discussions required by CEQA: cumulative impacts, effects found not to be significant, project alternatives, significant unavoidable impacts, significant irreversible
changes, and growth-inducing impacts.

Because the General Plan incorporates a 20-year planning horizon, the Plan's impacts
would be cumulative by nature; therefore, evaluation of many of the project impacts will constitute a cumulative impacts analysis. Cumulative impacts will be address separately
where region-wide effects may occur, such as air quality impacts to the Sacramento Valley Air Basin, and potential impacts to the region's groundwater supply.
Alternatives considered in the MEIR will be formulated based on conclusions made in the environmental analysis. Development of alternatives to be considered will respond directly to potentially significant impacts identified in the environmental analysis.

APPENDIX B - TRAFFIC ANALYSIS

COLUSA GENERAL PLAN UPDATE
TRAFFIC IMPACT ANALYSIS

EXISTING SETTING

Level of Service Thresholds / Standards

To describe current traffic conditions and put future traffic volumes into perspective existing traffic volumes and future forecasts were compared to Level of Service thresholds. "Level of Service
(LOS)" is a qualitative measure of traffic operating conditions whereby a letter grade, "A" through "F", corresponding to progressively worsening traffic operating conditions, is assigned to an intersection or roadway segment.
The General Plan speaks to minimum Level of Service as follows:

Implementing Action CIR-1.1.a: Streets and Roadways Master Plan

The City will prepare, adopt and periodically update a Streets and Roadways Master Plan that establishes LOS C as the minimum acceptable LOS for City streets and intersections. If conditions of LOS D or worse are already present, future proposed projects may not cause roadway volumes to increase by five percent or more and shall be accompanied by other
mitigation measures intended to reduce trip generation. LOS D is the minimum standard for
state highways.

Methodology - Intersection Level of Service. Level of Service can be calculated for different
types of facilities. Level of Service can be determined for highways and intersections, and published methodologies for determining Level of Service are predicated on hourly traffic volumes on these facilities. For this study, information regarding intersection Levels of Service has been developed using the procedures contained in the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM). Table presents the general characteristics of each level of service grade at intersections and on roadway
segments.

Methodology Levels of Service based on Daily Traffic Volumes. While assessment of peak hour conditions is standard, for planning level traffic studies it is also beneficial to describe Levels
of Service based on the average daily traffic volumes occurring on major city streets. Use of daily volumes permits relatively quick assessment of circulation system needs.

City of Colusa General Plan Update EIR
(March 13, 2007) Page .

Level of Service thresholds for streets and highways in Colusa were developed based on review of several sources. Because there is no uniform national standard to equate daily traffic volumes on urban streets to specific Levels of Service, the City of Colusa General Plan EIR and its background references and Caltrans guidelines were considered. We found that Caltrans has no
recommendations in this area, and that general thresholds originally developed by the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) are most applicable. The Level of Service thresholds developed by FDOT have been used by many California agencies.
Level of Service thresholds were developed in a manner that accounted for the presence of features that affect urban traffic flow. These thresholds account for the effects of traffic signals on overall traffic flow, as well as signal spacing. The FDOT guidelines suggest that the presence of a raised median could increase Level of Service thresholds by about 5%. However, while the presence of wider shoulders and or bicycle lanes will promote overall safety, the general capacity of the street may not be affected by this extra width. Resulting LOS thresholds are presented in Table 2. These thresholds are employed to identify the number of through travel lanes that would typically be expected on each street.

Current Levels of Service

Levels of Service on Roadway Segments. Table 3 presents current daily traffic volumes and resulting Levels of Service on the streets and highways that serve Colusa. The classification of each street under the proposed Circulation Element is also noted.
Traffic count data for state highways is available from two sources. First, Annual Average Daily Traffic Volumes (AADT) were reported by Caltrans for the year 2025. Second, traffic counts
conducted for this study in October 2005 are also presented. Comparison of this data reveals that these counts are appreciable different through downtown Colusa. Caltrans AADT are in the range of 20,000 to 25,000 on Market Street, while counts conducted for this study were in the range of 9,000 to 10,000 vehicles per day in the same locations. However, Caltrans AADT and new counts are similar at locations on the edge of Colusa. Based on review of p.m. peak hour data at these locations it is believed that the spot counts conducted for this study provide a more accurate representation of current traffic conditions.

City of Colusa General Plan Update EIR (March 13, 2007) Page 3

As shown, based on the new counts conducted for this study, all streets currently carry volumes that are indicative of LOS C or better conditions, with the exception of Bridge Street (SR 20) between Carson Street and Fremont Street, which operates at LOS D. This data suggests
satisfactory operations under GP policy.
However, Caltrans AADT are higher in some instances and are indicative of Levels of Service that are worse. Caltrans data suggests that SR 20 (Bridge Street) operates at LOS F from Market Street to Moonbend Road.

Levels of Service at Intersections. This analysis focuses on conditions occurring during the evening peak traffic hour. This time periods was selected as it represents the "worst case" period with regard to residential trip generation and background traffic on city streets.

Current p.m. peak hour Levels of Service at key intersections in Colusa are presented in Table 4.
These values are based on intersection traffic counts made in October 2005 between 4:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. At signalized intersections and at locations controlled by all-way stops, these
values represent the average condition for all motorists passing through the intersection. At intersections controlled by side street stop signs, the values present are representative of the delays occurred by motorists waiting to turn onto the main street (i.e. "worst case").

As shown, the poorest Levels of Service today occur at the SR 20 / Wescott Road intersection. During the p.m. peak hour motorists waiting to turn onto SR 20 experience delays that are indicative of LOS F conditions. The Level of Service at all other intersection is LOS C or better.

The extent to which any location is already a candidate for a traffic a signal was also evaluated using the peak hour volume warrants established by Caltrans. These warrants can consider both
urban and rural (high speed) conditions. Assuming that the higher volume urban warrants are applicable within Colusa, none of the intersections satisfies warrants.

IMPACTS OF IMPLEMENTING THE COLUSA GENERAL PLAN

The impacts of implementing the updated Colusa General Plan have been identified by estimating the amount of vehicular traffic associated with the new land uses that are possible with General Plan buildout and superimposing that traffic onto the circulation system network identified in the General Plan circulation diagram. Resulting Levels of Service were then compared to the minimum standards contained in the General Plan.

Circulation Diagram

The General Plan circulation diagram identifies several new streets which will carry traffic through the community and provide access to new growth areas.

Farinon-Railroad Collector. New development in southern Colusa will create the need for a collector street that provides access to SR 20. The General Plan Circulation diagram indicates that the Farinon Road - Railroad Collector will generally follow the alignment of the abandon railroad right of way from an intersection on SR 20 west of Wil S Green Street to Westcott Road. The eastern portion of the route will follow Farinon Avenue as it links Westcott Road and SR 20
in eastern Colusa. The intent of the General Plan is to provide access to new development while avoiding creation of a "bypass" that would divert through traffic away from downtown Colusa.

East Side Collector. New development east of SR 20 will be served by a new collector that will
extend north from the SR 20 / Sunrise Ave intersection to the extension of Market Street.

Wil S Green Street extension. West side development will be served by creating a collector that links Wilson Avenue with SR 20 at the Wil S Green intersection.
3rd Street, 5th Street and gth Street Extensions. The existing downtown grid street system will be extended south into new growth areas.
Colus Avenue Extension. Colus Avenue will be extended easterly from Wil S Green Street to 3rd Street

Tenant Drive. Tenant Drive will be extended westerly from Wescott Road to Wil S Green Street to serve new south Colusa development.

Land Use / Trip Generation Assumptions

The amount of new development anticipated under build out of the new Colusa General Plan has
been quantified for use in this analysis. To present a "worst case" assessment, these land use forecasts include development in "reserve" areas under current Colusa County designations.
As noted in Table 5, under "mid-range" assumptions for density implementing the General Plan could result in more than 7,000 new dwelling units in Colusa. Another 5.9 million square feet of non-residential development is also anticipated.

City of Colusa General Plan Update EIR Page :
(March 13, 2007)

The trip generation associated with new development has also been estimated. As shown, new residences could generate more than 67,000 new daily trips. Non-residential uses could generate
slightly fewer than 78,000 daily trips.

Total Non-Residential 77,773 6,216 8,951
Total Residential and Non-Residential 145,115 11,491 16,043

Trip Distribution Assumptions.

The trips generated by new development in Colusa will have origins / destinations both within the community and throughout the region. For example, a portion of the trips made to new commercial / professional uses will be made by new residents, while other trips will be made by existing residents and some trips will be external to Colusa.

Table 6 identifies the assumptions made to allocate new trips generated by residential and non-
residential uses as a precursor to local assignment onto Colusa streets. As noted, approximately 15% of the new residential generated trips will be external to Colusa. Approximately 19% of the trips generated by non-residential uses (excluding the Colusa Casino expansion), will be external. Because an appreciable portion of the trips will be "matched" between new uses, the
actual traffic increase will be less then the sum of raw trip generation. This approximates 96,000 new trips will be made on Colusa streets.

Having quantified the overall internal / external distribution of new trips generated by growth in Colusa, it is necessary to identify the directional distribution of external trips. This was accomplished by considering the relationship between Colusa and neighboring communities such as Williams and Yuba City, as well as the city's location in the region relative to the Interstate 5 corridor. Table 7 identifies the percentile directional distribution of external trips, exclusive of the trips generated by the Colusa Casino expansion.

Total 23,775 6% 4% 27% 1% 1% 1% 60%

Through Traffic Assumptions

Through traffic on SR 20 will continue to increase over the life of the Colusa General Plan as traffic between Interstate and SR 99 without origin or destination in Colusa can be expected to continue. Because no regional traffic model encompassing Colusa County is available, assumptions as to the magnitude of through traffic have been made based on consideration of the
volume of traffic occurring today on SR 20 west and west of the City. On a daily basis, the current "through" traffic volume can be no larger than the lowest volume occurring at the lowest volume locations east or west on the city.

City of Colusa General Plan Update EIR (March 13, 2007) Page

Today the lowest daily volume on SR 20 west of Colusa is 6,800 ADT at the SR 20 / Husted Road intersection east of Williams. East of Colusa, the lowest volume is 9,700 ADT just west of the eastern SR 45 junction. For this analysis it has been assumed that ½ of the volume observed west of Colusa is "through" traffic or 3,400 ADT.
The extent to which this through traffic will increase in the future can be estimated based on the continuation of general growth rates. Assuming a regional growth rate of 2.5% annually, through traffic could be expected to increase by 81% over the 24 years until the year 2030 horizon assumed in this study. This increase would represent another 2,750 ADT through Colusa.

Various routes are used by through traffic today, and these routes will be supplemented by the new Railroad Collector- Farinon Road Collector. This analysis assumes that ¼ of the traffic increase will use each of Market Street, Fremont Street, Sioc Street and the new collector, or approximately 700 ADT on each route.

Year 2030 Daily Traffic Volumes and Levels of Service

Table 8 identifies year 2030 daily traffic volumes on Colusa streets and presents resulting Levels of Service assuming implementation of the GP Circulation diagram but no improvements to
existing streets. Key impacts identified from this data are summarized in the text which follows.
Mitigation options that could be considered by the City of Colusa area also noted.

Impact 1: Traffic volumes on SR 20 result in Levels of Service in excess of minimum standards. The volume of traffic forecast for SR 20 through Colusa will exceed the LOS D threshold for a 2 lane arterial. Exceeding the City's LOS D threshold in these areas is a significant impact.

Strategies for mitigating this impact vary. While widening to a four lane facility should be possible in new growth areas, it would be difficult to provide a four lane section in the developed areas along the 10th Street corridor from Market Street south to the fairgrounds and on the Bridge Street corridor from Market Street south to Wescott Avenue.

In addition, the volume of traffic forecast on eastern SR 20 through the new commercial area will approach or exceed the LOS D threshold for a 4 lane facility. While creating a 6 lane section would theoretically deliver LOS D or better conditions, this level of improvement is not reasonable and this impact would better be mitigated by adding auxiliary turn lanes at major intersections. An SR 20 access management plan will be needed to confirm the land of important need.

Modifying the GPU Circulation Diagram to promote greater use of the planned Railroad Collector as an alternative to SR 20 through Colusa is a mitigation option that could be pursued in lieu of creating additional capacity along the current alignment. The "discontinuous" route intentionally incorporated into the plan could be replaced by a roadway that provided a more a direct connection between the east and west legs of SR 20. This change could reduce the volume of traffic at other locations on SR 20 through Colusa.

City of Colusa General Plan Update EIR Page 10 (March 13, 2007)

Mitigation Options:

1. 2. Widen SR 20 to 4 lanes on 10th Street, Market Street and Bridge Street Widen SR 20 to 6 lanes through the new eastern commercial area.
3. Modify the Railroad Collector alignment to draw more traffic away from SR 20
through Wheatland
4. Develop an access management plan for SR 20 that denotes the locations of
auxiliary lanes.

Impact 2: Traffic volumes on Fremont Street are indicative of LOS D conditions. The
volume of traffic expected on Fremont Street will exceed the LOS C threshold for a collector street. To deliver LOS C it would be necessary to prohibit on-street parking and stripe the street as a four lane facility. Alternatively development of additional east west capacity, such as through a modified railroad Collector or the extension of Sunrise Blvd west to Wescott Road
could reduce the volume on Fremont Street. Because both Fremont Street and Sioc Street are affected by future traffic, creation of a one-way couplet would increase the capacity of each street and deliver LOS C while retaining two lanes of travel and on-street parking on Fremont Street.

Mitigation Options:

~~i Widen Fremont Street to 4 lanes from 10th Street to Bridge Street
Modify the Circulation Diagram to promote other east-west routes such as Sunrise
Blvd and the Railroad Collector
3. Create a on-way couplet of Fremont Street and Sioc Street

Impact 3: Traffic volumes on Sioc Street are indicative of LOS F conditions. The
volume of traffic expected on Sioc Street will exceed the LOS C a threshold for a collector street. To deliver LOS C it would be necessary to prohibit on-street parking and stripe the street as a four lane facility. Alternatively, development of additional east - west capacity, such as through a modified railroad Collector or the extension of Sunrise Blvd west to Wescott Road could reduce the volume on Sioc Street. Because both Fremont Street and Sioc Street are both affected by future traffic, creation of a one-way couplet would increase the capacity of each street while retaining two lanes of travel and on-street parking on Fremont Street.

Mitigation Options:

1. Widen Sioc Street 1o 4 lanes from 4 10%h Street to Bridge Street 2. Modify the Circulation Diagram to promote other east-west routes such as Sunrise Blvd and the Railroad Collector
3. Create a on-way couplet of Fremont Street and Sioc Street

Impact 4: Traffic volumes on Colus Avenue between gth Street and Wil S Green Avenue are indicative of LOS D conditions. The volume of traffic expected on this segment of Colus Avenue will exceed the LOS C threshold for a collector street. To deliver LOS C it would be necessary to prohibit on-street parking and stripe the street with left turn lanes at major intersection. Alternatively, the volume on Colus Avenue could be reduced by development of additional east-west capacity elsewhere. Changing the alignment of the Railroad Collector or extending Sunrise Blvd to Wescott Road would incrementally alter travels patterns in this area.
1. Configure Colus Avenue without on-street parking and strip turn lanes 2. Modify the Circulation Diagram to promote other east-west routes such as Sunrise Blvd and the Railroad Collector

Page 15 City of Colusa General Plan Update EIR (March 13, 2007)

O

Impact 5: Traffic volumes on the Farinon Rd Extension between SR 20 and Westcott
Road are indicative of LOS D conditions. The volume of traffic expected on Farinon Road will exceed the LOS C threshold for a collector street. To deliver LOS C it would be necessary
to widen the roadway to 4 lanes. Alternatively, modifying the circulation plan to extend Sunrise Blvd west to Wescott Road could reduce the volume on Farinon Road to a level that may be accommodated by a collector street, although the effect on Wescott Road traffic is undetermined.

Mitigation Options:

1. 2. Widen Farinon Road to 4 lanes
Modify the GPU Circulation Diagram to promote other east-west streets, such
as Sunrise Blvd

Impact 6: Traffic Volumes on Wescott Road between the SR 20 intersection and Cynthia Avenue are indicative of LOS F conditions. The volume of traffic on the northern end of Westcott Road will exceed the LOS C threshold. To deliver LOS C it C would be necessary to acquire right of way and widen the roadway to 4 lanes. This level of improvement would, however, require appreciable right of way acquisition in an area of existing residences that front along Wescott Road. Alternatively, the GPU Circulation Diagram could be modified to minimize use of Wescott Road as a north-south collector. For example, extending Sunrise Blvd to Wescott Rd and prohibiting northbound traffic on Wescott Road at the Tenant Estates intersection would reduce the volume on the upper end of Westcott Road.

Mitigation Options:

1. 2. Widen Wescott Road to 4 lanes
Modify Circulation Diagram to reduce traffic volume on Wescott Road by extending Sunrise Blvd to Wescott Road and prohibiting northbound traffic on Wescott at Tenant Drive

Impact 7: Traffic Volumes on Wescott Road between Cynthia Avenue and the Railroad Collector are indicative of LOS D conditions. The D volume of traffic on the southern end of Westcott Road will exceed the LOS C threshold. To deliver LOS C it would be necessary to acquire right of way and improve the road to an Arterial standard.

Mitigation Options:

I. Re-designate Wescott Road as a 2 lane arterial street in this area and re-
construct accordingly.
2. Modify Circulation Diagram to reduce traffic volume on Wescott Road by extending Sunrise Blvd to Wescott Road and prohibiting northbound traffic on Wescott at Tenant Drive.

City of Colusa General Plan Update EIR Page 16

Impact 8: Traffic volumes on Wil S Green Ave are indicative of LOS F conditions in
the area between SR 20 and Colus Avenue and immediately north of SR 20. The volume of traffic on these portions of Wil S Green will exceed the LOS C threshold for 2 lane collectors. To deliver LOS C it will be necessary to add auxiliary lanes in the area between Colus Avenue and the SR 20 / Wil S Green Avenue intersection and on the northern leg of the intersection (i.e., separate right turn, through, and left turn lanes approaching SR 20). Alternatively, this portion of the road could be re-designated as a 4 lane arterial in the Circulation Element.
Mitigation Options:

1. Add Auxiliary lanes to the segments of Wil S Green Avenue north and south of SR 20.
2. Re-designate the portion of Wil S Green immediately north and south of SR 20 as a four lane arterial street.

Impact 9: Traffic volumes on SR 45 north of Market Street are indicative of LOS F. The projected volume on this state highway will exceed the LOS D threshold established by the General Plan. To deliver LOS D it would be necessary to widen the roadway to a four lane section.

Mitigation Options:

l. Re-designate SR 45 north of Market Street as a 4 lane arterial

Impact 10: Traffic volumes on SR 20 east and west of the Colusa sphere of influence are indicative of LOS F conditions. Regionally, development in Colusa will contribute to conditions in excess of the LOS D standard. Cumulating then will be the need to improve SR 20 to a four lane section from SR 99 to Interstate 5. While the inter-regional street system is not the sole responsibility of the City of Colusa, the City should investigate mechanisms for City development to participate on a "fair share" basis in the costs of maintaining and improving roads outside of the City limits. Colusa County and communities such as Williams and Yuba City need to work with Caltrans towards mechanism to address impacts to the state highway system. However, while a similar mechanism should be pursued by the City of Colusa, because no mechanism currently exists, this impact is considered significant and unavoidable.

Mitigation Option:

I. a Create a mechanism for development in Colusa to contribute on a "fair share" basis in the costs of improving inter-regional roads outside of the City limits

Impact 11: Traffic volumes on the East Collector are indicative of LOS D conditions.
The volume of traffic on the southern half of the new East Collector will exceed the LOS C
threshold. To deliver LOS C it would be necessary to designate this roadway as a 2 lane arterial and improve the road to arterial standards.

City of Colusa General Plan Update EIR Page 17
(March 13, 2007)

Mitigation Option:

l. Re-designate the East Collector as an arterial street and construct accordingly as development occurs.

Planning Issues

Two questions regarding the Colusa GPU Circulation Diagram were evaluated as part of the
DEIR traffic study:

l. How might north-south streets (i.e., 3rd Street, 5th Street, gth Street) best be extended from the downtown area into new growth areas? Does oth Street need to be extended
south of Colusa HS? and

2. What is the best alignment for the Railroad Collector - Farinon Avenue connection?
3rd Street, 5th Street, gth Street. Under the draft GPU Circulation diagram these three streets are to be extended southerly as collectors to link downtown Colusa with new growth areas. However, residents living along the developed portions of each street have questioned the desirability of adding new traffic on these routes, and development interests have asked whether it is necessary to extend each street to the Railroad Collector.
Forecast Traffic. The issues associated with these streets might best be considered within
the context of the volume using these routes. Individually each street today carries 800 to 1,800 vehicles per day but is expected to carry approximately 2,000 to 4,000 vehicles per day in the future. These forecasts assume that gth Street is extended from the High School to Tenant Drive. These volumes fall within the LOS A-B threshold for two lane collector streets (4,000 ADT).
Quality of Life Issues / Thresholds. However, while LOS A conditions suggest that collector streets will have the capacity to accommodate projected traffic volumes, it is important to note that residents living along such streets often perceive traffic impacts at volumes far below the actual capacity of the road itself. Complaints of noise, difficulty accessing local streets from driveways, and pedestrian conflicts are typical on residential streets with these volumes. As a result, many communities have adopted planning level thresholds for desirable volumes on local neighborhood streets with direct access. These thresholds range from 1,500 ADT (City of Merced) to 2,500 (Sacramento County). Comparison of these thresholds with projected volumes suggests that current residents of 3rd. and gth streets will perceive that traffic will impact their quality of life in the future. Based on this consideration it would not be surprising that current residents of all three streets would express concerns regarding the GPU circulation plan.
Collector Street Spacing. With regard to the extension of 3rd. 5th and gth through new growth areas, the Circulation diagram indicates that gth Street will extend beyond Tenant Drive
to the Railroad Collector, 5th street will terminate at Tenant Drive and 35G Street will continue
beyond Tenant Drive through the urban reserve to the Railroad collector. North of Tenant Drive gth Street and 3rd Street will be approximately 1,900 feet part, resulting in spacing between collector streets of approximately 1000°. ¼ mile spacing is common for new collector streets.

City of Colusa General Plan Update EIR
(March 13, 2007) Page 18

Diversion due to 8th Street Closure. The portion of 8th Street between Colus Avenue and Tenant Drive (i.e., south of the High School) is projected to carry approximately 600 vehicles per day, while 5th Street and gth Street will carry 1,650 and 850 vehicles per day, respectively in the same area. If this segment of gth Street is not constructed, most of the traffic using that route will
move to 5th Avenue (400 vehicles) and the balance will move to Wil S Green (200 vehicles). 3rd Street would be relatively unaffected by the closure. Assuming that the volume added to 5th Street continued to Sioc Street, the total volume on the existing portion of 5th Street could rise from the projected 3,000 ADT to a new total of 3,400 ADT, as compared to the current volume of 800 ADT. This higher volume would still remain within the LOS A/B threshold but would be incrementally higher than thresholds used for assessing local street "quality of life".
Alternatives / Mitigations Traffic Calming. Many communities consider traffic calming measures on local streets that are subject to speeding or high traffic volumes. However, these same communities typically reject such measures on collector streets which are intended to link neighborhoods and provide emergency access. Local streets with forecast traffic volumes of 2,000 to 4,000 ADT would normally be candidates for calming measures, but collector streets would not.

Traffic calming measures range from physical devices to slow traffic (i.e., undulations raised crosswalks), to intersection treatments (traffic circles, bulb outs) that reduce the width of the available travel way. These devices are typically effective in reducing average speeds by 2-3 mph and as a result may encourage motorists to use other available routes. However, emergency service providers typical object to physical barriers that increase response time on collector streets

Assessment / Conclusions. The primary reasons for extending 8th Street south of the high school would be to provide relief for the segment of Colus Avenue west of gth Street and to help provide connectivity with the balance of downtown. However, the north-south collector streets most affected by closing this portion of gth Street have the capacity to accommodate diverted traffic at a good Level of Service. Because of the volumes projected on Colus Avenue, the gth Street extension is recommended.

Railroad Collector / Farinon Road / Extension Alignment. As noted previously, the draft circulation diagram includes a new collector street that would provide access to southern development and link SR 20 west of Colusa with SR 20/45 on the east side of town. During initial hearings on the General Plan the key issue raised with regard to this roadway is the desire to avoid creating a "bypass" route that would drain through traffic from SR 20. Thus, the alignment of the proposed collector intentionally included a "jog" along Wescott Road that lengthened the route, increased travel time and could incrementally discourage through traffic.
The extent to which the proposed alignment is the best option for Colusa has been evaluated within the context of forecast traffic volumes and necessary traffic controls. As noted under the discussion of Impacts 5 and 7, the 5 volume of traffic on this route in the area of the Farinon Rd / Wescott Rd intersection will exceed the LOS threshold for collector streets. Thus, even with the planned "jog" in the road, the travel demand along this route eventually results in volumes that exceed the practical capacity of portions of the planned collector.

City of Colusa General Plan Update EIR Page 19 (March 13, 2007)

Measures to further reduce the attractiveness of the route might be considered. However, as noted under the discussion of Impacts 2, 3 and 4, the volume of traffic on other east-west streets across Colusa results in conditions in excess of LOS C on many routes. Thus, measures to reduce the volume of traffic on the Railroad Collector / Farinon Road route would likely have a detrimental effect on other streets.

Alternatively, modifications to the route to increase the use of the Railroad Collector - Farinon Route could be considered. Modifying the plan to create an arterial road while eliminating the Wescott Road jog" would likely result in higher volume of the route and increase the need for a four lane section. The incremental diversion to this improved route could result in LOS C conditions on Fremont Street and Colusa Avenue, but would unlikely be sufficient to deliver LOS C on Sioc Street.

Assessment / Conclusions. At full General Plan buildout, there will be a need for additional east-west capacity across southern Colusa beyond that provided under the draft circulation diagram. This might be achieved by modifying the planned Railroad Collector Farinon Road route to arterial standards and making the road more direct or by modifying the plan to extend Sunrise Blvd to Wescott Road.

2030 Intersection Levels of Service

Traffic Volumes and Levels of Service. Future p.m. peak hour traffic volumes were developed for study intersections in a manner that is similar to methodology employed to create daily traffic volumes. However, because the directionality of p.m. peak hour trips generated by residential and non-residential land uses may differ, inbound / outbound trips between these uses were balanced separately. Projected traffic volumes at study intersections are included in the LOS calculation worksheets in the appendix.
Table 9 presents p.m. peak hour Levels of Service at study intersections. These results assume that no improvements are made to existing intersections, except in the case of locations where new roadway extensions will be made. Where new roadways are added to intersections on SR
20, it is assumed that new mainline left turn and right turn lanes will be included.
As noted, Levels of Service in excess of the LOS C or D standard are projected at most study intersections, and most of these locations will carry traffic volumes that satisfy warrants for signalization. Specific impacts to study intersections are noted in the text which follows. While the Streets and Roadways Master Plan envisioned under GP CIRC.1.1a. will identify the level of improvement occurring at these locations over the life of the Master Plan, potential improvements that may deliver LOS C are noted.

Impact A: The intersection of SR 20 / Sunrise Blvd will operate / at LOS F. Projected conditions at this intersection will exceed the minimum LOS standard, and a traffic signal will be warranted. Based on the discussion of daily traffic volumes, mainline SR 20 will need to be widened to a four lane section through this intersection. Assuming separate left turn lanes on each approach, the intersection will operate at LOS C with signalization.

Impact B: The intersection of SR 20 Wescott Road will operate at LOS F. Projected conditions at this intersection will exceed the minimum LOS standard, and a traffic signal will be warranted. As noted in the discussion of daily traffic volumes, while a four lane SR 20 is desirable, it is unlikely that mainline SR 20 can be widened to a four lane section north of this intersection. It may be possible to widen the road to a create a northbound left urn lane and a separate southbound right turn lane (with overlap) on SR 20. Assuming separate left turn and right turn lanes on the Wescott Road approach, under this configuration the intersection will operate at LOS D with signalization. Alternatively, a roundabout intersection could be installed
at this location.

City of Colusa General Plan Update EIR
(March 13, 2007) Page 21

Impact C: The intersection of SR 20 / Sioc Street will operate at LOS F. Projected conditions at this intersection will exceed the minimum LOS standard. Based on the discussion
of daily traffic volumes, it is unlikely that mainline SR 20 can be widened to a four lane section through this intersection, and widening the intersection to provide auxiliary lanes may also be difficult without right of way acquisition. It may be that impacts to this intersection are significant and unavoidable.

Impact D: The Bridge Street (SR 20) / Market Street intersection will operate at LOS F. Projected conditions at this intersection will exceed the minimum LOS standard, and a traffic signal or roundabout will be warranted. Assuming that left turn lanes are provided on each approach and a separate right turn lane (with overlap) is provided on eastbound market Street, the intersection would operate at LOS C with a traffic signal. Alternatively, a roundabout intersection could be installed at this location.

Impact E: The Market Street / 5th Street intersection will operate at LOS D and traffic signal warrants will be met. Simply signalizing the existing intersection would yield LOS C.
Impact F: The Lurline Avenue/ 13th Street and 13th Street / Market Street intersections on SR 45 will operate at LOS E-F. Projected conditions at these intersections will exceed the minimum standard; however, traffic signal volume warrants are not met. These intersections are
closely a spaced, and as a result mitigations would need to be considered jointly. Because of their proximity, it may eventually be necessary to prohibit northbound left turns from 13th Street and to signalize the Lurline Avenue intersection.

Impact G: The 10th Street / Market Street intersection will operate at LOS F. Projected conditions at this intersection will exceed the minimum LOS standard, and a traffic signal or roundabout will be warranted. The City of Colusa is currently evaluating the feasibility of installing a roundabout at this intersection. Using FHWA methodology, single lane roundabout could operate at LOS B at this location.
Impact H: The 10th Street (SR 20) / Fremont Street intersection will operate at LOS F. Projected conditions at this intersection will exceed the minimum LOS standard, and a traffic
signal will be warranted. As noted in the discussion of daily traffic volumes, while a four lane SR 20 is desirable, it is unlikely that mainline SR 20 can be widened to a four lane section through this intersection. It may be possible to widen the road to create a separate northbound right turn lane on SR 20. Assuming separate left turn lanes on the Fremont Street approaches, under this configuration the intersection will operate at LOS C with signalization. Alternatively, a roundabout intersection could be installed at this location.

Impact I: The intersection of SR 20 Wil S Green Street will operate at LOS F. Projected conditions at this intersection will exceed the minimum LOS standard, and a traffic signal will be warranted. As noted in the discussion of daily traffic volumes, mainline SR 20 will need to be widened to a four lane section through this intersection. Right turn lanes will also be needed on the SR 20 approaches. The Wil Green approaches will need to be widened to provide three lanes (i.e., separate left turn, through and right turn lanes on each approach). Under this configuration, the intersection will operate at LOS C with signalization.

City of Colusa General Plan Update EIR (March 13, 2007) Page 22

Impact J: Intersections not addressed by this analysis are likely to eventually satisfy warrants for signalization. The evaluation of key intersections has noted several locations where traffic signals will be needed in order to deliver LOS C conditions. It is also possible to identify future signalized intersections based on the daily traffic volume warrant thresholds contained in the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD). At a planning level, intersections with daily volumes on all legs totaling more than 24,000 ADT with at least 3,000 ADT on each leg can be assumed to eventually warrant signalization.
Table 10 lists the locations of traffic signals that are projected to be needed at General Plan Build Out. As shown the two existing traffic signals could be joined by 16 new signals or roundabouts over the life of the Colusa General Plan.

PROJECT SPECIFIC IMPACTS

The General Plan land use diagram includes areas that are currently proposed for development. This report section identifies the specific contribution of these projects towards the traffic volume forecasts made under General Plan Build Out conditions.

Proposed Projects

The three projects include:

1. Colusa Crossing: A mixed use project along SR 20 on the west end of Colusa

2. combining 25 acres of commercial / industrial uses and 1,380 residential dwelling units; Brookins Ranch: a single family residential development totaling 639 units located east of Wil S Green Avenue;
3. Colusa Riverbend: An 42 acre residential development proposed in northeastern Colusa and totaling 2,530 dwellings.

Traffic Volume Contributions

As part of the GPU traffic impact analysis, trips generated by future development in Colusa were assigned to the city street system. Table 11 identifies the share of the future new traffic through Colusa intersections and on impacted streets resulting from each of the three projects.

APPENDIX C - NOISE MODEL OUTPUT

Appendix A
Acoustical Terminology

Acoustics The science of sound.

Ambient The distinctive acoustical characteristics of a given space consisting of all noise sources Noise audible at that location. In many cases, the term ambient is used to describe an existing or pre-project condition such as the setting in an environmental noise study.
Attenuation The reduction of an acoustic signal.
A-Weighting A frequency-response adjustment of a sound level meter that conditions the output signal to approximate human response.
Decibel or dB Fundamental unit of sound, A Bell is defined as the logarithm of the ratio of the sound pressure squared over the reference pressure squared. A Decibel is one-tenth of a Bell.
CNEL Community Noise Equi valent Level. Defined as the 24-hour average noise level with noise occurring during evening hours (7 - 10 p.m.) weighted by a factor of three and nighttime hours weighted by a factor of 10 prior to averaging.
Frequency The measure of the rapidity of alterations of a periodic signal, expressed in cycles per second or hertz.

Ldn Day/Night Average Sound Level. Similar to CNEL but with no evening weighting.

Leq Equivalent or energy-averaged sound level.

Lmax The highest root-mean-square (RMS) sound level measured over a given period of time.

Loudness A subjective term for the sensation of the magnitude of sound.
Masking The amount (or the process) by which the threshold of audibility is for one sound is raised by the presence of another (masking) sound.

Noise Unwanted sound.

Peak Noise The level corresponding to the highest (not RMS) sound pressure measured over a given period of time. This term is often confused with the "Maximum" level, which is the highest RMS level.

RTEO The time it takes reverberant sound to decay by 60 dB once the source has been removed,

Sabin The unit of sound absorption. One square foot of material absorbing 100% of incident sound has an absorption of 1 sabin.

SEL A rating, in decibels, of a discrete event, such as an aircraft flyover or train passby, that compresses the total sound energy of the event into a 1-s a time period.
Threshold The lowest sound that can be perceived by the human auditory system, generally of Hearing considered to be 0 dB for persons with perfect hearing.
Threshold Approximately 120 dB above the threshold of hearing. of Pain

Casino Expansion and Through Traffic Assumptions
Various routes are used by through traffic today, and these routes will be supplemented by the new Railroad Collector- Farinon Road Collector. The original GP analysis assumed that ¼ of the traffic increase will use each of Market Street, Fremont Street, Sioc Street and the new collector, or approximately 700 ADT on each route. If the Farinon Road connection is a direct link to the Railroad corridor, we assumed that Market Street, Fremont Street and Sioc Street would each carry 1/8 of the increase, or 350 ADT on each route
The original GP analysis assumed use of various roads by future traffic attracted by the expansion of the Colusa Casino. The original distribution pattern was based on the trip assignment presented in the Expansion's traffic study. This alternative analysis assumes no change to the pattern presented in that traffic study based on the assumption that the Farinon- Railroad corridor route will not be signed as the casino access route.
Year 2030 Daily Traffic Volumes and Levels of Service
Table 2 identifies year 2030 daily traffic volumes on Colusa streets and presents resulting Levels of Service assuming implementation of the GP Circulation diagram but no improvements to existing streets. Key impacts identified from this data are summarized in the text which follows. Mitigation options that could be considered by the City of Colusa area also noted.

Impact 1: Traffic volumes on SR 20 result in Levels of Service in excess of minimum
standards. The volume of traffic forecast for SR 20 through Colusa will exceed the LOS D
threshold for a 2 lane arterial. Exceeding the City's LOS D threshold in these areas is a significant impact, and implementing the circulation option does not eliminate this impact.

Impact 2: Traffic volumes on Fremont Street are indicative of LOS B conditions.
Addition of the one-way couplet would result in LOS B.

Impact 3: Traffic volumes on Sioc Street are indicative of LOS B conditions. Addition
of the one-way couplet would result in LOS B.

Impact 4: Traffic volumes on the Farinon Rd Extension between SR 20 and Westcott
Road are indicative of LOS B conditions. Traffic volumes on the Farinon Rd Extension
between SR 20 and Westcott Road are indicative of LOS B conditions with the development of a 4 lane arterial street. The volume of traffic expected on Farinon Road between Wescott Road and SR 20 will increase but will not exceed the LOS C threshold for a four lane arterial.

Impact 5: Traffic Volumes on Wescott Road between SR 20 and Tenant Drive are
indicative of LOS D conditions. The projected traffic volumes will exceed the LOS C threshold for a two lane collector without left turn lanes. Adding left turn lanes would deliver
LOS C in the area between SR 20 and Cynthia Avenue. To deliver LOS C between Cynthia Avenue and Tenant Drive the road would have to be constructed to two lane arterial standards.

Impact 6: Traffic Volumes on the Railroad Connector between Wescott Road and SR 20
are indicative of LOS D conditions. The volume of traffic on the Railroad Connector will
exceed the LOS C threshold for a llector street. To deliver LOS C it would be necessary to acquire right of way and improve the road to an Arterial standard.

Impact 7: Traffic volumes on Wil S Green Ave are indicative of LOS F conditions in
the area between SR 20 and Colus Avenue and immediately north of SR 20. As under the GP, the volume of traffic on these portions of Wil S Green will exceed the LOS C threshold for 2 lane collectors under the Circulation alternative. To deliver LOS C it will be necessary to add auxiliary lanes in the area between Colus Avenue and the SR 20 / Wil S Green Avenue
intersection and on the northern leg of the intersection (i.e., separate right turn, through, and left turn lanes approaching SR. 20).

Impact 8: Traffic volumes on SR 45 north of Market Street are indicative of LOS F. As under the base Circulation plan, the projected volume on this state highway will exceed the LOS D threshold established by the General Plan. To deliver LOS D it would be necessary to widen the roadway to a four lane section.

Impact 9: Traffic volumes on SR 20 east and west of the Colusa sphere of influence are indicative of LOS F conditions. Regionally, development in Colusa will contribute to
conditions in excess of the LOS D standard with either circulation option.

(June 18, 2007)

Impact 10: Traffic volumes on the East Collector are indicative of LOS D conditions. As under the base circulation plan, the volume of traffic on the southern half of the new East Collector will exceed the LOS C threshold. To deliver LOS C it would be necessary to designate this roadway as a 2 lane arterial and improve the road to arterial standards.

§ 21670. Legislative findings and declarations; creation;
membership; selection
Currentness
(a) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
(1) It is in the public interest to provide for the orderly development of each public use airport in this state and the area surrounding these airports so as to promote the overall goals and
objectives of the California airport noise standards adopted pursuant to Section 21669 and to
prevent the creation of new noise and safety problems.
(2) it is the purpose of this article to protect public health, safety, and welfare by ensuring the orderly expansion of airports and the adoption of land use measures that minimize the public's exposure to excessive noise and safety hazards within areas around public airports to the extent that these areas are not already devoted to incompatible uses. (b) In order to achieve the purposes of this article, every county in which there is located an airport which is served by a scheduled airline shall establish an airport land use commission. Every county, in which there is located an airport which is not served by a scheduled airline, but is operated for the benefit of the general public, shall establish an airport land use commission, except that the board of supervisors of the county may, after consultation with the appropriate airport operators and affected local entities and after a public hearing, adopt a resolution finding that there are no noise, public safety, or land use issues affecting any airport in the county which require the creation of a commission and declaring the county exempt from that requirement. The board shall, in this event, transmit a copy of the
resolution to the Director of Transportation. For purposes of this section, "commission" means an airport land use commission. Each commission shall consist of seven members to
be selected as follows:
(1) Two representing the cities in the county, appointed by a city selection committee comprised of the mayors of all the cities within that county, except that if there are any cities contiguous or adjacent to the qualifying airport, at least one representative shall be appointed therefrom. If there are no cities within a county, the number of representatives
provided for by paragraphs (2) and (3) shall each be increased by one. (2) Two representing the county, appointed by the board of supervisors.
(3) Two having expertise in aviation, appointed by a selection committee comprised of the
managers of all of the public airports within that county.

(4) One representing the general public, appointed by the other six members of the
commission.
(c) Public officers, whether elected or appointed, may be appointed and serve as members of
the commission during their terms of public office.
(d) Each member shall promptly appoint a single proxy to represent him or her in commission
affairs and to vote on all matters when the member is not in attendance. The proxy shall be
designated in a signed written instrument which shall be kept on file at the commission offices, and the proxy shall serve at the pleasure of the appointing member. A vacancy in the office of proxy shall be filled promptly by appointment of a new proxy. (e) A person having an "expertise in aviation" means a person who, by way of education,
training, business, experience, vocation, or avocation has acquired and possesses particular knowledge of, and familiarity with, the function, operation, and role of airports, or is an elected official of a local agency which owns or operates an airport. (f) It is the intent of the Legislature to clarify that, for the purposes of this article, that special districts, school districts, and community college districts are included among the local
agencies that are subject to airport land use laws and other requirements of this article.
