- INTRODUCTION

2 1.

3 In violation of state and local law, Real Party in Interest Touchstone Pistachio

4 Company, LLC, has transformed a small, local pistachio processing facility into a regional

5 pistachio processing facility on prime farmland in Tulare County. The original facility was

6 approved by the County of Tulare more than 25 years ago (in 1996) as a small processing
operation, limited to no more than 10 employees and a requirement that at least half of the
7 pistachios processed at the facility also be grown on-site.

8 2.

9 Touchstone Pistachio Company, LLC (*Touchstone Pistachio"), which calls itself

10 "one of the largest Grower-Processors of California Pistachios in the industry," acquired the

11 facility less than two years ago. Touchstone's public announcement touted expanding the

12 facility to a "capacity of 50+ million LBS and developing further." (Exhibit 1 - June 30, 2020,

letter)

13 3.

14 The County of Tulare's most recent approval, challenged here, increases the on-

15 site storage (and, in turn, associated capacity) by nearly 40 million pounds - almost double the
existing processing capacity. Yet the County completed no environmental review under the
16 California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"). Remarkably, the County deemed the near
17 doubling of the facility's number of 50-foot tall silos categorically exempt under CEQA

18

19 Guidelines Class 2 Section 15302(b) for Existing Facilities and Class 3 Section 15303 for New
Construction and Conversions of Small Structures. The use of these categorical exemptions was
20 inappropriate.

21 4. Touchstone Pistachio's acquisition of the facility was preceded by and has been
22 followed with the County's illegal issuance of various approvals to allow a facility intended to

23

24 process locally grown product to become a plant processing pistachios grown up to one hundred

25 miles away and from across the entire San Joaquin Valley.
5.

26 The County has allowed the facility's expansion to proceed unabated despite the

27 County's failure to conduct any environmental review. Located along Avenue 88 near Terra

1 Bella, between Avenue 96 and Queen B Road in an unincorporated area of Tulare County (the

2 "Project Site"), the facility's most recent expansion effort requires additional discretionary

3 approval from Tulare County. The County is required to comply with its own Code and CEQA

4 before issuing any approvals that further the facility's construction. Touchstone Pistachio knows

5 this. The County knows this. But the County and Touchstone Pistachio continue to ignore the

6 law.

7 6. As shown in the image below from 2004, as originally permitted, the modest facility

8 consisted of a couple of buildings, four small silos, and limited exterior equipment and storage.

19 7. More recently, however, through a series of piecemealed, illegally issued building
20 permits and other approvals, this small local facility has transformed into a major regional

21 processing plant, removing swaths of prime farmland from agricultural production in the process

22 and thereby reducing the amount of on-site growing capacity this facility is required to have

23 under its existing Special Use Permit. As shown in the following 2022 image, hundreds of
24 pistachio trees were cleared to provide additional staging areas and the facility's main building

25 substantially expanded.

(Project Site in 2022) 9
8. Touchstone Pistachio is again expanding the facility through the construction of 10
16 new storage silos, a second truck scale, and a refurbished huller line (the "Project"). On or 11
about December 20, 2021, the County issued Minor Modification No. 21-054 authorizing the 12

13 addition of a new truck scale, 16 new silos (for 36 total), and an upgraded huller line system in

14 violation of the County Code and CEQA.

9. Despite the County Code's (including its Zoning Ordinance) and CEQA's 15

16 mandates, the County approved Minor Modification No. 21-054, without complying with the
required administrative review process or conducting any environmental review. Additionally, 17

18 the County is currently processing multiple building permits in furtherance of the Project with
full knowledge that the Minor Modification that these approvals purport to rely upon is not yet 19
final.
20
10. Although Petitioners appealed the County's illegally-issued Minor Modification 21

22 on January 3, 2022, the County has refused to act on that appeal or even schedule a hearing.

11. The County knew that it was required to comply with its Code and CEQA prior to 23

24 the issuance of any discretionary approvals in furtherance of the Project. Notwithstanding this

25 knowledge, the County has illegally issued the Minor Modification approving new construction

26 activities in furtherance of the Project and ignored its violations of the County Code, including
its Zoning Ordinance. 27
12. Touchstone's industrial agricultural operation will have irreversible adverse 28

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ATTORNEYS AT LAW
LOs ANGELES

1 impacts on the environment. Yet the County has not completed any environmental review prior

2 to issuing the Minor Modification. The County has violated CEQA by issuing the Minor
3 Modification and continuing to process applications for additional building permits for

4 construction work with potentially severe environmental impacts prior to completing any of the

5 required analyses of those impacts. Continued expansion activities at the Project Site will result

6 in irrevocable adverse environmental impacts and render the County's compliance with CEQA a

7 mere post-hoc rationalization for approving the Project-i.e., a meaningless paperwork exercise.

8 PARTIES

9 13. Petitioner Wonderful Citrus II LLC (a "Petitioner" or "Wonderful Citrus") is a

10 Delaware limited liability company that owns citrus farms in the County, including roughly 132

11 acres of citrus fields within two miles of the Project Site (bounded by Road 192, Avenue 80, and

12 Avenue 74). Petitioner is committed to farming in a manner that minimizes environmental

13 impacts by employing sustainable farming practices including responsible water management,

14 careful soil maintenance, and a responsible integrated pest management program, including
15 employment of bio-rational pest control measures. Petitioner also owns and operates processing
16 facilities and employs people who live and work within the area under the jurisdiction of the San

17 Joaquin Air Pollution Control District (or "Air District"), including in the County of Tulare.

18 Wonderful Citrus' employees travel on the same roads used by Touchstone's trucks and face
19 increased traffic, risk of accident, and exposure to pollution as a result of the increased truck

20 traffic that the County's approvals create. Similarly, Wonderful Citrus' property and its

21 employees are exposed to increased emissions and pollution as a result of these truck trips and

22 increased operations at Touchstone's facility. Petitioner uses groundwater resources for
23 purposes of irrigating its crops in Tulare County generally and specifically at its approximately

24 132-acre property located less than two miles from the Project Site. Touchstone's increased
25 processing capacity will require an increase in the amount of water used. This water is drawn
26 from the same groundwater resource that Wonderful Citrus utilizes. Further, an increase in the

27 amount of water used for processing increases the amount of wastewater that will be stored in the

28 facility's 13-acre wastewater pond. Odors from these wastewater ponds have the potential to

LATHAM&WATKINS- VCU290229

LOs ANGELES FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 impact Wonderful Citrus' employees and Wonderful Citrus' operations at its property.

2 Declarations from Petitioners' employees at pages 71 to 94 of Exhibit 10 further detail the harm

3 that Petitioner will suffer as a result of the County's actions.

4 14. Petitioner The Wonderful Company LLC (also a "Petitioner" or "The Wonderful

5 Company") is a Delaware limited liability company that coordinates with related entities to farm

6 and process pistachios in the Central Valley. The Wonderful Company is a related entity to

7 Wonderful Citrus. The Wonderful Company-related entities own or operate nearly 4,500 acres

8 of land in Tulare County. Like Wonderful Citrus, The Wonderful Company is committed to

9 a farming in a manner that minimizes environmental impacts by employing sustainable farming

10 practices including responsible water management, careful soil maintenance, and a responsible

11 integrated pest management program, including employment of bio-rational pest control

12 measures. The Wonderful Company's employees access the Tulare County properties using the

13 same roads used by Touchstone's trucks and, as a result, face a increased traffic and exposure to
14 pollution as a result of the increased truck traffic associated with the facility's continued

15 expansion. The Wonderful Company has demonstrated its commitment to Tulare County by
16 donating millions of dollars to non-profit organizations and schools that address, among other

17 issues, child health and welfare issues. The Wonderful Company also owns and operates food

18 processing facilities and employs people who live and work within the area under the Air

19 District's jurisdiction, including within the County of Tulare. Touchstone's increased processing
20 capacity will require an increase in the amount of water used and may potentially impact the

21 local groundwater basin. This water is drawn from the same groundwater resource that The
22 Wonderful Company utilizes to service its property, threatening the long-term viability of
23 agricultural uses on these properties.

24 15. Respondent and Defendant County of Tulare and its Resource Management

25 Agency (collectively the "County") has land use jurisdiction over the unincorporated areas of the
26 County, including the Project Site.

27 16. Real Party Touchstone Pistachio a Company, LLC, is a California Limited Liability

28 Company. On information and belief, Touchstone Pistachio Company applied for Minor

3 17. Petitioners are unaware of any other parties that CEQA or other applicable law

4 requires as named real parties or the true names and capacities of Real Parties in Interest

5 1 fictitiously named herein as Does 1 through 50, inclusive, and sues each of the Real Parties in

6 Interest by fictitious names. Petitioners will amend this Petition to allege the fictitiously named

7 Real Parties in Interest's true names and capacities if ascertained.

8 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

9 18. This Court has jurisdiction to issue the relief requested pursuant to Code of Civil

10 Procedure sections 526, 1085, and 1094.5 and Public Resources Code sections 21168 and

11 21168.5.

12 19. Venue in this court is proper pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 393

13 and 394, as the Project Site is located in the unincorporated area under the County's land use

14 jurisdiction.

15 20. Petitioners have performed all conditions precedent to filing this Petition,
16 including, but not limited to, exhausting all administrative remedies or otherwise being excused
17 therefrom such requirement by futility, lack of jurisdiction, and/or unavailability of any other

18 timely review. Pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.5, Petitioners provided
19 Respondent County with notice of intent to file this action on January 3, 2022. A true and

20 accurate copy of that notice is attached hereto as Exhibit 2. Petitioners complied with the Public

21 Resources Code Section 21167.5 by providing Respondent with notice of intention to commence

22 the action. (attached as Exhibit 3.) Petitioners complied with the Public Resources Code Section
23 21167.7 by serving a copy of this Petition on the California Attorney General. (attached as

24 Exhibit 4.)

25 21. Petitioners have standing to assert these claims because Petitioners are directly
26 impacted by the impacts the Project will create and Petitioners have material interest in
27 ensuring that the County properly analyzes and mitigates the effects associated with the Project

28 and otherwise complies with the law. Petitioners seek to vindicate the substantial public interest

LATHAM&WATKINS.P VCU290229
ATTORNEYS AT LAW
LOs ANGELES FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 in protection of the environment and other interests alleged herein. Petitioners have no plain,

2 speedy, or adequate remedy at law.

3 LEGAL BACKGROUND

4 22. Under state law, the County is a legal subdivision of the State and "may exercise

5 its powers only through the board of supervisors or through agents and officers acting under

6 authority of the board or authority conferred by law." (Govt. Code, §§ 23002, 23003, 23005.) A
7 county's powers include legislative powers to enact ordinances and resolutions and to "do and

8 perform all other acts and things required by law ... or which are necessary to the full discharge

9 of the duties of the legislative authority of the county government." (Id., § 25207; see generally

10 id. §§ 25200 et seq.)

11 23. Notwithstanding their standing as a legal subdivision of the State with legislative

12 and other powers, as the Supreme Court has explained, "Public entities have, inter alia, a

13 mandatory duty to obey legislative enactments ...." (Ramos v. County of Madera (1971) 4

14 Cal.3d 685, 696.) Indeed, "It is elementary that public officials must themselves obey the law."

15 (Wirin v. Parker (1957) 48 Cal.2d 890, 894.)

16 24. This elementary requirement of municipal law requires that a public entity or

17 public official exercise their discretion (if any) under a proper interpretation of law. (See, e.g.,

18 Common Cause v. Board of Supervisors (1989) 49 Cal.3d 432, 442 [*Mandamus may issue,

19 however, to compel an official both to exercise his discretion (if he is required by law to do so)

20 and to exercise it under a proper interpretation of the applicable law."]; see also Valley Advocates

21 V. City of Fresno (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 1039, 1061-63 ['a prejudicial abuse of discretion

22 occurs when a public agency is misinformed regarding its discretionary authority and, as a result,

23 does not actually choose whether to exercise that discretionary authority"].)

24 25. The County of Tulare, through its County Code, including its Zoning Ordinance,

25 has prescribed both procedural and substantive requirements for the issuance, modification, or
26 revocation of permits and other approvals governing land use and development, including, for

27 example, special use permits, minor modifications, and building permits.

28 26. Accordingly, the County of Tulare, though vested with the authority to enact the
8
LATHAM&WATKINS VCU290229
ATTORNEYS AT LAW
LOs ANGELES FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

I County Code, including its Zoning Ordinance, must follow the County Code.

2 27. Similarly, CEQA, a state law, imposes clear and substantive responsibilities on

3 public agencies and is not merely a procedural statute. CEQA generally requires that public

4 agencies not approve projects that harm the environment unless and until all feasible mitigation

5 measures are employed to minimize that harm. (Pub. Resources Code §§ 21002, 21002.1, subd.

6 (b).) Agencies shall not undertake actions that could have a significant adverse effect on the
7 environment, or limit the choice of alternatives or mitigation measures, before complying with

8 CEQA. (Guidelines § 15004, subd. (b)(2).)2

9 28. Accordingly, public agencies may not "take any action" that furthers a project "in

10 a manner that forecloses alternatives or mitigation measures that would ordinarily be part of

11 CEQA review of that public project." (Save Tara V. City of West Hollywood (2008) 45 Cal.4th

12 116, 138.)

13 29. Thus, CEQA does not permit the postponement of environmental review "to the

14 point where the 'bureaucratic and financial momentum" has built up "irresistibly behind a

15 proposed project "thus providing a strong incentive to ignore environmental concerns.™ (Save

16 Tara, supra, 45 Cal.4th at 135.)

17 30. Failure either to comply with CEQA's substantive or procedural requirements so

18 that complete information as to a project's impacts is not developed and publicly disclosed
19 constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion that requires invalidation of the public agency action
20 regardless of whether full compliance would have produced a different result. (Pub. Resources

21 Code § 21005.)

22 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

23 A. Project Site

24 31. The Project Site is located at 19570 Avenue 88, just west of the County's Terra
25 Bella community. The Project Site is under the County's land use jurisdiction. The Project Site

26 is located less than one mile west of the Friant-Kern Canal and is immediately surrounded by

1 farms and other currently fallow farmland and orchards.

2 32. The Project Site is zoned AE-40. The AE zone, or Exclusive Agricultural Zone,

3 limits allowable uses to agricultural uses and uses that are a "necessary and integral part" of

4 supporting agricultural operations. The "-40" suffix indicates that the minimum lot size within

5 the AE-40 zone is 40 acres.

6 33. The Project Site subject to the San Joaquin Air Pollution Control District's and

7 the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board's jurisdiction. The Project Site is also

8 located within the Tule Sub-basin of the San Joaquin Groundwater Basin.

9 B. 1996 Special Use Permit

10 34. As explained in Special Use Permit No. 96-074, the facility's packing component

11 was originally constructed in 1983 to serve an on-site pistachio grove. In 1983, no use permit

12 was required for this operation. In 1986, however, the County amended its Zoning Code to

13 require uses engaging in curing, processing, packaging, packing, storage, and shipping of

14 a agricultural products to obtain a special use permit. Thus, since 1986, the Zoning Code (section

15 9.7) requires a Special Use Permit for curing, processing, packaging, packing, storage, and
16 shipping of agricultural products in the AE Zone.

17 35. In or around 1996, the previous owner illegally commenced construction of new
18 processing facilities in violation of the County Code. In response, the County required a Special

19 Use Permit to "bring an existing agricultural packing facility into conformance [with the Code]

20 and allow an expansion to said use The County issued Special Use Permit No. 96-074

21 (attached as Exhibit 5).

22 36. Although the County issued Special Use Permit No. 96-074 for the 1996

23 expansion of the facility, Special Use Permit No. 96-074 was premised on strict limits on where

24 the processed product originated and the number of facility employees. Specifically, Finding

25 No. 2 states that "the Zoning Administrator is authorized to approve or deny requests for special

26 use permits for expansion of ag processing facilities where more than one-half of the product is

27 produced on site and less than 10 persons are employed."

28 37. Special Use Permit No. 96-074's findings further note that the "applicant has
10
LATHAM&WATKINS. VCU290229
ATTORNEYS AT LAW
LOs ANGELES FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 requested a Special Use Permit to bring an existing agricultural packing facility into

2 conformance and allow expansion of the facility on approximately 3.8 acres of a 78.48 acre site."

3 At the time of the Special Use Permit's approval, the facility was an ancillary use to the existing

4 pistachio farming operation.

5 38. Likewise, the conditions of approval for Special Use Permit No. 96-074 limited

6 the duration and longevity of this use permit. Condition No. 11 states that "This Special Use

7 Permit shall automatically expire and become null and void two (2) years after the use for which

8 it was granted is discontinued or abandoned."

9 C. In 2015, A Piecemealed, Exponential Expansion of the Facility Begins

10 39. Between 2004 and 2015, the Project facilities appear to have remained generally

11 unchanged and largely consistent with the Special Use Permit, comprising a cluster of buildings,

12 four small silos, and limited exterior equipment and storage.

13 40. However, starting in 2015, the County allowed the facility to commence a
14 piecemeal expansion of the facility that, put together, would allow for a massive expansion of the
15 originally permitted facility.

16 41. On March 27, 2015, the County issued a "Special Use Permit Minor
17 Modification," No. 15-006, that purported to approve the construction of an additional receiving

18 unit and three additional "48' diameter" storage silos (over 50 feet tall). In terms of storage

19 capacity (by number of storage silos), this "minor modification" represented a 75% increase
20 above what Special Use Permit No. 96-074 permitted. Despite this substantial increase in

21 capacity, the County asserted that this expansion was exempt from CEQA under its Class 1,

22 Class 2, and Class 3 categorical exemptions for minor alterations to existing structures,

23 reconstruction of existing structures, and new construction of "small facilities or structures,"

24 respectively.

25 42. On July 6, 2017, the County issued a second "Minor Modification," No. 17-034,

26 to allow for the addition of seventeen storage silos, along with an additional receiving pit and

27 twelve 26-foot tall pistachio dryers. In terms of receiving capacity (number of receiving pits),

28 the 2017 "minor modification" doubled the capacity on top of the 2015 approval. In terms of
11
LATHAM&WATKINS.P
ATTORNEYS AT LAW VCU290229

LOs ANGELES FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 storage capacity, the County, with this 2017 approval and its 2015 approval, had approved a

2 500% increase above what had been originally permitted by Special Use Permit No. 96-074.

3 Despite this massive increase in capacity, the County asserted that this expansion was exempt

4 from CEQA under the Class 3 categorical exemption, even though the Class 3 exemption, by its

5 own terms, applies only to "limited numbers of new, small facilities or structures," such as one

6 single-family residence or the addition of 2,500 square a feet to a store or office structure. The

7 area approved for new construction for the seventeen new storage silos alone (not including the

8 additional receiving pit and twelve new drying facilities) exceeds 123,000 square feet.

9 43. Less than a year later, on February 5, 2018, the County issued yet another "Minor

10 Modification,' No. 18-009, this time to permit the addition of a 13-acre (over 565,000 square

11 feet), 184 acre-feet capacity wastewater treatment pond. As with the prior "minor
12 modifications," the County asserted this approval was exempt from CEQA under its Class 3

13 exemption (for limited numbers of new, small facilities) and its Class 4 exemption (minor

14 alterations in the condition of land, water, and/or vegetation). The County also boldly asserted

15 that this new 13-acre wastewater pond had "no reasonable possibility that [it] may cause a

16 significant effect on the environment

17 44. In May and June 2020, the County issued two building permits authorizing
18 construction that was beyond the scope of the Special Use Permit and Minor Modifications.

19 45. In December 2021, the County issued Minor Modification No. 21-054 to the
20 facility's Special Use Permit No. 96-074 which authorizes the addition of a new truck scale, 16

21 new silos, and an upgraded huller line system.

22 46. If an additional 16 silos are built, Petitioners are informed and believe that the

23 Project will have the capacity to process up to 90 million pounds of pistachios per year. In

24 contrast, when Special Use Permit No. 96-074 was approved in 1996, the facility's processing

25 capacity was approximately 225,000 pounds per year. ' Petitioners are also informed and believe

26

27 3 Special Use Permit No. 96-074 limited processing capacity to twice the on-site capacity. Assuming an average production capacity of approximately 2,805 pounds of pistachios per acre
28 of trees, 112,200 pounds could come from the adjacent 40-acre parcel and another equal amount that could legally come from off-site.

1 that the Project, if developed as proposed, will potentially result in significant, adverse impacts

2 to the environment that have not been analyzed, disclosed, or mitigated in any way. These

3 potential impacts include but are not necessarily limited to the following.

4 a. Air quality due to, among other things, the addition of a truck scale, which

5 will double the current number of scales on-site and will accommodate more trucks

6 moving on and off the property, and the addition of 16 new silos which will increase on-

7 site storage by 44%, both of which will increase truck traffic from hauling product from

8 off-site locations up to approximately 150 miles away to the Project Site for processing,

9 which will result in injury to public health as well as to the health of Petitioner's

10 employees who live and work close to the Project Site and under the jurisdiction of the

11 Air District.

12 b. Groundwater supply from the San Joaquin Groundwater Basin, Tule Sub-

13 Basin, which is designated as a High Priority a Basin under the Sustainable Groundwater

14 Management Act and is in a state of critical overdraft, due to, among other things, the

15 Project's increased demand for production water as evidenced by its new 13-acre

16 wastewater treatment pond; and

17 C. Increased noise disturbance due to the 24-hour a day processing of

18 pistachios at the expanded plant.

19 47. The County's continued failure to conduct any environmental review or monitor
20 operations at the expanded facility could result in reverberating impacts across the pistachio
21 industry. The Touchstone facility has undergone a haphazard, exponential expansion, without

22 any environmental review and no meaningful oversight from the County, despite a history of

23 prior health and safety measure violations. The County's failure to require Touchstone to

24 undergo even the most basic environmental review threatens the integrity of California's entire

25 pistachio processing industry.

26 D. The County Illegally Issues Minor Modification No. 21-054 for the Project's

27 Expansion

1 discretionary review and approval prior to the filing of this lawsuit.

2 49. Under the County Code and Zoning Ordinance, the issuance of Minor

3 Modifications require the exercise of discretion by the County to determine, among other things,

4 the following:

5 a. "the proposed construction and property comply with the requirements of

6 any other provisions of State law or this Ordinance Code;"

7 b. "the proposed construction and property comply with all of the provisions

8 of Ordinance No. 352 as amended (commonly known as the Zoning Ordinance of Tulare

9 County), any interim zoning ordinances;" and

10 C. "the approvals will not constitute nuisance." Nuisance is defined under

11 the County Code to mean, among other things, "Any use of land, buildings, or premises

12 established, operated, or maintained contrary to the provisions of any statute, any

13 provision of this Code, or any other ordinance adopted by the Board" and "Anything

14 which is injurious to health ... so as to interfere with the comfortable enjoyment of life or

15 property."

16 50. As described in more detail below, the County issued Minor Modification No. 21-

17 054 authorizing expansion of the facility that exceeded the scope of the permitted uses at the

18 Project Site and also violated the law in other ways.

19 E. The County Continues to Allow Piecemeal Expansion of the Facility

20 51. The County issued the Minor Modification No. 21-054 on December 20, 2021,

21 authorizing the addition of 16 storage silos, one truck scale, and a refurbished huller line.

22 (attached as Exhibit 6.)

23 52. On December 22, 2021, the County issued a Notice of Exemption associated with

24 its approval of Minor Modification No. 21-054, noting that the Project was exempt from CEQA

25 pursuant to CEQA Guidelines Section 15302 (Class 2 - Existing Facilities) and CEQA
26 Guidelines Section 15303 (Class 3 - New Construction and Conversions of Small Structures).

27 (attached as Exhibit 7.)

1 Minor Modification No. 21-054 to the County of Tulare, pursuant to County Code. A true and

2 correct copy of this letter is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.

3 54. On January 14, 2022, Petitioners submitted a letter to the County requesting that

4 the County deny the pending building permit applications due to the pending appeal and

5 investigate whether the facility was operating in compliance with Special Use Permit No. 96-

6 074. A true and correct copy of this letter is attached hereto as Exhibit 8.

7 55. Real Party has filed two new building permit applications with the County which

8 are under review as of January 25, 2022. Application No. A2200068 would permit an upgraded

9 huller, and Application No. A2200069 would add 16 storage silos. (attached as Exhibit 9.)

10 F. The County Refuses to Hear Petitioners' Administrative Appeal

11 56. On February 8, 2022, the County Board of Supervisors met in a closed session to

12 discuss this litigation.

13 57. On February 9, 2022, County Counsel informed Petitioners that "[t]he County

14 will not hold a hearing on [Petitioners'] appeal of MIM 21-054 unless or until a court issues a

15 ruling that Wonderful has standing to pursue such an appeal." (attachment to Exhibit 10 [March

16 2, 2022, Letter from Petitioner to County].)

17 58. On March 2, 2022, Petitioners submitted to the County a letter outlining the

18 County's obligations to hear the administrative appeal. This letter also transmitted declarations

19 detailing Petitioners' harms and evidence of the project's environmental impacts. A true and

20 correct copy of this letter is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.

21 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

22 (Violation of CEQA - Public Resources Code §§ 21000, et. seq. -

23 Illegal Piecemealing)

24 59. Petitioners incorporate by reference each of the allegations contained in the
25 preceding paragraphs in their entirety.

26 60. Under CEQA, the "lead agency" is the public agency that has the principal
27 responsibility for carrying out the project and determining, in consultation with other relevant

28 state agencies, whether an environmental impact report, a negative declaration, or a mitigated
15
LATHAM&WATKINSLP
ATTORNEYS AT LAW VCU290229

LOs ANGELES FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 negative declaration will be prepared for a project. (Pub. Resources Code §§ 21067; 21080.1,
2 subd. (a); 21083, subd. (a).)

3 61. At all times relevant to this action, Respondent County was the lead agency

4 responsible for reviewing the Project pursuant to CEQA.

5 62. Work authorized under Minor Modification No. 21-054 is in furtherance of the

6 Project. The County is aware that both the previous owner of the facility and now Touchstone

7 Pistachio have been seeking to expand the facility and that such expansion efforts are subject to

8 CEQA. The County's approval of Minor Modification No. 21-054 was a discretionary act under

9 CEQA and the County Code.

10 63. The Project is a "project" under CEQA. The Guidelines define a project as "the

11 whole of an action, which has a potential for resulting in either a direct physical change to the
12 environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment"

13 (Guidelines, § 15378 subd. (a)) and require that "all phases of project planning, implementation,

14 and operation" must be considered in the Initial Study for a project (Guidelines, § 15063 subd.

15 (a)(1)) prior to issuing a discretionary approval.

16 64. Accordingly, "There is no dispute that CEQA forbids *piecemeal' review of the
17 significant environmental impacts of a project. This rule derives, in part, from section 21002.1,

18 subdivision (d), which requires the lead agency ... to *consider[] the effects, both individual and

19 collective, of all activities involved in [the] project.™* (Berkeley Keep Jets over the Bay Com. v.

20 Board of Port Commissioners of the City of Oakland (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1344, 1358.

21 65. In addition, the potential applicability of a CEQA exemption does not relieve a

22 public agency from the requirement under CEQA to evaluate the "whole of a project" for
23 potentially significant environmental effects. If any component of a project is not exempt, then it

24 must undergo further environmental review under CEQA. (See, e.g., California Farm Bureau
25 Federation v. California Wildlife Conservation Bd. (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 173, 192-96.)

26 66. The County violated CEQA by failing to complete the required CEQA
27 compliance prior to issuing Minor Modification No. 21-054, a which is a discretionary approval

28 under the County Code. The County has continued to ignore CEQA by issuing piecemealed
16
LATHAM&WATKINS.P
ATTORNEYS AT LAW VCU290229

LOs ANGELES FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 approvals that together authorize an exponential expansion of an industrial-scale pistachio

2 processing facility. CEQA analysis, including any EIR, "should be prepared as early in the
3 planning process as possible to enable environmental considerations to influence project,

4 program, or design." (Bozung V. LAFCo. (1975) 13 Cal.3d 263, 282.) CEQA review and the

5 application of CEQA procedures must be followed at all stages of project consideration, to carry

6 out the legislative intent "to compel government at all levels to make decisions with
7 environmental consequences in mind." (Id. at 283.)

8 67. Where an approval is "an essential step leading to ultimate environmental impact

9 [] it is therefore ... a 'project' within the scope of CEQA. (Fullerton Joint Union High School

10 Dist. v. State Bd. of Education (1982) 32 Cal.3d 779, 797.)

11 68. "[T]he later the environmental review process begins, the more bureaucratic and

12 financial momentum there is behind a proposed project." (Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. V.

13 Regents of the University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 395.)

14 69. CEQA Guidelines section 15004 subd. (b)(2)(B) provides that public agencies
15 should not "take any action which gives impetus to a planned or foreseeable project in a manner

16 that forecloses alternatives or mitigation measures that would ordinarily be part of CEQA review

17 of that public project."

18 70. While "[m]inisterial projects are exempt from the requirements of CEQA"

19 (CEQA Guidelines section 15268, subd. (a)), "[w]here a project involves an approval that
20 contains elements of both a ministerial action and a discretionary action, the project will be

21 deemed to be discretionary and will be subject to the requirements of CEQA." (Guidelines con

22 15268, subd. (d).)

23 71. A discretionary project is "a project which requires the exercise of judgment or

24 deliberation when the public agency or body decides to approve or disapprove a particular
25 activity." (Guidelines, § 15357.) "Approval" is defined as "the decision by a public agency

26 which commits the agency to a definite course of action in regard to a project intended to be

27 carried out by any person." (Id., § 15352, subd. (a).) CEQA requires that "[b]efore any approval

28 of a project subject to CEQA" that the lead agency shall consider final CEQA determination.

LOs ANGELES FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 72. Minor Modification No. 21-054 purported to authorize the construction of 16
2 storage silos, one truck scale, and a refurbished huller line on the Project Site that are part of the

3 Project.

4 73. The issuance of Minor Modification a No. 21-054 is a necessary component of the

5 County's discretionary review of the Project.

6 74. The County violated CEQA and failed to proceed in the manner required by law,

7 committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion, and acted arbitrarily and capriciously in its issuance

8 of Minor Modification No. 21-054 because, without limitation, the County failed to subject

9 Minor Modification No. 21-054 and the Project to additional environmental assessment as

10 CEQA requires.

11 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

12 (Violation of CEQA - Public Resources Code §§ 21000, et. seq.-

13 The Project is Not Exempt)

14 75. Petitioners incorporate by reference each of the allegations contained in the
15 preceding paragraphs in their entirety.

16 76. If applying an exemption, "The agency bears the burden of showing that
17 substantial evidence supports its finding that a particular CEQA exemption applies." (Bus Riders

18 Union V. Los Angeles County Metro. Transp. Agency (2009) 179 Cal.App.4th 101, 107.)

19 77. Similarly, where an environmental impact report or negative declaration has

20 already been prepared and certified, CEQA requires the agency to make specific findings and, if

21 necessary, conduct additional environmental review or study, regarding the continuing validity
22 of the existing CEQA documentation prior to approving changes or modifications to the Project.
23 (Guidelines, §§ 15162, 15164.)

24 78. The County issued a Notice of Exemption stating that the Project was
25 categorically exempt under CEQA Guidelines Class 2 Section 15302(b) for Existing Facilities

26 3 and Class 3 Section 15303 for New Construction and Conversions of Small Structures.

27 79. The Class 3 exemption exempts "construction and location of limited numbers of

28 new, small facilities or structures; installation of small new equipment ... and conversion of
18
LATHAM&WATKINSUP
ATTORNEYS AT LAW VCU290229

LOs ANGELES FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 existing small structures." (Guidelines, § 15303.)

2 80. The CEQA Guidelines discuss the application of this exemption to small

3 residential developments, limited commercial development within urbanized areas, and

4 accessory structures. (Id.)

5 81. Minor Modification No. 21-054 permits an 80% expansion of the existing

6 facility's storage capacity, in turn increasing the production capacity. The facility, which

7 previously had a capacity of 50 million pounds of pistachios, will balloon to a capacity of 90

8 million pounds of pistachios with the addition of the 16 silos authorized by Minor Modification

9 No. 21-054.

10 82. The expansion authorized by Minor Modification No. 21-054 is well beyond the

11 scope of the "small structures" intended to be exempted under a Class 3 categorical exemption.

12 The Project was not exempt from CEQA and additional analysis is required.

13 83. Further, the Project is not exempt from CEQA because of the various exceptions

14 to categorical exemptions. The Project, when evaluated in conjunction with other nearby

15 development has the potential to result in cumulative impacts, meaning the use of an exemption

16 is inappropriate. (Guidelines, § 15300.2(b).) Additionally, a categorical exemption for the

17 Project is inappropriate because there is a reasonable possibility that the Project will result in

18 significant environmental effects, because of unusual circumstances - namely, the serial

19 expansion of the facility that was initially permitted as a modest processor of on-site and local

20 pistachios. Because the Project falls within numerous exceptions to categorical exemptions, it is

21 not exempt from CEQA and the Count is required to analyze the Project's environmental

22 impacts.

23 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

24 (Violation of Tulare County Code and Zoning Ordinance - Ultra Vires Action)

25 84. Petitioners incorporate by reference each of the allegations contained in the
26 preceding paragraphs in their entirety.

27 85. The Zoning Code only allows the Planning Director to approve Minor

28 Modifications of Special Use Permits "provided that any minor modification shall not
19
LATHAM&WATKINS. VCU290229
ATTORNEYS AT LAW
LOs ANGELES FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 substantially change or alter the use approved or conditions imposed." (Zoning Ordinance, §

2 16.)

3 86. Similarly, the Zoning Ordinance requires that the Resource Management Director

4 "first request[] the body which took final action on the use permit ... to determine if such

5 change constitutes a minor modification" prior to authorizing a Minor Modification to a Special

6 Use Permit issued by another decision-maker. (Zoning Ordinance, § 18.)

7 87. The addition of 16 new silos will increase the on-site storage capacity from

8 approximately 50 million pounds of pistachios to an estimated 90 million pounds of pistachios -

9 a 80% increase in capacity.

10 88. The addition of a new truck scale will increase the speed at which trucks can

11 unload raw product and load processed pistachios, further increasing production capacity.

12 Further, while not specified in the application, the replacement of the huller line may also result

13 in an unknown increase in processing capacity.

14 89. Together, the improvements authorized by Minor Modification No. 21-054
15 represent a substantial expansion of the existing use.

16 90. Because Minor Modification No. 21-054 authorizes such a substantial increase in

17 processing capacity, the Zoning Ordinance required that the Resource Management Director

18 request that the Zoning Administrator, or a higher decision-maker like the Planning Commission,
19 determine whether the proposed changes constitute a Minor Modification, or if another use
20 approval is required. This consultation did not occur.

21 91. The Resource Management Director approved Minor Modification No. 21-054

22 without this required consultation. Accordingly, approval of Minor Modification No. 21-054
23 violated the County Code.

24 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

25 (Violation of Tulare County Code and Zoning Ordinance -

26 Illegal Reliance on Special Use Permit)

27 92. Special Use Permit No. 96-074 states that "the Zoning Administrator is authorized

28 to approve or deny requests for special use permits for expansion of ag processing facilities
20
LATHAM+WATKINS4P VCU290229
ATTORNEYS AT LAW
LOs ANGELES FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 where more than one-half of the product is produced on site and less than 10 persons are

2 employed." On information and belief, the scope of Minor Modification No. 21-054 will result

3 in a facility of such size that the on-site farming activities will not generate sufficient product to

4 meet the one-half requirement and that will require more than 10 employees to operate.

5 93. Similarly, Special Use Permit No. 96-074 states that the "Director is authorized to
minor modifications in the approved plans upon a request by the applicant ... as long as 6 approve

7 said modifications do not materially affect the determination of the Zoning Administrator." (See

8 also County Zoning Code, Section 18.) However, Minor Modification No. 21-054 authorizes the

9 exponential expansion of the processing use authorized by Special Use Permit No. 96-074 and
10 materially affects the originally approved use.

11 94. ARO previously announced that the facility can now process 50 million pounds of
12 pistachios per year, and, with the added silo capacity, that number will increase to 90 million

13 pounds of pistachios. (Exhibit I - June 30, 2020, letter.)

14 95. Further, prior to the approval of the Minor Modification's additional capacity, the

15 applicant admitted that more than 100 employees will be employed on-site. (Exhibit - June 30,
16 2020, letter.)

17 96. Accordingly, in authorizing the expansion through a Minor Modification, the

18 Resource Management Director exceeded the authority Special Use Permit No. 96-074 and the

19 County Code delegate to him. The County has a ministerial duty to ensure that the County Code

20 is fully implemented. The County has failed to do so.

21 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

22 (Violation of Tulare County Code and Zoning Ordinance -

23 Special Use Permit No. 96-074 Is Void and Cannot Support Minor Modification No. 21-

24 054)

25 97. Petitioners incorporate by reference each of the allegations contained in the
26 preceding paragraphs in their entirety.

27 98. County Code section 7-15-1040 requires the Resource Management Director or
28 authorized representative to determine, among other things, that "the proposed construction and
21
LATHAM&WATKINS VCU290229
ATTORNEYS AT LAW
LOs ANGELES FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 property comply with all of the provisions of Ordinance No. 352 as amended (commonly known

2 as the Zoning Ordinance of Tulare County)," prior to the issuance of a Minor Modification.

3 99. County Zoning Ordinance sections 9.7 and 16 provide that the Project, which is

4 an establishment for the "curing, processing, packaging, packing, storage and shipping of

5 agricultural products," is allowed only "subject to such conditions and safeguards as the

6 authority granting the permit shall specify" in a Special Use Permit.

7 100. Under its own terms, Special Use Permit No. 96-074 "become[s] null and void

8 two (2) years after the use for which it was granted is discontinued or abandoned."

9 101. On information and belief, operations under Special Use Permit No. 96-074 were
10 discontinued for a period of time such that this special use permit could not have supported the

11 County's issuance of Minor Modification No. 21-054.

12 102. The California Regional Water Quality Control Board for the Central Valley

13 Region's Waste Discharge Requirement Order R5-2016-0052 stated that "ARO Pistachios, Inc. a

14 California corporation [the previous owner of the facility] is re-starting operation of the Pistachio
15 Processing Facility (Facility) at 19570 Avenue 88 in Terra Bella" and that the prior WDR order
16 authorizing operations at the Facility under the jurisdiction of the Regional Board was rescinded

17 in 2003. Accordingly, as the operations were either not commenced within a two-year period of

18 approvals being issued or were discontinued for a period of at least two years, Special Use

19 Permit No. 96-074 could not have supported the County's issuance of Minor Modification No.

20 21-054.

21 103. The County had no valid underlying approvals to rely upon in issuing Minor
22 Modification No. 21-054. Because Special Use Permit 96-074 expired on its own terms, Minor

23 Modification No. 21-054 is void and must be set aside.

24 SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION

25 Violation of Tulare County Code and Zoning Ordinance -

26 Silos Illegally Cross Property Line

27 104. Petitioners incorporate by reference each of the allegations contained in the

28 preceding paragraphs in their entirety.
22
LATHAM+WATKINS4P VCU290229
ATTORNEYS AT LAW
LOs ANGELES FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 105. Tulare Zoning Code Section 9.7.G requires projects in the AE-40 Zone to

2 maintain a minimum side yard setback of ten feet.

3 106. Tulare Zoning Code Section 16.I requires a that a Variance be obtained to deviate

4 from the "strict and literal interpretation and enforcement of the provisions" contained within the

5 Zoning Code. Only after an application for a Variance is submitted, does the County's Planning

6 Commission have the authority to act on the request. (Tulare Zoning Code § 16.I.A.)

7 107. There is no evidence that the applicant applied for or obtained a Variance for

8 relief from the Zoning Code's side yard requirement.

9 108. The 16 new storage silos authorized by Minor Modification No. 21-054 do not
10 comply with the County Code's side yard setback requirement because four of the new silos

11 traverse the property line and 12 of the new silos are fully contained on the neighboring property.

12 109. A Variance was required to permit these new silos. The County did not issue a

13 Variance. Thus, the County violated its Zoning Code by approving Minor Modification No. 21-

14 054 and authorizing development of structures within the site's required side yard. Minor

15 Modification No. 21-054 must be set aside.

16 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

17 WHEREFORE, Petitioners respectfully pray for the following:

18 A. For a writ of mandate directing the County to comply with the law; and

19 1) Directing the County to rescind Minor Modification No. 21-054 within 10

20 days of issuance of the writ and refrain from re-issuance of such permits until such time

21 that the Court has determined the County has complied with the County Code, Zoning

22 Ordinance, and all other applicable laws; and

23 2) Directing the County to refrain from issuing any permits for the Project or

24 any other actions in furtherance of the Project until such time that the Court has

25 determined the County has complied with the County Code, County Zoning Ordinance,
26 and all other applicable laws;

27 B. For a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, or permanent injunction

Re: Appeal of Minor Modification No. 21-054 and Related CEQA Exemption
Determination

Dear Mr. Britt:

On behalf of our client, The Wonderful Company, Wonderful Citrus II LLC, and related
entities, we hereby appeal the County's issuance of Minor Modification No. 21-054 for the addition of sixteen storage silos, a truck scale, and a refurbished huller line at Touchstone's
commercial pistachio processing facility operated at 19570 Avenue 88 near Terra Bella.

We separately appeal the County's determination that the Minor Modification was exempt from review under the California Environmental Quality Act pursuant to sections 15302
and 15303 of the CEQA Guidelines.

We request that the County rescind issuance of Minor Modification No. 21-054 and refrain from issuing additional approvals for new construction at the Touchstone facility until the County complies with the County Code and Zoning Code and completes all necessary environmental review for the proposed expansion.
This appeal is brought on the following separate and independent grounds thus far.

1. The County Issued MIM 21-054 In Error. The County violated the County
Code and Zoning Code in approving Minor Modification No. 21-054 to the facility's Special Use Permit for the following separate and independent reasons:

a. The Minor Modification improperly authorizes building silos across the
property line onto adjacent property because no variance has been obtained
authorizing the siting of silos within the minimum 10-foot side yard setback required for Projects in the AE-40 Zone.

b. The Minor Modification was issued in violation of the Tulare County
Zoning Code because the Director lacked the authority to authorize with a Minor Modification an expansion which would nearly double the facility's storage
capacity.

C. The Minor Modification permits the addition of a truck scale, which will
increase processing intensity on-site, increasing traffic, and is contrary to the
statement in the Minor Modification.

d. The Minor Modification will substantially modify the original conditions
of approval in the Special Use Permit by continuing to expand the facility in
violation of the limitation upon which the Special Use Permit was issued.

e. Special Use Permit No. 96-074 authorizing the pistachio processing use is expired and void by its own terms and cannot serve as the basis for the Minor
Modification.

2. The Minor Modification Is Not Exempt from CEQA. The County violated
CEQA in finding the project was exemption from environmental review for the following separate and independent reasons:

a. The Minor Modification is not exempt from CEQA because the new huller system will increase capacity and support nearly a doubling of the number of silos, and this is an improper expansion of capacity in violation of CEQA Guidelines Section 15302(b).

b. The Minor Modification is not exempt from CEQA because it authorizes a
substantial expansion of use by adding sixteen new silos which will permit the facility to process an additional 40 million pounds of pistachios in addition to its
current processing capacity of 50 million pounds.

C. The County failed to adequately analyze the potential environmental impacts associated with the Minor Modification.

d. There is a reasonable probability that approval of the Minor Modification
to allow an 80 percent increase in the silo storage capacity result in significant
environmental impacts under Section 15300.2(c).

e. Pursuant to Section 15300.2(b), the identified potential environmental
impacts could result in cumulative impacts, which would except the Minor
Modification from either of the stated categorical exemptions.

***:

We request that the County rescind issuance of Minor Modification No. 21-054 and refrain from issuing additional approvals for new construction at the Touchstone facility until the
County fulfills its obligations under the County Code and all applicable requirements of CEQA.

This appeal is based on the publicly-available information online and the text of Minor
Modification No. 21-054. Therefore, we reserve all rights to supplement this appeal once we
have been able to review the County's full administrative record.
Please advise of any fee associated with this appeal so that we may promptly pay it, and
do not hesitate to contact me with any questions at (213) 891-7540.

Very truly yours,
YNne Maria Pilar Hoye
of LATHAM & WATKINS LLP

ATTACHMENT A

The County issued Minor Modification 21-054 in error. The County also erred in
determining that the proposed modifications were exempt from CEQA pursuant to CEQA
Guidelines Sections 15302(b) and 15303.

A. History of ARO Pistachio's Operations
In 1996, the County issued Special Use Permit 96-074 after the facility had illegally
begun construction of additional facilities in violation of the County Code.
The 1996 Special Use Permit was premised on strict limits on where the processed
product originated and the number of facility employees. Specifically, the Special Use Permit assumed that more than one-half of the product would be produced onsite and that less than 10
persons would be employed.

The Special Use Permit also states that it expires two years after the authorized use is
discontinued.

More than twenty years after the County issued the Special Use Permit, ARO Pistachios applied for and the County granted a series of "Minor Modifications" (Nos. 15-006, 17-034, and
18-009) to allow ARO Pistachios to expand its facility substantially. It is not clear whether the facility was continually operating from 1996 through 2015.
Prior to the Minor Modifications, we understand that the facility consisted of a cluster of
buildings, four small silos, and limited exterior equipment and storage. In contrast to the modest original facility, from 2015 to 2018 the Minor Modifications collectively authorized the development of 20 new 48-foot silos, two receiving pits, 12 dryers, and an anaerobic pond. This represented a major expansion of the existing processing facility.
On or about December 21, 2021, the County issued Minor Modification 21-054
authorizing the addition of a new truck scale, 16 new silos, and an upgraded huller line system.
The Minor Modification was issued by the Director, without any public notice or public hearing.
This appeal timely followed.

B. The Approval and Issuance of Minor Modification 21-054 Violated County
Code

Issuance of Minor Modification 21-054 was improper. Minor Modification 21-054 does
not comply with the County Code.

The County's online permit portal incorrectly listed the facility's address at 19570 Avenue 80,
instead of the correct address of 19570 Avenue 88.

1. Minor Modification 21-054 Illegally Authorizes Development On an Adjacent Property & In a Required Yard Setback
Minor Modification 21-054 illegally authorizes development of silos across the eastern
property line and on the neighboring parcel. It is our understanding that the adjacent property,
identified by Assessor Parcel Number 319-130-023, is not commonly owned or tied to the site.

Projects in the AE-40 Zone must maintain a minimum side yard setback of ten feet.
(Tulare Zoning Code § 9.7.G.) The Zoning Code requires that a Variance be obtained to deviate
from the "strict and literal interpretation and enforcement of the provisions" contained within the Zoning Code. (Tulare Zoning Code § 16.I.) Only after an application for a Variance is
submitted, does the County's Planning Commission have the authority to act on the request.
(Tulare Zoning Code § 16.I.A.)

There is no evidence that the applicant applied for or obtained a Variance for relief from
the Zoning Code's side yard requirement. The 16 new silos authorized by Minor Modification
21-054 do not comply with the County Code's side yard setback requirement. (see Exhibit
MIM 21-054, Exhibit A, showing four of the new silos traversing the property line and 12 of the
new silos fully contained on the neighboring property.) A Variance was required to permit these
new silos. The County did not issue a Variance. Thus, the County violated its Zoning Code by
approving Minor Modification 21-054 and authorizing development of structures within the
site's required side yard. Minor Modification 21-054 must be set aside.

2. Approval of Minor Modification 21-054 Exceeds the Director's
Authority Under the Tulare County Zoning Code
The Zoning Code only allows the Planning Director to approve Minor Modifications of Special Use Permits "provided that any minor modification shall not substantially change or alter
the use approved or conditions imposed." (Zoning Ordinance, § 16.) Minor Modification 21- § 054 will exponentially increase the facility's annual processing capacity, resulting in an increase of the number of truck trips and associated employees.
The addition of 16 new silos will increase the on-site storage capacity from
approximately 50 million pounds of pistachios to an estimated 90 million pounds of pistachios -
a 80% increase in capacity.
The addition of a new truck scale will increase the speed at which trucks can unload raw product and load processed pistachios, further increasing production capacity. Further, while not specified in the application, the replacement of the huller line may also result in an unknown
increase in processing capacity. Together, the improvements authorized by Minor Modification
21-054 represent a substantial expansion of the existing use.
Because Minor Modification 21-054 authorizes such a substantial increase in processing
capacity, the Zoning Ordinance required that the Resource Management Director "first request[] the body which took final action on the use permit…to determine if such change constitutes a
minor modification." (Zoning Ordinance, § 18.) In other words, the Resource Management Director was required to present the Minor Modification first to the Zoning Administrator or a

higher body, such as the Planning Commission. That did not occur. Accordingly, approval of Minor Modification 21-054 violated the County Code.

3. Minor Modification 21-054 Will Increase Traffic

Contrary to Minor Modification 21-054's Finding No. 2, the additional processing capacity authorized will increase processing intensity on-site, and result in increased traffic.
The addition of a truck scale, which will double the current number of scales on-site, will
accommodate more trucks moving on and off the property to deliver raw product and haul
processed product. This will increase traffic.

The addition of 16 new silos will increase the on-site storage capacity by 44%, which will
in turn allow for additional raw and process product to be moved to and from the site during the
harvest and processing season. This will increase traffic.
The replacement of huller line with a modern system will likely increase processing efficiency and resulting capacity. That, coupled with the additional truck scale and 16 new silos will increase processing capacity and require additional staff to service the processing facility
during harvest. This will increase traffic.

4. Minor Modification 21-054 Substantially Affects the Original
Conditions of Approval
Contrary to Minor Modification 21-054's Finding No. 3, the Minor Modification will substantially affect or revise original conditions of approval. Special Use Permit 96-074 was predicated on a finding that "the Zoning Administrator is authorized to approve or deny requests for special use permits for expansion of ag processing facilities where more than one-half of the product is produced on site and less than 10 persons are employed." Special Use Permit 96-074 explains that the Zoning Administrator was only empowered to approve it because "more than
one-half of the product is produced on site and less than 10 persons are employed."

Under the Building Permits, ARO will operate the facility in violation of these limits.
ARO previously announced that the facility can now process 50 million pounds of pistachios per year, and with the added silo capacity that number will increase to 90 million pounds of
pistachios. (Exhibit 2 - June 30, 2020 ARO Letter.) In contrast, when Special Use Permit 96- 074 was approved in 1996, the facility's processing capacity was approximately 225,000 pounds per year.2 Further, the applicant has admitted that more than 100 employees will be employed
on-site, prior to the approval of the Minor Modification's additional capacity. (Exhibit 2 - June 30, 2020 ARO Letter.) Minor Modification 21-054 results in ARO exceeding Special Use
Permit 96-074's limit on employees to "less than 10 persons." Thus, because Minor Modification 21-054 allows ARO to operate in violation of the Special Use Permit, it was issued

2 Special Use Permit 96-074 limited processing capacity to twice the on-site capacity. Assuming an average production capacity of approximately 2,805 pounds of pistachios per acre of trees,
112,200 pounds could come from the adjacent 40-acre parcel and another equal amount that
could legally come from off-site.

in error, and must be set aside. (See, e.g., County Code, § 7-15-1040, subds. (b), (d); Zoning
Ordinance, §§ 9.7, 16.)

1. The Special Use Permit Is Void; Minor Modification 21-054 Was
Issued in Error

Special Use Permit 96-074 provides that the permit expires and is null and void two years after the authorized use is discontinued. If the facility stopped operating for a two-year period at
any time since 1996, then the Special Use Permit expired and is void under its own terms. Without a special use permit, the facility cannot operate. (E.g., Zoning Ordinance, §§ 9.7, 16; County Code, § 7-15-1040, subds. (b), (d).)

Federal and state records show that the facility stopped operations for at least six years
since 1996, specifically from at least 2004 to 2010.
2004: "Mehdi Orandi closed the processing plant";

- 2010: "Mr. [Adam] Orandi said he began processing pistachios in 2010."

(Exhibit 3 - FDA records [emphasis added; omissions in original].)
FDA records note that the "[Plant Manager] stated that in 2011, the firm started hulling and shelling pistachios," indicating that processing activities were restarted after a lapse in operation. (Exhibit 3 - FDA records; see also Exhibit 4 - WDR Order R5-2016-0052.) Air District records also show no reported emissions during this same time period. (Air Resources Board Records [Air Resources Board database shows no reported emission from 2001 to 2013].)
Thus, Special Use Permit 96-074 expired two years after "Mehdi Orandi closed the
processing plant" in 2004.

Special Use Permit 96-074 is void because operations were discontinued for more than
two years. Therefore, the County could not issue Minor Modifications to the Special Use Permit
or the Building Permits.

The Building Permits could not issue, and cannot issue, absent a valid Special Use
Permit.

C. The Issuance of Minor Modification 21-054 Violated CEQA

1. CEQA Requires the County to Analyze the Expansion's
Environmental Impacts
The County has not conducted any environmental review of the potential impacts associated with the significant increase in operations from the facility's overall proposed expansion. There is clear potential for the expansion to result in impacts to agricultural
resources, air quality, noise, traffic, hazards, utilities, and potentially other impact areas.
(Exhibit 5 - Ramboll Report.)

In fact, the facility's operation already results in environmental impacts. In fall of 2019
numerous complaints were filed with the Air District regarding odors, flies, and fires associated
with operations at the ARO facility. (Exhibit 6 Air District Complaints.) Inspectors confirmed that the dumping of waste materials and processing debris was causing a foul odor and drawing flies to the area. Without a detailed analysis of potential impacts, including those that are already occurring because of the improper expansion of the ARO facility, it is impossible for the County to determine what mitigation is required.

2. Minor Modification 21-054 Is Not Exempt As A Replacement of
Existing Facilities

The Minor Modification purports to authorize the replacement of the existing huller system that has been in operation since 1980. The new huller system will increase capacity and support nearly a doubling of the number of silos. The Minor Modification is not exempt from CEQA under CEQA Guidelines Section 15302(b), because the Minor Modification authorizes an
expansion of capacity, not just a replacement of existing equipment.

3. Minor Modification 21-054 Is Not Exempt As Construction of A Small
Structure

The additional truck scale and 16 silos are not small structures, but large, industrial scale pistachio processing equipment that will significantly increase the processing capacity of the facility. The 48-foot silos have the capacity to hold up to 2.5 million pounds of pistachios per silo, for a total capacity of approximately 40 million pounds of pistachios. As compared to the facility's currently approved capacity of approximately 50 million pounds, the Minor
Modification's authorization of the 16 new silos represents a 44% increase in capacity to 90
million pounds of pistachios. This is a substantial expansion of the existing use. The silos are
not comparable to a single family residence or structure not exceeding 2,500 square feet in floor area, as contemplated by CEQA Guidelines Section 15303.

4. Minor Modification 21-054 Is Excepted From A Categorical
Exemption

Pursuant to CEQA Guidelines Section 15300.2(c), there is a reasonable possibility that
the approval of the Minor Modification to allow an 80% increase in the silo storage capacity will
result in significant environmental impacts. As detailed in the attached report from Ramboll, the recent expansion of the processing facility, and further expansion authorized by the Minor Modifications, could result in significant impacts associated with air quality, hazards, noise, traffic, and water quality. Further, pursuant to CEQA Guidelines Section 15300.2(b), the identified potential environmental impacts could result in cumulative impacts, which would
except the Minor Modifications from either of the stated categorical exemptions.

5. The County & Applicant Improperly Piecemealed the Project
The serial authorization of additional construction at the facility is improper
piecemealing. The Minor Modification, when reviewed together with the previously approved
Minor Modifications, represent an exponential increase in the facility's capacity (increasing silo

capacity alone by at least 1,000 percent, if not far more) as compared to what was originally authorized by the Special Use Permit. The failure to consider the full environmental impacts of this large-scale expansion as a whole constitutes improper piecemealing in violation of CEQA.

CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines, and long-standing precedent make clear that CEQA
review must precede public agency action to move forward with a planned project. a The CEQA Guidelines define a project as "the whole of an action, which has a potential for resulting in either a direct physical change to the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment" (Guidelines §15378 subd. (a)), and require that "all phases of project planning, implementation, and operation" must be considered in the Initial Study for a project (Guidelines, §15063 subd. (a)(1), emphasis added). CEQA review and the application of CEQA procedures must be followed at all stages of project consideration, to carry out the legislative intent "to compel government at all levels to make decisions with environmental consequences in mind." (Bozung v. LAFCo. (1975) 13 Cal.3d 263, 283.)
The timing of the requests for the Minor Modifications, including Minor Modification 21-054, indicate that a larger expansion was planned and then individual modifications were requested for portions of the overall expansion - a classic case of piecemealing. The County cannot avoid its obligation to evaluate the environmental impacts of this major expansion by
parsing the review and approvals in this manner.
Under CEQA, neither a lead agency nor a project applicant can piecemeal a single, integrated development into smaller parts to avoid conducting a comprehensive CEQA
assessment of the entire project. Where, as in the case here, a project applicant makes clear that it has a comprehensive development plan, the lead agency is required to analyze the whole of that project before authorizing construction.

BEFORE THE ZONING ADMINISTRATOR

COUNTY OF TULARE, STATE OF CALIFORNIA

IN THE MATTER OF SPECIAL USE PERMIT
DECISION NO. 2028
APPLICATION NO. PSP 96-074 (ZA)
Decision of the Zoning Administrator of the County of Tulare approving a Special Use Permit requested by Mehdi Orandi, 19570 Avenue 88, Terra Bella, CA 93270 to bring an existing agricultural packing facility into conformance and allow an expansion to said use on approximately 3.8 acres of a 78.48 acre site in the AE-40 (Exclusive Agricultural 40 acre minimum) Zone on property located on the north side of Avenue 88, 1/2 mile east of Road 192, west of Terra Bella.
The Zoning Administrator hereby determines the following findings were relevant in evaluating this application:

l. An application for a Special Use Permit has been filed pursuant to the regulations contained in Section 16 of Ordinance No. 352, the Zoning Ordinance.

2. Under Board of Supervisors' Resolution No. 83-459, as amended, and Section 16 of the Tulare County Zoning Ordinance, the Zoning Administrator is authorized to approve or deny requests for special use permits for expansion of ag processing facilities where more than one-half of the product is produced on site and less than 10 persons are employed.

3. Staff has given notice of the Zoning Administrator's intention to consider the granting of a Special Use Permit as provided in Section 16 of said Ordinance No. 352 and as provided in Section 65905 of the Government Code of the State of California.

4. Staff has performed necessary investigations, prepared a written
report and recommended certain conditions of approval if this application is approved by the Zoning Administrator.

5. A public hearing was conducted on December 12, 1996, in Room 109 of the Planning and Development Department Offices in order to receive public testimony on the proposed application. No one appeared to speak regarding this project at the public hearing.

6. The applicant has requested a Special Use Permit to bring an existing agricultural packing facility into conformance and allow expansion of the facility on approximately 3.8 acres of a 78.48 acre site in the AE-40 (Exclusive Agricultural-40 acre minimum) Zone. The site is located on the north side of Avenue 88, 1/2 mile east of Road 192, west of Terra Bella. APN 319-130-19 Sec. 2, T 26 E, MDB&M 23 S, R

7. The site is zoned AE-40 and contains an existing packing facility and pistachio grove. The properties to the north and south are zoned AE-40 and contain orchards and fallow land. The l1and to the

Decision No. 2028
Zoning Administrator
Page 2

east is zoned AE-20 (Exclusive Agricultural-20 acre minimum) and is planted in a vineyard and the Friant-Kern Canal is also to the east. West of the subject site is an orchard and packing facility on property zoned AE-40.

8. The site is not within any Urban Area Boundary and is therefore,
subject to the Rural Valley Lands Plan policies which state that some agricultural industries are allowed to support the agricultural
products.

9. The proposal is consistent with the Tulare County General Plan.

10. The site is within Agricultural Preserve No. 2527 , a contracted pre- serve. Because the use is existing, serves the adjacent agricultur- al crop and does not remove any additional land from agricultural production, the findings can be made that the use is consistent with all principles of compatibility as set forth in Government Code Section 51238.1.

11. The packing facility has direct access to Avenue 88, a 50-foot wide, County-maintained right of way. The ultimate right of way is 60-
feet. Due to the traffic generated by the packing facility, it is found that a five-foot dedication of right of way is appropriate across the portion of the site having frontage for the packing facility.

12. The applicant has constructed a 5,075 sq. ft. addition between the two existing buildings for storage and shipping of pistachios grown on-site. This expansion was commenced without use permit approval, however, the applicant obtained a building permit (A9602611) on September 30, 1996 with the notice that they could proceed at their own risk. This special use permit was filed on September 17, 1996. Approval of this use permit will bring the use into compliance with zoning requirements.

13. The packing facility was originally constructed in 1983 to serve their pistachio grove which was planted in 1976. In 1983, no special use permit was required. On August 5, 1986, the AE-40 Zone was amended by Ordinance No. 2720 to add establishments for the curing, processing, packaging, packing, storage and shipping of agricultural products to the list of uses requiring a special use permit. Upon adoption of said ordinance amendment, existing facilities became non-conforming uses, however, expansions of non- conforming uses require approval of a special use permit.

14. A Negative Declaration was prepared for the project and approved for public review by the Environmental Assessment Officer indicating that the project will not have significant effect on the environ-
ment.

Decision No. 2028
Zoning Administrator
Page 3

The Zoning Administrator hereby finds the proposed Special Use Permit will not have a significant effect on the environment and certifies that a Negative Declaration for said use permit has been completed in compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act and the State Guidelines for the Implementa- tion of the California Environmental Quality Act of 1970 and that the Zoning Administrator has reviewed and considered the information contained in the Negative Declaration prior to taking action on the Special Use Permit.
The Zoning Administrator, after considering all of the evidence presented, found that the establishment, maintenance, and operation of the use of building or land applied for will not, under the circumstances of the particular case, be detrimental to the health, safety, and general welfare of persons residing or working in the neighborhood or to the general welfare of the County.

Exhibit "A") and with the Site Plan Development Standards pertaining to a use of this type adopted by the Planning Commission on February 20, 1970.

2. Regardless of Condition No. 1 above, the Planning and Development Director is authorized to approve minor modifications in the
approved plans upon a request by the applicant, or his successors as long as said modifications do not materially affect the deter- mination of the Zoning Administrator. Such modifications shall be noted on the approved plans and shall be initialed by the Planning
and Development Director.

3. Al1 exterior lighting shall be so adjusted as to deflect direct rays away from public roadways and adjacent properties.

4. Any structures built shall conform to the building regulations and the building line setbacks of the Ordinance Code of Tulare County insofar as said regulations and setbacks are applicable to such structures except as modified herein.

5. The applicant or his contractor shall obtain a final inspection on building permit no. special use permit. A9602611 within 60 days of approval of this

6. The property owner(s) shall sign and record a Right to Farm Notice together with the Decision approving this special use permit. (Right to Farm Notice attached)

Decision No. 2028
Zoning Administrator
Page 4

7. Five feet of additional right of way shall be dedicated along the north side of Avenue 88 along the western 560 feet of the property. Dedication shall be in the form of an Irrevocable Offer.

8. The conditions of approval required herein shall be complied with within 60 days from the date of the Zoning Administrator's signed
decision in order that the safety and general welfare of the persons using said premises, and the traveling public, shall be protected. If said conditions of approval are not complied with within said 60 day time period, the County may commence revocation/modification proceedings in accordance with Section 18 of the Tulare County Zoning Ordinance. The Zoning Administrator may grant one or more extensions of said 60 day time period, upon written request by the applicant.

9. This Special Use Permit will not be effective until ten (10) days after the date of the Zoning Administrator's signed decision and until the applicant, at his own expense, has executed and filed with the County Recorder, a certified copy of the decision of the Zoning Administrator granting said permit with duly authorized accep- tance, in the form approved by the County Counsel, endorsed thereon.

10. All standard conditions and all special conditions of approval of this Special Use Permit must be complied with at all times in order to continue the use or uses allowed. Compliance with such condi- tions is subject to review at any time. An initial review of compliance shall be conducted by the Zoning Administrator three months after the granting of the Special Use Permit. Additional
reviews may be undertaken at the discretion of the Zoning Adminis- trator.

l1. This Special Use Permit shall automatically expire and become null and void two (2) years after the use for which it was granted is discontinued or abandoned. However, upon application by the
applicant, or his/her successor, the Zoning Administrator may extend the expiration date in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Zoning Ordinance.

SPECIAL USE PERMIT MINOR MODIFICATION

NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN that pursuant to Section 18 of the Tulare County
Zoning Ordinance (Ordinance No. 352, as amended), the County Administrative Officer and the
Economic Development & Planning Director of the County of Tulare have reviewed the request
of the applicant (Touchstone Pistachio CO., LLC, 1396 West Herndon Avenue #110, Fresno,
CA, 93711. Agent: Jeffrey Roberts) for a minor modification to Special Use Permit No. 96-074,
which brought an existing agricultural packing facility into conformance and allowed for
expansion of use at 19570 Avenue 88, Terra Bella in the AE-40 (Exclusive Agricultural - 40-
Acre Minimum) Zone. The requested minor modification to Minor Modification No., MIM 18-
009 which was recorded on April 11, 2018, as document number 2018-0018681; Minor
Modification No., MIM 17-034 which was recorded on February 2, 2018, as document number
2018-0005130; Minor Modification No., MIM 15-006 which was recorded on April 8, 2015, as
document number 2015-0017895; and Special Use Permit No. PSP 96-074, decision number
2028 which was approved by the Tulare County Zoning Administrator and recorded on June 14,
2001 as document number 2001-0044615, is to allow for sixteen (16) additional storage silos,
one truck scale, and refurbish the "huller line". This will allow for greater efficiency, and is
described and depicted, respectively, in attached Exhibits "A" and "B" which are made a part
hereof.

Based on a review of all of the relevant facts and circumstances relating to this request, it

is hereby found and determined as follows:

(1) Pursuant to Section 18 of the Tulare County Zoning Ordinance, the requested
modification is minor in nature, will not result in a substantial change or alteration
to the use approved or any conditions imposed in connection with Special Use
Permit No. PSP 96-074, and is in conformance based on the following grounds:
The request will not change will not alter the original intent of the project site
(Pistachio Processing Facility) and all addition will occur on the already approved
site.

(2) Modifying the originally approved site development plan does not add any
additional uses to the site and may result in increased in traffic.

(3) The requested modification does not compromise the integrity of conditionally
approved Minor Modification No. MIM 18-009, Minor Modification No. MIM
17-034, Minor Modification No. MIM 15-006 or, Special Use Permit No. PSP 96-
074, as the proposed modification does not substantially affect or revise any of the
original conditions of approval.

(4) The minor modification, and all activities conducted, continues to comply with
Tulare County Development Standards as they pertain to the subject site. The
applicant is not in violation of conditions of approval of Minor Modification No.
MIM 18-009, Minor Modification No. MIM 17-034, Minor Modification No.
MIM 15-006 or, Special Use Permit No. PSP 96-074, nor any applicable federal,
state or local law.

(5) CEQA Review: The proposed activities are excluded or exempt from the
California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") on the following separate and
independent grounds:

(a) To the extent that any local permits (e.g., building or encroachment permits)
are required to be obtained by Waterman Valve or their designees, it is
concluded that these permits are exempt from CEQA on the grounds that
these permits encompass activities involving ministerial authority (Public
Resources Code Sections 21080(b)(1); and 14 Cal. Code Regs. Section
15302 pertaining to Replacement or Reconstruction and Section 15303
pertaining to New Construction.

(b) All of the activities contemplated herein would be exempt from CEQA
pursuant to Replacement or Reconstruction (14 Cal. Code Regs. Section
15302) and New Construction (14 Cal. Code Regs. Section 15303). A
Notice of Exemption (NOE) shall be filed with the Tulare County Clerk
evidencing the CEQA exemptions expressed herein and Touchstone
Pistachio Co., LLC shall pay the filing fees for such NOE.

(6) This minor modification shall be a part of Special Use Permit No. PSP 96-074
and any violation of this modification by the applicant (including any person
acting in concert therewith) shall be subject to all remedies allowed by law,
including, but not limited to, the remedies set forth in Sections 16 and 18 of the
Tulare County Zoning Ordinance.

(7) Indemnity: The applicant, Touchstone Pistachio Co., LLC, agrees to hold
harmless, defend and indemnify Tulare County, its agents, officers and employees
from and against any liability, claims, actions, costs, damages or losses of any
kind arising out of the activities of the owners and operators, or its agents, officers
and employees, under this Minor Modification. This indemnification obligation
shall continue beyond the term of this minor modification as to any acts or
omissions occurring under this minor modification or any extension of this minor

modification.

Based on the foregoing findings, determinations, facts and circumstances in relation
hereto, the requested minor modification of Special Use Permit No. PSP 96-074 is hereby
approved and is described and depicted, respectively, in attached Exhibits "A" and "B." The
original use permit is attached as Exhibit "C." This minor modification shall be duly recorded
forthwith in the records of the Tulare County Clerk/Recorder.

Re: Permits Associated with Minor Modification 21-054

Dear Mr. Schenke:

On January 3, 2022, we filed an appeal of the County's issuance of Minor Modification No. 21-054 on behalf of our clients, the Wonderful Company, Wonderful Citrus II, LLC, and
related entities.

Minor Modification No. 21-054 purports to modify Special Use Permit No. 96-074 to allow for the addition of sixteen storage silos, a truck scale, and a refurbished huller line at Touchstone Pistachios, Inc.'s commercial pistachio processing facility operated at 19570 Avenue 88 near Terra Bella. We understand that the County is currently processing the appeal and will
be scheduling a hearing on the matter soon.

It has come to our attention that your Agency is currently processing building permit applications Nos. A2200068 and A2200069 for upgrades to a huller system at the Touchstone Pistachio facility pursuant to Minor Modification No. 21-054. Minor Modification No. 21-054, Attachment A [listing "Replacement of older equipment and components for huller line"].)
Minor Modification No. 21-054 has been appealed and is not final. Therefore, the County cannot rely on Minor Modification No. 21-054 to issue Building Permit Nos. A2200068
and A2200069 or any other building permits.

The Touchstone Pistachio facility lacks the underlying land-use approval re uired by the
County's Zoning Ordinance to authori e the re uested permits and any building permits issued
in reliance on Minor Modification No. 21-054 must be revoked.

For these reasons, we respectfully re uest that the County not issue any permits predicated on Minor Modification No. 21-054.

January 14, 2022 Page 2

We look forward to County's consideration of our appeal to Minor Modification No. 21-

Re: Appeal of Minor Modification No. 21-054

Dear Mr. Pierce:

We write in response to your email dated February 9, 2022 (attached).
The County's decision not to hear Wonderful's appeal of a land use permit is incorrect, legally and factually. The County's decision to deny Wonderful its right to petition the
government for redress violates state law, the County Code, and Wonderful's constitutional
rights.
The County's denial of Wonderful's right to be heard, "unless or until a court issues a ruling that Wonderful has standing to pursue such an appeal" is wrong for multiple reasons.
CEQA mandates that the Board hear Wonderful's appeal. Public Resources Code
Section 21151(c) grants Wonderful a right to appeal the Resource Management Agency's
determination to the Board of Supervisors. ("If a nonelected decisionmaking body of a local lead agency … determines that a project is not subject to [CEQA], that certification, approval, or determination may be appealed to the agency's elected decisionmaking body, if any."); see San
Diegans for Open Government v. City of San Diego, 6 Cal.App.5th 995, 1004.) The County's refusal to hear Wonderful's appeal violates CEQA.
The County cannot make up new administrative burdens for one party. The County has
no authority to demand Wonderful affirmatively demonstrate "standing" to participate in the
County's administrative process. The County Code contains no "standing" requirement and the County has not cited to any such provisions. Making up the rules and refusing to hear
Wonderful's appeal is ultra vires and violates Wonderful's constitutionally protected due process
rights.

The County's stated reasons for not hearing Wonderful's appeal are spurious. The
County parrots Touchstone's Cross-Complaint filed in Tulare Superior Court Case No.

March 3, 2022
Page 2

LATHAM&WATKINSLP

VCU290229 in asserting that Wonderful "lacks standing." However, Touchstone has led the
County astray. The Superior Court's decision in Case No. VCU290229 is inapplicable to the current administrative appeal and Wonderful clearly does have standing to appeal the current land use approvals.
The Superior Court's decision in Wonderful's challenge to the County's issuance of building permits found that Wonderful did not have standing in that case. Judge Hillman made
this very clear holding that "there is insufficient record evidence that [Petitioners'] property
interests or its employees' health will suffer harm as a result of issuance of the Building Permits." In denying Touchstone's Motion for Attorneys' Fees, Judge Hillman further clearly explained that "in this case. this court finds that Wonderful lacks [public right/public interest] standing.' Judge Hillman did not hold Wonderful did not have standing to challenge future County land use approvals.
And Judge Hillman's decision, which is on appeal and therefore not a final decision on the merits, certainly did not address whether Wonderful has standing to seek relief through the
County's administrative process. We are aware of nothing in the County Code, CEQA, or otherwise that requires an aggrieved party to establish standing before the County hears an
appeal under CEQA. The County cites none in its February 9, 2022, email.
In all events, Wonderful has standing. Wonderful owns property about one mile from Touchstone's facility and Wonderful is directly impacted by the County's issuance of permits to allow Touchstone to expand that facility. Wonderful, therefore, is beneficially interested. These
impacts are detailed in our appeal, our petition challenging the County's land use permit, and in the attached declarations. Also attached is evidence of the expansion's potential environmental
impacts that the County must assess under CEQA.

*****

Thank you for your attention to these important issues.

Lastly, although the County's February 9, 2022, correspondence states that the County rejects Wonderful's settlement offer, Wonderful's settlement offer stands and we remain
available to discuss these issues with you.

Very truly yours,

Subject: Wonderful/ARO Appeal and Writ

Dear Counsel,

This email is regarding the matter of Wonderful Citrus II LLC et al v. County of Tulare and Tulare County Resource
Management Agency, Tulare Superior Court Case no. VCU290229 ("Wonderful |l"). On February 8, 2022, the Tulare
County Board of Supervisors authorized this office to defend the County and to tender the County's defense to
ARO/Touchstone. Please direct all future communications regarding Wonderful II to this office.
One of the issues in Wonderful Il is whether Wonderful has standing to appeal County land use approvals at
ARO/Touchstone's pistachio processing plant in Terra Bella. The issue of standing bears directly on Wonderful's
underlying appeal of Tulare County Minor Modification MIM 21-054. In the prior related case of Wonderful Citrus II LLC
et al v. County of Tulare and Tulare County Resource Management Agency, Tulare Superior Court Case no. VCU283508
("Wonderful !"), the Court ruled that Wonderful did not have standing to appeal land use approvals at the Terra Bella
plant. Wonderful l and Wonderful II are based on similar facts and legal issues.

The issue of standing is currently before the Tulare County Superior Court in Wonderful II, and the Fifth District Court of
Appeal in Wonderful I. The County will therefore not hold a hearing on Wonderful's appeal of MIM 21-054 unless or until
a court issues a ruling that Wonderful has standing to pursue such an appeal, as the Court's ruling in Wonderful l has
determined that Wonderful lacks standing to do so. The County Resource Management Agency will continue to process
building permits in accordance with the Court's ruling in Wonderful l.

As final matter, the County thanks Mr. Arnone for his settlement offer dated February 7, 2022. The offer is rejected.
The County does not wish to make a counteroffer at this time.

Please let me know if you have any questions regarding this matter.

Thank you,

ATTACHMENT B

I, Danny Garcia, declare the following:

1. I am Sr. Director of Human Resources for Wonderful Citrus (Wonderful). The
3 facts provided herein are based on my personal knowledge, and if called upon to do so, I could
and would competently testify thereto.

2. I currently have 20 + years of Human Resources experience and possess Bachelor
6 of Science in Business Administration with a concentration in Human Resources.
7 3. Part of my professional responsibilities include the Wave Ranch in Tulare County,
8 4. Wonderful values its employees, as all good businesses do. Without its
employees, Wonderful could not function as a business.

10 A. Wonderful's Concerns Regarding the Touchstone Facility's Expansion

11 5. Wonderful's concems over the Touchstone processing facility include the

12 potential, unstudied impacts that the facility's expansion would have on Wonderful's workforce,
13 many of whom drive past the Touchstone facility to and from work every day and all of whom
14 work just over a mile from that facility. Avenue 88 is a narrow two-lane road. I believe that
15 more truck traffic on this road will increase the risk of traffic accidents involving our workforce.

16 6. Wonderful is similarly concerned about other potential impacts of the Touchstone
17 processing facility on its workforce, including, for example, impacts related to hazardous air
18 quality from fires at that facility or odors emanating from that facility, which have been reported
19 in the press or by regulatory agencies; see, for example, https://www.visaliatimesdelta.com/storv/
20 news/2017/11/27/fire-destrovs-150-tons-pistachios/897232001/ (Exhibit A); copies of air district

21 complaints (Exhibit B). The Wave Ranch is just over one mile from the Touchstone facility, and
22 employees on site are at risk of impacts from the Touchstone facility's operations throughout the

23 a day, on a daily basis. This includes impacts to our employees' health from increased air emissions
24 and odors the Touchstone facility's increased operations will generate.

25 B. Wonderful's Employees Are Important

26 7. The absence of employees due the time needed to recover from incidents like

27 traffic accidents or illness from increased exposure to adverse environmental impacts hurts not

28 only our workforce, but the Wave Ranch generally. The Wave Ranch cannot operate without the

DECLARATION
1

1 regular attendance of its workforce, as scheduled and planned.

2 8. Finally, as should be well-known, there is a significant labor shortage, so it is not

3 the case that the absence of any employee, whether temporary or permanent, is easily addressed.

4 E.g., Emily Hamann, Amid rising costs and limited availability, farmers struggle to find enough

5 workers, Sacramento Business Journal (Apr. 24, 2020),
6 https://www.bizjournals.com/sacramento/news/2020/04/24/amid-rising-costs-and-limited-

7 availability-farmers.html.

8 C. Conclusion

9 9. As valued members of Wonderful's team and mission, our employees' absence
10 hurts our operational readiness and ability to deliver our product to consumers.

11 declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. Executed in the
12 County of Kern, California, on February 23, 2022.

Firefighters are on the scene of a fire near Avenue 88 and Road 196. Tulare County Fire Department

A fire burned through more than 250 tons of pistachios in Tulare County early
Monday morning.
The cost of damages is estimated at $1.6 million, said fire Capt. Joanne Bear.
Employees of Terra Bella's Aro Pistachio called firefighters just after 4 a.m. to
the business near Avenue 88 and Road 196. Witnesses told dispatchers flames
were seen coming from pistachio bins.

The pistachios had just recently been fumigated. The product used - which
becomes flammable when wet is suspected of starting the fire.

"The rain was unexpected and it just erupted," said CEO Adam Orandi. "It
went up like a ball of fire. It looked like a torch."

When firefighters arrived, they discovered multiple plastic storage bins on fire.

Firefighters were able to stop the spread of flames to nearby structures. The
fire burned through 280 tons of pistachios and 350 plastic bins, firefighters
said.

The damages make up 5 percent of Aro's inventory. The plant has just finished
harvesting. Thanksgiving was the first break for workers since August, Orandi
said.

"It's painful," Orandi said. "We're still assessing the damage. It's a loss we all
feel. A loss of work and a loss of jobs."

Crews remained on scene late into the afternoon to monitor the incident as
flash fires were a concern.

Aro Pistachios is a family-owned business that has been in Terra Bella since
1971. The first tree was planted by founder Dr. Mehdi Orandi, according to the
company's website.

Orandi Ranch orchards grow three pistachio varieties in the rural Tulare
County community. Last year, Orandi harvested more than 11 million pounds
of pistachios.

10/3/19, RI (reporting inspector) Brian Clough arrived at the location where
pistachios were being unloaded from trucks onto a dirt lot. RI called the RP (reporting person) for more details. The RP stated that pistachio shells were being composted, which was attracting flies and causing an odor. RI then contacted Greg,
a manager from ARO Pistachio who was responsible for the operation. Greg
acknowledged that the flies had been an issue and said they had sprayed the piles on
Wednesday, October 2nd in order the control the fly populations. He also mentioned
that ARO Pistachio was offering to buy fly traps for the neighboring homes to help
them with the issue. RI confirmed both the odor and the flies, which were swarming
the entire area.

- DECLARATION OF TODD CONSOLASCIO

2 I, Todd Consolascio, declare the following:

3 1.

4 I am the Northern Division Farming Director for the Wave Ranch located at

5 Avenue 80 and Road 192 in Tulare County, California. The facts provided herein are based on

6 my personal knowledge and, if called upon to do so, I could and would competently testify

thereto.

7 2.

8 I received my college degree in agricultural business from California State

9 University, Fresno in 1997. After receiving my degree, I worked in agricultural consulting for

10 about five years, then started working for Wonderful Citrus. I have worked at Wonderful Citrus

11 for 18 years. I began my work at Wonderful Citrus in research and development (e.g., irrigation,

12 pest control, pruning, cultural methods) and then shifted into farm management. For the past

four

13 years, I have been the Northern Division Farming Director. In this role, I oversee the Wave

Ranch and other ranches in the area.

14 3.

15 Wave Ranch is roughly 120 acres of citrus (seedless mandarins under the Halos
brand), which were planted in 2018. About six miles to the north is another citrus ranch that
16 oversee, which is about 400 acres. About three miles to the south on Avenue 56 is the Ducor

17 Ranch, which has another 1,500 acres of citrus.

18 4.

19 As the Northern Division Farming Director, I oversee the operation of Wave

Ranch and other citrus ranches in the area. I visit the Wave Ranch roughly one to two times per

20 week to supervise the farm manager, who is generally responsible for the ranch's day-to-day

21 operations.

22 5.

23 Wave Ranch is located approximately 1.15 miles southeast of Touchstone's Terra

24 Bella pistachio processing facility located at 19570 Avenue 88 in Tulare County. Exhibit 1 is a

25 map showing Wave Ranch's location and Touchstone's location. Exhibit 2 a is a map showing

26 Touchstone's Terra Bella pistachio processing facility as well as Wonderful Citrus' other ranches
in the area, including the two referenced above.

27 6.

28 Given Wave Ranch's close proximity to Touchstone's Terra Bella processing
facility, Wave Ranch and its employees, including me, have experienced direct impacts from

LATHAM&WATKINSw
ATTORNEYS AT LAW
LOS ANGELES DECLARATION OF TODD CONSOLASCIO

1 Touchstone's ongoing operations. Touchstone's further expansion of its Terra Bella facility will

2 increase these impacts on Wave Ranch, its employees, and me. These impacts include traffic,

3 dust control and air quality, pest control, odors, water supply, and subsidence.

4 Overview of Wave Ranch Operations

5 7. Wave Ranch operates year-round. Therefore, Wave Ranch's employees,

6 including me, will experience impacts from Touchstone's operations on a year-round basis.

7 Harvesting Season Activities

8 8. The busiest season (harvesting) occurs from roughly mid-February to May.

9 Anywhere from 50 to 250 employees will be on site daily during this period.

10 9. Harvesting occurs in several stages and generally occurs from February to mid-

11 May. At the beginning of the season, we will go through the orchards and harvest fruit if they

12 are the appropriate size and color. Fruit that is smaller and immature at the beginning of the

13 harvest season are left behind to be picked at a later time (by mid-May).

14 10. Starting in early March, we work on netting. Netting requires a crew of
15 approximately 20 people and is completed by the end of March. Netting consists of covering
16 individual rows of trees with a semi-impermeable plastic netting to prevents bees from reaching

17 flowers and cross-pollinating the trees. This process prevents the fruit from becoming seeded.

18 11. In April, the citrus trees flower and we take the nets off, roughly by end of April

19 or mid-May once bloom is complete. After the nets are taken off, not all fruit will have fully
20 matured, so we continue to manage the crop to obtain the optimum size and quality for

21 harvesting prior to the end of the season in mid-May.

22 12. After harvesting is completed we do pruning work, which requires a crew of

23 about 18-20 people for about one month.

24 Post-Harvesting Season Activities

25 13. From roughly mid-May to November, two to three employees will be on site two

26 to three times per week, working on irrigation, fertilization, nutritional sprays, pest control as
27 needed, and road maintenance.

28

LATHAM&WATKINS-P
ATTORNEYS AT LAW DECLARATION OF TODD CONSOLASCIO

LOS ANGELES 2

1 14. From November to February, the on-site employees work on frost control.
2 Typically, these employees will monitor the temperatures in the orchard at night and manage the

3 temperatures in the orchard with wind machines or irrigation. For example, our orchards have

4 wind machines that can blow warmer air (6-7 degrees warmer, about 35 feet above the orchard)

5 down to the orchard. In addition, employees can also warm the orchard one to two degrees by

6 running microsprinklers. Depending on the time of year and status of the crop, frost control

7 methods will be initiated at 32-33 degrees or as low as 28-29 degrees.

8 Potential Impacts on Wave Ranch Operations

9 15. Touchstone's proposed expansion of its Terra Bella pistachio processing facility

10 will have a number of environmental impacts, particularly on our employees.

11 Increased Vehicular Traffic

12 16. Wave Ranch's employees primarily come from Porterville, which is located to the

13 north of Wave Ranch and the Touchstone processing facility. Employees take various paths of

14 travel to Wave Ranch from the Porterville area. Roads traveled include Avenue 88, which is the

15 road on which the Touchstone processing facility is located. As such, Wave Ranch employees
16 drive directly past Touchstone's processing facility on their way to and from work. Wave Ranch

17 employees also take Road 192 south to Avenue 80. The intersection of Road 192 and Avenue 80

18 is roughly 1 mile south of the intersection of Road 192 and Avenue 88. The Touchstone
19 processing facility is about ½ mile east of the intersection of Road 192 and Avenue 88.

20 17. Increased traffic on the roads surrounding Wave Ranch, including Avenue 88,

21 Avenue 80, and Road 192, will lead to a greater risk of frequency and severity of accidents.

22 Most of our employees drive relatively smaller personal vehicles, such as cars and light trucks.

23 At least one employee in the last year has been involved in a traffic accident commuting to and

24 from work on Road 192. Heavy trucking associated with an industrial scale processing facility

25 on the surrounding roadways will increase the risk to me and our employees on a daily basis.

26 Increased Dispersion of Pests and Increased Pest Control Efforts

27 18. Traffic on roadways surrounding and nearby Wave Ranch, including Road 192,

28 Avenue 88, and Avenue 80, generally kicks up a lot of dust into the air. As a result, insects and

LATHAM&WATKINS-
ATTORNEYS AT LAW DECLARATION OF TODD CONSOLASCIO

LOS ANGELES 3

1 mites become airborne and become displaced into nearby trees and then move throughout the

2 Wave Ranch orchards. This requires greater pest control, in particular, spraying of pesticides, to

3 protect the orchard and crop. The increased truck traffic associated with the additional silos and

4 truck scales at the Touchstone facility will result in an increase in the number of trucks going to

5 and from the Touchstone facility. The increase in trucks will lead to greater dust and pest

6 dispersion and a greater burden on Wave Ranch's pest control activities.

7 Increased Air Quality Impacts

8 19. The increased dust and emissions from diesel trucks on nearby roadways,

9 including on Road 192, Avenue 88, and Avenue 80, will worsen localized air quality impacts.

10 and my fellow employees breathe this air.

11 Increased Odors

12 20. In this area, depending on the winds, odors can travel up to 4 to 5 miles. Wave

13 Ranch is located about one mile from Touchstone's pistachio facility. Given the proximity of

14 Wave Ranch to Touchstone's pistachio facility, I believe there is a substantial risk that odors
15 emanating from it have been and will be experienced by me and other people working at Wave

16 Ranch.

17 21. It is my understanding that with the increase in capacity at the Touchstone facility
18 through the addition of 16 storage silos and a truck scale, there will be an increase in water usage

19 and, therefore, water storage in the wastewater ponds. I understand that if the ponds are not
20 managed properly, there will be a risk of more odors from Touchstone's facility.

21 Increased Security Demands & Risk of Loss

22 22. Increased development in the vicinity of our ranch may also require greater
23 physical security. In my experience, increased activity in an area leads to an increase of theft.

24 This includes theft of farm equipment or theft of crops. With the additional activity that will be

25 created by Touchstone's expansion, there is an increased risk of loss from Wave Ranch. As a
26 result, the further expansion of the Touchstone processing facility may require us to install

27 greater security measures at our ranch-for example, the installation of additional fencing.

28

LATHAM&WATKINS-P
ATTORNEYS AT LAW DECLARATION OF TODD CONSOLASCIO

LOS ANGELES 4

- Increased impacts to water supply and subsidence

2 23.

3 two reasons. Water supply and pumping issues a are also a significant concern for our ranch, for

4 24.

5 The first concern is related to water supply. Our ranch has a deep well water

6 pump from which it draws groundwater. Production from this well has been decreasing, and

7 increased groundwater pumping from other sites in this area will reduce water resources

8 available for existing agricultural operations, including our ranch. I understand that the

9 Touchstone facility also relies on groundwater. Given the close proximity of the Touchstone
facility to Wave Ranch, about 1.15 miles, I am concerned that additional pumping will further
10 impact our groundwater well.

11 25.

12 In addition, though the ranch also draws water from the Friant-Kern Canal, the

13 Canal has lost approximately 60% of its capacity in this area.' As is well-known in this area,
there is an extreme drought that is putting significant pressure on crops.2

14 26.

15 The second concern is subsidence. I have observed increased subsidence in this

16 area (on our ranch to the north) due to groundwater pumping activities, where I observed damage

17 to a groundwater well on that ranch due to subsidence. The problem of subsidence is well-

18 known in the area and the industry, especially because Friant-Kern Canal Middle Reach Capacity

19 Correction Project' recently broke ground to address this problem with respect to the Canal.

27. The Touchstone facility is located approximately 2,500 feet from the Friant-Kern
20 Canal. Increased pumping by Touchstone could lead to increased subsidence that could impact

21

22 the Friant-Kern Canal and thereby impact Wave Ranch's ability to draw water from it.

DECLARATION OF DAVE SZEFLIN

2 I, Dave Szeflin, declare the following:

3 1. I am Executive Vice President, Operations for Wonderful Pistachios & Almonds

4 LLC. The facts provided herein are based on my personal knowledge, and if called upon to do
5 so, I could and would competently testify thereto.

6 2. have a degree in Industrial Technology from Southern Illinois University. I have
7 worked in the agricultural industry in California since 1992, including in the management of
8 pistachio and almond growing operations and processing facilities.

q 3. There are several steps to bring a pistachio nut from the tree to the consumer
10 (industrial or otherwise). The nuts are harvested from the pistachio grove and placed into bottom
11 dump trailers. From there, the nuts are transported to a processing facility where they are cleaned
12 and evaluated for size and quality. A pistachio from the tree consists of an outer hull, inner shell,
13 and the nut. In the first step of processing, abrasive rollers remove the hulls using a significant
14 amount of water. The pistachios then go through a float separator, where the "good" nuts sink to
15 the bottom and are conveyed out for drying.
16 4. The wastewater from the wet hulling process must then be strained to remove the
17 hulls before the wastewater is placed in holding ponds. The water in these ponds still contains
18 dissolved solids, which limits its reuse. Under California law, the water can be spread out over
19 land, but only in a manner that does not result in the change of the chemistry of the existing dirt.
20 5. At Wonderful Pistachios & Almonds LLC, we capture the water from the hulling
21 process and move it to a holding pond a half-mile away, through a system of trough conveyors.
22 The water is then strained. After resting in the settling pond to allow the remaining solids to drop
23 out, the water is then used to irrigate the adjacent land. Without adjacent land, another disposal
24 mechanism would be required, nearly all of which are cost prohibitive (e.g., shipping the water).
25 6. Some pistachio processors opt to leave the water in ponds until the ponds dry out.
26 This is not the best method because of the extreme odor that results. At about the 5 or 6 week 5

27 mark, the rotting hulls will emanate a noxious stench. The longer the water is held in place, the
28 farther the stench will drift. At the six to eight month mark, one should expect that the rot will be

smelled approximately a mile away.

2 7. I am familiar with the Touchstone Facility, Terra Bella, and have visited it on at
3 least 3 occasions. At the times I visited, the site was a "patchwork facility" that seemed to have

4 expanded over the years in piecemeal fashion.

5 8. My understanding is that the site is currently improved with a pistachio

6 processing facility comprised of receiving pits, a pre-cleaner, huller lines, 16 26-foot long
7 pistachio dryers, four small silos and 20 48-foot diameter/55-foot tall silos, and a 184 acre-foot

8 capacity anaerobic pond. The existing facility and its 20 48-foot diameter/55-foot tall silos have

9 a total processing capacity of 40.7 million pounds of pistachios. I understand that Touchstone
10 has previously stated the facility in its current configuration has capacity to process 50 million
11 pounds of pistachio.

12 9. My further understanding is that Touchstone has received approvals from the
13 County of Tulare to expand its facility further. This further expansion would include sixteen
14 additional 48-foot diameter/55-foot tall silos, an additional truck scale and new huller system.
15 Each 48-foot diameter/55-foot tall silo can hold approximately 1.7 million pounds of pistachios.
16 10. Based on the completed and planned silo construction, it appears that the site
17 seeks to increase capacity from 40.7 million pounds of pistachios per year to 77 million pounds.
18 This is an increase of over 36 million pounds of pistachios and an approximate 89% increase in
19 capacity.

20 11. Processing an additional 36.3 million pounds of pistachios would create a need
21 for additional resources, including: (1) natural gas: increase from approximate current use of 360
22 decatherms per day to 681 decatherms per day; (2) fumigants: increase from approximate current
23 use of 1,682 pounds per year to 3,182 pounds per year; and (3) staffing: increase from 80
24 employees on site to 151 employees on site.

25 12. Based on my experience and the information set forth above, an increased
26 capacity of 36.3 million pounds will further require an increase from 73 trucks per day to
27 138 trucks per day during the harvest (which lasts between 30-45 days).
28 13. A total of approximately 125 truckloads is required to fill a single 48-foot

2 diameter/55-foot tall silo. Thus, each silo will generate approximately 250 total trips. The

3 additional 16 silos, if filled, will generate approximately 4,000 trips during the brief harvest

season.

4 14.

5 This is a total increase in trucks from 2,200 to 4,162 during the harvest, assuming

6 a 30-day harvest period. The trucks per day may vary on peak harvesting days, where the number

7 of trucks will be higher than at the beginning and end of the harvest. The increased volume of

8 pistachios will require an additional amount of acres to be harvested - from approximately

9 14,034 acres to 26,551 acres. The average amount of pistachios grown on an acre of land is

10 approximately 2,805 pounds, skewed down slightly for drought years. The closest pistachio
grove owned by the Assemis that I am aware

11 Touchstone processing site. of is located approximately 50 miles from the

12 15.

13 Based on this estimate of increased capacity from 40.7 to 77 million, the water

14 required for hulling will be approximately 2,500 gallons per minute. Additional waste will

15 include the removed hulls, which will have to be hauled away, and pistachio shells with no

16 kernels inside ("blanks"). Each truckload of pistachios is approximately 50,000 pounds, and will

17 yield one-third of that weight in pistachios, one-third in hull waste, and one-third in water loss.

REVIEW OF THE POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF
THE PROPOSED PISTACHIO PROCESSING PLANT IN
TULARE COUNTY, CALIFORNIA

Dear Ms. Hoye: March 3, 2022

Ramboll US Corporation (Ramboll) has prepared this evaluation of the potential
environmental impacts associated with the Minor Modification No 21-054 Ramboll

(Modification) issued for Touchstone Pistachio Co.'s Facility (Touchstone Facility) 5 Park Plaza

located at 19750 Ave 88, Terra Bella, California. Suite 500
Irvine, CA 92614

f We have evaluated if the construction and operations associated with the recently USA

granted Minor Modification No. 21-054 for the Touchstone Facility may cause T +1 949 261 5151
environmental impacts. F +1 949 261 6202

Minor Modification No. 21-054 authorizes development that has the potential to lead www.ramboll.com

to significant environmental impacts, including impacts on Wonderful Citrus II LLC's
orchard, called Wave Ranch, located approximately one mile to the south and the
employees who work there.
We have summarized our findings based on the information reviewed to date on these
potential environmental impacts. A copy of my curriculum vitae is attached as is
Exhibit A.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND AND ISSUES
Minor Modification MIM 21-054 approves the following changes to the Touchstone
Facility:
16 (sixteen) new 48-foot diameter, 55-foot tall silos for pistachio storage;
Replacement of existing equipment and components for huller line; and
One new outbound truck/trailer scale.
The documentation released by the County on the approval of Minor Modification
No. 21-054 and related CEQA Exemption determination provide no information about
the existing equipment and components of the huller line that will be replaced.
Further, it fails to evaluate the potential impacts associated with changes to the
Touchstone Facility that the Modification would trigger. The new and expanded
structures approved under Minor Modification No. 21-054 will increase the throughput
that could occur at the current facility. Notably increasing the number of large silos,
which are the key storage component related to pistachio processing, replacing the

1/13

RAMBOLL

a huller line with a modern system that will likely increase processing efficiency, and a new truck/trailer
scale for a total of two at the facility will increase the facility's capacity.
The 16 additional silos will greatly increase the operating throughput of the Touchstone Pistachio
Facility. Increasing the number of the 55-foot tall storage silos from 20 to 36 is an 80 percent increase
in storage capacity. Given the limited harvesting season for pistachios of approximately six weeks, the
80 percent increase in capacity would be expected to increase the emissions by 80 percent during the
season when the pistachios must be processed. The County approved the Modification without
evaluating its potential environmental impacts. The County imposed no mitigation related to the
potentially significant environmental impacts the Modification may cause.
Based on Touchstone's prior statements that the pre-Modification capacity was approximately
50 million pounds of pistachios in one harvest season (see Exhibit B), it is estimated that the
additional silos may allow an additional capacity of nearly 40 million pounds of pistachios, for a total of
approximately 90 million pounds of pistachios. The increase in production capacity will have potentially
significant environmental impacts that have not been evaluated, nor has the County imposed
mitigation measures related to these potential environmental impacts. Potentially significant
environmental impacts to the environment and nearby properties are discussed further below.

Hazards
The expanded Touchstone Pistachio Facility will require increased use of chemicals and materials that
are considered hazards and/or hazardous materials. Based on my review, the County has not
evaluated for or imposed feasible mitigation measures to address these potentially significant
environmental impacts.
Hazards are associated with fumigant usage at pistachio processing facilities. For example, in 2017, a
fire erupted at the facility under prior ownership due to the fumigated pistachios coming in contact
with water (Exhibit C). As discussed above, the Touchstone Pistachio Facility expects to use much
greater quantities of fumigants given the increased number of silos. Thereby, in consideration of this
past event, there is in increased likelihood for an event that is a hazard to the public and environment
based on the potential for an outbreak of large fire. As an additional example of the hazard risk, the
SDS for Fumitoxin® lists that the material is classified as:
Flame: in contact with water releases flammable gases which may ignite spontaneously;

• Skull and crossbones: fatal if swallowed or inhaled;
Corrosion: causes serious eye damage; and
Environment: very toxic to aquatic life.
The Touchstone Pistachio Facility uses other hazardous materials as listed by California EPA (diesel,
sanitizer with isopropyl alcohol, sodium hypochlorite, mixtures containing sodium hydroxide, sodium
percarbonate and/or potassium hydroxide, hydrogen peroxide, propane, ethyne (acetylene), argon,
nitrogen, and oxygen) (Exhibit D). Hazardous material used, handled, or stored in quantities greater
than or equal to 500 pounds of a solid substance, 55 gallons of a liquid substance, and/or 200 cubic
feet of a compressed gas are expected to be reported through a Hazardous Material Business Plan.
The Touchstone Pistachio Facility may also need to comply with the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism
Standards (CFATS). Chemicals which have security issues when released or stolen from a facility are on the Chemicals of Interest list regulated by CFATS. This list of more than 300 chemicals of interest
includes aluminum phosphide, magnesium phosphide, and phosphine. Submittal of a Top-Screen to

2/13

RAMBÖLL

the Department of Homeland Security for the phosphine gas (VAPORPH3OS fumigant) would be
required if present above the screening threshold quantities.
There are receptors near the Touchstone Pistachio Facility that have the potential to be impacted by
these hazards and hazardous materials. An increased use of chemicals and other hazardous materials
could lead to a greater risk for residential and non-residential receptors in the vicinity of the
Touchstone Pistachio Facility including but not limited to the nearest residential property (located at
18945 Ave 88, Terra Bella, CA, 93270, less than one mile west of the Touchstone Pistachio Facility)
and workers in surrounding farms and ranches including Wonderful Citrus II LLC's Wave Ranch.
Odors
The Touchstone Pistachio Facility has had historical odor complaints and the expanded Touchstone
Pistachio Facility is introducing a greater potential for odor impacts. These past complaints include
ones from September 24, 2019; September 25, 2019; October 3, 2019; October 15, 2019. These
complaints are included as Exhibit E. The time period of these complaints appears to correspond to
the pistachio harvesting period. Notably, the complaint filed on October 15, 2019 reported of fertilizer,
which is understood to consist of pistachio waste, that had caught fire and was smoldering in piles.
The reporting person stated that "the Fire Department has responded to location multiple times due to
the fertilizer catching fire." Thus, even prior to the expansion of the Touchstone Pistachio Facility,
there were odor impacts. Based on my review, the County has not evaluated for or imposed feasible
mitigation measures to address these environmental impacts, including those associated with the
increased application of pistachio processing waste resulting from the increase in processing capacity
at the site.

The expansion of the Touchstone Pistachio Facility will increase the sources of odor that may lead to
odor impacts causing considerable annoyance and distress to the public. Given the 80 percent increase
of pistachios that will be processed, the amount of material that leads to the odors is greatly
increasing, and thus it is likely that odor impacts will also increase. The wastewater pond (130 ac-ft)
at the Touchstone Pistachio Facility will receive even more odorous effluent. The wastewater pond is a
known contributor to odors given the storage of the spent process water, which contains high levels of
organics and the potential for the water to sit for prolonged periods of time. Again, the County has not
evaluated for or imposed feasible mitigation measures to address this environmental impact.
The intensity of an odor source's operations and its proximity to sensitive receptors influences the
potential significance of odor emissions. The San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District (the
District) has established screening levels for potential odor sources including food processing facilities
like the Touchstone Pistachio Facility in its guidance for assessing and mitigating air quality impacts.1
Based on this guidance, a food processing facility like the Touchstone Pistachio Facility has the
potential to generate odor impacts at receptors located within 1-mile distance, such as the residential
property located at 18945 Ave 88, Terra Bella, CA, 93270, workers at surrounding farms and ranches
including Wonderful Citrus II LLC's Wave Ranch, and motorists driving past the facility.
Air Quality
The air quality in the area of the Touchstone Pistachio Facility is already impacted. The San Joaquin
Valley is in nonattainment for PM2.5 (federal and state standards), PM10 (state standards), 8-hour
ozone (federal and state standards), and 1-hour ozone (state standards).2 The San Joaquin Valley (the

RAMBÖLL

Valley)'s natural environment presents significant challenges for air quality. The surrounding mountain
ranges to the west, east and south trap air pollutants and the airflow can be blocked in the Valley,
leading to severely constrained dispersion. High-pressure systems can cause a stagnant atmosphere
where wind flow is calm and air movement is minimal. The stagnant weather systems can also cause
severe temperature inversions, holding in nighttime accumulations of pollutants. The Valley is affected
by problems with particulate matter: secondary PM in the winter and primary PM in the fall. The
exceedances observed in the fall are usually the most severe and at the highest levels. In the Valley,
ozone concentrations are highest in the summer months, and downwind of urban areas.3 Given that
the harvest season takes place during late summer and early fall, there is overlap in timing with the
periods when ozone and PM are both elevated in the area.

Construction
The construction of silos and modification of the huller line will result in environmental impacts. During
construction, activities such as (but not necessarily limited to) the hauling of materials to the site, use
of diesel-powered equipment during construction, fugitive dust from dirt movement and/or movement
on unpaved and paved surfaces, workers commuting, and welding could lead to environmental
impacts, if not properly mitigated. These activities result in the emissions of criteria pollutants, notably
nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter. In addition,
mobile sources (e.g., diesel trucks) will emit greenhouse gases and also toxic air contaminants (e.g.,
diesel particulate matter) which cause health impacts. Based on my review, the County has not
evaluated or imposed feasible mitigation measures to address these environmental impacts.
Operation
As a result of expanded operational capacity, the Touchstone Pistachio Facility will result in increased
emissions associated with transportation of goods to/from the facility (i.e. additional truck trips), and
additional natural gas combustion and increased chemical usage for processing the pistachios that will
emit more criteria air pollutants (i.e., nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds, carbon monoxide,
and particulate matter) and toxic air contaminants. Because the County has not conducted any
environmental review of all the operations of this facility, they are being done without disclosure and
without imposing feasible mitigation measures to reduce potentially significant impacts.
The following activities and pieces of equipment expected to be used for the pistachio processing need
to be analyzed for air quality and greenhouse gas impacts, as they generate criteria air pollutant (CAP), greenhouse gas, and toxic air contaminant emissions. Most of these activities and equipment
were evaluated in the Draft Environmental Impact Report (DEIR) for Touchstone's proposed Kamm
Avenue Pistachio Processing Plant.4
Mobile sources (haul trucks): The expanded operations at the Touchstone Pistachio facility are
expected to increase mobile sources, notably haul truck activity and emissions to bring the
pistachios to the facility. The increased pistachio processing is also expected to increase worker
vehicle travel and related fugitive dust from those mobile sources. Furthermore, given the sizeable
in increase in capacity of the Touchstone Pistachio Facility (i.e., 80 percent), it is likely that the
unprocessed pistachios will need to be hauled to the Touchstone Pistachio Facility from more
distant locations. The increased hauling will lead to greater CAPs including diesel particulate

matter (DPM) and greenhouse gas emissions from trucks. The California Air Resources Board has
identified DPM as a toxic air contaminant.5 The health studies have shown that there is a
relationship between exposure to diesel exhaust with health effects such as lung cancer. Diesel
exhaust is also considered to contribute to non-cancer health effects, such as premature death,
chronic heart and lung disease including asthma, respiratory symptoms, and decreased lung
function. Assuming a hauling distance of 50 miles, and that approximately 95 loads/day may be
required to bring the additional 40 million pounds of pistachios to the Touchstone Pistachio Facility
over a 21-day harvesting period, this may increase the trucking related emissions as shown in the
Table 1 and Table 2 below when compared to the Touchstone Pistachio Facility before this
expansion. The calculations are based on EMFAC2021 T7 Single Dump Class 8 emission factors.

Given the proximity of residential and worker receptors to the site, as identified in the Hazards
section above, the additional emissions of toxic air contaminants due to the Minor Modification
MIM 21-054 from increased haul truck activity require evaluation. Additional haul trucks would
lead to diesel particulate matter emissions which would generate additional health risk for these
receptors. This risk will be greater for the residents and workers nearest to the route that the
trucks take to enter and exit the site.

Mobile sources (employee trips): An increased number of employee trips would be expected to
manage the additional pistachio processing capacity. A full-time workforce of 40 employees and a
seasonal workforce of 40 additional employees would be expected during the harvest.6 These
employee trips would generate additional emissions of criteria air pollutants and greenhouse
gases.

6 The Draft Environmental Impact Report (DEIR) for the proposed Kamm Avenue Pistachio Processing Plant dated February 2021, stated that 60 employees full-time and 60 employees seasonally were required for 60 million pounds of pistachios. The data was used to estimate the employee trips for the additional capacity of nearly 40
million pounds of pistachios of the Touchstone Pistachio Facility. The DEIR is available at: https://www.co.fresno.ca.us/home/showpublisheddocument/52615/637490858960430000. Accessed: February

Sample dryers: Natural gas sample dryers are used for the pistachio processing to dry a small
portion of harvested pistachios as soon as they arrive on site to assess their quality of stock
received. An increased capacity of pistachios would be expected to require greater sample drying
capability.
Pistachio crackers: After hulling, approximately 80% of the pistachios have open shells while 20%
have closed shells. These closed shell nuts are typically cracked open during the processing stage
in pistachio crackers. This process generates particulate matter emissions. The modification does not assess the impact of additional cracking on particulate matter emissions.
Column dryers or pot dryers: After removing the hulls from the harvested pistachios and cracking
them, they are heated in column dryers or pot driers to reduce the moisture content from 30-40%
to approximately 7%. An increased capacity of pistachios would require increased natural gas use
in dryers.
Silo heaters and blowers: After drying, the nuts are conveyed to storage silos where they can be
stored with aeration for several months before they are removed for processing and packaging. Hot air is periodically blown through the silos, particularly during the wet season to maintain the
moisture content of the pistachios. Each silo is typically equipped with two natural gas silo heaters and blowers. Since the proposed modification includes 16 additional silos, we would expect the
installation and operation of 32 silo dryers which would increase on-site the natural gas
combustion.

Fumigation: The Touchstone Pistachio Facility will use fumigants in silos to control pests. Their air
permits (Exhibit F) indicate the facility will use fumigants such as Fumitoxin®, Eco2Fume®,
Vaporph3os™, MagnaPhos®, Profume or equivalent which would release phosphine and ammonia.
Phosphine and ammonia (components of the fumigant) are known toxic air contaminants.7
Increased use of these chemicals for processing the increased pistachio throughputs would result
in increased health impacts which have not been evaluated. Further, the increased use of the
fumigant Eco2Fume®, which is a gaseous mixture of 2.2% by weight of phosphine gas and 97.8%
of carbon dioxide (CO2) has the potential to increase greenhouse gas emissions.

Pasteurizers: Pistachio processing typically involves pasteurizing of the nuts prior to roasting and
packaging. Natural gas fired boilers are used to supply heat for the pasteurization process. The
emissions from the additional pasteurization activity due to increased pistachio processing capacity
should be assessed.
The California Emissions Inventory Data Analysis and Reporting System (CEIDARS) is
a database management system developed to track statewide criteria pollutant and air
toxic emissions, and it shows that the facility has substantial air emissions which with an increase in
throughput and capacity will lead to an increase in these air emissions. This increase is a potentially
significant impact and should be evaluated further. The emissions in this database for the facility are
available from 2014 to 2019. The 2019 emissions of reactive organic gases (ROG), carbon monoxide
(CO), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), and oxides of sulfur (SOx) are 7.5-times the quantity of emissions in
2014.8 In this timeframe, the site added at least 9 large silos based on aerial imagery from September
2019 (Exhibit G). The following table summarizes these criteria air pollutant emissions:

Based on these air quality emissions, the Touchstone Pistachio Facility also has GHG emissions, which
would also be expected to increase with the increased throughput from the Modification. The
greenhouse gas emissions for a similar pistachios processing facility, Setton Pistachios in Terra Bella,
CA were reported at 8,283 MT CO2e in 2019.9 The GHG emissions at the Touchstone Pistachio Facility
should be evaluated as it is clear that there are GHG emissions from such facilities.

Agriculture Resources
The construction and operational activities due to the Modification at the Touchstone Pistachio Facility
will generate increased dust from the additional truck traffic and on-site equipment which may have
an impact on agriculture. California is becoming warmer and drier, 10,11 which will result in increased
dust. The combiOnation of drier conditions and increased truck and equipment use at the Touchstone
Pistachio Facility will result in increased dust on the site. A literature review was conducted to better
understand the relationship between increases in dust and subsequent increases in the occurrence of
insect pests such as mites that exploit dusty conditions and cause damage to crops. Mites feed by
piercing plant cells and feeding on the nutrients inside. This activity leaves necrotic or yellowing spots
and adversely impacts the overall health of the plant. The results of the literature review suggest a
relationship between increased dust, often accompanied by hotter and drier climates, with conditions
more favorable to pest insects and unfavorable to beneficial insects. For instance, Demirel and Cabuk
studied the effects of road dust on two spotted spider mites on 48 cotton fields near roads.12,13 The
authors reported that populations and densities of mites were significantly higher near dirt roads due
to dusty conditions. McCrea (1984 and 1990) conducted studies on road dust and subsequent damage

to crops. 14,15 The author described how dust negatively affects beneficial insects and positively affects
pest insects. McCrea reported that pest insects were more abundant closer to the roads but decreased
with distance from roads (and dust). The author concluded that road dust increases pest insects which
lead to decreased crop yields and quality of produce.
Fritz (2017) conducted a study on pest management and reproduction of spider mites in agricultural
fields. 16 The investigation was conducted within a greenhouse which allowed for control of
environmental variables such as temperature and humidity. Spider mites were reared on soybean
plants and dust was applied directly to leaves. The author reported that dusty plant surfaces may
provide an ideal environment for mite reproduction, food, and protection from natural enemies. The
author reported that humidity and temperature may also be strong indicators of spider mite
infestation. White (2005) reported that increased temperature and decreased humidity, which
increases dust, promoted spider mite development.17 Fleschner (1958) reviewed pests and dust on
avocado plants. Overall, dust deposits inhibited beneficial insects and increased pest induced
damage.18 The author reported that dust may adversely affect the efficiency of beneficial insects in
several ways including dulling their senses, agitating them, causing them to leave a dusty area, or
slowing down their flying efficiency so that their searching capacity iS reduced. Many of the food items
that beneficial insects prefer may be so covered by dust deposits that they are unavailable to these
insects, or they may be so contaminated with dust particles that, should they be ingested, they could
impair the digestion of the beneficial species. The studies reviewed indicate that a relationship exists
between dust and increases in mites/insect pest populations that result in crop damage. A
combination of high temperatures, low humidity, and low precipitation increases dust and produces an
environment for opportunistic insects due to displacement of beneficial insects. Given the potential
increases in truck traffic from the expansion authorized by the Modification, the County should
evaluate the potentially significant impact on the agriculture along these roads.
An increase in pest insects will likely result in the increased use of pesticides. Any additional use of
pesticides to control an increase in pest insects because of increases in dust will have to be detailed in
the Hazards and Hazardous Materials section of an EIR. Pesticides can have an adverse impact to both
beneficial insects (i.e., pollinators) and pest insects, wildlife in the area and human health and are
heavily restricted. The County should evaluate potential health impacts to farm workers and residents
as well as to area wildlife and in particular, special-status plants and animals from increased pesticide
use.

Biological Resources
The planned removal of trees to accommodate the new silos should be conducted to avoid nesting
season for any birds. Existing nests should not be disturbed until a qualified biologist can identify the
species of bird using the nest. Some bird species return to the same nest each year. Other wildlife
species may use the pistachio tree understory for habitat and nesting. If a nest belongs to a special
status species than additional evaluation or mitigation may be required prior to the tree being
removed. For example, the Draft Environmental Impact Report (DEIR) for the proposed Kamm Avenue
Pistachio Processing Plant19 included pre-activity nesting bird surveys prior to the start of construction
as a mitigation measure.
Noise
The construction and operations activities due to the Modification at the Touchstone Pistachio Facility
will generate noise. The noise will be generated from truck traffic and equipment and operations
onsite. Tulare County has noise limits to address potential noise impacts as discussed in their General
Plan (Section 10.8 Noise on page 10-60 through 10-63).20 In addition, the Occupational Health and
Safety Administration requires employers to implement a hearing conservation program when noise
exposure is at or above 85 decibels averaged over 8 working hours (i.e., an 8-hour time-weighted
average, TWA). The construction and operations have activities that could exceed these standards.
Construction equipment can have high noise levels ranging from 70-95 dBA from the loudest side of
the equipment. The U.S. Department of Transportation has identified some reference noise levels
(Section 9.4, Table 9.1).21 Agricultural operations are also known to have operations that are noisy,22
Receptors nearest to the site, such as the residents to the west and the agricultural workers in the
surrounding area, would have potential for greater exposure to noise based on construction and
operational activities due to the increased activity at the Touchstone Pistachio Facility. Based on my
review, the County has not evaluated for or imposed feasible mitigation measures to address this
environmental impact.

Water and Wastewater
The Modification will result in greater water use and wastewater generation. Touchstone Pistachio
Facility appears to plan to pull water from an onsite water well, which is part of the Eastern Tule
Groundwater Sustainability Agency (GSA) within the Tule Sub-Basin. Per the 2020 Groundwater
Sustainability Plan for the Eastern Tule GSA, the Tule Sub-basin is critically overdrafted with an
estimated historical annual overdraft of 115,300 acre-feet per year (61,000 acre-feet per year of
which is within the Eastern Tule GSA).23 According to the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act
2019 Basin Prioritization report from the Department of Water Resources, the Tule Sub-Basin falls in

the high priority basin category (Appendix A, Table A-1 page A-14).24 This California Department of
Water Resources report and figure indicates that the basin is overdrafted.25 With their increased operations, the Touchstone Pistachio Facility will increase their water usage. Thus, increased levels of
water usage will be taken from a water basin that is already in overdraft. Based on my review, the
County has not evaluated for or imposed feasible mitigation measures to address this environmental
impact.

The Touchstone Pistachio Facility's past non-compliance suggests that additional evaluation may be
necessary to ensure that water impacts are properly understood. The California Environmental
Protection Agency State Water Resources Control Board issued violations for the Facility for lack of
submittal of self-monitoring reports (SMRs) in all four quarters of 2018 and 2019.26 Adequate
evaluation of the water impacts is thus necessary to understand if there are any potentially significant
impacts.

As noted above, the Modification for the Touchstone Pistachio Facility includes 16 new silos, which
may allow an additional capacity of nearly 40 million pounds of pistachios. An increased water demand
of 43.6 million gallons per year27 would be required to process these additional pistachios. Due to the
strains on water availability, the Eastern Tule GSA is planning to impose a penalty for over-pumping
the groundwater in the basin. Based on the sustainability plan, currently, 1.04 acre-feet per acre
pumping iS allowed at the rate of $9.08 per ac-ft. The penalty fee will likely start at $245 an ac-ft and
rise as more water is pumped.28 The water availability via groundwater pumping is constrained and
thus the increased water demand should be evaluated as part of this Modification.
The wastewater pond's operation is permitted with the California Regional Water Quality Control
Board, Central Valley Region, and the permit includes waste discharge requirements. The permit
includes monitoring for wastewater effluent to the pond, discharges from the pond to the land
application areas, pond monitoring, source water monitoring, land application area monitoring, and
groundwater monitoring. The monitoring covers issues such as (but not limited to) biochemical oxygen
demand, total dissolved solids, volatile dissolved solids, and total kjeldahl nitrogen. Based on my
review, the County has not evaluated for or imposed feasible mitigation measures to address the
potential environmental impact from the water use and wastewater generation.
Further, an assessment is required for the impact of pumping on the groundwater quality. The water
quality control board is closely monitoring nitrate and salts in the groundwater in the valley region. In

May 2018, the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) approved a new Nitrate
Control Program to address widespread nitrate pollution in the Central Valley. As part of this program,
new regulations are being implemented to provide safe drinking water to the communities and to
reduce nitrate impact on the public supply wells.29 In order to comply with these regulations, each
entity requires to choose one of the two pathways for compliance:
- Pathway A - Individual Permitting. To comply with Pathway A, the facility needs to place itself in
one of the five discharge categories (Category 1 through Category 5)30 based on the assessment
of nitrate discharge.
Pathway B - Local Management Zone. Dischargers can opt to work collectively with other
dischargers through a Local Management Zone.31
The potential increase in water demand from the Minor Modification may have a potentially significant a
impact on sustainable water resources. Groundwater sustainability is based on how much groundwater
can be pumped from the aquifer without adversely affecting water quality. Given the attention RWQCB
has on groundwater pumping, the County should evaluate the potentially significant impact on water
resources, which would include how the Modification would comply with these regulations.
Waste
The Modification at the Touchstone Pistachio Facility will result in increased solid waste. The solid
waste includes twigs, leaves, and other green waste, as well as solids produced from screening of
wastewater (e.g., hulls, shells, skins). Based on published agriculture processing information, the
waste could be up to twice the weight of the pistachios produced (i.e., 2/3 of the raw material mass becomes waste),32, 33 thus the anticipated waste generation will be much greater at the Touchstone
Pistachio Facility compared to their prior operating levels. Given that the facility may increase the
pistachios processed by 40 million pounds, that means the increase in waste generated may be 80
million pounds. The waste will have to be treated and reused onsite or hauled away for disposal
elsewhere. If they are reused on site (e.g., though the placement on land), there are potential
environmental impacts associated with that reuse, that may include impacts to soil and groundwater.
If they are hauled away, there are potential environmental impacts associated with the truck hauling
and the end-of-life of the waste (e.g., if the waste is composted or landfilled). Additional truck hauling
trips for hauling away waste that is not reused on site has the potential to generate additional health
risk to the workers and residents near to the site if the waste disposal trucks are fueled if by diesel,
emitting diesel particulate matter. Composting and landfilling also have potential environmental
impacts (e.g., odors, groundwater). Based on my review, the County has not evaluated for or imposed
feasible mitigation measures to address this environmental impact.

Fumigation tablets, rain cause massive pistachio fire

Sheyanne N Romero, Visalia Times-Delta Published 7:12 a.m. PT Nov. 27, 2017 | Updated 1:18 p.m. PT Nov. 27, 2017

A fire burned through more than 250 tons of pistachios in Tulare County early Monday morning.

The cost of damages is estimated at $1.6 million, said fire Capt. Joanne Bear.

Employees of Terra Bella's Aro Pistachio called firefighters just after 4 a.m. to the business near Avenue 88 and
Road 196. Witnesses told dispatchers flames were seen coming from pistachio bins.

(Photo: Tulare County Fire The pistachios had just recently been fumigated. The product used - which becomes flammable when wet -
Department) is suspected of starting the fire.

"The rain was unexpected and it just erupted," said CEO Adam Orandi. "It went up like a ball of fire. It looked like a torch."

When firefighters arrived, they discovered multiple plastic storage bins on fire.

Firefighters were able to stop the spread of flames to nearby structures. The fire burned through 280 tons of pistachios and 350 plastic bins, firefighters
said.

The damages make up percent of Aro's inventory. The plant has just finished harvesting. Thanksgiving was the first break for workers since August,
Orandi said.

"It's painful,' Orandi said. "We're still assessing the damage. It's a loss we all feel. A loss of work and a loss of jobs."

Crews remained on scene late into the afternoon to monitor the incident as flash fires were a concern.

Aro Pistachios is a family-owned business that has been in Terra Bella since 1971. The first tree was planted by founder Dr. Mehdi Orandi, according to
the company's website.

Orandi Ranch orchards grow three pistachio varieties in the rural Tulare County community. Last year, Orandi harvested more than 11 million pounds of
pistachios.

County of Fresno Draft Environmental Impact Report
Touchstone's Kamm Avenue Pistachio Processing Plant

Touchstone Pistachios is currently pursuing approvals for a new pistachio processing
facility in the County of Fresno. As part of the County's review of that development, the County
prepared and published a Draft Environmental Impact Report ("Draft EIR" or "DEIR")
analyzing the potential impacts associated with the pistachio processing facility. (Kamm Avenue Pistachio Processing Plant Draft EIR No. 7896 (SCH No. 2020090207).)
Touchstone Pistachios is proposing a new facility with an approximate capacity of 60
million pounds of finished product per year. (Notice of Availability, published February 17, 2021.) The project consists of new processing facilities including a 130,000 square foot processing and packaging building, a scale house and guard shack, administrative buildings, 49
(forty-nine) 48-foot diameter silos, a huller system, 13 dryers, a 353,000 gallon water storage tank, a domestic water treatment facility, fumigation and chemical storage areas, and 100-acre-
feet capacity settling and cleaning ponds, among other components. (DEIR, pp. 2-8-2-9.) The
a project will have a full-time workforce of approximately 60 employees, with an additional 60 employees working during the 6-week harvest period. (DEIR, p. 2-11.) During peak harvest, operations would result in approximately 295 one-way daily trips, including 150 harvest truck trips. (DEIR, p. 2-23.)

The Draft EIR analyzed impacts in 20 different areas. Potentially significant impacts were identified related to air quality, biological resources, geology and soils, transportation, and utilities. (DEIR, pp. 3.1-9, 3.4-21, 3.7-9, 3.17-13, 3.19-11.) Mitigation measures were imposed
to address these significant impacts. Other impact areas analyzed include agriculture, energy, greenhouse gases, hazards and hazardous materials, hydrology and water quality, land use and planning, mineral resources, tribal cultural resources, utilities, and wildfire. The Draft EIR
outlined mitigation measures to reduce significant impacts in the following impact areas.

Aesthetics

O AES-1 requires measures to reduce light and glare impacts associated with
operations on the site.

Air Quality

O AIR-1 requires the preparation of a dust control plan prior to commencing construction activities.

The Draft EIR and associated appendices can be found at the following link to the County of
Fresno's webpage: https://www.co.fresno.ca.us/departments/public-works-and-
planning/divisions-of-public-works-and-planning/development-services-and-capital- projects/planning-and-land-use/environmental-impact-reports/eir-7896. Copies of the documents have been provided electronically to the County as an attachment hereto.

-

O AIR-2 requires the use of best available control technology and permitted for
equipment.

Biological Resources

O BIO-1 requires the implementation of measures to protect the Blunt-nosed Leopard Lizard and Coast Horned Lizard.

O BIO-2 requires the implementation of measures to protect the San Joaquin
Coachwhip and San Joaquin Glossy Snake.

O BIO-3 requires the implementation of measures to protect the Western Burrowing
Owl, American Badger, and the San Joaquin Kit Fox.

O BIO-4 requires the implementation of measures to protect the Swainson's Hawk.

O BIO-5 requires the implementation of measures to protect the San Joaquin
Antelope Squirrel.

O BIO-6 requires the pre-activity surveys for nesting migratory birds and raptors.

O BIO-7 requires the implementation of measures to protect bats.

Cultural Resources

O CUL-1 requires the measures to be implemented if cultural, historical,
archeological, or fossil resources are discovered during construction activities.

O CUL-2 requires that a qualified archaeological monitor is present during the
installation of certain project components.

Geology and Soils

O GEO-1 requires the preparation of an erosion control plan and Storm Water
Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP).

Hydrology and Water Quality

O HYD-1 requires that the project obtain necessary permits from the Regional Water Control Board to authorize discharges.

O HYD-2 restricts the discharge to settling ponds.
o HYD-3 limits the biological oxygen demand loading rate.

O HYD-4 limits the hydraulic loading of irrigation reuse water.
o HYD-5 limits the waste constituents allowed in irrigation reuse water.

2

O HYD-6 limits the periods when irrigation reuse water can be used for irrigation.

O HYD-7 requires that the project prepare a Wastewater and Nutrient Management
Plan.

O HYD-8 requires the preparation of a Salinity Control Plan.

O HYD-9 requires that no pistachio processing solids shall be applied in the 100- year flood zone map area.

O HYD-10 requires that pistachio processing solids be managed by limiting
application and incorporation into neighboring soils.

O HYD-11 requires sampling to monitor constituents of concern.

O HYD-12 requires that any unknown well encountered during construction be
properly destroyed.

Noise

O NOI-1 requires all construction equipment be equipped with noise control
devices.

O NOI-2 requires that all operational equipment be maintained according to
manufacturers' specifications and all noise-generating equipment be equipped
