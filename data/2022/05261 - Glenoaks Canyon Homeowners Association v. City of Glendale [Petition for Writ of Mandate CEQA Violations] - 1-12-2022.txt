INFRODUCTION

1. Petitioner Glenoaks Canyon Homeowners Association (*Petitioner" or
"GOCHA") brings this action to challenge the City of Glendale's (*City's") violation of the
California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), Planning and Zoning Law and Municipal Code
6 in approving the Biogas Renewable Generation Plant Project (*Biogas Project" or "Project") at
7 the Scholl Canyon Landfill (*SCLF*).

8 2. This Project would demolish the existing facilities that had for many years
9 I transported landfill gas to the Grayson Power Plant for use in energy production and build a new
10 Biogas Plant to process the landfill gas onsite at the SCLF.

11 3. The environmental impact report (*EIR") for the Biogas Project is inadequate in a
12 number of respects. It fails to include an accurate and complete project description, failing to
13 adequately address the closure of the SCLF, including whether the Project could induce
14 expansion or further industrialization of the SCLF.

15 4. Despite repeated requests from Petitioner and others, including the City of Los
16 Angeles, the EIR fails to consider the whole of the project. Instead, it improperly segments
17 review of the Biogas Project from the linked Grayson Repowering Project.

18 5. The EIR relies on uncertain Priority Reserve credits to reduce the obligation to
19 mitigate air quality impacts for the surrounding community.

20 6. The EIR gives short shrift to the serious and foreseeable wildfire impacts at and

21 around the Project site that would be exacerbated by this Project.

22 7. Additionally, the EIR's alternatives analysis fails to include a reasonable range of

23 alternatives or the necessary comparative analysis of the alternatives that are included.

24 8. The City's approval of this Project violates Planning and Zoning Law because the
25H Project is inconsistent with a number of General Plan policies and objectives, particularly those
included in the General Plan's Open Space Element. The Project is inconsistent due to its 26
27 construction on a protected ridgeline. It is also inconsistent with objectives to provide open
28 space amenities for the community, expand recreation facilities and to protect the community

2

Printed on Recycled Paper PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

from wildfire and other hazards.

2 9. Further, the City's approval of a Conditional Use Permit and Special Recreation
3 Review for the Project violate the City's Municipal Code because the findings required for these
4 approvals cannot be made because the Project is inconsistent with the General Plan and would
5 be detrimental to public health and safety.

6 JURISDICTION

10. This Court has jurisdiction over the writ action under section 1094.5 of the Code

8 of Civil Procedure.

11. This Court also has jurisdiction over the writ action under section 1085 of the
10 Code of Civil Procedure, and sections 21168 and 21168.5 of the Public Resources Code.

STATEMENT OF FACTS
2 Project Site and Surrounding Area
3 16. The Project site is located within the boundaries of the existing 535-acre Scholl
4 Canyon Landfill (*SCLF*), in Los Angeles County, at 3001 Scholl Canyon Road, Glendale,
5 California, 91206. The Project facilities would be located on a 2.2-acre site on the southern part
6 of an approximately 95-acre area owned by Los Angeles County that is within the SCLF in an
7 area not used for waste disposal and would 8 require 8 acres of the site to be disturbed.

8 17. Regional access to the landfill is from the Ventura Freeway (State Route 134) at
9 the Figueroa Street exit. The Project site itself is exclusively accessed by Scholl Canyon Road,
10 a narrow two-lane road.

11 18. The Project site is bordered on the north by the San Gabriel Mountains, on the
12 northwest by the Verdugo Mountains, and on the east by the San Rafael Hills. The easternmost
13 edge of the Santa Monica Mountains, in Los Angeles's Griffith Park. lies just beyond the City's
14 boundary to the southwest. The Verdugo Mountains and the San Rafael Hills are the most
15 significant physical landmarks in the community because these topographic features frame the
16 central portion of the City.
17 19. Additional facilities ocated near the proposed Project site include the Sanitation
18  Districts of Los Angeles County portable and temporary offices, and landfill condensate and
19 groundwater collection systems located adjacent to where the is Project is proposed to be located.
20| 20. The land uses surrounding the proposed Project site are non-industrial and include
21 low density residential and very low density/open space land uses. Immediately to the south of
22 the proposed Project site is the City of Los Angeles community of Eagle Rock, and to the east of
23 l the proposed Project site is the City of Pasadena, including Arroyo Seco Park and Rose Bowl
24 | Stadium.

25 21. Communities surrounding the SCLF include: Eagle Rock (9,661 homes),
26 Glenoaks Canyon (750 homes), Chevy Chase Canyon (800 homes), Rancho San Rafael (549
27 homes), Annandale and Linda Vista (1,330 homes). The neighborhoods along Linda Vista in
28 Pasadena and Glenoaks Canyon in Glendale have only narrow one way in and out streets.

Printed on Recycled Paper PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

22. These communities include more than three dozen schools, outdoor recreational
2 centers, hospitals and health facilities as well as public attractions. Approximately 60,000 people
3 live or work within two miles of the landfill and thousands more visit the area regularly.

4 Included in the surrounding recreational facilities are the Scholl Canyon Golf Course and Scholl

5 Canyon Ball Fields.

Project Description

8 23. The Project is construction and operation of a Biogas Renewable Generation Plant
9 intended to utilize landfill gas, also referred to as biogas, from the SCLF for generation of
10| electric energy for local consumption by the City of Glendale and potentially for sale outside of
11| the City.
12 24. Biogas is a natural byproduct of the decomposition of organic material in landfills.
13 Biogas is composed of methane (the primary component of natural gas), carbon dioxide,
14 nitrogen, oxygen, and small amounts of other compounds. If this biogas is not captured and
15 disposed of properly it will disseminate into the atmosphere and contribute to detrimental
16 greenhouse gas effects.

17 25. Biogas can also be used as a replacement for natural gas as a power plant fuel.
18 Until recently, the landfill gas from SCLF had been piped to the Grayson Power Plant. located
19 approximately five miles from the SCLF, for energy production. Any landfill gas that was not
20 conveyed to the power plant was destroyed by combustion using a flare station at the SCLF.

21 26. In 2018, more than a year after the Biogas Plant proposal was disclosed to the
22 community, the City halted use of the pipeline system to convey landfill gas to Grayson Power
23 Plant. but has not yet decommissioned this pipeline. To address the accumulation of landfill
24 gas. the City then began flaring all landfill gas from SCLF using outdated flares that do not
25 comply with South Coast Air Quality Management District (*SCAQMD") requirements, greatly
26 increasing the air pollutant emissions in the area surrounding the Project site.

27 27. To make room for the Biogas Project. the existing landfill gas processing facility
28| which conveys landfill gas to the Grayson Power Plant will be dismantled and removed. The

5
Printed on Recycled Paper PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

existing concrete foundations and existing asphalt roads would also be demolished.
2 28. In addition to the demolition of existing landfill gas processing facilities, the
3 Project includes the installation of a new Biogas Plant. This facility would include internal
4 combustion engines that would burn the landfill gas in order to generate electrical power, and
5 would include a natural gas pipeline, water pipeline, and two water tanks. The hazards
6 associated with this facility require vegetation clearance from within 100 feet of the proposed
7 facility, but that clearance was not include as an enforceable mitigation measure.

8 29. The Southern California Gas natural gas pipeline is a three-inch, steel gas pipeline
9 that would be located above ground, within the boundary of the SCLF, except at road and
10 drainage culvert crossings. This natural gas pipeline is required because there is inadequate
11 methane content in the landfill gas and natural gas supplementation is needed to run the internal
12 combustion engines in the Biogas Plant.
13 30. The new 60,000-gallon water storage tank for fire protection and a new
14 approximately 10,000-gallon potable water storage tank would also be installed. The Project
15 has planned to install this water storage tank on a primary ridgeline, where the City's general
16 plan prohibits any construction. In order to convey water to the proposed Project, an
17 approximately one-mile-long, 12-inch steel or high-density polyethylene pipeline would be
18 connected to the existing 16-inch pipeline located north of the SCLF on Glenoaks Blvd. This
19 water line would be installed above-ground except for road and drainage culvert crossings, and
20 at those locations the water line would be installed below-ground under the roads and either over

21 or under the drainage culvert crossings.
22 31. The Project would be constructed and operated adjacent to the existing landfill gas
23 collection and landfill gas flaring systems. There are two operating and one backup LFG blower
24| delivering landfill gas to the landfill gas flaring system which consists of 12 existing eight-foot
25 diameter, 16-foot high ground flares. The existing flares are outdated and out of compliance
26 with the flaring requirements established by the SCAQMD.
27 32. Project construction would occur in three phases over an approximately 15- to 18-
28 month period.

Printed on Recycied Paper

33. The life of the proposed Project is anticipated to be 20 years, or as long as the
2 landfill gas can be used to generate electricity; after which time the EIR claims the equipment
3 and equipment foundations would be removed.
4 Scholl Canyon Landfill

5 34. The SCLF opened in 1961 and is owned by the City of Glendale.
35. The SCLF is an operational Class III nonhazardous landfill that accepts municipal
solid waste, but it is not a generator of, or repository for, hazardous wastes.
36. Portions of SCLF are owned, respectively, by the City of Glendale, Los Angeles
County, and by Southern California Edison Company. The SCLF is operated by the Los
10 Angeles County Sanitation District No. 2, serving as the administrative entity for the Los
11 Angeles County Sanitation Districts pursuant to a Joint Powers Agreement.
12 37. Los Angeles County, the Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles County and the City
13 of Glendale entered into a Joint Powers Agreement for construction and operation of the SCLF
14 in 1959, with periodic amendments and supplements, the most recent of which is dated 1997.
15 This Joint Powers Agreements requires the SCLF to become a recreational area after closure.

16 38. Landfilling operations were initially conducted in Scholl Canyon and subsequently
17 moved to an adjacent canyon to the north. Near the end of the life of the northern canyon in
18 1975, landfilling operations resumed in the main Scholl Canyon. Since 1975, landfilling
19| operations have only been conducted in the main Scholl Canyon.
20 39. During the mid-1980s, the amount of waste received at the SCLF increased
21 significantly. In response, the City passed ordinances in 1987 to limit the uses of SCLF and the
22 amount of waste SCLF could receive. Ordinance No. 4780 limited use of the site to a wasteshed a
23 comprised of the following cities and communities: Glendale, La Canada-Flintridge, Pasadena,
24 San Marino, Sierra Madre, South Pasadena, and the unincorporated Los Angeles County
25 communities of Altadena. La Crescenta. Montrose. and East Pasadena. Ordinance No. 4781
26| limited the waste received for disposal to 33,600 tons per week (5,600 tons per day), Monday
27 through Saturday. although the current permit limits disposal to only 20,400 tons per week.
28 40. The SCLF is nearing its total permitted capacity, with estimates that it will reach

7
Printed on Recycled Paper PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

that capacity in 2025 or 2026.

2 41. In 2014, the City prepared an EIR to analyze a project to expand the allowable
3 total capacity for SCLF, thereby extending its life. The City has since stated an intention to not
move forward with the SCLF expansion project, but they are not prohibited from doing so in the
5 future based on the existing environmental review that already has been prepared.

42. In 2013, the City's of Glendale Public Works Department released a request for

7 proposals for the provision of a Municipal Solid Waste Anerobic Digestion Project at SCLF.
8 High grade methane from anaerobic digestion could augment landfill gas energy production. In
9 July 2016, the City authorized an exclusive negotiating agreement to determine the feasibility of
10 the energy conversion project. The City did not move forward with the project at that time, but
11 they are not prohibited from doing so in the future, given the state's pressure to redirect organic
12 matter from landfills.

14| Related Projects, Project Review and Approval Process
15 43. The Grayson Repowering Project is a power plant repowering project proposed by
16 Real Party in Interest Glendale Department of Water and Power to remove and replace aging
17 infrastructure with state-of-the art equipment at the Grayson Power Plant. This Project is related
18 to and physically connected to the Biogas Project because the landfill gas at SCLF was piped to
19 and used at the Grayson Power Plant until April 2018. The pipeline connecting SCLF and
20 Grayson still exists.

21 44. The notice of preparation for the Grayson Repowering Project was circulated on
22 December 15, 2016, at a time when landfill gas was still being used at the Grayson Power Plant.
23 45. The draft EIR for the Grayson Repowering Project was first made available for
24 public review in fall of 2017. The City received numerous comments, including comments from
25 Petitioner.

26 46. A final EIR for the Grayson Repowering Project was prepared and released in
27 2018. The City Council considered the EIR on April 10, 2018, at which point they instructed
28 the Glendale Department of Water and Power to consider greener alterhatives as part of that

Printed on Recycled Paper PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

project.
2 47. In August 2021, the City commenced a 98 day comment period for a partial
3 recirculated draft EIR for the Grayson Repowering Project. A revised final EIR has not yet been
4 released. Reconsideration of this project is anticipated to occur in the coming months.
5 48. The Biogas Project was first analyzed in a mitigated negative declaration
6 (*MND"). This MND was circulated for public comments in 2017.

49. The final MND was considered and rejected by the City's Planning Commission

8 on March 9, 2018. The Planning Commission recommended that an EIR be prepared for the
9 Biogas Project, with a particular focus on the alternatives analysis for the treatment of landfill
10 gas.
11 50. In August of 2018, the City issued a request for proposals for preparation of an
12 EIR for the Biogas Project.

13 51. A Notice of Preparation for the Biogas Project EIR was issued in March 2019.
14 52. The draft EIR for the Biogas Project was circulated July 1, 2020, through
15 September 30, 2020 and a final EIR was published on the City's website on August 2, 2021.
16 53. Petitioner submitted detailed comments on the draft and final EIR. Their

17 comments are consistent with the many comments provided by Glendale, Eagle Rock and
18 Pasadena community members, Los Angeles Council District 14 and expert agencies, including
19 the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD), Los Angeles County Public
20 Works Department, the City of Los Angeles Department of Sanitation and Environment and the
21 California Department of Fish and Wildlife. These comments detail an inadequate project
22 description, improper segmentation of the Biogas Project from the Grayson Repowering Project,
23| insufficient analysis of air quality and wildfire impacts and an inadequate alternatives analysis.
24 CEQA requires that the lead agency for a project evaluate all DEIR comments received on
25 environmental issues and prepare a written response.
26 54. On October 6. 2021, the City's Planning Commission unanimously denied
27 approval of a Conditional Use Permit (*CUP*) and Special Recreation Review (*SRR") for the
28 Biogas Project, citing inconsistencies of the proposed Project with the City's General Plan and

9

Printed on Recycled Paper PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

the Project's impacts to public health, safety and welfare. The Planning Commission did not
2 certify the final EIR or adopt the Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program (*MMRP") for
3 the Project.

55. Real Party filed an appeal of the Planning Commission's denials of the CUP and
5 SRR, and requested the City Council certify the final EIR, adopt the MMRP and overturn the

6 Planning Commission's denials of the CUP and SRR.

56. On November 30, 2021, the City Council held a hearing on Real Party's appeal
8 and overturned the Planning Commission's denial of the Project. The City Council certified the

9 final EIR. adopted the MMRP and approved the CUP and SRR for the Project.
10 57. The City of Glendale filed a Notice of Determination for the Project on December
11 13, 2021.

12 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

13 AND INADEQUATE REMEDIES AT LAW

14

15 58. Petitioner objected to the Project in the administrative process, and fully
16 exhausted its administrative remedies. Petitioner, and members of Petitioner, submitted letters
17 during the comment period raising the issues set forth herein and provided testimony at the
18 public hearings held regarding the Project.
19 59. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law
20 unless this Court grants the requested writs of mandate and injunctive relief. In the absence of
21 such remedies, Respondent's approval of the project would form the basis for a development
22 project that would proceed in violation of state law.
23 60. Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.7 by filing a
24 copy of this petition with the California Attorney General. A copy of that notice is attached as
25 Exhibit A.

26 61. Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.5 by
27 providing the City of Glendale with notice of its intention to commence the action. A copy of
28 that notice is attached as Exhibit B.

10

64.

10| following: Petitioner incorporates all previous paragraphs as if fully set forth.

11 The City's violations of CEQA's requirements include, but are not limited to, the

12 The EIR Relies on an Inaccurate and Incomplete Project Description

13 65. "[A]n accurate, stable and finite project description is the sine qua non of an
14 informative and legally sufficient EIR." (County of Inyo V. City of Los Angeles (1977) 71
15 Cal.App.3d 185, 199.) An EIR must provide an adequate description of the whole of the action
16 that is being contemplated. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15378, subd. (c).)

17 66. Contrary to these requirements, the project description provided for the Biogas
18 Project fails to provide adequate information to allow an assessment of all Project impacts,
19 including the reasonably foreseeable consequences of the Project, and also prevents an accurate
20 comparison of the Project to alternatives

21 67. The EIR fails to include the required accurate and complete project description for
22 several reasons.

23 68. The EIR fails to adequately address the closure of the Scholl Canyon Landfill
24| (SCLF) and when the facility would reach capacity. The Biogas Project relies upon landfill gas
25 produced by the SCLF, thus the EIR must provide detailed and supported information regarding
26 when the landfill would reach capacity.
27 69. The EIR's project description also fails to address how long the SCLF would
28 continue to produce landfill gas once that facility has reached current capacity. The EIR fails to

Printed on Recycled Paper 11
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

address whether the Project could induce expansion of the SCLF or installation of an anaerobic
digestor to allow continued use of the Biogas Project. An expansion of the SCLF was
previously analyzed by the City. Although the City has claimed it does not plan to move
forward with the expansion project at this time, there is nothing preventing the City from
restarting the SCLF expansion project process, particularly given that a substantial amount of
6 work has already been completed for this project, including preparation of an EIR. Similarly,
the City previously proposed installation of an anaerobic digestor at the SCLF. While the City

8 iS not currently moving forward on such a project. there is nothing preventing them for doing so.
70. The draft EIR's project description also fails to disclose the continued use of flares
10 under the Project, preventing an accurate assessment of Project impacts. The draft EIR did not
11 disclose that it is highly likely the flares for landfill gas would need to operate simultaneously
12 with the Biogas Plant because the landfill gas flow from the SCLF currently exceeds the
13 capacity of the Biogas Plant. The City failed to recirculate the EIR or include necessary analysis
14 when it admitted the continued use of flares in the final EIR.

15 71. The EIR's project description is further inadequate because it fails to provide
16 accurate and reliable information concerning the predictable net power to be produced by the
17 Biogas Plant and the amount of natural gas that would need to be added over time and after
18 landfill closure to maintain operation of the Biogas Plant.
19
20 The City Improperly Segmented Environmental Review
21 72. CEQA requires that environmental review documents analyze "the whole of an
22 action" (CEQA Guidelines § 15378) and not evade comprehensive CEQA analysis by splitting
23 projects into separate pieces for purposes of environmental review.
24 73. Despite repeated comments from Petitioner and other agencies, including the City
25 of Los Angeles, the EIR fails to consider the whole of the project. Instead. it improperly
26 segmented review of the Biogas Project from the linked Grayson Repowering Project.
27 74. Here, the Biogas Project and the Grayson Repowering Project have the identical
28 objective of providing local power generation, and the Biogas Project would generate that power

12
Printed on Recycled Paper PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 through the use of gas produced at the Scholl Canyon Landfill. gas which was used for power
2 generation at the Grayson Power Plant until very recently. In fact, the EIR for the Grayson
3 Repowering Project acknowledges the interconnected nature of these projects. The Biogas Plant
4 is an alternative method for processing landfill gas. instead of processing it at the updated
5 Grayson Power Plant. Both the Biogas Project, addressing landfill gas. and the repowering of
6 Grayson Power Plant impact space at Grayson, Glendale's electricity needs and Glendale's
7 renewable portfolio. These projects are part of the whole of an action by the City and as such
8 should have been analyzed in joint EIR to address how the projects can fit together, how

9 Glendale's power needs can be met, the overall costs and how to meet Glendale's renewable
10 portfolio targets.
11 75. By failing to do so, the City has relied on an improperly "narrow view of the
12 relevant project." (California Unions for Reliable Energy v. Mojave Desert Air Quality
13 Management Dist. (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1241-1242.) "[T]he interrelated character of
14 the proposals was known in advance. [Thus] the selection of a narrow project as the launching
15 pad for a vastly wider proposal frustrated CEQA's public information aims." (County of Inyo V.
16 City of Los Angeles (1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 185, 199-200.)
17

18 Impacts Were Not Properly Analyzed in the EIR

19 76. CEQA requires the City to conduct an adequate environmental review prior to
20 making any formal decision regarding projects subject to the Act. (CEQA Guidelines § 15004.)
21 CEQA imposes upon the City a clear, present and mandatory duty to certify an EIR only if the
22 EIR fully discloses to the public the significant environmental effects that may occur. The
23 Project EIR lacked the necessary analysis.

24 Air Quality Impacts

25 77. The EIR's analysis of air quality impacts is inadequate in a number of respects.

26 78. The EIR relies on an improper baseline for its air quality analysis. Without an
27 accurate baseline, an EIR cannot accurately disclose a project's likely environmental impacts,
28 or determine whether those impacts can be fully mitigated. (Communities for a Better

13
Printed on Recycled Paper PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Environment v. South Coast Air Quality Management District (2010) 48 Cal.4th 310, 322.)
Under CEQA, a project's environmental impacts are determined by comparing the
3 environmental baseline, the without-project conditions, to with-project conditions. (CEQA
4 Guidelines §15125, subd. (a).) An artificially high baseline fails to address all project impacts
by relegating what are actually "new" impacts to existing conditions. This prevents an EIR
6 from formulating mitigation measures capturing the project's full impacts. Thus, an accurate
7 baseline is fundamental to an accurate CEQA analysis. (Citizens for East Shore Parks v.
8 California State Lands Com. (2011) 202 Cal.App.4th 549, 557.)

79. The EIR improperly relies upon the very recent condition of flaring all landfill
10 gas at SCLF using outdated flares as the baseline emissions. SCAQMD has required the
11| upgrade of these flares and permits have been sought for the upgraded and less-polluting flares.
12 Use of the required upgraded flares should have instead been identified as the baseline for
13 environmental review to provide a true comparison of the conditions with and without the
14 Biogas Project.

15 80. The draft EIR also failed to include the new regenerative gas flare as well as the
16 waste flares emissions in the calculation of the Project's emissions. These emissions were
17 disclosed in the final EIR in response to comments from South Coast Air Quality Management
18 District (*SCAQMD"). When the flares emissions were added to the Project emissions in the
19 final EIR, the final EIR acknowledged that operational NOx emissions exceed the localized
20 significance thresholds for NOx. The final EIR also shows PM10 and PM 2.5 emissions would
21 exceed localized thresholds. The City failed to identify this as a significant impact requiring
22 mitigation.
23 81. The EIR also lacks the required cumulative assessment of air quality impacts from
24 both the Biogas Project and the Grayson Repowering Project.
25 82. The EIR fails to provide adequate analysis regarding the use of natural gas
26 augmentation in the Biogas Plant and the amount of natural gas that would be required. The
27 emissions caused by the added natural gas are not included in the Project emissions; thus, the

28

14
Printed on Recycled Paper PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 EIR fails to provide required information and analysis regarding the impacts associated with the

2 Project.

3 83. The draft EIR also fails to analyze the potential impacts associated with operating

4 both the flare equipment and the Biogas Plant at the same time. The draft EIR fails to disclose
5 the air emissions that would be produced when the flare is operated at the same time as the

6 Biogas Plant. The City failed to recirculate the EIR when acknowledging emissions from the
Project's flare equipment in the final EIR. despite the fact this would significantly increase the
8 release of harmful air pollutants.

9 84. The EIR also attempts to rely on uncertain Priority Reserve credits to further
10 reduce the obligation to mitigate air quality impacts for the surrounding community. CEQA
11 Guidelines section 15126.4. subdivision (a)(2) requires that all mitigation measures be "fully
12 enforceable." Here, the EIR relies on the use of SCAQMD Priority Reserve credits to mitigate
13 the significant NOx and VOC emissions from the Biogas Project. However, the City cannot
14 approve Priority Reserve credits for the Project; only the SCAQMD can do so. The City
15 assumes the SCAQMD will approve these credits needed to claim the Project's air quality
16 impacts have been mitigated to a less than significant level, but it cannot guarantee all credits
17 will be approved.

18 85. That the City will seek these credits is not a fully enforceable mitigation measure.
19 As such, CEQA requires the City to conclude the Biogas Project will have remaining
20| significant and unavoidable air quality impacts and to make findings pursuant to Public
21 Resources Code $ 21081.

22 86. Further, reliance on these Priority Reserve credits fails to address the localized
23 health impacts of the significant exceedances of criteria pollutants at the Biogas Plant.
24 Growth Inducing Impacts
25 87. CEQA Guidelines section 15126.2, subdivision (e) requires an EIR to address any
26 growth inducing impacts associated with a project.
27

28

15
Printed on Recycled Paper PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

88. Here, the EIR fails to address growth inducing impacts associated with the Biogas
2 Project. Implementation of this Project, which relies
U upon landfill gas produced by the SCLF,

4 would indirectly encourage expansion of the SCLF and/or the installation of anaerobic digestors
at the SCLF. The City will be investing millions of dollars in infrastructure to generate power
5 from the landfill gas and will want to continue that source of fuel for its investment. The EIR
6 fails to include a detailed analysis of the amount of landfill gas that would be produced by the
7 SCLF based on its current capacity limits.

8 Greenhouse Gas Impacts
89. The EIR fails to provide an adequate analysis of the Project's greenhouse gas
10 (GHG) emissions. The EIR fails to support its claim that Project emission would be nearly
11 identical to emissions from the existing flares. The Project emissions included in the EIR do
12 not include emissions associated with natural gas augmentation, which would increase the
13 Project's GHG emissions.

14 90. The final EIR also fails to provide the required good faith response to comments
15 from SCAQMD that the Project's daily operational CO emissions exceed SCAQMD
16 significance thresholds.
17 91. Real Party has indicated an intention to make adjustments to the gas collection

18 system at SCLF in an attempt to increase methane content in the landfill gas going to the
19 Biogas Plant engines. The EIR fails to assess these changes and whether they could result in an
20 increase in methane to the atmosphere, increasing GHG emissions from the Project.

21 Wildfire and Other Hazards

22 92. The Project site is located in a Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone
23| (*VHFHSZ"), which Cal Fire designates as the most at risk for fire within the State. Thus,
24 wildfire presents a huge risk to the neighborhoods of Glenoaks and Chevy Chase Canyons,
25 Linda Vista and Eagle Rock surrounding the Project site. These neighborhoods are all limited
26 by narrow, single access roads, and any increase in wildfire risk puts
27 93. them in grave danger.
Despite this, the EIR's wildfire analysis minimizes this danger by not adequately
28 analyzing and disclosing the Project's wildfire impacts, nor its potential mitigation measures.

Printed on Recycled Paper PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

The EIR does not adequately address the Project's potential exacerbation of wildfire impacts,
2 which is required analysis as the Project is located in a VHFHSZ. The EIR also fails to analyze
3 the Project's impacts to fire evacuation routes for the surrounding communities.

4 94. The EIR also fails to adequately address the wildfire and other impacts associated
a 5 with a potential explosion originating from the proposed natural gas and pressurized landfill gas
6 pipelines.
95. The EIR further fails to analyze the effects of an earthquake on the fault line under
8 the canyon or its enhanced effects on fire danger or hazardous material dispersion. The EIR fails
9 to adequately address various hazardous materials stored on site that could leak into the landfill
10 as a result of an earthquake and/or fire. This includes the hazards associated with aqueous
11 ammonia tanks that are not adequately mitigated in case of an earthquake.

12 Land Use and Aesthetic Impacts

13 96. The Project's 60,000-gallon water tank and the 40-foot tall exhaust stacks will be
14 visible from surrounding communities and from trails if the area does revert to a recreation area
15 as set forth in the Joint Powers Agreement. There is no discussion of how the Project will affect
16 aesthetics as the landfill closes.

17 97. The Project's water tank would be located on a primary ridgeline. The EIR fails to
18 acknowledge this is a significant aesthetic impact and also a land use impact because such
19 construction on primary ridgelines is prohibited by the City's Municipal Code and General Plan.
20 Biological Impacts
21 98. The EIR fails to address that the hills surrounding the Project site serve as a
22 wildlife corridor for a number of species which could be disrupted by the Project, especially by
23 the noise the equipment would create.
24 Noise Impacts
25 99. The EIR fails to include adequate information to analyze the impacts of the
26 Project's continuous operational noise on the surrounding community and the detrimental
27 effects on humans or wildlife. The data was improperly limited, with a only a few measurements
28 taken, a on a single day five years ago.

17
Printed on Recycled Paper PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Transportation Impacts

100. The EIR underestimates the Project's impact on transportation by not including
3 increased traffic on Glenoaks Boulevard during construction, by not addressing Colorado
4 Boulevard at all. and by accepting as adequate, a failing measure of traffic on the intersection of

5 Figueroa Boulevard and SR134.

6 Recreational Impacts

7 101. The EIR includes virtually no discussion of future recreation areas on the site of

8 the SCLF after it has closed. The EIR lacks an assessment of the Project's impacts on access to
9 these recreation areas, which could be significant because the main access road crosses the
10 Project's buffer zone. The EIR also fails to address air quality, noise and hazard impacts from
11| the Project on those using the recreation areas. Additionally, no plans have been submitted
12 addressing the visibility of the Project from future recreational areas within the closed SCLF.
13

14 •The EIR Relies on an Improperly Limited Geographic Scope
15 102. CEQA requires that defensible geographic scope be used to assess a Project's
16 potentially significant impacts. (CEQA Guidelines § 15130(b)(3).) Here. the EIR improperly
17 limits the impacts of the Project to a geographical area no larger than the 2.2-acre plot on which
18 the Project would sit. the area it would physically disturb and to a community that includes only
19 a few houses within a mile of the site. In reality, however, the Biogas Project would serve a
20 535-acre regional municipal waste facility surrounded by densely populated, well-established
21 communities that have been there long before the landfill. The EIR fails to justify its limited
22 geographic scope of impact analysis. In particular, the EIR ignores impacts on Eagle Rock and
23 Pasadena neighborhoods adjacent to the Project site and its access road.
24
25 The EIR Fails to Adequately Analyze Project Alternatives
26 103. The City has a duty under CEQA to evaluate a reasonable range of
27 alternatives to the environmentally damaging proposed Project. (Laurel Heights 1, supra,
28 47 Cal.3d at 400.) As the California Supreme Court has stated: "Under CEQA, the public

18
Printed on Recycled Paper PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

agency bears the burden of affirmatively demonstrating that ... the agency's approval of
2 the proposed project followed meaningful consideration of alternatives and mitigation
3 measures." (Mountain Lion Foundation v. Fish and Game Commission (1997) 16 Cal.4th

4 105. 134.) While an EIR is "the heart of CEQA", the *core of an EIR is the mitigation and
5 alternatives sections." (Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Bd. Of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d
6 553. 564.) Preparation of an adequate EIR with analysis of a reasonable range of
7 alternatives is crucial to CEQA's substantive mandate to "prevent significant avoidable
8 damage to the environment" when alternatives or mitigation measures are feasible. (CEQA
9 Guidelines § 15002(a)(3).)
10 104. Here, an EIR was required specifically to assess alternatives to the proposed
11 Project. Unfortunately, the EIR fails to assess a reasonable range of alternatives. For
12 example, the EIR fails to assess the alternative of continuing to send landfill gas to the
13 Grayson Power Plant as it had for many years.
14 105. The EIR also fails to provide sufficient information regarding Project
15 alternatives to allow for the necessary comparison. Omission of comparative, quantitative
16 analysis of alternative does not "produce information sufficient to permit a reasonable
17 choice of alternatives so far as environmental aspects are concerned." (Kings County Farm
18 Bureau v. City of Hanford (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 692, 733-736.)

19 106. The EIR's failure to provide adequate and accurate information also prevented
20 decision makers from determining the best course for achieving the objective of safely using
21 landfill gas generated by the SCLF for beneficial purposes.

22
23 The EIR Was Required to Be Recirculated

24 107. "A lead agency is required to recirculate an EIR when significant new
25 information is added to the EIR after public notice is given of the availability of the draft EIR
26 for public review under Section 15087 but before certification." (CEQA Guidelines § 15088.5.) §
27 New information includes when information regarding a significant environmental impact not
28 disclosed in the DEIR would result unless mitigation measures are adopted that reduce the

19
Printed on Recycled Paper PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

impact to a level of insignificance. (Ibid.)

2 108. Here, the final EIR disclosed the need for a new a mitigation measure to address
3 significant adverse impacts of the industrial facility on recreational uses. The air quality

4 analysis that was revised in the final EIR pursuant to flaws in the analysis identified by

5 Petitioner's expert and others shows that there would be exceedances of thresholds of
6 significance for ambient air quality. The EIR should have been recirculated to address this
7 newly disclosed significant impact and assess mitigation measure to address identified
8 significant air quality impacts.
109. The EIR also fails to identify the significance of the loss of recreational area that
10 would result a from a necessary buffer zone from the Project site not identified until the final EIR,
11 claiming only that it would be small compared to the remainder of the recreational area. The
12 EIR should have been recirculated to disclose this new information and to impose mitigation to
13 address the newly disclosed significant adverse recreational impact.

14 110. The final EIR further include significant new information regarding the Project's
15 use of flares and need for natural gas augmentation. This new information implicates changes in
16| air quality and GHG impacts associated with the Project. This information should have been
17 addressed in a recirculated draft EIR.

18 111. A new less impactful alternative was identified prior to the release of the final
19 EIR-use of new flares with significantly less emissions. Permits were sought for these new
20 flares prior to the release of the final EIR and a revised assessment of Project alternatives should
21 have been prepared to identify these upgraded flares as the No Project Alternative.
22

23 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

24 (VIOLATION OF STATE PLANNING AND ZONING LAW)

25 112. Petitioner incorporates all previous paragraphs as if fully set forth.

26 113. The Project must be consistent with the City's General Plan. (Govt. Code §
27 65300.5; Families Unafraid to Uphold Rural Etc. County V. Board of Supervisors (1998) 62
28 Cal.App.4th 1332, 1336.) To be consistent with a general plan, a project "must be compatible

20
Printed on Recycled Paper PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

with the objectives, policies, general land uses and programs specified in the general plan."
2| (Spring Valley Lake Association v. City of Victorville (2016) 248 Cal.App.4th 91, 99, citations
3 omitted.) A city's consistency determination is reviewed for an abuse of discretion, determining
4 whether the city "reasonably could have made a determination of consistency." (Ibid.)
5 114. Under the City's General Plan, the Project site has a land use designation of
6 Recreation/Open Space, requiring strict compliance with the General Plan Open Space Element.

115. Compliance with the City's Open Space Element is of particular importance.
8 (Resource Defense Fund v. County of Santa Cruz (1982) 133 Cal.App.3d 800, 806, citations
omitted; see also Gov. Code §§ 65566, 65567.) The City is not allowed to subordinate the Open
10 Space Element to other elements of the General Plan or other land use plans, which would
11 frustrate the legislature's open space preservation intent in adopting the Open Space Lands Act.
12 (Sierra Club v. Board of Supervisors (1981) 126 Cal.App.3d 698, 704; Gov. Code §§ 65560-
13 65570.)

14 116. The City's approval of the Project violates State Planning and Zoning Law
15 because the Project is inconsistent with a number of General Plan policies and objectives,
16 including but not limited to the following:

17 117. The grading for and construction of a water tank on a primary ridgeline for the a
18 Project is inconsistent with the Open Space and Conservation Element objective to protect
19 primary ridgelines. (Open Space Element pp. 4-4, 4-38-4-40. 5-2; Land Use Element p. 24.)
20 118. The Project is inconsistent with the Open Space and Conservation Element's
21 objectives to provide for open space, natural resources, and amenities for the residents of the
22 City.

23 119. The Project is inconsistent with the Land Use Element Residential Goal to
24 "safeguard residential neighborhoods from intrusion of incompatible and disruptive uses." (LU
25 Element p. 8.) Construction and operation of the Biogas Project would be incompatible with
26 and disruptive to the surrounding residential neighborhoods. The Project's air quality impacts
27 and wildfire hazards are also incompatible with the surrounding residential neighborhood.

28 120. The Project is inconsistent with the General Plan's Safety Element, which states

21
Printed on Recycled Paper PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

that critical facilities should not be constructed in seismic zones IB. IC or IIB. Portions of the
2 Project site are located within these seismic zones and construction of the Biogas Plant on those
3 zones would be inconsistent with the General Plan.

4 121. The Project is also inconsistent with Recreation Element Objective 1, Policy 3:
5 "*The City shall enhance and expand existing recreational facilities in response to community
6 needs.' Scholl Canyon is identified as existing recreation facilities that will be expanded once
7 the landfill reaches capacity. Construction of the Biogas Plant on this site is inconsistent with
8 this objective because it will limit recreational expansion at Scholl Canyon. It is also
9 inconsistent with the Land Use Element Residential Goal to promote development of parks and
10 recreational areas. (Land Use Element p. 8.)

11 122. The wildfire hazards associated with the Project put the Project in conflict with
12 Land Use Element Goal: "Provide for measures to prevent the loss of life, injury and economic
13 dislocation resulting from fire, flood, and geologic hazards.* (Land Use Element p. 7.)

14

15 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION
16 (VIOLATION OF GLENDALE MUNICIPAL CODE)
17

18 123. Petitioner incorporates all previous paragraphs as if fully set forth.
19 124. The City's approval of the Project violates the Glendale Municipal Code because
20 the City lacks substantial evidence to support the findings required to approve a conditional use
21 permit (CUP) or Special Recreation (SR) Review for the Project.
22 125. In order to approve a CUP for the Biogas Project, pursuant to Glendale Municipal
23 Code section 30.42.030, the City must have substantial evidence that supports all of the
24 following findings:
25 A. That the proposed use will be consistent with the various elements and objectives of

26 the general plan.
27 B. That the use and its associated structures and facilities will not be detrimental to the

28

Printed on Recycled Paper PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

ur L N m public health or safety, the general welfare, or the environment.
C. That the use and facilities will not adversely affect or conflict with adjacent uses or
impede the normal development of surrounding property.
D. That adequate public and private facilities such as utilities, landscaping, parking

6 spaces and traffic circulation measures are or will be provided for the proposed use.
126. As set forth above, the Project would be inconsistent with a number of objectives
7 and policies contained in the General Plan, thus required finding A cannot be made.

8 127. The Project's emission of air pollutants could be detrimental to public health and
safety. The internal combustion engines relied upon for the Project are highly polluting and the
10 Project's operation would produce higher levels of all criteria pollutants than the current flares
11| produce. Increases in NOx, CO and VOC emissions exceed the SCAQMD significance
12 threshold without the application of priority reserve credits, which do not reduce this Project's
13 pollutant emissions. The required new flares will reduce the NOx emissions, making the
14 increase for the Project even higher.

15 128. The high levels of air pollutants require a setback zone, but this fails to protect
16 sanitation employees at the landfill and Biogas Plant.
17 129. In addition, the Project as proposed needs to use natural gas augmentation for the
18 pre-combustor starting at the beginning of the Project operation, and potentially later as well to
19| improve the power output as landfill gas (*LFG") levels decrease. This will add to the Project's
20 greenhouse gas emissions as well as further increase the criteria pollutants beyond what has
21 been disclosed.

22 130. The Project's wildfire hazards and increased noise levels would also be
23 detrimental to public health and welfare.

24 131.

25 132. For all of these reasons. required finding B cannot be supported.
The Project would expand an industrial use into an area that is currently open
26 space, delaying the required conversion of this land to recreational uses as required by the Joint
27 Powers Agreement and the City's General Plan, preventing required finding C.

28 133. The City's findings in support of the CUP lack substantial evidence and fail to

Printed on Recycled Paper 23
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

"bridge the analytic gap between the raw evidence and ultimate decision." (Topanga Assn. for a
2 Scenic Community v. County of Los Angeles (1974) 11 Cal.3d 506, 514-515.)

134. The City also lacks substantial evidence to support the findings required to
approve the SR Review. The purpose of SR Review is "provided due to the unique and special
characteristics of the variety of recreational uses possible in order to foster compatibility
6 between uses and to protect the public health, safety and general welfare of the community."
7 (Glendale Municipal Code § 30.15.010(D).)

8 135. To approve SR Review, the City must find that the Project is in "conformance
9 with the comprehensive general plan, public access and circulation" and that it would not have
10 an adverse effect on "existing or planned uses and development of the surrounding private or
11 public property, and [that] the recreational objectives and services being offered to the public."
12 (Glendale Municipal Code § 30.15.040(F).) As discussed above, this finding cannot be made.

13 136. The Project also does not provide recreational uses and fails to adequately protect
14 public health, safety and welfare of the community, further preventing approval of SR Review
15 under the Glendale Municipal Code.

16
