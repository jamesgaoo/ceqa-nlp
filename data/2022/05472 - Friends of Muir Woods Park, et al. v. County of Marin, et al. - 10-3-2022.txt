PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA, MCMC)

1 Petitioners, Friends of Muir Woods Park and Watershed Alliance of Marin

2 Allege:

I. INTRODUCTION

5 1. Through this Complaint and Verified Petition for Writ of Administrative Mandate
6 (*Petition"). Petitioners acting in the interest of protecting the environment and health and safety,
7 seek to compel the setting aside of Marin County Board Of Supervisors ("County") September
8 22, 2022 approval of the Dipsea Ranch (Weissman) land division and Mitigated Negative

q Declaration ("MND and its Amendment"). If allowed to proceed, the Project - a development of
10 3 to 21 luxury homes - impacts due to grading, housing and road construction and other

11 operations will cause irreversible harm to Redwood Creek and its ecosystems, endangered
12 species, including Northern Spotted Owl, Coho Salmon, Steelhead and to other wildlife, which
13 use the property as a corridor. The Project also presents other substantial risks including impacts
14 to surface water quality, increased fire hazard risk, and traffic safety on Panoramic Highway,
15 including vehicular accidents due to access by a narrow, winding, shoulderless road, with blind
16 curyes, poor visibility and heavy bike and car traffic.
17 2. In essence, this case is about whether government agency, Marin County, must fulfill
18 its duty to oversee and ascertain the facts about the Project's environmental impacts or whether
19 the County can abdicate its role as regulatory and permitting authority and rely solely on
20 consultant assessments conducted on behalf of the applicant. From its inception the Project
21 generated enormous public and expert opposition as a result of the numerous errors, omissions,
22 and lack of quantification of impacts and unscientific claims in the hydrological, geological, and
23 biological assessments of the Project. A state public trust agency, the California Department of
24 Fish and Wildlife ("CDFW"), other expert scientists and even the County's own consultants
25 criticized the County's remarkable assertions that, despite the project affecting a Federal
26 jurisdictional wetland and depositing sediment in a tributary of Redwood Creek that no impacts
27

28 -1-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA, MCMC)

1 would be made to water quality, wetlands or endangered species, including Coho Salmon and
2 Steelhead.

3 3. In 2017 and 2018, the applicant and property owner, Daniel Weissman ("Weissman" or
4 "Developer"), submitted various proposals to subdivide steeply sloped parcels in or near 455
5 Panoramic Highway, Mill Valley and adjacent to Mt. Tamalpajs State Park and develop from 13 6 to 14 homes. Those applications were withdrawn or lapsed.
7 In 2018, the Developer applied to subdivide a central portion of his property, currently 8 three single-family residential lots with developed with one single-family residence, into
Q each lot. The County's Tamalpais Design Review Board proposed building envelopes on

was 10 ("TDRB") and the Petitioners, however, communicated to the County that the Developer 11 arguably entitled to build not just three but twelve (12) units on that property. Therefore, while
12 the Project proposal allows development of a total of three luxury single-family homes, the 13 Developer can also arguably develop a total of twelve units on the property without further 14 permitting due to State law allowing for "by-right" development of second and third units. The 15 TDRB and Petitioners objected to the Project, stating that 12 units built in such an ?9 environmentally sensitive area was inappropriate and would cause significant environmental
17 impacts. On April 2, 2020, the Marin County Planning Commission approved the Dipsea Ranch 18 Land Division, AKA Dipsea Ranch Tentative Map (*Dipsea Ranch Subdivision" or 19 Il "Subdivision" or "Project") and accompanying Mitigated Negative Declaration ("MND and its
20 Amendment").

21 On August 5, 2020, Petitioners appealed the Marin County Planning Commission's
22 approval of the Project to the Board of Supervisors.
23 6. On October 6, 2020, after extensive public controversy over the County's repeated failure
24 to provide public notice to the neighbors and post local site notice as required by the Government 25 Code, the Board of Supervisors held a hearing on the Project and accompanying MND and its
26 identifying issues with the MND and its Amendment. The County received dozens of letters
27

-2- 28
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA, MCMC)

1 Amendment regarding the lack of data, conflicting data and unsupported conclusions regarding
2 the project description and existing conditions regarding the fire road illegally built by
3 Weissman, the grading, cut and fill for the Project, and the new and altered drainages. These
4 letters also addressed the environmental impacts related to those issues.
5 7. Residents within the Redwood Creek watershed, members of the public, scientists and
6 technical experts, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife and the National Park Service,
7 commented that the Project will cause significant unmitigated environmental impacts to geology
8 and soils, wildfire hazards, hydrology and water quality, land use and planning, traffic safety,
9 and biological resources, including salmonid species listed by the Federal government as
10 endangered, including Steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and Coho Salmon (Oncorhynchus
11 kisutch). Redwood Creek has been declared critical habitat for both Steelhead and Coho

12 Salmon. Despite the evidence of potential significant impacts, the County chose to only prepare
13 an Initial Study/Mitigated Negative Declaration (*MND and its Amendment") for the Project
14 instead of a more comprehensive Environmental Impact Report ("EIR"), thereby leaving the
15 County and the public without the scientific data and analysis necessary for a project with such
16 impacts.. The evidence also showed that the Project is inconsistent would adversely affect
17  ecosystems in Mount Tamalpais State Park and the Muir Woods National Monument.
18 9. Despite the public's effort and despite the evidence of potential significant impacts, the
19 County chose to only prepare an Initial Study/Mitigated Negative Declaration (*MND") and a
20 document titled "MND Amendment" for the Project both of which lack the data and analysis
21 required by CEQA thereby leaving the County and the public without the scientific data and
22 analysis necessary to review project impacts.

23 10. On October 6, 2020, the County ignored the community, including the County's Tam
24 Design Review Board and environmental groups approved the subdivision map and the MND
25 and its Amendment.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA, MCMC)

I1. On November 4, 2020, Petitioners filed a first suit against the County of Marin for
2 violations of CEQA and the Subdivision Map Act ("SMA"),
3 12. Petitioners asked the Marin County Superior Court to find that the County failed to
4 comply with the California Environmental Quality Act (Pub, Res. Code, §§ 21000 et seq.
5 "CEQA"), and Government Code requirements in the Subdivision Map Act (Gov't Code 6 64110 el seq. "SMA") and the County Municipal Code (e.g. § 22.82.050) requiring all tentative
7 maps to be compliant and consistent with the general plans and community plans. 8 13. In a January 10, 2022 ruling, the Court found that the MND and its Amendment approved by
9 the County violated CEQA on numerous grounds, including project description and existing
10 conditions for the fire road, grading, cut and fill, and drainage. The Court found that the County
11 had not violated the Subdivision Map Act.
12 14. On January 10, 2022, the Court issued a Judgment and Writ of Mandate, setting aside all the
13 County approvals for the Project including the voiding of both the subdivision approval and the
14 MND. Petitioners had not requested and the Court did not require the County to prepare an
15 Environmental Impact Report. The Court did not require the County to Return to Writ. As of the
16 date of filing this Petition for Writ of Mandate, the County still has not returned to Writ.
17 15. On January 27, 2022, County staff originally and appropriately determined that the
18 Planning Department and Planning Commission should consider and review the MND and its
19 Amendment "Amendment." County staff communicated this decision to the public. However,
20 that decision was reversed and the County skipped Marin County Municipal Code required steps
21 to provide required circulation, reasonable time to review the MND and its Amendment,
22 opportunity to appeal the MND and its Amendment, thereby violating the Petitioners due process
23 rights.

24 16. Despite losing the lawsuit, the County issued a barebones improper "Amendment" to the
25 MND and its Amendment on June 24, 2022 despite County staff having knowledge that key
26 members of Petitioners were out of town in July.
27

28 -4-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA, MCMC)

1 17. Despite the County intentionally planning the circulation period for a time when
2 Petitioners were out of town, Petitioners managed to retain an expert Geomorphologist, Laurel
3 Collins, who wrote a 56 page letter carefully and technically scrutinizing the Project, the
4 County's geological and hydrological reports and the MND and its Amendment "Amendment."
5 Ms. Collins' extensive analysis clearly demonstrated that the County did not provide adequate
6 discussion of the Project Description and the Existing Conditions and that the Amendment was
7 based on unsupported, skeletal, and arbitrary conclusions regarding the impacts related to the fire
8 road, grading, cut and fill, and drainage. Petitioners also submitted a CV for an additional
9 expert, Lotic Environmental. On or about July 4, 2022, Geologist Préston Brown and Watershed
10 and Coho Salmon expert, Joe Brunner submitted expert comments critiquing the MND and

11 /"Amendment."

12 18. On or about the evening of August 20, 2022 or morning of August 21, 2022, the County
13 released its "Response to Comments." However, these responses were again barebones, not
14 supported by expert or other technical analysis and barely bothered to address Ms. Collins, Mr.
15 Brown or Mr. Brunner's comments, except to attempt to denigrate all three experts.
16 19. On August 23, 2022, the County again approved the MND and its Amendment, again,
17 violating CEQA because there are no actual scientific studies or surveys to support the County's
18 conclusions regarding the fire road, grading and cut and fill and drainage and that the related
19 impacts are less than significant. The MND and its Amendment provides little data, modeling

20 or explanation of the future impacts of the supposed mitigation and provides no required
21 performance standards for the deferred mitigation.

22 20. Under CEQA, a plan must consider the impacts of past, present, and foreseeable future
23 projects combined with the incremental impacts of those potentially caused by the project. The
24 MND and its Amendment violated this requirement because it dismissed the impacts of the
25 Developer's previous illegal grading on property. Therefore, the County failed to consider the
26

27

28 •5-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA, MCMC)

1 contributions of that grading, Project grading and construction and increased runoff due to new
2 impermeable surfaces into the Redwood Creek watershed.
3 21. As such, the County failed to provide support to its required findings that (a) that the
4 design of the subdivision or the proposed improvements are likely to cause substantial
5 environmental damage or substantially and avoidably injure fish or wildlife or their habitat. The
6 County did not and could not make required Project findings because among other reasons: the
7 Project's property's steep slopes, and geological and hydrology restraints, the Project's sediment
8 and polluted runoff into Redwood Creek, existing conditions of the property as potential habitat
9 for wildlife species, including listed endangered species and the slope stability and extreme fire
10 hazard risks to human health.

11 22. Petitioners ask this Court to find that the County failed to comply with the California
12 •Environmental Quality Act, Pub. Res. Code, §§ 21000 et seq. ("CEQA") and the CEQA
13 Guidelines, Title 14, California Code of Regulations, §§ 15000 et seq. ("CEQA Guidelines"),
14 and Code of Civ. Proc. § 1094.5 regarding approval of the Project and the Subdivision.
15 Through this Petition, Petitioners further request that this Court again issue a writ of mandate ? 9 setting aside and voiding the County's approval of the Subdivision and accompanying MND and 17 its Amendment.

10 C. Standing

11 32. Petitioners and their members are beneficially interested in the County's full compliance
12 with the law regarding the County's approval of the Subdivision and MND and its Amendment.
13 The Petitioners are residents of the County of Marin and Mill Valley, whose personal, health,
14 professional and aesthetic interests of Petitioners and the persons associated with them will be
15 injured if the Project, pursuant to the Subdivision, as approved by the County, is allowed to
16 proceed as planned. Petitioners are within the class of persons beneficially interested in and
17 aggrieved by the County's approval as alleged below. Petitioners include individuals who
18 expressed their concerns and objections to the approval of the Subdivision directly to County
19 staff and at County meetings and in correspondence to the County. Respondents owed a
20 mandatory duty to comply with the legal duties that Petitioners allege were violated before
21 approving the Subdivision. Petitioners have the right to enforce the mandatory duties that CEQA
22 imposes on Respondents.
23 D, Factual and Procedural Background
24 |33. The applicant and property owner, Daniel Weissman ("Weissman" or "Developer") owns
25 the property, which is located in and around 455 Panoramic Highway, Mill Valley, further
26 identified as Assessor's Parcel 046-161-11 (*Property").
27

28 -8-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA, MCMC)

1 34. In 2016, Developer applied for and was given approval for separate sewer hookups to the
2 Property by the Local Area Formation Commission ("LAFCO") and the Homestead Valley
3 Community Service District. Three Members of the County Board of Supervisors are members
4 or alternates on the LAFCO.

5 35. In or about 2015, 2017 and 2018, the applicant and property owner, Daniel Weissman
6 ("Weissman" or "Developer"), submitted proposals to subdivide parcels on steeply sloped acres
7 (including parcels of 8.29 acres and 1.8 acres) of property adjacent to Mt. Tamalpais State Park
8 in the County of Marin, California and develop from 14 homes with associated accessory
9 dwelling units and junior dwelling units.
10 36. In 2018, the Developer applied to subdivide a central portion of his property, currently
11 developed with one single-family residence, into three single-family residential lots with
12 proposed building envelopes on each lot. The Developer submitted technical studies, requesting
13 a Subdivision for the Project. Marin County staff later conducted an initial study and prepared
14 the MND for the Project. The County identifies this Subdivision and Project as ID P1589.
15 37. The County's Tamalpais Design Review Board and the Petitioners, however, informed
16 the County that the Developer was arguably entitled to build not just three but twelve (12) units
17 on that property. Before and during the Marin County Planning Commission hearing on the
18 Project, the TDRB and Petitioners objected, stating that additional units, including 12 possible
19 units due to state housing law ministerial approval requirements in such an environmentally

20 sensitive area was inappropriate and would cause significant environmental impacts.

21 38. On April 2, 2020, the Marin County Planning Commission approved the Dipsea Ranch
Land Division, AKA Dipsea Ranch Tentative Map (*Dipsea Ranch Subdivision" or 22

23 "Subdivision" or "Project") and accompanying Mitigated Negative Declaration ("MND").
39. On August 5, 2020, Petitioners, including Friends of Muir Woods Park's 150 community 24 members and the Watershed Alliance of Marin, signed a Petition and appealed the County 25 Planning Commission's approval of the Mitigated Negative Declaration and Tentative Map 26 Subdivision (dated July 27, 2020) to the County Board of Supervisors. This approval was based,

23 actual grading or impervious surfaces allowed, nor specific hydrologic performance criteria nor

24 the exact development scenario.
40.
25 On October 6, 2020, the Marin County Board of Supervisors conducted a hearing on

26 Petitioners appeal. At the public hearing, the Board heard oral and written testimony and

27 evidence presented or filed regarding the MND and its Amendment and the Project. Petitioners'

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA, MCMC)

1 members attended the public hearing. Issues raised in the Board hearing by WAM and others
2 included: the need for an environmental impact report based on expert testimony and publicly
3 disclosed potential impacts of Project impacts to wetlands, habitat, and species in Redwood
4 Creek; fire hazards due to increase structures in a urban wildland interface, surface water quality;
5 geologic feasibility and landslide hazards; traffic and safety on Panoramic Highway; cultural
6 resources; lack of consistency with the CWP and TACP and alleged segmentation of CEQA
7 review:

8 41. At the end of the public hearing on October 6, 2020, the County approved the
Q Subdivision and accompanying Mitigated Negative Declaration ("MND and its Amendment") in
10 a 4 to 1 vote. The Project proposal allows development of a total of three luxury single-family
11 homes, yet the Developer can also do an additional lot split, build duplexes, and develop four
12 Accessory Dwelling Units ("ADU") and four Junior units on the property without further.
13 permitting due to State law allowing for by-right development of such units. (Government Code
14 Section 65852.2 et seq.) The Project approvals also include construction of two new septic
15 systems and the extension of an existing driveway which serves the current residence as well as
16 addition of a stop sign and new acceleration lane within double blind curves on Panoramic Hwy.
17 42. On November 3, 2020, Petitioners filed suit against Marin County for violating CEQA
18 and the SMA due to the reasons identified supra Paras 39-41.
19 43. On January 10, 2022, the Hon. Andew-E. Sweet of the Marin County Superior Court
20 found that the County had violated CEQA by failing to properly prepare the Project Description 21 and Existing Conditions portions of the MND and its Amendment. The Court's Ruling and
22 February 7, 2022 Judgment declared the MND legally inadequate, which ruling included the
23 following holdings: given these important characteristics of the Project site, the description of
24 the Project is lacking in that the specific plans for excess fill from the Project's grading
25 activities are not addressed; an environmental review should address this issue in more detail
26 given the County's recognition that the streams downslope are tributaries to Redwood Creek;

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA, MCMC)

1 the IS/MND does not describe the more recent investigation or studies that were conducted to
2 reach these conclusions or support the description of the current state of the property in the
3 IS/MND. Any supporting study or investigation is insufficient particularly given the earlier study
4 which is potentially inconsistent with this description; further development of the fire road is not
5 itself part of the Project, but the fire road extends across the lots (e.g. AR 95) and its continued
6 use is a reasonably foreseeable use of the Project; as a result, the ISIMND does not satisfy
7 Section 15063 with respect to its description of soil stability around the fire road; the Court
8 agrees with Petitioners that there is some conflicting information in the record regarding the
9 location of the drainages on the property and, specifically, whether they run through any WCA
10 or SCA; The IS/MND should clarify the information regarding the location of drainages at the
11 property in relation to any SCA or WCA and discuss, if applicable, any mechanisms to divert
12 water away from these areas and related environmental impacts. The Court issued Writ of
13 Mandate on February 8, 2022 setting aside all County approvals for the Dipsea Ranch Project.
14 44. On January 27, 2022, the County stated on its website that it would revise and recirculate
15 the MND and its Amendment and submit it to the Marin County Planning Department/Planning 16 | Commission.
17 45. On May 23, 2022, Petitioners contacted County Planning Department staff, Sabrina
18 Cardoza and Jeremy Terjerian, announcing that they would be out of the County and not
19 available during July 2022.

20 46. On or around June 15, 2022, the County took down the announcement made on January
21 27, 2022 regarding Planning Commission approval, and instead announced that they would
22 circulate an "amendment" to the MND and its Amendment during June and July 2022 for 20
23 days and then have the Board of Supervisors consider and approve the Project Approvals.
24 47, Petitioners hired an expert geomorphologist. Laurel Collins; who has over 30 years of
25 expert field work experience in the San Francisco Bay Area, including the greater Mount
26 Tamalpais watershed for clients including the County of Marin, an attorney to submit comments
27

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA, MCMC)

1 to the County on their behalf. Ms. Collins' July 14, 2022 letter to the County regarding the
2 Dipsea Ranch Project, included 47 pages of technical comments in the areas of geology,
3 hydrology, geomorphology, soil stability, and polluted runoff. These comments found that the
4 MND and its Amendment and the "Amendment" relied on inaccurate or incomplete information
5 and were scientifically baseless.
6 48. Ms. Collins' commented that the hydrological and geological reports had inaccurate and
7 incomplete, out of date, and inaccurate information and conclusions regarding rainfall, geology,
8 soil, stability, landslides, and other earth movement, hydrology, drainages. Ms. Collins also
9 commented that because the MND and Amendment relied on the faulty hydrology and geology
10 reports and provided no new technical data or analysis, thereby failing to address the incomplete
11 report regarding land stability, historical landslides, weather patterns and scientific likelihood of
12 potential soil movement into streambeds in the project areas. Ms. Collins also commented on the
13 MND and Amendment's lack of specificity regarding soil movement impacts and mitigation and
14 failed to demonstrate the effectiveness of BMPs or other measures to mitigate project sediment
15 impacts. Ms. Collins also stated that the photographs and imagery depicted in the record of
16 landslide instability substantiate concerns that slope instability/Fire trail issues have not been
17 adequately addressed to claim that the proposed project will not have negative impacts.
18 49. Petitioners' members, including Laura Chariton, and other community group members,
19 including Judy Schreibman and other experts and community members also submitted letters
20 objecting to the discussion and conclusions in the "Amendment.",

21 50. Letters submitted to the County include a July 15, 2022 letter by expert Preston Brown,
22 who has 13 years.of field experience in Coho Salmon watershed management, who discussed the
23 failure of the MND and Amendment to adequately discuss modification of to the Redwood
24 Creek watershed and impacts to Coho Salmon. Mr. Brown stated thät the proposed
25 development's Stormwater Control Plan and routing patterns into the existing wetland and

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA, MCMC)

ephemeral creek setbacks will likely adversely impact downstream salmon habitat and critical
2 base flows due to likely erosion and suspended sediment loads from steep slopes.
3 51. Letters submitted to the County included a July 15, 2022 letter by Joe Brunner P.E., who 4 has 40 years of experience in Geotechnical and Environmental Engineering, who commented on
5 the MND and Amendment's failure to adequately discuss soil stability, land movement, and
6 drainage factors and impacts. Mr. Brunner stated that; 1250 cubic yards of undocumented fill
7 was illegally (without a grading permit) dumped and rolled by the Developer fill was placed 8 directly on a "wetlands" and ephemeral creek headwater area; the protections designated by the
9 Marin 2007 Countywide Plan require 100-foot setbacks for construction which the road fill
10 violates; this amounts to approximately 120 dump truckloads of fill placed during the rainy
11 season, the worst conditions for fill placement; this fill was placed over a defunct "fire access
12 road;" there are no records of the source of this fill, any geotechnical classification, or whether it
13 is environmentally certified as "clean fill".
14 52. Letters submitted to the County commenting on the MND and Amendment included a
15 July 15, 2022 letter by Petitioners' attorney Edward E. Yates, who discussed the County failures
16 to abide by its Municipal Code and deny the Petitioners the right to adequate due process,
17 including but not limited to notice, opportunity to comment, sufficient circulation, right to appeal
18 and opportunity to be heard. Mr. Yates also stated thät Petitioners would return to court if the
19 County did not address its failures to provide due process and comply with CEQA,
20 53. Late on Friday, August 20 or on the morning of Saturday August 21, the County
21 published a Response to Comments. Those comments were drafted by County contract staff.
22 The Responses included limited, new analysis that was missing from the circulated MND and
23 Amendment. However, the Responses included no new technical data or analysis or response
24 and Respondents instead, included only nontechnical, one paragraph replies regarding the letters,
25 data and analysis in the letters by Ms. Collins, Mr. Brown Mr. Brunner, and Mr. Yates.

1 54. One working day later, on August 23, 2022, the County Board of Supervisors held a
2 hearing on the adequacy of the MND and its Amendment and regarding the subdivision
3 approval. As such, the Board, the public and the Petitioners had only one working day to review
4 substantially new discussion and responses before the Board. Petitioners and their attorney
5 attended the meeting and made comments objecting to the approvals proposed by Staff but had
6 no time to submit comments regarding the substance of the Responses, which Responses
7 included the vast bulk of the Amendment. The County, however, voted that same day to
8 approve the MND and its Amendment and the subdivision approval with no additional study,
9 pollution prevention or other mitigation measures.

10 55. Petitioners

11 56. This action is timely filed within 30 days as required by Pub. Res. Code § 21167.5.
12 E. Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies

13 57. In accordance with Public Resources Code section 21177, subdivisions (b) and (c),
14 Petitioners and their members objected to the approval of the project orally or in writing during
15 the public comment periods prior to the close of the public hearings on the project before
16 Planning Commission and the Board of Supervisors before the County approvals of the
17 Subdivision and MND and its Amendment and the filing of the notice of determination.
18 Petitioners have performed any and all conditions precedent to the filing of this Petition and, to
19 the extent required, have exhausted all available administrative remedies in that the
20 determination by the County is final and no further administrative appeal procedures are
21 provided by state or local law. Alternatively, Petitioners were not provided opportunity to raise
22 the grounds of noncompliance alleged in this Petition prior to the County's decision to approve
23 the Subdivision. Further, Petitioners do not believe they are required to exhaust their
24 administrative remedies, because to attempt to do so would be futile and Petitioners do not have
25 adequate administrative remedies.

26 58. The Petitioners have complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.5

3 59, The Petitioners have elected to haye the County prepare the record of proceedings
4 pending an estimate by the County in the above-captioned proceeding or to pursue an alternative
5 method of record preparation pursuant to Public Resources Code Section 21167.6(b)(2). 6 Notification of the Election to Prepare the Administrative Record is attached as Exhibit B.
7 F. Notice Requirements
8 60. In accordance with Pub. Res. Code § 21167.5 and Code of Civ. Proc. § 1021.5, on
9 October 28, 2020, Petitioners served Respondent the County with a Notice of Intent to Sue in an
10 effort to resolve disputes set forth in this Petition, and to provide notice to the County that if the
11 matter could not be resolved, Petitioners would file this action. The County did not respond to
12 this Notice. A true and correct copy of the Notice of Intent to Sue is attached hereto as Exhibit
13 A.

14 61, In accordance with Pub. Res. Code § 21167.7 and Code of Civ. Proc. § 388, Petitioners
15 a will serve a copy of this pleading on the Attorney General's office, within ten business days.
16 G. No Adequate Remedy
17 62. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law,
18 within the meaning of Code of Civ. Proc. § 1086 because Petitioners, their members, and the
19 public will be irreparably harmed by the ensuing environmental damage and by Respondent's
20 violations of CEQA. The County has prejudicially abused its discretion in approving the
21 Subdivision and the MND and its Amendment, At all times mentioned herein, the County has
22 been able to deny the approval of the MND and its Amendment and approval and operation of
23 the Subdivision at issue. Despite such ability, and despite Petitioners' demand for denial, the
24 County has failed and continues to fail to perform its duty to deny the approval and operation of
25 the Subdivision and the MND and its Amendment.

3 enjoined from engaging in cutting trees, clearing land, grading, excavating and constructing
4 facilities on this Subdivision site, the land, wildlife habitat, and environmental values subject to
5 and affected by the Subdivision will suffer irreparable and permanent damage.
6 64. Petitioners bring this action as a private attorney general pursuant to Code of Civ. Proc. §
7 1021.5 to enforce important rights affecting the public interest. Issuance of the relief requested in
8 this Petition will confer a significant benefit on a large class of persons by ensuring that the
9 County does not approve the Subdivision and MND and its Amendment without complying with
10 CEQA. The necessity and financial burden of enforcement are such as to make an award of
11 attorney's fees appropriate in this proceeding. Absent this timely enforcement action.by
12 Petitioners, the Subdivision and MND and its Amendment might otherwise be deemed lawfully
13 approved, despite the County's failure to comply with CEQA.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA, MCMC)

1 67. The Superior Court's Writ of Mandate in Friends of Muir Woods v. County of Marin
2 (CIV 2003248) voided the County's approvals. As such, the County must comply with all
3 CEQA, SMA and County Muni Code procedural requirements for approval of maps and CEQA
4 documents. See e.g. Pub. Res. Code §§ 21091(b); 21092; 14 CCR $$15072; 15073, including 5 noticing relevant Federal and state agencies due to the regional impacts. Given the regional 6 nature of potential Project impacts, the IS/MND and its Amendment must be submitted to the
7 State Clearinghouse and circulated for a minimum of 30 days. Ibid.; Pub. Res. Code § 8 21082.1(c)(4). The County however failed to provide such noticing to the public and Federal
9 and state agencies and failed to circulate the MND and its Amendment to the public for the
10 stated 30 days.

11 68. The Marin County Municipal Code requires that CEQA documents be approved by the
12 Community Development Director. (Muni Code $§ 22.40.020 - Review Authority for County
13 Land Use and Zoning Decisions, Table 4-1; 22.40.060, 22.110.030.) Then, if the applicant or
14 interested members of the public choose to appeal, that appeal shall be considered by the
15 Planning Commission unless the Director makes certain findings. Muni Code §§. 22.110.030,
16 22.114.020. The finding in 22.114.020(a)(3) is that the appeal "Would not raise substantial
17 policy issues or result in community-wide impacts, including community character and traffic
18 congestion."

19 69. The County notified the public on the County website in January 27, 2022 that it was it
20 going to submit the approvals to the County Planning Commission for review. The County,
21 however, with essentially no notice, violated its own Municipal code and Petitioners due process
22 rights by changing the approval process.so that the new proposal and IS/MND and its 23 Amendment will be submitted directly to the Board of Supervisors for approval of the SMA map
24 and the IS.

25 70. The County made this decision before any findings were made despite there being no 26 completed or approved IS/MND and its Amendment to base such a finding. Thus, the County
27

28 -18-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA, MCMC)

1 has improperly and baselessly predetermined the outcome of its duty to make regulatory findings
2 without the required underlying evidence and therefore, has additionally demonstrated its bias.
3 Second, the Director did not have the authority to refer any possible appeal directly to the Board
4 because no required findings were made. As set out in the July 15, 2022 letter by Petitioner's
5 attorney Edward E. Yates, this proposal, therefore, violates the County's own Muni Code
6 procedural requirements by skipping Planning Department review and by denying Petitioners the
7 due process right to appeal the Planning Director and/or Planning Commissions determinations
8 regarding SMA and CEQA approval. Mr. Yates letter also describes County failures to abide by
9 its Municipal Code and deny the Petitioners the right to adequate due process, including but not
10 limited to notice, opportunity to comment, sufficient circulation, and opportunity to be heard.
11 71. The County failed to make the findings in 22.114.020(a)(3) and could not have made
12 such findings because any such findings could not meet the Muni Code requirements for projects
13 with wide community interest and impacts. The County Violated CEQA, Municipal Code and
14 SMA Procedures Denying Petitioners the Right to Appeal.
15 72. '[W]hen functioning in such an adjudicatory capacity, the city council must be "neutral
16 and unbiased." (Woody's Group, Inc. v. City of Newport Beach (2015) 233 Cal.App.4th 1012,

18 1 3:426, p. 3-70 ['A decisionmaker must be unbiased (meaning that the decisionmaker has no
19 conflict of interest, has not prejudged the specific facts of the case, and is free of prejudice
20 [***37] against or in favor of any party)'].)" Petrovich Development Co., LLC v. City of
21 Sacramento (2020) 48 Cal.App.5th 963, 973

22 73. Not complying with procedural requirements potentially violätes due process. Breakzone
23 Billiards v. City of Torrance (2000) 81 Cal.Ap.4th 1205, 1235-6. Thus, the County
24 Demonstrated Bias In Making the Approvals.

26 Municipal Code by truncating the County's CEQA review, evidenced by County Staff's

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQÃ, MCMC)

1 admission that the County intentionally circulated the "Amendment" when it knew key members
2 of Petitioners would be out of town.

3 75. These substantial failures to comply with the County Municipal Code and due process
4 requirements for circulation, notice, Director review, and an appeal right were prejudicial and 5 caused substantial injuries to Petitioners due to Petitioners lack of opportunity for an appeal, and 6 lack of opportunity to address the Responses, resulting in a lack of meaningful fair hearing.
7 Gov't Code § 65010.
8 III. SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION - VIOLATIONS OF THE CALIFORNIA
9 ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT
10 Against all Respondents and Does
11 Petitioners re-allege and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs in their entirety, as
12 though fully set forth herein.

13 76. CEQA requires the County to conduct adequate environmental review prior to
14 making any formal decision regarding projects subject to the Act. CEQA requires that an MND
15 and its Amendment identify, evaluate and mitigate the possible significant environmental
16 impacts of the proposed project. Pub. Res. Code §§ 21002, 21080.
17 77. CEQA imposes upon the County a clear, present and mandatory duty to approve an MND
18 and its Amendment only if the MND and its Amendment fully discloses to the public the project
19 description, existing conditions and significant environmental effects that may occur due to 20 implementation of a project and only if all feasible alternatives and mitigation measures have
21 been incorporated to avoid or reduce these impacts.
22 78, If there is substantial evidence in the record that the project will have significant impacts,
23 the lead agency must prepare an Environmental Impact Report ("EIR".) Pub. Res. Code 24 §21080(d), §21080.3, §§21082.1, 21100, 21151; CEQA Guidelines §§ 15063-15064(f).

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA, MCMC)

79. The MND and its Amendment must also provide substantial evidence that all impacts
2 have been mitigated below the level of significance. Pub. Res. Code §§ 21002, 21080, CEQA
3 Guidelines §§ 15063, 15064, 15070-15075.

4 80. The County prejudicially abused its discretion in permitting the discretionary project
5 (Subdivision) without adequate evidence and justification which might authorize the use of an
6 MND and its Amendment instead of an EIR as is required by CEQA.
7 81. The County's failures to comply with CEQA include, but are not limited to, the
8 following:
9 A. Inadequate Project Deseription

10 82. Every MND and its Amendment must contain project description of a project's
11 technical, economic, and environmental characteristics." CEQA Guidelines §§ 15070, 15071.
12 An EIR "is an informational document" that must be "prepared with a sufficient degree of
13 analysis to provide decisionmakers with information which enables them to make a decision
14 which intelligently takes account of environmental consequences." CEQA requires the analysis
15 of potential impacts to be "reasonably thorough" and specific at the project level. Accordingly, a
16 project description must be sufficiently detailed for environmental impact analysis to determine
17 technical compliance with CEQA. CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15063, 15071.
18 83. An MND and its Amendment's project description must also be stable and finite.
19 84. The MND and its Amendment does not fully describe Project required excavation and
20 carthmoving and supporting studies improperly exclude detailed description of proposed grading
21 and placement of impermeable surfaces, and does not include necessary detail regarding quantity
22 of soil excavated, moved and placed in other locations., excavations for septic tanks and tree
23 remoyals resulting in less soil retention.

24 85. The MND and its Amendment does not consider all project components such as
25 impermeable surfaces and change to drainage, which could cause direct and indirect impacts
26 (e.g. erosion/sedimentation, stream setbacks,) from the Project caused by activities or project
27

28 -21-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA, MCMC)

1 components. This includes the County failure to adequately discuss project drainage, grading, 2 cut and fill and resulting myriad changes in water course patterns as set out in letters submitted 3 to the County by geologist, Joe Brunner, biologist and restoration expert Preston Brown, and 4 geomorphologist Laurel Collins. This inadequate project description includes lack of discussion 5 of t key project element, construction of a driveway and turn around serving the existing house. 6 The County itself has stated that the driveway must be upgraded to accommodate the fire trucks 7 and equipment. The County has also stated that there must be an upgrade for this road to 8 accommodate a 30-ton fire apparatus in all weather conditions and there are limitations on the 9 grade of the driveway, and that the surface will support the aforementioned weight in all weather
10 conditions.

11 B. Existing Conditions

12 86. CEQA requires that an environmental review document include a description of the 13 physical environmental conditions in the vicinity of the project in order to assist in the
14 determination as to whether an impact is significant. CEQA Guidelines §§ 15063, 15071(b). 15 This description must be sufficiently comprehensive to allow the project's impacts to be 16 considered. Courts have held that generalized references are not sufficient and that the
17 description must be of specific location and extent of riparian habitat on or near the project 18 property. San Joaquin Raptor/Wildlife Rescue Center v. County of Stanislaus (1994) 27 Cal.
19 App. 4th 713. CEQA also requires that an agency correctly identify the existing conditions as
20 the baseline for the project against which the project's environmental impacts are measured.
21 87. The County prejudicially abused its discretion, did not support its MND and its
22 Amendment approval with substantial evidence, and failed to proceed according to the law in its 23 failure to, among other things, approve the MND and its Amendment, which was incomplete and 24 incorrect and insufficient to evaluate significant environmental effects, without sufficient
25 information regarding sensitive plant species, wetland soils, wetlands vegetation and riparian 26 habitat that exist in the project area; neglected to require surveys for or data on these
27

28 -22-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA, MCMC)

1 species/habitats, such as Steelhead trout and Coho salmon which are documented to historically

2 occur in Redwood Creek and for which the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service has

3 established protections. The MND and its Amendment fails to provide a clear or accurate

4 baseline for groundwater, surface stream, wildlife, or other resources and fails to provide any
5 impact analysis, quantification, industry accepted wildlife or wetland plant surveys or even a
6 detailed description of Redwood Creek, riparian habitat in the Project, and fails to delineate
7 wetlands on the Property or discuss Project runoff impacts to seasonal wetlands on the property.
8 88. The MND and its Amendment has not adequately identified existing conditions,
9 including not conducting protocol or industry standard field surveys on wetlands, endangered
10 species and riparian habitat..

11 89. The MND and its Amendment has not adequately identified existing conditions,

12 including but not limited to failures of the hydrology and geology reports and MND and the
13 Amendment that fail to adequately consider geological geomorphological existing conditions as
14 set out in the July, 2022 letters by expert field geomorphologist Laurel Collins and watershed

15 and salmonids expert Preston Brown and geologist Joe Brunner.
16 90. The MND and its Amendment failed to adequately consider existing hazards including
17 the potential for soil instability as on the steep mountainside slopes on the Property. The MND
18 and its Amendment failed to consider the hazards of travel on Panoramic Highway and related
19 vehicular accidents with the operation of addition of up to 12 residences on the narrow, winding,

20 shoulder less, and substandard road. The MND and its Amendment also failed to describe and

21 consider the historically hazardous dry season conditions of the project area that the County itself
22 has recognized as a wildland urban a interface fire risk area.
23 Environmental Impacts and Mitigation

24 91. CEQA requires that an MND and its Amendment identify, evaluate and mitigate the
25 possible significant environmental impacts of the proposed project. Pub. Res. Code §§ 21002,
26 21080, CEQA Guidelines §§ 15063-15064, 15071. The lead agency is required to conduct a
27

28 -23-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA, MCMC)

1 "thorough investigation" with respect to significant impacts, and its conclusion must be based on 2 substantial evidence. See Pub. Res. Code §§ 21168, 21168.5, 21082.2; CEQA Guidelines § 3 15064(a).

4 92. Under CEQA, a project's significant effects must be evaluated and mitigated regardless 5 whether the effects will arise elsewhere if the project does not go forward. See CEQA Guidelines 6 § 15026.6(e)(3)(B). CEQA requires that direct and indirect impacts of the project be considered. 7 CEQA Guidelines §§ 15064(d)(1), 15358(a).
8 93. CEQA requires that the agency must consider all information in the record in determining 9 whether to prepare an EIR and not just information in the MND and its Amendment, Pub. Res. 10 Code §§ 21080(c), 21082.2. This includes all information in the record including evidence 11 submitted by project opponents, government agencies and experts. Further CEQA states that 12 where there is disagreement among experts - whether by agency experts or submitted by 13 citizens, an agency prepare an Environmental Impact Statement and not just an initial study. (see 14 e.g., Brentwood Ass'n for No Drilling v. County of Los Angeles (1982) 134 C.A.3d 491, 505.) 15 94. The County prejudicially abused its discretion, did not support its MND and its
16 Amendment approval with substantial evidence, and failed to proceed according to the law in its
17 failure to, among other things, assess the Project's potentially significant impacts, such as to 18 biological resources, water resources, and failure to identify and adopt all feasible mitigation 19 measures for those resources. These failures include, but are not limited to, impacts to 20 anadromous salmonid protection; wetlands, watercourse areas; water quality, including from
21 erosion and sedimentation; fish and amphibians, including salmonids and other special-status 22 wildlife species, as more fully described in Petitioners' and other members of the public's 23 comment letters to the County regarding the MND and its Amendment. For instance, the MND
24 and its Amendment provided no actual study or analysis of the potential impacts on biological
25 species or their habitat from: 1) storm water's movement of through natural or man-made
26 channels to Redwood Creek, nor 2) the increased and on-going erosion and runoff from grading, 27

28 -24- PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA, MCMC)

1 surface water diversions, road and home construction and impermeable surfaces, which could

2 adversely affect the riparian zones and water quality of Redwood Creek; and 3) tree removal and

3 grading that could affect wetlands, wildlife corridors and endangered species such as the

4 Northern Spotted Owl ("NSO".)

5 95. The MND and its Amendment's basis for impact assessment of geological, land stability
6 and hydrological impacts lacks evidence, because it does not - and cannot identify adequate

7 .mitigation measures which would otherwise enable the County to satisfy CEQA with a mitigated
8 negative declaration. The MND and its Amendment's basis for impact assessment of impacts to
9 hydrological, geological and biological resources is based on lacking evidence because it does

10 not and cannot - identify adequate mitigation measures which would otherwise enable the

11 County to satisfy CEQA with a mitigated negative declaration. Pub. Res. Code § 21080(c)(2);

12 CEQA Guidelines §15070(b). For instance, the Geologic reports accompanying the MND and
13 its Amendment lacked essential data necessary to form scientific opinions regarding landslides
14 and subsidence. The MND and its Amendment did not evaluate reasonably foreseeable future

15 plans for housing expansion and did not evaluate potential impacts to Geology and Soils,
16 including exposure to risks to life and property and indirectly to water resources due to soil
17 removal, placement, and surface runoff. The Geology Report also contradicts the Hydrology
18 report, which contradiction means that there is no substantial evidence for the MND and its

19 Amendment's conclusions. (County of Inyo v. Yorty (1973) 32 C.A.3d 795, 814.)64.

20 .96. The County prejudicially abused its discretion by failing to require and provide evidence

21 to support its conclusions and which adequately assess project impacts, including but not limited

22 to, repeatedly and substantially relying on consultant assessments that do not provide survey or
23 other data for the actual project area and the MND and its Amendment at issue, such as evidence

24 to support conclusions about impacts to Northern Spotted Owl, Bats, Steelhead and Coho
25 Salmon and wildlife corridors, without a scientific analysis of how the erosion from the project
26 will affect those species.

27

28 -25-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA, MCMC)

1 97. The MND and its Amendment also failed to adequately describe and discuss the
2 hazardous conditions that the County itself has recognized area of high wildland fire risk. The
3 sufficiency of local water supply for residents, increased fire hazard, and increased congestion
4 for fire hazard escape routes on Panoramic Highway were not established to assess this risk
5 exposure with the project.
6

7 98. The County prejudicially abused its discretion, did not support its MND and its
8 Amendment approval with substantial evidence, and failed to proceed according to the law in its
9 failure to provide the necessary analysis and evidence demonstrating that mitigation had reduced
10 the project impacts below the level of significance. Thus, the County has not provided evidence
11 that an EIR is not required.

12 E. Cumulative Impacts

13 99. CEQA requires that a MND and its Amendment analyze the project's cumulative
14 impacts. Pub. Res. Code §§ 21080.5(d)(3)(A), 21083(b)(2); see CEQA Guidelines §§ 15 15065(a)(1), 15063(a)(1); Environmental Protection Information Center, Inc. v. Johnson (EPIC)
16 (1985) 170 Cal. App. 3d 604, Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. v. Regents of University of
17 California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376; Bakersfield Citizens for Local Control v. City of Bakersfield
18 (2004) 124 CA 4th 1184.

19 100. Cumulative impacts are the incremental effects from multiple projects that combine to
20 affect the environment. "The cumulative impacts from several projects is the change in the
21 environment which results from the incremental impact of the project when added to other
closely related past, present, and reasonably foreseeable probable future projects." CEQA
23 Guidelines § 15355(b). Cumulative impacts are "two or more individual effects which, when
24 considered together, are considerable or which compound or increase other environmental 25 impacts ...[they] can result from individually minor but collectively significant projects taking 26 place over a period of time." CEQA Guidelines § 15355(b); accord EPIC, supra, 170 Cal. App.
27

28 -26-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA, MCMC)

1 3d at p. 625. Such incremental effects must be analyzed whether they fall on-site or off-site.
2 E.g., Friends of the Old Trees v. Department of Forestry & Fire Protection (1997) 52 Cal. App.
3 4th 1383, 1396.

4 101. The County prejudicially abused its discretion, did not support its MND and its
5 Amendment approval with substantial evidence, and failed to proceed according to the law in its
6 failure by, among other things, approving the MND and its Amendment which fails to:
7 adequately designate thresholds for cumulative impacts, identify past, present, and foreseeable
8 projects and consider cumulative impacts and identify and analyze incremental impacts, such as
9 past grading combined with Project grading discharges to water bodies including onsite wetlands
10 and watercourses; provide any analysis, quantitative or otherwise, of the cumulative impacts
11 related to past illegal grading on the Property, or reasonably foreseeable future home grading,
12 construction and introduction of increased impervious surfaces; and disclose related cumulative
13 impacts to fisheries, wildlife, water quality, hydrology and landslides and land stability and
14 wildfire hazards.

15 102. In approving the MND and its Amendment, the County prejudicially abused its discretion
16 in violation of CEQA as more fully described by Petitioners and others in comment letters to the
17 County. In particular, but without limitation, the County prejudicially abused its discretion by
18 failing to: lawfully assess the MND and its Amendment's cumulative impacts on watershed
19 resources, including threatened salmonids and their habitat from increased peak flows and
20 sedimentation; wetlands; and fails to disclose the existence of past projects within the affected
21 environment that have had environmental effects with which the environmental effects of the
22 MND and its Amendment will combine; assess or disclose how the environmental effects of the
23 MND and its Amendment will combine with the environmental effects of past projects located
24 within the affected environment; and assess or disclose how the environmental effects of the
25 MND and its Amendment will combine with the environmental effects of reasonably foreseeable
26 future projects on the land within the affected environment.
27

28 -27-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA, MCMC)

103. The MND and Amendment also fail to provide project description and any related
2 direct, indirect and cumulative impact discussion of a key project element, construction of a
3 driveway and turn around serving the existing house. This driveway must be upgraded to meet
4 County standards, graded and as such will have additional sediment and runoff issues that will
5 combine with other project impacts to increase sediment load in Redwood Creek.
6 E. Improper Deferral of Impact Assessment and Mitigation
7 104. Petitioners incorporate by reference all the allegations contained in the previous
8 paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.
9 105. CEQA requires that all foreseeable environmental impacts be assessed and that feasible
10 mitigation measures be considered before the agency makes its decision to approve a project.
11 Pub. Res. Code §§ 21002, 21002.1. Specifically, where mitigation measures are necessary to
12 reduce impacts below the level of significance, members of the public and other agencies must
13 be given an opportunity to review the environmental document before the document and project
14 are approved. Pub. Res. Code §§ 21080(c)(2). Studies and mitigation measures that are deferred
15 until after the environmental document is approved violate CEQA's requirements for public and
16 agency review and scrutiny of the environmental impacts. Sundstrom v. County of Mendocino
17 (1988) 202 Cal. App. 3rd 296.
18 106. The County prejudicially abused its discretion, did not support its MND and its
19 Amendment approval with substantial evidence, and failed to proceed according to the law in its
20 failure to, among other things, approve the MND and its Amendment based on sediment runoff
21 and mitigation claims. Those measures have an absence of required specificity, performance
22 standards, protocol requirements, surveys or thresholds for significance regarding impacts related
23 to the post-approval surveys. CEQA does not allow for such deferral of the study or mitigation
24 of impacts,

25 107. MND and its Amendment Mitigation Measures rely on future plans that have not been
26 evaluated as to their feasibility as mitigation for the potential impacts to geology and soils,
27

28 -28-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA, MCMC).

including exposure of risks to life and property and indirectly to biological and water resources

2 from debris flow and surface runoff. Specifically, the mitigation measures for landslides and the

3 potential for soil erosion or the loss of topsoil and potentially unstable soils which may result in

4 on or off site landslides or collapse are deferred mitigation, improperly relying on future plans.
5 Those MND and its Amendment mitigation measures improperly rely on future plans that have
6 not been evaluated as to their feasibility as mitigation for the potential impacts identified above.

7 H. Failure to Respond to Comments

8 108. Petitioners incorporate by reference all the allegations contained in the previous

9 paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.

10 109. CEQA requires that the County invite and consider comments on MND and its
11 Amendments. Pub. Res. Code §§ 21091(d); CEQA Guidelines §§ 15200. the though, did not

12 respond to or erroneously responded to comments by the National Park Service, California
13 Department of Fish and Wildlife, Lotic Environmental Services, Ms. Collins, Mr. Brown and

14 Mr. Brunner and many of the public comments regarding failure of the County technical studies,
15 MND and Amendment to accurately and fully describe the project and existing conditions, and
16 environmental impacts. Thus, it is clear the County improperly failed to consider expert technical
17 and agency expert technical opinions and thus, the MIND and its Amendment the County has
18 failed to prepare an adequate MND,
19 110. Any responses must manifest a good faith, reasoned analysis; conclusory statements
20 unsupported by factual information will not suffice. CEQA Guidelines §15088. Yet the County

21 Responses relied on legal compliance, yet failed to enforce its own regulations on project

22 grading and runoff, grading in a wetland, an illegal fire road and development and runoff in

23 drainage that effected a County determined Streamside Conservation Area.

24 111. The County prejudicially abused its discretion and failed to proceed according to law and
25 did not support its MND and its Amendment approval with substantial evidence in that the
26 Official Response for the MND and its Amendment is inadequate in ways which include, but are
27
28 -29-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA, MCMC)

1 not limited to, its failure to provide, evaluate and respond in non-conclusory fashion to the issues
2 and comments raised during the review process. This failure includes, but is not limited to, the
3 failure to include and adequately respond to public comments regarding lack of notice,
4 comments about impacts to salmonids, wetlands, and cumulative impacts, impacts regarding
5 geology and land hazards, and cumulative impacts of adjacent projects.
6 112. In light of the foregoing violations of CEQA, the County prejudicially abused its
7 discretion.

8 113. WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for relief as set forth below.

10 IV. PRAYER FOR JUDGMENT

11 By reason of the foregoing, Respondents have violated the California Environmental
12 Quality Act, the Subdivision Map Act and Code of Civ. Proc. §91085 and 1094.5 by, the Marin
