VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Petitioner Center for Biological Diversity brings this action on its own behalf, on behalf

2 of its members, on behalf of the general public, and in the public interest, and alleges as follows:
cn I. INTRODUCTION

4 1. The California Department of Conservation, Geologic Energy Management

5 Division ("CalGEM" or "Respondent") consistently fails to live up to its obligations under the

6 California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") and California Public Resources Code when it

7 permits new oil drilling projects without any opportunity for public comment and without

8 independent environmental review.

9 2. One way that CalGEM evades its responsibilities under CEQA is by relying on

10 the antiquated, inapplicable, and inadequate environmental reviews of other agencies.

11 3. In November 2022, CalGEM permitted nine new oil and gas wells in the Placerita

12 oilfield in Los Angeles County (the "Placerita wells") and eight new oil and gas wells in the Elk

13 Hills oilfield in Kern County (the "Elk Hills wells").

14 4. CalGEM did not post any notice before permitting these new wells. Instead, only

15 it after it had approved these wells, it posted Notices of Determination, indicating that it had

16 fulfilled its CEQA obligations by deferring entirely to environmental analyses conducted long

17 ago- -a 1991 Mitigated Negative Declaration certified by. the City of Santa Clarita for the

18 Placerita wells and a 1997 Environmental Impact Statement and Report certified by the

19 Department of Energy and Kern County for the Elk Hills wells.

20 5. These quarter-century-old analyses are deficient in several respects. Critically,

21 they address the environmental consequences of drilling a specific number of wells in the

22 oilfields. But in the intervening time since the analyses were certified, more wells have been

23 drilled than were contemplated in the analyses. CalGEM therefore cannot rely on these analyses

24 when authorizing additional wells. CalGEM must initiate a new environmental review process.

25 6. In addition, CalGEM's authority to regulate oil and gas drilling has expanded as

26 new information has emerged about the significant harms that oil drilling poses to the health of

27 nearby communities, to wildlife, and to our climate. A large and growing body of scientific

28 research-including local, state, and federal governments' own studies-concludes that oil and

- 2-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 gas activities cause significant harms to public health and the environment. Oil and gas

2 production causes air and water pollution, destroys large areas of habitat, sickens nearby

3 |communities, and adds substantial amounts of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere.

4 7. Since the 1990s, the circumstances in the Placerita and Elk Hills oilfields have

5 also changed. In Santa Clarita, for example, a new high school and housing developments were

6 constructed in the 2000s. Those sensitive receptors are within a close distance to the wells

7 CalGEM recently permitted. CalGEM itself has since commissioned a study of health effects and

8 concluded that the risk of adverse health outcomes significantly increases when oil and gas

9 development occur close to sensitive receptors.

10 8. CalGEM's after-the-fact notices for new drilling approvals for the Placerita wells

11 and the Elk Hills wells do not include findings related to the adequacy of the underlying

12 environmental analyses. The notices also do not include any evaluation of additional measures

13 that could mitigate the significant harms of drilling. The notices provide inconsistent information

14 labout when the underlying reviews were conducted and do not include any information about

15 where those reviews may be found.' These notice practices are wholly inconsistent with CEQA's
16 purpose to disclose to decision makers and the public the significant environmental harms of

17 proposed projects under consideration and to mitigate those harms before approval.

18 9. The seventeen new oil and gas well approvals at issue in this petition are

19 lexamples of CalGEM's broader pattern and practice of inadequate CEQA review. Petitioner has

20

21 The notices for the Placerita oilfield wells first indicate that the underlying analysis was conducted in 2011, but the notices later provide a certification date of January 3, 1991. See

8 II. PARTIES

0 10. Petitioner CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY ("the Center" or

10 I"Petitioner") is a non-profit organization with offices in California and throughout the United

11 States. The Center is actively involved in environmental protection issues throughout California

12 and North America. The Center has over 89,000 members, including over 18,000 members who

13 reside in California, over 1,600 in Alameda County, and more than 3,900 throughout Los

14 Angeles and Kern Counties. The Center's mission includes protecting and restoring habitat and

15 populations of imperiled species, reducing greenhouse gas pollution to preserve a safe climate,
16 and protecting air quality, water quality, and public health.
17 11. The Center's members and staff include individuals who live, work, and recreate

18 in areas threatened by the adverse impacts of oil drilling in the Placerita and Elk Hills oilfields,

19 including members who are particularly interested in protecting the many native, imperiled, and

20 sensitive species and their habitats that may be affected by oil drilling. Members and staff

21 include those who regularly use and intend to continue to use the areas affected by the oil and

22 gas well approvals at issue here.

23 12. The pollution caused by oil and gas development poses a risk a to the health and

24 safety of the Center's members and staff. Members and staff in California also suffer harm from

25 the effects of climate change fueled by oil and gas production.

26 13. The Center, its members, and its staff also depend on the rights that CEQA's

27 public notice, hearing, and commenting requirements provide to advocate for stronger

28 environmental protection and inform the public and decision-makers about the harms of oil and

6 IV. STATEMENT OF FACTS

7 A. Environmental Setting

8 28. The Placerita oilfield is located in Santa Clarita, in northern Los Angeles County,

9 north of Placerita Canyon Road and west of Sierra Highway.

10 29. In 1991, the City of Santa Clarita certified a 14-page negative declaration for a

11 new project to add 99 oil wells to the Placerita oilfield, which at that time contained 113 wells.

12 The negative declaration noted that the area was designated as very low and low density

13 residential in City plans. Oak trees and blue line streams were identified on the site but the

14 negative declaration concluded that the placement of the new wells would avoid impacts to those

15 resources.

16 30. Some areas bordering the Placerita oilfield continue to be low and very low
17 density residential areas: Quigley Canyon Open Space adjoins the western part of the field, and
18 across the Antelope Valley Freeway to the cast lies Placerita Canyon State Park. Other areas,
19 however, have changed. In the 2000s, the City constructed a major arterial highway-Golden
20 Valley Road--from the Antelope Valley Freeway to an extension of Newhall Ranch Road,

21 providing an east-west link through the heart of the City. The road abuts the oilfield and
22 |developments have sprung up along it, including Golden Valley High School and residential

23 neighborhoods north of the oilfield.3

• 1 31. The City of Santa Clarita is within the South Coast Air Basin, which is in
"extreme" nonattainment of various air quality standards established under the federal Clean Air

3 Act to protect public health and the environment, including ground-level ozone (smog).*
T 32. The Placerita oilfield is also the site of the largest plugging and abandonment
project in CalGEM's history. Fifty-six oil wells that CalGEM determined were "presumed

6 orphaned" by prior operators were prioritized for remediation, at an estimated cost of $3.3

7 million, based on multiple risk factors, including proximity to residences and shallow

8 groundwater.'

9 33. The Elk Hills oilfield is located in Kern County, approximately 26 miles west of

10 Bakersfield between the communities of Taft, Tupman, Buttonwillow, and McKittrick.

11 34. In 1997, the U.S. Department of Energy and Kern County certified a

12 |Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement / Program Environmental Impact Report when

13 the federal government solicited bids for the sale of its interests in the Naval Petroleum Reserve

14 that existed in the oilfield. The environmental analysis considered the impacts that could occur

15 due to accelerated levels of development, including up to 628 new wells drilled through 2034.

16 Those wells would be additive to the 2,504 active wells that existed in the oilfield in 1995 and

17 360 abandoned wells.

18 35. The 1997 analysis identified several imperiled species that would be foreseeably

19 harmed by oil and gas development, including the San Joaquin kit fox, giant kangaroo rat, blunt

20 nosed leopard lizard, San Joaquin antelope squirrel, San Joaquin woolly threads, and Kern

21 mallow. Potential kit fox dens have been identified in close proximity to oil and gas operations in

N the field. In addition, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife has documented violations

2 of Endangered Species Act permit conditions in the oilfield. California Resources Elk Hills has

3 previously conducted activities in violation of permit requirements.
t• 36. The Elk Hills oilfield is within the San Joaquin Valley Air Basin, which maintains

5 the worst designation for ozone pollution and has yet to attain the 1997 PM2.5 National Ambient

6 |Air Quality Standard.5

7 37. Due to injection activities, there is a risk of surface expressions in the oilfield;

8 these occur when steam injected under pressure to produce oil breaks through natural geologic

9 |barriers and comes to the surface. The latest surface expression in the Elk Hills oilfield was

10 reported in June 2022.' Oil and gas activities also occur near creek beds. At least two oil spills in

11 the oilfield have affected dry creek beds in the last two years.8

12 38. Occidental Petroleum Corporation was the highest bidder for the federal

13 government's interests in the Naval Petroleum Preserve. After California Resources Corporation

14 was spun off from Occidental, California Resources Elk Hills started operating in the field.

15 39. California Resources Corporation's financial problems led it to declare

16 bankruptcy in 2020. Through the bankruptcy proceeding, California Resources Corporation shed

17 more than $5 billion in debt, and emerged from bankruptcy later that year." Post-bankruptcy, the

18 company's bonding level remains inadequate to cover the cost of remediating the more than

19 16,500 wells that California Resources Corporation and its affiliates operate throughout the state,

20 including more than 7,000 wells that have been idle for two years or more.

• 1 40. Although operators are legally responsible for plugging their wells and restoring

2 the surface area, in reality many operators attempt to walk away from these duties after well

3 production declines. Some use bankruptcy to evade these costs, leaving the state to clean up sites

4 using public funds.

41. According to a recent CalGEM analysis, the average cost to plug a well in

6 California is $111,000.10 This means California Resources Corporation would need to set aside

7 more than $1.8 billion to complete plugging and abandonment of its wells to reduce the risk of

8 air and water pollution from idled wells. An independent panel of scientists has warned that

q |California's operators have only set aside a small fraction of financial resources necessary to

10 plug the state's wells." On information and belief, in 2020, California Resources Corporation

11 had $17.25 million in active bonds.

12 B. Harms of Oil Production Activities

13 42. CalGEM's issuance of a drilling permit allows a well to be drilled and oil to be

14 produced. Production activities create a host of environmental and health harms and risks,

15 including air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, harm to wildlife and habitat, water usage, and

16 water pollution.

17 43. CalGEM issues permits for particular well types. Operators often locate oil and

18 gas production wells near steam or water flood injection wells, where operators use "enhanced

19 oil recovery" techniques in which they pump steam, water, and gas into injection wells to

20 increase the flow of oil and gas to the surface. The pressure and heat involved in the injection

21 |process can cause additional adverse impacts, including risks to groundwater, air quality, soil,

22 and climate.

44. Air pollutants and greenhouse gases are emitted in many stages of oil and gas

2 production, including drilling, well completion, well maintenance, transportation, and waste

3 disposal. Engines used to construct and drill wells, to pump oil and gas and other materials, and

4 to run the trucks used to transport people and materials, all release harmful air pollutants like

5 Iparticulate matter and greenhouse gases.

6 45. Additional sources of air pollution include volatile organic compounds ("VOCs")

7 and other hazardous air pollutants. VOCs can react in the atmosphere to form ozone and small

8 particulate matter, which can cause respiratory ailments such as astlhma and bronchitis, heart

9 attacks, and even premature death. These impacts are especially severe in the San Joaquin Valley

10 and Los Angeles air basins, which already experience some of the worse ozone and particulate

11 matter air pollution in the nation.

12 46. Oil drilling can also release toxic chemicals, such as benzene, toluene,

13 ethylbenzene, xylene, radioactive materials, hydrogen sulfide, arsenic and mercury. The

14 hydrocarbons extracted from the ground during oil production can contain heavy metals such as

15 lead, mercury, and arsenic. The extracted petroleum also includes polycyclic aromatic

16 hydrocarbons, some of which are carcinogenic or otherwise harmful to human health.

17 47. Exposure to air pollution from oil and gas activity is associated with significant

18 adverse health effects, including respiratory, cardiovascular, neurologic, and pulmonary

19 illnesses, damage to the nervous system, immune system, and endocrine system, increased rates

20 of birth defects and cancer, and harm to eyes, skin, and other sensory organs.
21 48. Mounting scientific evidence shows living in close proximity to oil and gas

22 development results in higher rates of asthma and other respiratory ailments, cancer, and adverse

23 birth outcomes.

24 49. Oil and gas activities in California also emit significant amounts of greenhouse

25 gases such as carbon dioxide and methane-a gas that traps over 80 times more heat than carbon

26 dioxide over 20 years. Greenhouse gas emissions from the extraction stage alone account for

27 4.1% of California's total greenhouse gas emissions. Refining fossil fuel accounts for an

28

- 11 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

•1 additional 7.0%, and combustion of fossil fuels in the transportation sector accounts for 41 % of

2 statewide greenhouse gas emissions.
0 50. The greenhouse gas emissions associated with California oil and gas production

4 have increased in recent decades as more energy is required to extract oil in aging fields.

5 51. Methane leakage from oil and gas wells also contributes to greenhouse gas

6 emissions. There have been several recent leaks in Kern County and Los Angeles from long term

7 idle wells.

8 52. Oil production often requires use of large volumes of fresh water. Water usage is

g a major issue in California due to significant drought and water shortages. Water withdrawal for

10 oil production can affect the availability of water for other uses.

11 53. The disposal of the vast quantities of wastewater left behind when oil is extracted

12 poses additional risks and harms. The water used during oil drilling and produced during the

13 drilling process may contain salts, toxic metals, and other substances, and must be disposed of

14 properly to protect groundwater sources and prevent unwanted exposure to the contaminated

15 water. Wastewater is often stored in waste pits and injected into disposal wells. Wastewater

16 disposal has resulted in documented cases of groundwater contamination.

17 54. Oil and gas activities have caused numerous large-scale spills in California.

18 Operators have spilled tens of millions of gallons of oil and toxic wastewater, resulting in soil

19 contamination, air pollution, and wildlife fatalities. Steam injection can also create pathways

20 between the oil and the surface, resulting in so-called "surface expressions" that spill oil and

21 |wastewater.

22 55. Oil production is an intense industrial activity that can harm plants and animals by

23 destroying, disturbing, or fragmenting habitat; injuring or killing wildlife through vehicle strikes;

24 exposing species to oil and chemicals via spills, pits, and sumps; causing harmful noise, light,

25 and vibration pollution; introducing invasive species; and by driving climate change.

26 56. Oil and gas permitting also adds to the inventory of wells that must be properly

27 plugged and abandoned in the future. Unplugged wells serve as conduits for contamination and

28 fugitive gas leaks. California has tens of thousands of unplugged idle wells that pose a risk to

- 12 -

4

groundwater, air, and climate if left unaddressed. By one estimate, roughly two-thirds of idle

2 wells in California are leaking methane. 12

3 57. The risk of damage from idle and deserted wells is a growing concern. Although
4 companies are legally required to pay for the costs of plugging their wells, the state does not

5 currently require companies to set aside bonds that cover the full cost of remediating a well and

6 the state does not impose a deadline for plugging idle wells. Thousands of wells remain

7 unplugged indefinitely, and oil wells can become orphaned if the companies responsible for them

8 fail to meet their obligations.

9 58: Oil and gas projects result in significant cumulative environmental impacts as

10 well. New oil and gas activity adds to existing air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and water

11 pollution. Studies also indicate that cumulative drilling can contribute to subsidence and seismic

12 activity in California.

13 C. CalGEM's Regulation of Oil and Gas

14 59. CalGEM is the main regulator of oil and gas activity in California. CalGEM must

15 supervise oil and gas well drilling, operation, maintenance, and abandonment activities "so as to

16 |prevent, as far as possible, damage to life, health, property, and natural resources." Pub. Res.

17 Code § 3106(a). Effective January 1, 2020; the Public Resources Code further declares that the

18 purpose of this oversight is to "protect[] public health and safety and environmental quality,

19 including reduction and mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions associated with the development
20  of hydrocarbon and geothermal resources in a manner that meets the energy needs of the state."
21 Id. con 3011(a). Relatedly, CalGEM is "tasked with advancing California's goal to become carbon-

22 neutral by 2045."13

23 60. CalGEM determines whether to allow proposed oil and gas activities to proceed,

24 and which conditions to impose on the activities if they are approved. Operators are required to

2 §§ 3000 et seq.

m 61. CalGEM may impose conditions on permits and exercises its discretion to craft

4 what it deems to be appropriate safety standards for construction and operational activities.

5 62. CalGEM also retains authority to inspect, monitor, impose additional conditions

6 upon, or cease operations.

7 63. Over time, as the dangers of oil and gas production have become better

8 understood, the Legislature has expanded CalGEM's regulatory authority, including by

q supplementing additional duties over specific operations such as well stimulation treatment,

10 injection, and wastewater disposal.

11 64. In 2017, lawmakers passed legislation declaring orphan and hazardous wells a

12 nuisance and declaring a state policy that polluters pay the costs of abating such nuisances. Id.

13 c0. 3250. That was followed in 2019 by legislation that allows CalGEM to require security up to

14 $30 million to cover the cost of plugging, abandonment, and remediation of well sites in order to

15 lower the risk that operators will desert wells or that their wells may pose a threat to life, heath,

16 and property. § Id. 8 3205.3.

17 65. The legislature has also directed CalGEM to look more closely at the application

18 |documentation operators submit before approving new permits. As of January 2022, CalGEM

19 "*shall require a copy of the local land use authorization" that actually "supports the installation

20 submits the notice of intention for the well." Id. § 3203.5. of a well at the time an operator

22 safety, and the environment, [CalGEM] is currently undertaking a process to update public

23 health and safety protections for communities near oil and gas production operations."14 The

24 proposed rule, which was developed based on input from a panel of public health experts,

25 prohibits new oil and gas wells within 3,200 feet of homes and schools to protect public health. 15

2 an implementation date of January 1, 2023.

3 D. Required Environmental Review

4 67. When permitting oil and gas wells, CalGEM has nondiscretionary duty to

5 comply with CEQA, a comprehensive statute designed to provide for long-term protection of the

6 environment. Pub. Res. Code §§ 21001(d), 21080(a); 14 Cal. Code Regs. §§ 1681 et seq.

7 68. One of the fundamental purposes of the CEQA process is to provide the

8 decisionmakers and the public in general with detailed information about the impacts a proposed

9 project will likely have on the environment in order to balance the project's benefits against its

10 environmental costs, consider appropriate mitigation measures, and properly weigh project

11 alternatives. CEQA Guidelines § 15002.

12 69. For oil and gas projects for which no other public agency has conducted an

13 environmental review, CalGEM acts as the "lead agency." Subject to certain limited statutory
14 and categorical exemptions, CEQA requires lead agencies to, at minimum, conduct an initial

15 study on any project that "may have a significant effect on the environment." CEQA Guidelines

16 § 15063(a). This study must examine all significant direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts of
17 the proposed project. Where an agency determines that, after an initial study, the project may
18 have a significant impact on the environment, or if the project contributes to cumulative impacts,

19 the lead agency must prepare an Environmental Impact Report. Id. § 15064(f) & (h).
20 Alternatively, if an agency determines that a proposed project would not have a significant

21 impact on the environment, it may adopt a Negative Declaration. Pub. Res. Code §§ 21064,

22 21080(c).

23 70. Where a separate agency has previously elected to serve as the lead agency for a

24 project, CalGEM must conduct an independent review to determine whether the underlying

25 [environmental review properly covers the scope of the currently proposed project. CalGEM must
26 assume the role of the lead agency where the previous review did not cover the project as
27 currently proposed. CEQA Guidelines § 15052(a).

28 71. Even where the scope of the project is encompassed in the underlying review,

- 15 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

•1 CalGEM must still conduct a subsequent environmental review when circumstances have

2 changed or new, important information becomes available. Id. §§ 15162-63.
n 72. Circumstances under which new review is necessary include where there is no

4 relevant environmental analysis, where the relevant environmental analysis is inadequate, where

5 Ithere are substantial changes to a project, where there are substantial changes to the

6 circumstances under which the project is undertaken that increase the severity of impacts or

7 cause new impacts, or where there is new information of substantial importance about significant

8 impacts, mitigation, or project alternatives. Id. §§ 15052(a), 15162.

o 73. Even in instances where an underlying environmental may be relied upon, the

10 secondary or "responsible agency" must still adhere to CEQA's requirements. Pub. Res. Code

11 §§ 21002.1(b), 21081; CEQA Guidelines §§ 15091, 15096, 15381.

12 74. Where CalGEM acts as responsible agency, it must record independent findings

13 and statements of fact, consider if there are feasible alternatives, and mitigate and avoid the

14 direct or indirect environmental effects of the it parts of a project it approves. Pub. Res. Code §§
15 21002.1(b), 21081; CEQA Guidelines §§ 15091, 15096.

16 75. When a lead agency makes a decision to carry out or approve a project on the a
17 basis of an environmental impact report or negative declaration, it must file a notice of

18 determination. CEQA Guidelines §§ 15075, 15094. Responsible agencies also "should" file

19 notices of determination when they reach a decision to approve a project. Id. 15096(i). Filing a

20 notice of determination triggers a 30-day statute of limitations. Pub. Res. Code § 21167(e);

21 CEQA Guidelines §§ 15094(g), 15075(g).

22 76. When CalGEM posts notices of determination, the agency must comply with the

23 notice requirements intended to inform the public and fulfill the transparency and informed

24 decision-making goals of CEQA. See CEQA Guidelines §§ 15096(i), 15075, 15094.

25 E. Recent Permit Approvals in the Placerita Oilfield

26 77. Since the beginning of November 2022, CalGEM has issued nine Permits to

27 Conduct Well Operations allowing Shadow Wolf to drill nine new oil and gas production wells

28 in the Placerita oilfield. A list of these wells, including their identifying numbers and locations is

2 78. CalGEM has discretion to modify permit conditions and here imposed certain

3 conditions related to, among other things, the specifications of blowout prevention equipment,

4 the materials to be used, witnessing, and surveys and practice drills.

5 79. CalGEM subsequently filed Notices of Determination, which state that CalGEM

6 acted as a "Responsible Agency" under CEQA and relied upon an older analysis of the City of

7 Santa Clarita. The Notices were signed by the same CalGEM staff member who signed the

8 Notices associated with the Elk Hills approvals that are at issue in this petition.

9 80. The Notices include conflicting information about when the underlying analysis
10 of the City of Santa Clarita was conducted, including a descriptor that the year was 2011 or that
11 the year was 1991.

12 81. The Notices indicate the original project approved by the City of Santa Clarita

13 was for "drilling 99 new oil wells and related improvements within an existing oilfield," that
14 mitigation was included in the Negative Declaration, and that a mitigation monitoring and
15 reporting plan was adopted for the project when first approved by the City of Santa Clarita.

16 82. No other documents are attached with the notices, no information is provided

17 about where the environmental analysis prepared by Santa Clarita may be located, and no

18 findings or discussion of mitigation are included.

19 83. CalGEM's online WellSTAR database includes documents submitted with the

20 new drilling permit applications, including the Negative Declaration prepared by the City of
21 Santa Clarita, confirming it was certified in January 1991.

22 84. The 1991 Negative Declaration authorized 99 new oil wells and noted that 113

23 wells existed in the oilfield at the time the analysis was conducted.

24 85. The Negative Declaration contained no mitigation monitoring and reporting plan.

25 It states mitigation measures "are not attached."

26 86. The Negative Declaration notes that there is the potential for significant impacts
27 in several areas, including to air, noise, and risk of upset and hazards.

4 does not mention nearby houses or a nearby school. It does not discuss impacts specific to

5 particular kinds of wells, such as production wells or enhanced oil recovery injection wells. It

6 does not discuss the risks of idle wells.

7 89. CalGEM's online WellSTAR database also includes the application and "over-

8 the-counter" permits for the wells from the City of Santa Clarita. One of the applications and

9 Santa Clarita permits for five wells includes a photograph showing the location of the wells will

10 be located less than 3,200 feet from homes and a school. The other application and Santa Clarita

11 permit for four wells includes a photograph showing the location of the wells will be located less

12 than 3,200 feet from homes.

13 90. The applications state that water usage is estimated to be 1,000 or 7,500 gallons

14 per well, depending on the well. The applications include conflicting information about waste
15 generation--the application cover sheets state "no waste will be generated," but the safety plan

16 attachments state drill cuttings and mud will be stored onsite then later sampled and disposed of.

17 91. The applications and Santa Clarita permits include tables with the number of

18 active, idle, and plugged and abandoned oil wells currently drilled in the oilfield. CalGEM also

19 maintains a list of all wells in California. While the number of wells drilled in the Placerita

20 oilfield varies between information sources, in all instances the number of wells drilled and

21 approved today exceeds the 212 well number covered in the 1991 Negative Declaration (99 new

22 wells and 113 existing wells).

LJ G. Petitioner's Comments

4 104.

5 Petitioner has repeatedly put CalGEM on notice that its reliance on the

6 inadequate, outdated environmental analyses of other "lead agencies" violates CEQA.

105.

7 In May 2020, the Center sent a letter alerting CalGEM that its practice of relying

8 on an invalidated Kern County Environmental Impact Report when permitting new drilling

9 activities in that county violates CEQA. In November 2020, the Center followed up with a letter

10 alerting CalGEM that its broader practice of relying on outdated permits and environmental

11 reviews violated CEQA. The Center specifically notified CalGEM that it needs to analyze

12 whether older environmental review documents encompass new drilling requests and to consider

13 new information showing significant environmental harm attributable to drilling projects.

106.

14 The Center's comments documented new information that was not known and

15 could not have been known at the time of the dated approvals related to the scope and severity of

16 the environmental impacts across multiple categories, including air, health, climate, water, and

17 species. For example, the comments included references to updated information about: impacts

18 of climate change and the attribution to fossil fuels; impacts of surface expressions and spills; the

19 |prevalence of methane leaks and new detection and prevention technologies; health impacts

20 associated with living near oil drilling; where certain rare, threatened, and endangered species

21 are located in relation to projects; the fiscal burden to state and the environmental impacts that

22 come with unplugged and/or improperly plugged and remediated wells. The Center's comments

23 also emphasized new statutory obligations that support increased CalGEM oversight to protect
public health and the environment.

24

25 107. The Center made clear that its November 2020 comments apply to all currently

26 pending and future applications for drilling. The Center submitted a blanket comment letter for

27 future permit applications because CalGEM typically approves permits with no notice and no

28 comment period specific to individual permit approvals, making it impossible for the public to
comment on specific permit applications prior to CalGEM's approval.

108. The issue of CalGEM's general reliance on inadequate prior environmental

2 review without conducting its own CEQA analysis is part of the Center's pending case in

3 Alameda Superior Court seeking to stop CalGEM's pattern and practice of approving permits to

4 drill oil wells without adequate CEQA review. See Center for Biological Diversity v. Cal.

5 Geologic Energy Management Division (Alameda Cty. Super. Ct., filed Feb. 21, 2021) Case No.

6 RG 21090952. Judge Grillo denied Motions for Judgment on the Pleadings from CalGEM and

7 Intervenors in that case in December 2021, allowing case to move forward. The case is currently

8 in the discovery phase and the parties have engaged in settlement discussions.

9 109. The CalGEM approvals for the Placerita and Elk Hills oilfields at issue in this

10 case occurred after the Center filed the pattern and practice suit, but further illustrate CalGEM's

11 |continuing pattern of CEQA violations in its role as a responsible agency and, therefore, are

12 related to the pending pattern and practice action. Here, the Center seeks injunctive and

13 declaratory relief to remedy individual CEQA violations in connection with CalGEM's recent

14 Placerita and Elk Hills oilfield approvals.

15

16 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

17 (Violations of CEQA as Against CalGEM and Shadow Wolf - Public Resources Section
21000, et seq. and 14 Cal. Code Regs. section 15000 et seq.)
18 110. Petitioner incorporates herein by reference the allegations contained in the
19 foregoing paragraphs.

20 111. CalGEM violated CEQA by approving the new well permits in the Placerita
21 oilfield listed in Exhibit A without adequate environmental review and documentation.

22 CalGEM's CEQA violations include the following:
23 a. Failure to assume the role of lead agency and comply with the duties of a lead
24 agency, in that:
25 i. Where a responsible agency is called upon to grant an approval for a project
26 subject to CEQA for which another public agency was the lead agency, the
27 responsible agency shall assume the role of the lead agency where (i) new
28 information or changed circumstances require additional CEQA review, (ii) the

• 23 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

FN0TOON original lead agency has granted final approval of the project, and (iii) the time
to challenge that original agency approval has expired. CEQA Guidelines §
15052(a). Upon assuming lead agency status, the former responsible agency
assumes the duties of the lead agency, id. § 15052, including the cop duty to prepare
a subsequent or supplemental CEQA document under CEQA Guidelines
sections 15162-63.
ii. CalGEM violated CEQA by failing to assume lead agency status and, instead,

8 relied for its approval of the Placerita oilfield wells included in Exhibit A on an

Q outdated, inadequate, and inapplicable CEQA document.
iii. The prior CEQA document is inadequate for at least two reasons: (1) the
11 number of wells covered by the prior CEQA document and approvals has
12 already been exceeded, and (2) the prior CEQA document does not consider or
13 disclose subsequent changes in the project or its circumstances and relevant new

14 information concerning significant impacts that was not known and could not

15 have been known at the time at the time of the previous CEQA review. CalGEM

16 therefore cannot rely upon the review to approve yet more wells. Before

17 CalGEM may proceed with the approvals, therefore, it must assume lead agency

18 status and prepare subsequent or supplemental CEQA review.

19 b. Failure to adequately consider the environmental analyses prepared by the lead

and their locations; failed to accurately identify the date on which the lead and
responsible agencies approved the projects; failed to accurately identify whether
mitigation measures were made a condition of approval of the projects and
whether a mitigation monitoring plan or program was adopted; failed to include

20 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

21 (Violations of CEQA as Against CalGEM and California Resources Elk Hills - Public

22 Resources Section 21000, et seq. and 14 Cal. Code Regs. section 15000 et seq.)
113.
23 Petitioner incorporates herein by reference the allegations contained in the

24 foregoing paragraphs.

114.
25 CalGEM violated CEQA by approving the new well permits in the Elk Hills

26 oilfield listed in Exhibit A without adequate environmental review and documentation.

27 CalGEM's CEQA violations include the following:

a.
28 Failure to assume the role of lead agency and comply with the duties of a lead
agency, in that:

- 25 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

-N0TO0 i. Where a responsible agency is called upon to grant an approval for a project
subject to CEQA for which another public agency was the lead agency, the
responsible agency shall assume the role of the lead agency where (i) new
information or changed circumstances require additional CEQA review, (ii) the
original lead agency has granted final approval of the project, and (iii) the time
to challenge that original agency approval has expired. CEQA Guidelines §
A 15052(a). Upon assuming lead agency status, the former responsible agency

g assumes the duties of the lead agency, id. con. 15052, including the duty to prepare
9= a subsequent or supplemental CEQA document under CEQA Guidelines
sections 15162-63.
ii. CalGEM violated CEQA by failing to assume lead agency status and, instead,
12 relied for its approval of the Elk Hills oilfield wells included in Exhibit A on an
13 outdated, inadequate, and inapplicable CEQA document.
14 iii. The prior CEQA document is inadequate for at least two reasons: (1) the
number of wells covered by the prior CEQA document and approvals has 15

16 already been exceeded, and (2) the prior CEQA document does not consider or

17 disclose subsequent changes in the project or its circumstances and relevant new

18 information concerning significant impacts that was not known and could not

19 have been known at the time at the time of the previous CEQA review. CalGEM

20 therefore cannot rely upon the review to approve yet more wells. Before

21 CalGEM may proceed with the approvals, therefore, it must assume lead agency

22 status and prepare subsequent or supplemental CEQA review.

23 b. Failure to adequately consider the environmental analyses prepared by the lead

24 agency and make necessary findings about significant impacts, in that:
i. In claiming to act as a responsible agency, CalGEM violated CEQA by failing
to consider the underlying environmental review prepared by the lead agency 25

26

27 and reach its own conclusions on whether and how to approve the Elk Hills
oilfield wells included in Exhibit A. CalGEM did not comply with its duties to 28

25 (Violations of Public Resources Code as Against CalGEM - Failure to Require Adequate
