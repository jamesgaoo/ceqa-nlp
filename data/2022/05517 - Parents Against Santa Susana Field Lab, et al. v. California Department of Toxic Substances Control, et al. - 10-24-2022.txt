Notice to the Attorney General - Case No. 56-2022-00570675-CU-WM-VTA

1 To the Attorney General of the State of California:

2 PLEASE TAKE NOTICE, under Public Resources Code section 21167.7 and Code of Civil

3 Procedure section 388, that on October 6, 2022, Petitioners Parents Against Santa Susana Field Lab,

4 Physicians for Social Responsibility/Los Angeles Chapter, Inc., and Public Employees for

5 Environmental Responsibility, Inc., filed a Petition for Alternative Writ of Mandate ("Petition")

6 against Respondents the California Department of Toxic Substances Control ("DTSC"), Lawrence

7 Hafetz, in his official capacity, the California Regional Water Quality Control Board, Los Angeles

8 Region ("Regional Board"), and Real Party in Interest The Boeing Company ("Boeing")

9 ("Respondents") in the Ventura County Superior Court. The Petition seeks a writ of mandate ordering

10 Respondents to (1) immediately vacate an agreement reached between DTSC and Boeing on May 9,

11 2022 which commits DTSC to forego considering more aggressive soil cleanup and remediation

12 alternatives by Boeing at the Santa Susana Field Laboratory ("SSFL") ("SSFL Agreement") by

13 significantly weakening soil cleanup levels prior to DTSC's compliance with the California
14 Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") (Pub. Res. Code ["PRC"] § 21000 et seq.), and (2)

15 immediately vacate the Memorandum of Understanding entered into by the Regional Board and

16 Boeing on August 12, 2022 ("Water Board Agreement"), which triggered the effectiveness of the

17 SSFL Agreement. The Petition requested that the Court issue an alternative writ of mandate ordering

18 DTSC, the Regional Board and Boeing to appear at a hearing to show cause why the SSFL

19 Agreement and Water Board Agreement should not be vacated.

20 A copy of the Petition is attached to this notice.

8 this Court for an Alternative Writ of Mandate pursuant to California Code of Civil

9 Procedure §§ 1085 and 1087 ordering the California Department of Toxic Substances

10 Control ("DTSC"'), Lawrence Hafetz, in his official capacity, the California Regional

11 Water Quality Control Board, Los Angeles Region ("Regional Board"), and Real Party in

12 Interest The Boeing Company ("Boeing") respectively, to (1) immediately vacate the

13 Settlement Agreement entered into on May 9, 2022 by DTSC and Boeing purporting to

14 implement a Consent Order for Corrective Action entered into between DTSC and
15 Boeing in August 2007 including establishing soil cleanup levels for the highly-
16 contaminated Santa Susana Field Laboratory ("SSFL Agreement") and 2) immediately
17 vacate the "Memorandum of Understanding Establishing the Processes, Methodologies,
18
and Standards for Assessing Stormwater Discharges and Applicable Requirements
19

20 Following The Boeing Company Soil Cleanup at the Santa Susana Field Laboratory Site"

21 ("Water Board Agreement") approved by the Regional Board on August 11, 2022 and

22 entered into by the Regional Board and Boeing on August 12, 2022. True and correct

23 copies of the SSFL Agreement and Water Board Agreement are attached hereto as

24 Exhibits C and D, respectively. By this verified petition, Petitioners allege as follows:

25 1. As a result of a secret negotiation and without any input from the public,

26 DTSC and Boeing sought to limit the site clean-up alternatives that would be considered

27 by DTSC in its ongoing process to select a clean-up plan for the toxic contamination at

28 SSFL. As a result, when DTSC entered into the SSFL Agreement, DTSC and its agent,

VERIFIED PETITION FOR ALTERNATIVE WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Mr. Hafetz, violated the California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code

2 sections 21000 et seq. ("CEQA"), by taking an action which gave impetus to the soil and

3 groundwater remediation project at the Santa Susana Field Laboratory ("SSFL

4 Remediation Project" or a "Project") in a manner that forecloses alternatives or mitigation
5 measures that are part of the ongoing review of the SSFL Remediation Project pursuant
6 to CEQA. (See Save Tara v. City of W. Hollywood (2008) 45 Cal.4th 116, 138; 14 Cal.
7 Admin Code § 15004(b)(2).) Specifically, the SSFL Agreement stipulates that the Human
8
Health Risk-Based Screening Levels ("Health RBSLs") and soil cleanup standards
9

10 required by a consent order issued by DTSC in 2007 and incorporating a DTSC-approved

11 2014 Standardized Risk Assessment Methodology (SRAM) Workplan (Rev. 2) ("2014

12 SRAM'") will be superseded with new, less stringent Health RBSLs identified in

13 Attachment 3 of the SSFL Agreement. In addition, the SSFL Agreement further reduces

14 the clean-up standards by authorizing Boeing to further weaken the clean-up levels by

15 multiples of 5 and 100 times the already less stringent Health RBSLs. The SSFL

16 Agreement also places a cap of 440,000 cubic yards ("cu. yds.") on the volume of soil

17 that could be removed from Boeing's areas of responsibility, above which Boeing could

18 challenge with litigation. Lastly, the SSFL Agreement eliminates consideration of an

19 alternative cleanup plan that would allow for future rural residential (agricultural) use.

20 These decisions, included as part of the adopted SSFL Agreement, require less soil

21 cleanup at the SSFL than is required by the currently applicable Health RBSLs. These

22 decisions also require less soil cleanup than is identified in the "Draft Program
23 Environmental Impact Report for the Santa Susana Field Laboratory" released for the
24 Project in 2017 ("Pending EIR"). As a result, the SSFL Agreement forecloses alternative
25 soil remediation efforts at the site, including for example removal of soil consistent with
26
the soil clean-up levels and Health RBSLs required by the 2007 Consent Order and 2014
27
SRAM as well as the alternative described in the Pending EIR. By foreclosing those
28
project alternatives, the SSFL Agreement also forecloses mitigation measures that would

3

VERIFIED PETITION FOR ALTERNATIVE WRIT OF MANDATE

1 be considered to address those alternative's impacts. DTSC could not take this action in

2 furtherance of the Project prior to the completion and certification of the Pending EIR,

3 the process for which is already pending and has been underway for eight years.
4 2. The SSFL Agreement includes a condition that makes it effective only
5 upon the Regional Board's approval of the Water Board Agreement. As a result, when a
6 the Regional Board approved and entered into the Water Board Agreement, the Regional
7
Board violated CEQA by taking an action that significantly altered the SSFL
8
Remediation Project in a manner that forecloses alternatives or mitigation measures that
9

10 are part of the ongoing review of the Project pursuant to CEQA. The Water Board

11 Agreement forecloses alternative soil remediation efforts at the site including but not

12 limited to removal of soil consistent with the soil clean-up levels and existing Health

13 RBSLs as well as the alternative described in the Pending EIR. By foreclosing these

14 project alternatives, the Water Board Agreement also forecloses mitigation measures that

15 would be considered to address those alternative's impacts. The Regional Board could

16 not take this action in furtherance of the Project prior to the completion and certification

17 of a legally sufficient EIR, including evaluating public comments and selecting the

18 cleanup alternative that will be applied to Boeing's portions of the SSFL.

4 Beneficial Interest of Petitioner; Capacity of Respondent
5 4. Petitioner PARENTS AGAINST SANTA SUSANA FIELD LAB ("Parents
6 Against SSFL") is an association of residents living in communities adjacent to SSFL.
7 Parents Against SSFL was founded by mothers of children diagnosed with rare cancers
8
and seeks to reduce, to the greatest extent possible, the number of local families who
9

10 have to hear the words, "your child has cancer." Parents Against SSFL advocates for the

11 complete remediation of the SSFL and to protect nearby communities from exposure to

12 the site's toxic and carcinogenic contamination.

13 5. Parents Against SSFL members live, recreate, and work in the vicinity of

14 the SSFL. Parents Against SSFL's members residing and working in the communities
15 surrounding the San SSFL have been exposed to contamination released from soils and

16 water at the SSFL. Members of Parents Against SSFL residing and working in the

17 communities surrounding the SSFL live with a constant fear that contamination from the

18 SSFL has caused, is causing, and will cause adverse health effects, including cancer, to

19 them, their families, and friends. Parents Against SSFL has been actively engaged in
20 proceedings relating to the contamination, health risks and inadequate clean-up of the

21 SSFL, including providing extensive comments on the Pending EIR released in 2017 and

22 the Water Board Agreement for which limited notice was provided to the public. Had

23 Parents Against SSFL been notified of the SSFL Agreement prior to its finalization,
24 Parents Against SSFL would have submitted comments objecting to the Agreement.
25 Parents Against SSFL's participation in the Pending EIR process is substantially
26 impaired by DTSC's and the Regional Board's challenged actions by foreclosing any
27 meaningful consideration of Parents Against SSFL's preferred alternative for the SSFL

Remediation Project include the soil clean-up of the SSFL be done consistent with pre-

8

VERIFIED PETITION FOR ALTERNATIVE WRIT OF MANDATE

1 SSFL background levels, the Health RBSLs approved in 2014, and rural residential and

2 agricultural uses.

3 6. Petitioner PHYSICIANS FOR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY/LOS

4 ANGELES CHAPTER, INC. ("PSR") is a non-profit public benefit corporation
5 organized under the laws of the State of California with its main office in Los Angeles,
6 California. PSR has approximately 470 members who live, recreate and work in and
7 around Los Angeles and Ventura Counties. PSR is dedicated to, among other goals, the
8

9 achievement of a sustainable environmental and advocating in support of vigorous efforts

10 to clean-up contamination resulting from nuclear energy and weapons research. To

11 further these goals, PSR advances solutions grounded in public health by amplifying the

12 trusted voices of health care professionals and providing them with the tools they need to

13 successfully advocate for healthier, stronger communities. For over 40 years, PSR has

14 organized educational training sessions and opportunities for direct policy advocacy with

15 legislators, decision-makers and the media, all with the purpose of advancing policies that

16 foresee and forestall damage to human health. PSR's program areas include Air &

17 Climate Justice, Clean Water, Land Use & Health, Nuclear Threats and Toxics-Free

18 Communities. PSR's advocacy is focused on eliminating the disproportionate adverse

19 effects of environmental degradation and nuclear threats on low-income communities of

20 color. PSR actively seeks federal and state agency implementation of State and federal

constant fear that contamination from the SSFL has caused, is causing, and will cause

9

VERIFIED PETITION FOR ALTERNATIVE WRIT OF MANDATE

1 adverse health effects, including cancer, to them, their families, and friends. PSR has

2 been actively engaged in proceedings relating to the contamination, health risks and

3 inadequate clean-up of the SSFL, including providing extensive comments on the

4 Pending EIR released in 2017 and the Water Board Agreement for which limited notice
5 was provided to the public. Had PSR been notified of the SSFL Agreement prior to its
6 finalization, PSR would have submitted comments objecting to the Agreement. PSR's
7
participation in the Pending EIR process is substantially impaired by DTSC's and the
8
Regional Board's challenged actions by foreclosing any meaningful consideration of
9

10 PSR's preferred alternative for the SSFL Remediation Project that the soil clean-up of the

11 SSFL be done consistent with pre-SSFL background levels, the Health RBSLs approved

12 in 2014, and rural residential and agricultural uses.

13 8. Petitioner PUBLIC EMPLOYEES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL

14 RESPONSIBILITY, INC. is a national, non-profit corporation based in Washington, D.C.

15 with chapters throughout the United States, including California. California PEER has a

16 field office in Oakland, California. PEER represents current and former federal and state

17 employees of land management, wildlife protection, and pollution control agencies who

18 are frustrated by the failure of governmental agencies to enforce or faithfully implement

19 the environmental laws entrusted to them by Congress or States. PEER has thousands of

20 members living across the country, including hundreds of members who live, recreate

21 and work in the vicinity of the SSFL.

and intends to submit comments on the final EIR and future DTSC actions involving the

10

VERIFIED PETITION FOR ALTERNATIVE WRIT OF MANDATE

1 SSFL Remediation Project. PEER's ability to participate in the EIR process is

2 substantially impaired by DTSC's and the Regional Board's challenged actions by

3 foreclosing any meaningful consideration of PEER's preferred alternative for the SSFL

4 Remediatione Project include the clean-up of the SSFL be done consistent with pre-SSFL
5 background levels, the Health RBSLs approved in 2014, and rural residential and

6
agricultural uses.
7
10. Petitioners and their members have direct and beneficial interests in
8

9 Respondents' compliance with laws bearing upon approval of the Project. These interests

10 will be directly and adversely affected by the Project, which violates the law as set forth

11 in this Petition. The maintenance and prosecution of this action will confer a substantial

12 benefit on Petitioners and the public by protecting Petitioners and the public from the

13 environmental and other harms alleged below and others that may exist but are unknown

14 due to the lack of a full environmental analysis of the Project.

15 11. Respondent DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL is

16 the state agency responsible for overseeing and approving the clean-up of hazardous

17 materials and soil contamination at the SSFL within Boeing's areas of responsibility.

19 Resources Code section 21067 and has principal responsibility for conducting
20 environmental review for the SSFL Remediation Project and taking other actions

21 necessary to comply with CEQA. DTSC, through its agent Respondent Lawrence Hafetz,
22 entered into the Settlement Agreement with Real Party in Interest Boeing.
23 12. Respondent CALIFORNIA REGIONAL WATER QUALITY CONTROL
24 BOARD, LOS ANGELES REGION is the state agency with primary responsibility for
25 overseeing water contamination associated with SSFL. Pursuant to 14 Cal. Admin. Code
26
15381, the Regional Board is a responsible agency under CEQA for the SSFL
27

28 Remediation Project. The Regional Board approved the Water Board Agreement. When

11

VERIFIED PETITION FOR ALTERNATIVE WRIT OF MANDATE

1 it approved the Water Board Agreement, the Regional Board also rendered the SSFL

2 Agreement in effect.

3 13. Respondent LAWRENCE HAFETZ is the Chief Counsel for Respondent

4 DTSC. Mr. Hafetz is named as a respondent in his official capacity. Mr. Hafetz was the
5 signator on behalf of Respondent DTSC to the Settlement Agreement.

7
corporation. Boeing owns approximately 2,403 acres of the 2,850 acre SSFL. Boeing is
8
the party responsible for soil clean-up activities in 672 acres of Area I, 119 acres of Area
9

10 III and a 1,140-acre southern buffer zone at the SSFL. Boeing is a party to a the Settlement

11 Agreement. Boeing is a party to the Water Board Agreement

12 15. Petitioners do not know the true names or capacities of the persons or

13 entities sued as Real Parties in Interest ROES I through X, inclusive, and therefore sue

14 these real parties by their fictitious names. Petitioners and plaintiffs will amend the

15 Petition to set forth the names and capacities of the ROE defendants along with

16 appropriate charging allegations when such information has been ascertained.

17 Jurisdiction and Venue

18 16. Pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 (alternatively

19 section 1094.5) and Public Resources Code sections 21168.5 (alternatively section

20 21168) and 21168.9, this Court has jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandate to set aside

21 Respondents' decisions to approve the Project without proper CEQA review.

22 17. Venue is proper in this Court because this action challenges acts done by
23 public agencies, and the causes of action alleged in this Petition arose in Ventura County.

1 extent required by law. The Settlement Agreement was negotiated confidentially between

2 DTSC and Boeing. There was no administrative procedure provided by DTSC which

3 Petitioner could employ to remedy the violations encompassed by this Petition.

4 Subsequent to DTSC's decision to weaken the Health RBSLs, on June 2, 2022, DTSC
5 held an on-line public meeting at which it allowed a limited number of members of the
6 public to ask questions. Several Petitioners and or their members raised objections or
7 attempted to raise objections at this post-hoc forum. In lieu of any available
8
administrative procedure, on October 3, 2022, Petitioners served DTSC with the notice
9

10 letter attached hereto as Exhibit A requesting that DTSC, as well as the Regional Board

11 and Boeing, vacate the SSFL Agreement and Water Board Agreement because the

12 Agreements foreclose alternatives and mitigation measures that must be reviewed and

13 addressed in the pending, public EIR process considering alternative clean-up scenarios

14 at the SSFL. On August 8, 2022, Petitioners submitted extensive comments to the

15 Regional Board objecting to its proposed entry of the Water Board Agreement, including

16 the Agreement's triggering the effective date of the SSFL Agreement and the

17 inconsistency with implementing a clean-up alternative consistent with the 2007 Consent

18 Order and 2014 SRAM. (Exhibit Q, PE002406 - PE002499' [Comments by Parents

14

VERIFIED PETITION FOR ALTERNATIVE WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Respondents and Real Party to set aside their actions taken in violation of CEQA. In the

2 absence of such remedies, Respondents' decisions will remain in violation of state law.

3 Statutory Background

4 The California Environmental Quality Act

5 24. CEQA mandates that "the long-term protection of the environment...shall

6 be the guiding criterion in public decisions" throughout California. (Pub. Res. Code 0.
7 21001(d).) The foremost principle under CEQA is that it is to be "interpreted in such a
8
manner as to afford the fullest possible protection to the environment within the
9
reasonable scope of the statutory language." (Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Bd. of
10

11 Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal. 3d 553, 563-64.) An agency's action violates CEQA if it

12 "thwarts the statutory goals" of "informed decisionmaking" and "informed public

13 participation." (Kings Co. Farm Bur. V. City of Hanford (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 692,

14 712.)

15 25. Under CEQA, a public agency must prepare and certify an EIR on any

16 project the agency "propose[s] to "carry out or approve" if that project may have

17 significant environmental effects. (PRC §§ 21100(a).)

18 26. "An environmental impact report is an informational document which,

19 when its preparation is required by this division, shall be considered by every public

20 agency prior to its approval or disapproval of a project." (PRC § 21061.) "The purpose of

21 an environmental impact report is to provide public agencies and the public in general

22 with detailed information about the effect which a proposed project is likely to have on
23 the environment; to list ways in which the significant effects of such a project might be
24 minimized; and to indicate alternatives to such a project." (Id.)
25 27. "Project' means the whole of an action, which has a potential for resulting
26 in either a direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect
27 physical change in the environment....* (14 Cal. Admin. Code § 15378(a).) "The term
28
*project' refers to the activity which is being approved and which may be subject to

15

VERIFIED PETITION FOR ALTERNATIVE WRIT OF MANDATE

1 several discretionary approvals by governmental agencies. (14 Cal. Admin. Code

2 15378(c).) "The term 'project' does not mean each separate governmental approval."

3 (Id.).

4 28. "Approval" means the decision by a public agency which commits the
5 agency to a definite course of action in regard to a project intended to be carried out by
6 any person. (14 Cal. Admin. Code § 15352(a).)
7
29. "Before granting any approval of a project subject to CEQA, every lead
8

9 agency or responsible agency shall consider a final EIR or negative declaration or another

10 document authorized by these guidelines to be used in the place of an EIR or negative

11 declaration. (14 Cal. Admin. Code § 15004(a).) "[A]t a § minimum an EIR must be

12 performed before a project is approved, for if post-approval environmental review were

13 allowed, EIR's would likely become nothing more than post hoc rationalizations to

14 support action already taken."(Save Tara, 45 Cal.4th at 130 (citation omitted).)

15 30. "Just as CEQA itself requires environmental review before a project's

16 approval, not necessarily its final approval [citation omitted], so the guideline defines

17 'approval' as occurring when the agency first exercises its discretion to execute a contract

18 or grant financial assistance, not when the last such discretionary decision is made."

19 (Save Tara, 45 Cal.4th at 134 [emphasis supplied].) "EIRs and negative declarations

20 should be prepared as early as feasible in the planning process to enable environmental

21 considerations to influence project program and design and yet late enough to provide

22 meaningful information for environmental assessment." (14 Cal. Admin. Code §
23 15004(b).) "[P]ostponing environmental analysis can permit 'bureaucratic and financial
24 momentum' to build irresistibly behind a proposed project, 'thus providing a strong
25 incentive to ignore environmental concerns." (Save Tara, 45 Cal.4th at 135, quoting
26 Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. V. Regents of the University of California, 47 Cal.3d
27
376, 395.)
28

16

VERIFIED PETITION FOR ALTERNATIVE WRIT OF MANDATE

1 31. "[P]ublic agencies shall not undertake actions concerning the proposed

2 public project that would have a significant adverse effect or limit the choice of

3 alternatives or mitigation measures, before completion of CEQA compliance." (14 Cal.

4 § Admin Code § 15004(b)(2).) "For example, agencies shall not take any action which

5 a gives impetus to a planned or foreseeable project in a manner that forecloses alternatives
6 or mitigation measures that would ordinarily be part of CEQA review of that public
7 project." (Id.; Save Tara, 45 Cal.4th at 138 ['"before conducting CEQA review, agencies
8
must not "take
9 any action" that significantly furthers a project a "in a manner that

10 forecloses alternatives or mitigation measures that would ordinarily be part of CEQA

11 review of that public project"].) "While mere interest in, or inclination to support, a

12 project does not constitute approval, a public agency entering into preliminary

13 agreements regarding a project prior to approval shall not, as a practical matter, commit a

14 the agency to the project. (14 Cal. Admin Code § 15004(b)(4).) "[A]ny such pre-approval

15 agreement should, for example:... (B) Not bind any party, or commit to any definite

16 course of action, prior to CEQA compliance; [and] (C) Not restrict the lead agency from

17 considering any feasible mitigation measures and alternatives, .... (Id.)

18 32. Postponing preparation of an EIR until after a binding agreement with a

19 project proponent has been reached "would tend to undermine CEQA's goal

20 of transparency in environmental decisionmaking." (Save Tara, 45 Cal.4th at 136

21 [citation omitted].) "Besides informing the agency decision makers themselves, the EIR

22 is intended 'to demonstrate to an apprehensive citizenry that the agency has in fact
23 analyzed and considered the ecological implications of its actions.' (Id., quoting No Oil,
24 Inc. V. City of Los Angeles, 13 Cal.3d 68, 86.) "When an agency reaches a binding,
25 detailed agreement with a private developer and publicly commits resources and
26

27 governmental prestige to that project, the agency's reservation of CEQA review until a

28 later, final approval stage is unlikely to convince public observers that before committing
itself to the project the agency fully considered the project's environmental

17

VERIFIED PETITION FOR ALTERNATIVE WRIT OF MANDATE

1 I consequences." a (Id.) "Rather than a document of accountability, the EIR may appear,

2 under these circumstances, a document of post hoc rationalization." (Id. [citation

3 omitted].)

4 33. "A CEQA compliance condition can be a legitimate ingredient in a
5 preliminary public-private agreement for exploration of a proposed project, but if the
6 agreement, viewed in light of all the surrounding circumstances, commits the public
7
agency as a practical matter to the project, the simple insertion of a CEQA compliance
8

9 condition will not save the agreement from being considered an approval requiring prior

10 environmental review." (Save Tara, 45 Cal.4th at 132.) "[C]ourts should look not only to

11 the terms of the agreement but to the surrounding circumstances to determine whether, as

12 a practical matter, the agency has committed itself to the project as a whole or to any

13 particular features, so as to effectively preclude any alternatives or mitigation measures

14 that CEQA would otherwise require to be considered...." (Id. at 139.)

15 34. A claim that a lead agency approved a project with potentially significant

16 environmental impacts before preparing and considering an EIR for the project is a

17 question of law, reviewed de novo by the court. (Save Tara, 45 Cal.4th at 131.)

18 Factual Background

19 A. SSFL background.

20 35. SSFL is a former nuclear reactor and rocket-testing facility. (Exhibit E, Ch.

21 2, PE001197 [Draft Program Environmental Impact Report for the Santa Susana Field
22 Laboratory; Sept. 2017].) Established in the 1940s, the site was used to conduct tens of

23 thousands of rocket tests, using an array of hazardous rocket fuels. (Exhibit F, PE001717

24 [Supplemental Detailed Comments on Draft Program Environmental Impact Report on

25 Cleanup of the Santa Susana Field Laboratory by the Committee to Bridge the Gap and

26 the Natural Resources Defense Council; Dec. 14, 2017].) Two open-air burn pits were

27 operated at the site in which radioactive and toxic wastes were burned. (Id. at PE001719.)

28 As a result of these operations and the mishandling of solvents and highly toxic materials
at the facility for many decades, the SSFL site is contaminated with hazardous chemicals

18

VERIFIED PETITION FOR ALTERNATIVE WRIT OF MANDATE

1 such as perchlorate, PCBs, dioxins, volatile organic compounds, semi-volatile organic

2 compounds, and heavy metals. (Exhibit E, Ch. 1, PE001105, PE001202; Exhibit E,

3 PE001722, PE001760.)

4 36. The SSFL is located in the southeast corner of Ventura County directly

5 adjacent to a stretch of the eastern border of Los Angeles County. (Exhibit E, PE001111.)

6 The facility is approximately 29 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles. (Id.) The

7 city of Simi Valley is located about one mile north of the site's northern border. (Id.) The

8 community of Bell Canyon is located directly south of the site. (Id.) To the east are the

9 residential communities of Canoga Park, West Hills, and Chatsworth within the City of

10 Los Angeles. (Id.)

11 37. The site extends over 2,850 acres. (Exhibit E, PE001111.) The site has been

12 divided into four administrative areas - Areas through IV - associated with three

13 responsible parties, Boeing, DOE, and NASA. (Id at PE001112.) Area I encompasses 713

14 acres in the northeastern section of SSFL. (Exhibit E, PE001411.) 672 acres of Area I is

15 owned and being investigated by Boeing. (Id.) Area III includes 119 acres located within

16 the western half of the SSFL site. (Id.) Area III is owned and being investigated by

17 Boeing. (Id.) The Southern Buffer Zone is 1,143 acres located south of Areas I through

18 IV. (Id.) The Southern Buffer Zone is owned and being investigated by Boeing. (Id.)

19 38. The Health RSBLs and soil cleanup standards mandated by the SSFL

20 Agreement only pertain to contamination from hazardous chemicals within Boeing's

21 areas of responsibility.

22 39. In 2015, Boeing prepared RCRA Facility Investigation reports for various
23 areas of the SSFL. (Exhibit G, Att. A, PE001863 [PSR-LA Comments on DTSC's Draft

24 PEIR for the SSFL Cleanup and Draft Program Management Plan; Dec. 14, 2017].) The

25 reports included cancer risk assessments for a suburban residential garden use. (Id.)

26 Boeing's risk assessment indicated that the cancer risk from the contamination for which

27 it is responsible at the Santa Susana Field Lab, in an area referred to as Systems Test

28 Laboratory IV, is 9.6E-01 (9.6 x 10-1). (Exhibit G, Att. A, PE001875.) That risk

19

VERIFIED PETITION FOR ALTERNATIVE WRIT OF MANDATE

1 assessment means that, if 100 people lived in this area and had a garden, 96 of them

2 would be expected to get cancer from the exposure. (Id.) That same location registered e

3 Hazard Index of 727. (Id. at PE001876.) A Hazard Index of 1 is the threshold limit for

4 non-carcinogenic health impacts. (Id. at PE001872.) Anything above 1 indicates a

5 significant health risk. (Id.)

6 40. Boeing estimates other a high cancer risks for a suburban residential use with

7 a garden at other locations for which it is responsible for the remediation. (Exhibit G,

8 PE001854.) Boeing reported a cancer risk of 200,000 cancers per million and a Health

9 Index of 700 for an area at SSFL named Happy Valley North. (Id. at PE001854; Id. at

10 PE001907.) The area known as Compound A was estimated to pose a cancer risk of

11 100,000 in a million and posted a Hazard Index of 1,112. (Id. at PE001854; Id. at

12 PE001900.) The Advanced Propulsion Test Lab was found to pose a cancer risk of

13 20,000 cancer per million people and a Hazard Index of 2,000. (Id. at PE001913.)

14 41. Hazardous wastes or hazardous waste constituents have migrated or may

15 migrate from the Facility into the environment through surface water, air, and

16 groundwater (including seeps and springs) pathways. (Exhibit C, Ex. 2, PE000050 [SSFL

17 Settlement Agreement; May 9, 2022].) Potential exposures can occur from direct contact

18 with soils, sediments, weathered bedrock, surface water, air, and groundwater, as well as

19 potential indirect exposure to chemicals in plants following uptake from the soil. (Id.)

20 B. The 2007 Consent Order

21 42. On or about August 16, 2007, DTSC entered into a Consent Order For

22 Corrective Action with Boeing, DOE and NASA ("2007 Consent Order"). (Exhibit C,

23 Ex. 2. PE000042 - PE000115.)

24 43. The 2007 Consent Order establishes the decision-making process for the

25 cleanup of contaminated soils on the portions of SSFL for which Boeing is responsible.

26 (Exhibit C, Ex. 2, PE000042 - PE000115.)

27 44. The 2007 Consent Order identifies the types of chemicals to be cleaned up
28 and requires the actual cleanup of soil contaminated by those chemicals be decided

20

VERIFIED PETITION FOR ALTERNATIVE WRIT OF MANDATE

1 utilizing the Standardized Risk Assessment Methodology ("SRAM") for SSFL. (Exhibit

2 C. Ex. 2, PE000061; Id. at PE000051; Id. at PE000049; Id. at PE000110 - PE000111.)

3 An initial SRAM was approved by DTSC in 2004. (See Exhibit I, PE002225 [DTSC

4 letter to Boeing regarding SRAM-2 comments; June 4, 2014].)

5 45. A key element of the 2007 Consent Order is a requirement that Boeing

6 prepare a Corrective Measures Study Workplan ("CMS Workplan"). (Exhibit C, Ex. 2,

7 PE000060 - PE000061.) After completion of various investigation and characterization

8 documents and treatability studies, Boeing's proposed CMS Workplan is intended to

9 provide details of the methodology for developing and evaluating potential corrective

10 measures to remedy chemical contamination at the Facility utilizing the Standardized

11 Risk Assessment Methodology (SRAM) Workplan (Rev. 2) and to identify the potential

12 corrective measures. (Id. at PE000060 - PE000061.)

13 46. DTSC will evaluate the CMS Workplan and then prepare a draft cleanup

14 decision. (Exhibit C, Ex. 2, PE000061.) That draft cleanup decision would be made

15 available to the public for review and comment. (Id. at PE000062.) Once that public

16 review period has concluded and the public's comments taken into account, DTSC would

17 then select and approve the cleanup decision document for implementation. (Id.) DTSC is

18 preparing an EIR for the cleanup decision. (See id. at PE000064; Exhibit E, App. C,
19 PE001411.)

20 47. The 2007 Consent order required a plan from Boeing setting forth tasks,

21 milestones and timelines to achieve "[r]emediation of chemically contaminated soils by
22 June 30, 2017 or earlier, utilizing the Standardized Risk Assessment Methodology

23 (SRAM) Workplan (Rev. 2)." (Exhibit C, Ex. 2, PE000051.)

24 48. In 2010, DTSC confirmed that the clean-up standards to be achieved by the

25 2007 Consent Order would require clean-up levels that protect residential with garden

26 uses and would be comparable to a cleanup to background levels. (Exhibit J, PE002247 -
27 PE002248, PE002250, PE002257 [DTSC Response to Comments, Agreements in

28 Principle, State of California and the Department of Energy, State of California and the

21

VERIFIED PETITION FOR ALTERNATIVE WRIT OF MANDATE

1 National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Volume 1; October 26, 2010]. See

2 Exhibit C, Ex. 2, PE000042 - PE000115.) Boeing is required to address exposures to
3 contaminated soils through direct contact, vapor and dust inhalation, and ingestion of soil

4 and plants from home gardens. (Exhibit C, Ex. 2, PE000107.)

5 49. In August 2014, the SRAM was updated to incorporate a list of Risk-Based

6 Screening Level thresholds for hundreds of toxic contaminants potentially present in

7 contaminated soils at SSFL. (Exhibit K, App. A, PE002337 - PE002349 [Final

8 Standardized Risk Assessment Methodology Revision 2 Addendum for the SSFL; August

9 2014].) On August 26, 2014, DTSC approved the 2014 SRAM Rev. 2 Addendum.

10 (Exhibit L, PE002360 [Approval of the SRAM Rev. 2 Addendum for the SSFL].) The

11 2014 SRAM included Health RBSLs proposed by Boeing. (Exhibit K, PE002285.)

12 C. The EIR for the SSFL Clean-up.

13 50. On November 22, 2013, DTSC issued a Notice of Preparation ("NOP")

14 announcing the agency's initiation of a process to prepare a program environmental
15 impact report for the contaminated soil and groundwater remediation project at the SSFL.

16 (Exhibit E, PE001411.) The NOP states that "[t]he proposed project includes the

17 activities necessary to implement soil and groundwater remediation." (Id.)

18 51. DTSC determined that the SSFL Remediation Project may have a

19 significant impact on the environment and a Program EIR is necessary to fully evaluate

20 potential environmental effects, including cumulative impacts, and alternatives for

21 program-wide mitigation. (Exhibit E, Ch. 1, PE001102.)
22 52. According to the Scoping Report accompanying the NOP, the SSFL

23 Remediation Project EIR "will analyze remediation of soils and groundwater, RCRA

24 closure of three facilities and ongoing monitoring and maintenance of former RCRA

25 impoundments, and demolition of Area IV buildings and associated infrastructure which

26 will be implemented by the [responsible parties]." (Exhibit E, PE001403.) The Scoping

27 Report acknowledges that the activities to be reviewed in the EIR "are remedial actions

28 that will require approval by DTSC." (Id.) The EIR "will establish a framework for

22

VERIFIED PETITION FOR ALTERNATIVE WRIT OF MANDATE

1 "tiered" or project-level environmental documents to be prepared to address further

2 development and refinement of remediation approaches and actions." (Exhibit E, App. C,

3 | PE001411.)

4 53. On September 7, 2017, DTSC released a draft EIR for the SSFL

5 Remediation Project. (Exhibit E.)

6 54. As it relates to Boeing, the primary objective of the Project is to implement

7 the 2007 Consent Order. (Exhibit E, Ch. 1, PE001112.)

8 55. The DEIR evaluates a cleanup plan alternative that relies on the Health

9 RBSLs approved in 2014. (Exhibit E, App. B, PE001370 - PE001373.) The DEIR further

10 acknowledges that "the risk-based screening levels used for characterization purposes

11 should be considered preliminary screening levels and are surrogates for risk-based

12 cleanup requirements." (Id. at PE001206.) Accordingly, alternatives relying on the

13 screening levels identified in the DEIR or other alternative screening levels could be

14 proposed by commenters and considered in the preparation of the EIR.

15 56. The DEIR emphasizes that DTSC's evaluation of alternatives includes

16 factors that consider the extent of any final clean-up and its reliability:

17 To aid the decision making bodies in their review of the project and the

18 environmental impacts and alternatives to the cleanup, the following
criteria are assessed and considered:
19 3. Long-term effectiveness and reliability (after remedial activities are

20 complete) in protecting human health and the environment (inclusive of
surrounding communities) from exposure to materials containing
21 contaminants above applicable cleanup requirements.

22 4. Reduction of toxicity, mobility, and/or volume of contaminated media.
5. Short-term effectiveness (during implementation/construction activities)
23 in protecting human health and the environment (inclusive of surrounding

24 communities) from exposure to materials with contaminants above
applicable cleanup requirements.
25 6. Ability to implement the remedial activities, including feasibility to

26 construct and operate, administrative feasibility and availability of services
and materials.
27 7. Remediate the site in an expedient and cost-effective manner.

28 8. Community input during a formal public comment period on the cleanup
decision document.

23

VERIFIED PETITION FOR ALTERNATIVE WRIT OF MANDATE

1 (Exhibit E, Ch. 1, PE001113, PE001311.) All of these factors and the range of

2 alternatives are topics to be addressed in the EIR and subject to public comment.

3 57. The DEIR acknowledges that the range of alternatives subject to public

4 comment and review by DTSC encompasses various cleanup scenarios. For example, the

5 DEIR proposes to reject the possible alternative to clean up Boeing Areas and III for use

6 as residential property assuming that all of the residents consume 100 percent of produce

7 grown onsite and in soil after remediation. (Exhibit E, Ch. 6, PE001319.) Although the

8 DEIR proposes to reject this alternative, that draft proposal is subject to public comment

9 and further review in the EIR process. Indeed, Petitioners and others have objected to

10 DTSC's rationale in developing this alternative and proposed corrections to this

11 alternative to be considered. (Exhibit G, PE001856 - PE001858, PE001928; Exhibit H,

12 PE001965 - PE002223 [Parents Against SSFL Comments and accompanying

13 Change.Org Petition on DTSC's Draft PEIR for the SSFL Cleanup]; see also Exhibit F,

14 PE001747.)

15 58. The DEIR also reviewed an alternative that would be based on less

16 stringent clean-up levels assuming that future residents would not eat any homegrown

17 produce from residential gardens. (Exhibit E, Ch. 6, PE001319.) "This alternative was

18 considered but rejected from further analysis, as this alternative would not meet the

19 cleanup standards of the 2007 Consent Order." (Id.) That draft proposal to reject this

20 alternative is subject to public comment and further review in the EIR process. (Id.)
21 59. The draft EIR focuses on a preferred alternative that relies on estimated soil

22 cleanup volumes and acreage for the Boeing areas of responsibility that are based on a

23 future use of suburban residential with a garden from which the residents would eat 25

24 percent of their total diet. (Exhibit E, Ch. 1, PE001115.) Petitioners and other interested

25 parties have submitted comments sharply criticizing DTSC regarding its formulation of

26 this alternative. (Exhibit G, Att. A, PE001866 - PE001868, PE001928; Exhibit H,
27 PE001966 - PE002223; see also Exhibit F, PE001739 - PE001758.) For this alternative,

28 the DEIR estimates that 921,000 cubic yards of contaminated soil will have to be

24

VERIFIED PETITION FOR ALTERNATIVE WRIT OF MANDATE

1 remediated in areas for which Boeing is responsible. (Exhibit E, Ch. 3, PE001243.) Of

2 the total 921,000 cu. yds. of contaminated soil to be addressed by Boeing in that

3 alternative, the DEIR assumes only 390,000 cu. yds. would be excavated and shipped to a

4 disposal site. (Id.) Interested parties have submitted comments requesting DTSC to

5 consider soil cleanup standards that would remove more soil and be more protective of

6 human health and the neighboring communities. An alternative requiring more soil to be

7 removed could still be considered in the EIR process.

8 60. The public comments on the draft EIR take issue with the range of
9 alternatives proposed by DTSC. (Exhibit G, Att. A, PE001927 - PE001929.) This

10 ongoing public process regarding the appropriate range of alternatives and the final

11 cleanup alternative for Boeing's areas of responsibilities must be completed before any

12 possible alternatives are foreclosed. PSR-LA and others commented that the draft EIR

13 should include an alternative version of the Project that required soil clean-up to levels

14 consistent with background concentrations of the contaminants. (Exhibit G, Att. G,

15 PE001956; Exhibit H, PE001968; see also Exhibit M, PE002365 - PE002366 [City of

16 Los Angeles, et al. Comments on the Draft PEIR and Draft Program Management Plan

17 for the SSFL; Dec. 7,2017].) The comments also argued for consideration of an

18 alternative applying the soil remediation thresholds for rural residential/agricultural uses

19 at the site. (Exhibit G, PE001853, PE001855 - PE001856; Exhibit M, PE002366. See

20 also Exhibit F, PE001741.) Clean up levels for rural residential/agricultural uses would

21 be the most protective and require the greatest amount of soil remediation because these

22 uses would include not only consumption of fruits and vegetables but also beef, dairy

23 products, chicken, eggs and other farm products as well as longer exposure times.
24 (Exhibit G, PE001855 - PE001856; Exhibit F, PE001742.) Likewise, the comments

25 demand that DTSC include an alternative in the DEIR based on DTSC-approved inputs

26 found in the 2014 SRAM. (Exhibit G, Att. A, PE001928; Exhibit F, PE001752.)

27 Commenters point out numerous errors in the DEIR's calculation of the SRAM-based

28 clean-up levels. (Exhibit G, Att. A, PE001928; Exhibit F, PE001747 - PE001756.) The

25

VERIFIED PETITION FOR ALTERNATIVE WRIT OF MANDATE

1 comments also take issue with the DEIR's focus on an alternative that would leave in

2 place thousands of cubic yards of contaminated soil. (Exhibit G, Att. A, PE001928;

3 Exhibit H, PE001968; Exhibit F, PE001757.) Likewise, the comments take issue with the

4 draft EIR's failure to disclose the alternative clean-up levels from which DTSC will

5 choose. (Exhibit G, PE001858 - PE001859; Exhibit M, PE002367.)

6 61. Petitioner PSR-LA also submitted comments, explaining that "[t]he way to

7 protect people nearby is to assure that DTSC's promises (and those of Boeing) that SSFL

8 would be cleaned up such that it would be safe to live on site, eat produce grown on it,

9 and drink from wells are fully carried out. If the source is cleaned up to those safe levels,

10 it is then safe for the people nearby." (Exhibit G, PE001858.) Additionally, Petitioner

11 Parents Against SSFL submitted comments on the Draft PEIR, including an online

12 petition which garnered 72,000 comments critiquing the Draft PEIR. (Exhibit H.) The

13 comment advocates for an alternative cleanup to background levels and objects to the

14 Draft PEIR's alternatives that would leave any toxic chemical contaminants in place

15 "where they could continue to migrate offsite and place neighboring communities at

16 risk." (Id. at PE001968.)

17 D. The DTSC and Boeing Agreement

18 62. Instead of considering the comments of the public actively engaged in the

19 EIR process for the SSFL Remediation Project and considering an alternative applying

20 more stringent clean-up standards and soil removal to Boeing's soil cleanup as part of the

21 EIR process, DTSC has instead engaged in a secret process with Boeing to foreclose

22 DTSC's consideration of alternatives remediating the site to achieve background levels of
23 contaminants and levels protective of agricultural and residential uses. On January 22,

24 2021, DTSC sent an "Offer to Enter Into Non-Binding, Confidential Mediation With

25 Boeing to Resolve the Santa Susana Field Laboratory Formal Dispute Dated December 6,

26 2019." (Exhibit N [DTSC Letter to Boeing on Confidential Mediation of Dispute; Jan.

27 22, 2021].) In that letter, DTSC also invited the Regional Board to participate in the

28 confidential mediation. (Id.)

26

VERIFIED PETITION FOR ALTERNATIVE WRIT OF MANDATE

1 63. On May 9, 2022, DTSC and Boeing entered into a Settlement Agreement.

2 (Exhibit C.)

3 64. DTSC did not provide an opportunity for any public comments on the

4 Settlement Agreement. (See Exhibit N.)

5 65. In May 2022, DTSC issued a Community Update that indicates that the

6 Settlement Agreement selected clean-up standards to be applied by Boeing. (Exhibit O

7 [DTSC News Release: "California holds Boeing Accountable for Cleanup at Toxic Santa

8 Susana Field Laboratory," May 9, 2022].)

9 66. On June 2, 2022, DTSC held a public meeting to a announce its prior signing

10 of the Settlement Agreement with Boeing and to present its terms to the public. DTSC

11 prepared a Power Point presentation for the meeting. (Exhibit P [DTSC Community

12 Meeting Powerpoint Presentation Update; June 2, 2022].) The Power Point emphasizes

13 that the cleanup required under the 2007 Order has been changed and any alternatives

14 more stringent than the new screening levels dictated by the Settlement Agreement would

15 not be in the range of possible clean-ups of the site. (Id. at PE002387, PE002392.) The

16 Power Point also states that the five times multiplier method was established as part of

17 the SSFL Agreement. (Id. at PE002394.) Power Point also states that Settlement

18 Agreement includes "exception areas" where up to a 100 times multiplier could be

19 applied, precluding alternatives requiring more stringent clean-up in those areas. (Id. at

20 PE002395.)

21 The SSFL Agreement Weakens Currently Applicable Screening

22 Thresholds and Forecloses an Alternative to Require a Cleanup Using
the Approved 2014 Risk-Based Screening Levels for Soil.
23

24 67. Among other provisions, the SSFL Agreement commits DTSC and Boeing

25 to weakening the Human Health RBSLs included in the 2014 SRAM. The 2014 SRAM

26 includes Risk-Based Screening Levels for the suburban residential garden standard for

27 182 chemical constituents. (Exhibit K, App. B, PE002353.) The SSFL Agreement

28 weakens these approved Health RBSLs for 147 of those chemicals, strengthens the levels
for 34 chemicals, and leaves one unchanged. (Exhibit Q, App. B, PE002452.)

27

VERIFIED PETITION FOR ALTERNATIVE WRIT OF MANDATE

1 68. The SSFL Agreement mandates that the weakened levels be implemented

2 despite the relevance to potential Project alternatives and public comments on such

3 alternatives. The SSFL Agreement states that:

4 d. SRAM Process for Boeing's Soil and Groundwater Remediation. The

5 SRAM process for the soil and groundwater remediation conducted by
Boeing will be completed as follows:
6 1. Boeing shall revise the 2014 SRAM Rev. 2 Addendum in accordance

7 with the specifications provided in Exhibit 5 (SRAM Amendment Process
and Summary).
8

9 3. ... DTSC will authorize the use of the SRAM if it meets the
specifications provided in Exhibit 5 (SRAM Amendment Process and
10 Summary).

11 (Exhibit C, PE000010.)
12 69. Attachment 3 to Exhibit 5 of the SSFL Agreement sets forth "Soil Risk-
13 Based Screening Levels for a Hypothetical Future Resident No Garden, Hypothetical
14 Future Resident with Garden, Hypothetical Future Recreator, and Hypothetical Future
15 Site Worker." (Exhibit C, Ex. 5, PE000133 PE000156.) The Human Health RBSLs
16 included in Exhibit 5 are less stringent than the currently approved soil screening levels
17 used by the 2014 SRAM. (Compare id. with Exhibit E, App. B, PE001370 - PE001373.
18 See Exhibit Q. App. D, PE002480 - PE002499 [presenting side-by-side comparisons of
19 2014 screening levels and weakened screening levels from SSFL Settlement].)
20 70. The SSFL Settlement limits the contaminant cleanup levels for each
21 identified cleanup scenario from the currently approved levels included in the 2014
22 SRAM to the weakened levels identified in Exhibit 5 of the SSFL Settlement. The SSFL
23 Agreement mandates that the "SRAM Rev. 2 Addendum (2022) will include the
24 following updates, which will supersede and replace the referenced language/process in
25 the SRAM Rev. 2 Addendum (2014):..." (Exhibit C, Ex. 5, PE000122.) The mandated
26 revisions include using the weaker Human Health RBSLs currently applicable to the site:
27 0 All methods and parameters will be consistent with those used in the
28 approved 2022 Human Health Risk-Based Screening Levels. Approved
RBSLs are provided in Attachment 3 to this procedure.

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR ALTERNATIVE WRIT OF MANDATE

1

2 (Id. at PE000124 [emphasis added].)

3 71. As a result, the SSFL Agreement forecloses alternative cleanups that would

4 be based on more accurate or the existing screening levels in the approved 2014 SRAM

5 from consideration in the EIR process.

6 The SSFL Agreement Further Weakens Currently Applicable

7 Screening Thresholds and Forecloses any Alternative That Does Not
Multiply Boeing's Screening Levels by Five and 100 Times.
8
72.
9 The Settlement Agreement further weakens the Health RBSLs by allowing

10 a for a multiplier of 5 above the calculated Risk-Based Screening Levels for some areas of

11 the site for which Boeing is responsible. (Exhibit C, Ex. 5, PE000133 -PE000151.) An

12 even higher multiplier of 100 times the screening levels is allowed for the remainder of

13 the Boeing site. (Id.) Accounting for these multipliers, the actual number of 2014

14 screening levels that are weakened applying the five-fold multiplier is 176 less stringent

15 screening levels while only six screening levels are tightened. (Exhibit Q, App. B,

16 PE002452.) The number of 2014 screening levels that are weakened applying the 100-

17 fold multiplier is 179 while only three screening levels are tightened. (Id.)

18 The SSFL Agreement as a Practical Matter Forecloses DTSC From
Considering Clean-up Alternatives That Would Excavate and Dispose
19 of More Than 440,000 Cubic Yards of Soil.

20 73. The SSFL Agreement places hurdles for DTSC to consider and adopt an

21 alternative clean-up project that would remediate more than 440,000 cubic yards of soil

22 from those areas of the SSFL for which Boeing is responsible. (Exhibit C, PE000007.)

23 DTSC has estimated that a soil remedy for Boeing's areas of responsibility to a

24 residential with 100% garden standard could involve excavation and disposal of

25 approximately 440,000 cubic yards of soil. (Id.) That volume is approximately the soil

26 volume for a residential with 100% garden cleanup as estimated in the Draft EIR and set

27 forth in Appendix K to the DEIR. (Exhibit E, App. K, PE001417 - PE001709.) The

28 Settlement Agreement includes an Agreement by DTSC that it will not require more than

29

VERIFIED PETITION FOR ALTERNATIVE WRIT OF MANDATE

1 440,000 cu. yds. of soil to be excavated by Boeing: "[f]or purposes of resolving the

2 Parties' dispute and accelerating the remedial activities at the SSFL, Boeing has agreed as

3 part of this settlement that it will not contest a soil remedy decision by DTSC that is

4 consistent with the processes, methodologies and schedule under this Agreement and the

5 Exhibits, and is among the scenarios and within the range of estimates presented in the

6 summary table on page iii of Appendix K to the Draft PEIR." (Exhibit C, PE000007.)

7 74. Submitted comments on the DEIR for the SSFL Cleanup propose

8 alternatives employing more stringent soil cleanup levels and more excavation and

9 disposal of contaminated soil. (Exhibit G, PE001853, PE001855 - PE001856, PE001928,

10 PE001956; Exhibit F; Exhibit M.) Boeing has previously contended that cleaning up soil

11 to background levels in its areas of responsibility could require excavation of as much as

12 1.6 million cubic yards of contaminated soil. (Exhibit J, PE002267.) As a practical

13 matter, the soil removal cap of 440,000 cu. yds. included in the SSFL Agreement,

14 commits the agency to a version of the Project which forecloses consideration of

15 alternatives involving more soil removal and disposal.

16 The SSFL Agreement Forecloses Consideration of a Clean-up

17 Alternative Allowing Rural Residential (Agriculture).

18 75. In the Settlement Agreement, DTSC announces that it will not consider an
19 alternative requiring Boeing to clean-up contaminated soils to levels allowing a rural

20 residential (agriculture) use. (Exhibit C, Ex. 5, PE000124.) The Settlement Agreement

21 states that the "[Risk-Based Screening Levels] for the rural residential (agricultural)

22 exposure scenario do not need to be included or updated in SRAM Rev. 2 Addendum

23 (2022)." (Id.) "DTSC has determined, based on a variety of factors, that this scenario

24 does not represent the reasonably anticipated future land use at SSFL." (Id.) DTSC

25 claims that "numerous factors, including but not limited to the following, are relevant for

26 support for DTSC's decision on this matter of only focusing on non-agricultural uses:

27 population growth patterns and projections; soil type and topography; the lack of a water

28

30

VERIFIED PETITION FOR ALTERNATIVE WRIT OF MANDATE

1 source for irrigation purposes; market forces; and the site's location in relation to urban,

2 residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural and recreational areas." (Id.)

3 76. Comments on the DEIR proposed an alternative for Boeing to cleanup

4 contaminated soils to allow for agricultural uses. (Exhibit G, PE001853, PE001855 -

5 PE001856; Exhibit F, PE001741; Exhibit M, PE002366.) This alternative should be

6 addressed in an EIR process. By rejecting it as part of a secret negotiation culminating in

7 the SSFL Agreement, DTSC has foreclosed consideration of this potential alternative in

8 an EIR.

9 The Regional Board's Approval of the Water Board Agreement Made

10 the SSFL Agreement Effective and Foreclosed Consideration of
Alternatives.
11
77.
12 In addition to the SSFL Agreement, Regional Board staff negotiated the

13 terms of a "Memorandum of Understanding Establishing the Processes, Methodologies,

14 and Standards for Assessing Stormwater Discharges and Applicable Requirements

15 Following The Boeing Company Soil Cleanup at the Santa Susana Field Laboratory"

16 (*Water Board Agreement") between the Regional Board and Boeing regarding the

17 implementation of the Boeing National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit

18 regulating the quality of storm water discharges from the SSFL. (Exhibit D.) The SSFL

19 Agreement is conditioned upon the Regional Board's approval of the Water Board

20 Agreement. (Exhibit C, PE000029.) The Agreement states that "[t]he Effective Date of

21 this Agreement is the later of the following after both have occurred: (a) the day it is

22 signed by the last signatory, and (b) the Effective Date of Water Board Agreement." (Id.)
78.
23 On July 11, 2022, the Regional Board issued a public notice of its intent to

24 consider and adopt the MOU at the Regional Board's August 11, 2022 Board meeting.

25 (Exhibit R [Notice of Public Meeting to Consider Memorandum of Understanding

26 Between Boeing and the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board].)
79.
27 On August 8, 2022, Petitioners submitted extensive comments to the

28 Regional Board critiquing the SSFL Agreement and the weakening of the Health RBSLs.
(Exhibit Q.) The comments point out that the Settlement Agreement weakens the Health

31

VERIFIED PETITION FOR ALTERNATIVE WRIT OF MANDATE

1 RBSLs for 147 of the 182 chemical constituents, strengthens the levels for 34 chemicals,

2 and leaves one unchanged. (Id. at PE002452.) Clean-up level concentrations required by

3 the Settlement Agreement are a hundred times higher than previously allowed for some

4 areas of the site, and ~2000 times higher for the rest of the Boeing site. (Id.)

5 80. The MOU Comments further point out that the actual number of Health

6 RBSLs that are weakened applying the Settlement Agreement's five-fold multiplier is

7 176 less stringent screening levels while only six screening levels are tightened. (Exhibit

8 Q, App. B, PE002452.) The number of Health RBSLs that are weakened applying the

9 100-fold multiplier is 179 while only three screening levels are tightened. (Id.)

10 Petitioners' comments also pointed out that the belated rationale for weakening the

11 Health RBSLs were not supported by any evidence. (Id. at PE002455 - PE002457.)

12 81. Despite these comments by Petitioners, at the conclusion of the Regional

13 Board's August 11, 2022 hearing, the Regional Board approved the Water Board

14 Agreement. (Exhibit S [Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board Resolution

15 Approving the MOU between Boeing and the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality

16 Control Board]; Exhibit D.)

17 82. In the SSFL Agreement, DTSC purports to "reserve[] all of its rights,

18 powers, discretion and authority as the CEQA lead agency for the remediation of

19 contamination at the SSFL in selecting a soil remedy and in selecting a groundwater

20 remedy with regard to the Boeing Areas of Responsibility." (Exhibit C, PE000015; Id. at

21 PE000215 - PE000217.) However, because the terms of the SSFL Agreement, viewed in

22 light of all the surrounding circumstances, commit the agency as a practical matter to a

23 specific limited version of the clean-up Project, the reservation of CEQA authority does

24 not cure the Project approvals made by the Agreement.

25 83. DTSC's approval of Health RBSLs set forth as an attachment to the

26 Settlement Agreement is an action concerning the SSFL Remediation Project that limits

27 the choice of alternatives or mitigation measures, before completion of CEQA

28 compliance.

32

VERIFIED PETITION FOR ALTERNATIVE WRIT OF MANDATE

1 84. DTSC's approval of a five-time multiplier and/or a 100-time multiplier to

2 the Health RBSLs for Boeing are actions concerning the SSFL Remediation Project that

3 limit the choice of alternatives or mitigation measures, before completion of CEQA

4 compliance.

5 85. DTSC's agreement with Boeing identifying a maximum amount of soil

6 excavation and disposal under which Boeing would not challenge such excavation and

7 disposal requirement is an action concerning the SSFL Remediation Project that as a

8 practical matter limits the choice of alternatives or mitigation measures, before

9 completion of CEQA compliance.

10 86. DTSC's decision in the Settlement Agreement to not consider an alternative

11 to clean-up Boeing's areas of responsibility to levels allowing a rural residential

12 (agriculture) use is an action concerning the SSFL Remediation Project that limits the

13 choice of alternatives or mitigation measures, before completion of CEQA compliance.

14 87. The Regional Board's decision to approve the Water Board Agreement
15 triggering the effectiveness of each of DTSC's premature actions is an action concerning

16 the SSFL Remediation Project that limits the choice of alternatives or mitigation

17 measures, before completion of CEQA compliance.

18 Claims for Relief

19 88. The allegations of paragraphs 1-87 are incorporated by reference as though

20 fully set forth herein.

21 89. At all times herein mentioned, Respondents DTSC and Regional Board
22 have been able to carry out their duties to formulate and regulate Boeing's remediation of
23 Boeing's areas of responsibility at the SSFL in a manner consistent with the requirements

24 of CEQA. Notwithstanding such ability, the plain duties imposed on Respondents by

25 CEQA, and the demand of Petitioners that Respondents perform such duties, Respondent

26 DTSC, in entering into the Settlement Agreement with Real Party Boeing, and

27 Respondent Regional Board, in approving the Water Board Agreement making the

28 Settlement Agreement effective, have wrongfully taken actions concerning the Project

33

VERIFIED PETITION FOR ALTERNATIVE WRIT OF MANDATE

1 that effectively foreclose DTSC's consideration of alternatives requiring more stringent

2 soil remediation, possible future uses, and a safer environment for surrounding
3 communities, as well as additional mitigation measures that would be associated with

4 such alternatives. The adverse effects of Respondents' premature approvals continue to

5 this day. Unless compelled by this Court to vacate the SSFL Agreement and the Water

6 Board Agreement and refrain from approving activities that foreclose DTSC's

7 consideration of alternatives and mitigation measures as required by law of their offices,

8 Respondents will continue to violate CEQA.

9 90. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy 1n the ordinary

10 course of law because, unless the Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require

11 Respondents to comply with their legal duties, Respondents will continue to proceed in

12 violation of the law.

13 91. If Respondents continue to maintain the SSFL Agreement and the Water

14 Board Agreement limiting Respondents' ability to evaluate and consider alternatives that

15 would reduce risks to the surrounding communities, including members of Petitioners, as

16 well as future users of the SSFL site, Petitioners will suffer substantial, clear, and certain

17 irreparable injury in that their procedural rights to comment on alternatives and effective
18 mitigation measures pursuant to CEQA during the pending EIR process will be
19 significantly undermined, the discretion of DTSC to select an alternative and any

20 accompanying mitigation measures that would be most protective of surrounding

21 communities unduly constrained, and Respondents will proceed with a flawed and

22 improperly truncated EIR procedure pursuant to CEQA.

23 PRAYER

24 Petitioners pray that this Court:

Re: Notice of Intent to File Suit Under the California Environmental Quality Act
Regarding the May 9, 2022 Santa Susana Field Laboratory Settlement Agreement Between DTSC and The Boeing Company and the August 12, 2022 Memorandum of Understanding Between the Los Angeles RWQCB and The Boeing Company

Dear Director Williams, Mr. Hafetz, Mr. Becker, and Executive Officer Purdy:

am writing on behalf of Parents Against Santa Susana Field Lab, Physicians For Social Responsibility/Los Angeles Chapter, Inc., and Public Employees For Environmental
Responsibility, Inc. ("Petitioners") regarding the two agreements entered into with The Boeing
Company (*Boeing") - the Settlement Agreement agreed to by the Department of Toxic
Substances Control ("DTSC") and Boeing on May 9, 2022 ("SSFL Agreement") involving
remediation activities at the Santa Susana Field Laboratory ("SSFL") and the Memorandum of
Understanding approved by the Regional Water Quality Control Board, Los Angeles Region
("Regional Board") on August 11, 2022 and signed by the Executive Officer on August 12, 2022
("Regional Board MOU") which, among other things, triggered the effectiveness of the DTSC
Agreement.

In entering into the SSFL Agreement, DTSC has foreclosed consideration of site clean-up
alternatives that could have been considered by DTSC in its ongoing environmental impact report process to select a clean-up plan for the toxic soil contamination at SSFL. As a result,

Notice of Intent to File CEQA Suit
DTSC and RWQCB Agreements Relating to Santa Susana Field Laboratory Soil Remediation
October 3, 2022
Page 2 of 4

when DTSC entered into the SSFL Agreement, DTSC and its agent, Mr. Hafetz, violated the
California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code sections 21000 et seq. ("CEQA"), by taking an action that significantly furthered the soil and groundwater remediation project at the SSFL ("SSFL Remediation Project" or "Project") in a manner that a forecloses alternatives or
mitigation measures that are part of the ongoing review of the SSFL Remediation Project pursuant to CEQA. (See Save Tara V. City of W. Hollywood (2008) 45 Cal.4th 116, 138.) In particular, the SSFL Agreement stipulates that the Human Health Risk-Based Screening Levels ("Health RBSLs") and soil cleanup standards approved by DTSC in 2014 will be superseded with new, less stringent Health RBSLs identified in the SSFL Agreement. The SSFL Agreement also mandates reductions in the clean-up standards by authorizing reductions in soil clean-up
levels by multiples of 5 and 100 times the already less stringent Health RBSLs. The SSFL
Agreement further places a cap of 440,000 cubic yards ("cu. yds.") on the volume of soil that
could be removed from Boeing's areas of responsibility, above which Boeing could challenge with litigation. Lastly, the SSFL precludes consideration of a clean-up alternative that would allow rural residential (agriculture) uses.

These decisions made in the SSFL Agreement foreclose alternative soil remediation
efforts at the site, including for example removal of soil consistent with the soil clean-up levels and Health RBSLs approved for the site and other alternatives being considered as part of the existing EIR process for the SSFL Remediation Project. By foreclosing those project alternatives, the SSFL Agreement also forecloses mitigation measures that would be considered to address those alternative's impacts. DTSC could not take these actions in furtherance of the Project prior to the completion and certification of an EIR for the Project.
The SSFL Agreement includes a condition that makes it effective only upon the Regional Board's approval of the Regional Board MOU. As a result, when the Regional Board approved and entered into the Regional Board MOU, the Regional Board violated CEQA by taking an action that significantly furthered the SSFL Remediation Project in a manner that forecloses alternatives or mitigation measures that are part of the ongoing review of the Project pursuant to
CEQA. The Regional Board could not take this action in furtherance of the Project prior to the
completion and certification of a legally sufficient EIR, including an evaluation of public comments and selection of the cleanup alternative that will be applied to Boeing's portions of the
SSFL.

Please take notice, pursuant to Public Resources Code ("PRC") section 21167.5, that
Petitioners intend to file a Verified Petition for Alternative Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (*Petition"), under the provisions of CEQA, PRC §21000 et seq., against Respondents DTSC, Regional Board and, in his official capacity, Lawrence Hafetz ("Respondents") and Real Party in Interest The Boeing Company in the Superior Court for the County of Ventura, challenging the SSFL Agreement and the Regional Board MOU for Respondents' premature approvals of the SSFL Remediation Project prior to completing and
