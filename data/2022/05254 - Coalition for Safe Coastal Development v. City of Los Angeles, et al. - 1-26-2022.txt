Petitioner, COALITION FOR SAFE COASTAL DEVELOPMENT (*Petitioner"'),

2 alleges through this Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate ("Petition"), as follows:
INTRODUCTION

"Respondent") adoption of a Notice of Exemption from the California Environmental Quality 1. Petitioner challenges the Respondent City of Los Angeles' ("City" or

6 Act ("CEQA"), and the related discretionary approvals (together, the "Project Approvals") for

7 the Reese Davidson Community Project (the "Project"). As detailed herein, (a) the Project fails

8 to qualify for the CEQA exemption claimed, and (b) because the Project required City approval

10 obligations imposed by the Subdivision Map Act. These failures resulted in substantial prejudice 4 of a vesting tentative tract map, the Project is not exempt from the environmental review

11 by precluding informed public participation and fatally impairing the decision-making of the
L1Z06 12 City's approving bodies, including the Advisory Agency, City Planning Commission, and the
13 8 B F E  HH AOO eynS "pALg JYSIIM €888 Petitioner additionally challenges the City's Project Approvals based upon the City Council itself.
SIl!H ÁueAeg 14 2.

15 City's failure to comply with applicable laws, including but not limited to the Subdivision Map
16 Act, the Mello Act, and fundamental principles of constitutional due process for a fair
17 adjudicatory appeal hearing.

18 3. The proposed Project Site is located between two one-way streets: North Venice

19 Boulevard on the north, and South Venice Boulevard on the south, and is bounded by Dell

20 Avenue on the east, and South Pacific Avenue on the west. The Project Site is bisected by the
21 historic Grand Canal, a part of the larger Venice Canal system. Public parking is currently

22 located on the western and eastern portions of the Project Site. The eastern portion of the Project
23 Site also contains a two-story, four-unit residential structure and a boat launch area which serves

24 as access for recreational boating and vital maintenance of the entire Venice Canal system.
25 4. Currently, the Project Site is one of the largest publicly owned City of Los
26 *a -ce Angeles parking lots for users of the very popular Venice Beach. City records show that the
27

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 parking revenue from this lot (Lot 731) represents approximately 5% of all parking revenue from
2 all City parking lots. The portion of Lot 731 west of Grand Canal contains approximately 40
3 percent of the public parking on the Project Site immediately adjacent to Venice Beach. The
4 larger portion of Lot 731 to the east of Grand Canal contains approximately 60 percent of the
5 public parking for the Project Site. The combined area of Lot 731 is low-lying and zoned for
Open Space. As a practical matter, Lot 731 functions as a protective containment area for high
7 tidal flooding, and even for tsunami inundation flood waters and, if developed as proposed, could
8 divert flood or tsunami waters into the adjoining Venice Canals area, thus exacerbating property
damage and threatening the safety of area residents.

10 5. The Project requires the demolition of Lot 731 (containing 196 vehicular parking

11 spaces) and demolition of a two-story, four-unit residential apartment structure owned by the
LLZ06 OgL eUNS 'PALE BJILUSIM €888 d11 'doJo Mel jeuueuo 12 City (all units are occupied by senior/low-income residents), and the construction, use and

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Parties in Interest Hollywood Community Housing Corporation and Venice Community Housing

2 Corporation would develop the residential housing/commercial mixed-use project on a legal

3 subdivision of City-owned land underlying the parking lots on a 99-year land leasehold. The

4 leasehold area would be the "donut" rings of the Project on the West Site and East Site, and the

5 Los Angeles Department of Transportation ("LADOT")-owned land on the East Site will be the

6 "donut" hole of land the public parking garage will be built upon.
The precise details of the parking structures to be developed remains shrouded in

8 secrecy, primarily by reason of the ongoing refusal by the LADOT to release public documents 7.

4 related to the development, construction, ownership and operation of the East Site public parking

10 structure. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges that the East Site public

11 parking structure would be independently owned, constructed, financed, developed, and operated 0SL d11 'dnoJo Mel |auueyo 4-706 1 08 PE THMSIRA SOCS SIlIH Auexeg by or for LADOT. Alternatively, Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges that an
13  undisclosed public/private partnership entity, would somehow obtain and exercise dominion over 12

14 the portion of the land use entitlements granted to Real Parties Hollywood Community Housing
15 Corporation and Venice Community Housing Corporation related to the East parking structure.
16 In other words, the Project description in officially released documents grants entitlements to
17 Hollywood Community Housing Corporation and Venice Community Housing Corporation, but,
18 in reality, those entities would not develop, build, own or operate the East Site public parking

19 structure located on the "donut hole" land. Additionally, Petitioner is informed and believes, and

21 entitlement recipients to attempt to rationalize characterizing the "Texas donut" 20 thereon alleges that the City and Real Parties have structured the project description and land use

22 residential/commercial mixed-use buildings and the "Texas donut hole" East Site public parking
23 structure project as a single project completely exempt from environmental review.
Plans submitted to the City show that the combined non-public and public parking
25 structures will provide a total of 360 on-site automobile parking spaces comprising of 61 24 8.

26 residential spaces, 42 commercial spaces, 196 public spaces (replacing the current parking spaces

of Lot No. 731), 23 Beach Impact Zone (BIZ) spaces and 38 non-required spaces; and 136

2 bicycle parking spaces (19 short-term and 117 long-term).

3 9. The combined residential project and parking structure project would require the
export of 9,100 cubic yards of building material and soil; the removal of 24 on-site trees and 11
5 non-protected street trees; and substantial modifications to the canal access boat ramp at the
6 Grand Canal. The City's project description fails to distinguish how much soil/debris removal,
and what tree removals are attributable to the East Site public parking structure developed by

8 LADOT versus the residential/commercial mixed-use and non-public parking components of the
Project developed by Hollywood Community Housing Corporation and Venice Community
10 Housing Corporation throughout the Project Site.

11 10. The unit mix of the residential component of the Project underscores that only a
LLZ06 OSL eHnS "PAIE EJJHSI!M E8E8 Channei Law Group, d77 12 portion of the Project is to include housing units occupied by formerly homeless residents
13
8 receiving supportive housing services. The Developer provided this summary: "The residential
'SIH Áueaeg 14 component of the Project will consist of 68 units reserved for low-income formerly homeless
15 households (permanent supportive housing); 34 affordable units for low-income artists, including
16 live/work studios on the ground floor; 34 affordable units for lower-income households; and 4
17  units for on-site property management staff." Accordingly, a majority of the units of the Project
18 are not committed to permanent supportive housing to help alleviate homelessness, yet it is the
19 homelessness components that are touted to the public, press, and decision makers.
20 11. The City's actions and the Project Approvals come amid alarms rung by the City
21 Controller in two official audits and by others that the City's Proposition HHH affordable
22| housing program is mired in obscenely high costs per unit developed using the ground up
23 construction method chosen by the City. Indeed, Petitioner estimates based in part upon the
24 developer's own data show that each 460 square foot unit of Supportive Housing in the Project
25 will cost as much as $824,448, not including possible overage costs common in such
26 construction projects. These high costs undermine the public's confidence in the City's

6 12. In fact, as first reported by the Westside Current website, due to concerns about
the boondoggle aspects of the Project, in October 2021, Sonya Reese Greenland, great

8 granddaughter of Arthur Reese, a Black visionary involved with Abbot Kinney in the creation of

9 Venice Beach, demanded in a letter to Venice Community Housing Corporation that her
grandfather's name be removed from the Project. Ms. Reese Greenland contended in her letter 10

11 that "her grandfather would oppose the project, among other reasons, because of its cost and the 8 d77 'dnoJo MET IBuueHO H1Z06 12 large amount of space it will occupy, arguing it would create congestion and infringe on public
13 access to the beach." 8 elns "pAa euIlyS|!M €8€8 'SIlH AueAeg 14 13. Also as noted by the Westside Current, after Reese Greenland's letter was
of Gregory Hines - a Tony Award-winning choreographer, dancer 15 published Evan Hines, the son
16  and actor who lived in Venice and was intended to be the namesake of the project's community
17 arts center -also demanded the removal of that family name. The facile paternalism exhibited by
18 Councilmember Bonin and other proponents of the Project by exploiting the names and legacies

19 of Mr. Reese and Mr. Hines without obtaining (or even seeking) the permission of their families
20 speaks volumes.
21 14. While Councilmember Mike Bonin and entitlement counsel for the developers

22 claim the opponents to the Project are a "small group," the list of prominent opponents has
23 grown exponentially, to the point where Mr. Bonin faces a recall backed by community members
24 of all political parties, and the more than 1,000 people who submitted objection letters to the

15 motion of Council member Mike Bonin to instruct the Department of Transportation to issue a

16 Request for Proposals to develop City Parking Lot 731 with an affordable housing project. Mr.

4 Thus, the Project as proposed is inconsistent with almost every applicable City plan and zoning
5 law from the fundamental General Plan down to even routine street dedications.

6 35. On December 18, 2018, the City issued an Initial Study and Notice of Preparation
of an Environmental Impact Report for the Project. The Initial Study identified sixteen (16)

8 environmental subject areas where the Project could generate significant negative environmental
impacts. The NOP observed: "Based on an Initial Study, the Project could have potentially
10 significant environmental impacts in the following topic areas, which will be addressed in the
11 EIR: Aesthetics, Air Quality, Biological Resources, Cultural Resources, Geology and Soils,
9 11Z06 12 Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Hazards and Hazardous Materials, Hydrology and Water Quality,

'SIl!H Kueaeg 14 Resources, Utilities and Service Systems (including water and wastewater), Energy Conservation
15 and Infrastructure."

16 36. On January 14, 2019, the City conducted an open house regarding the notice of
17 preparation. From the outset, community members expressed concern about the concept of using
18 low lying open space parking lots that provide the most critical beach access to an estimated 10
19 million people who visit Venice Beach each year. There were immediate concerns expressed
20 | about the diversion of tidal flood or tsunami surge waters into the adjoining properties and the
21 historic Venice Canal area with the Project occupying the open space of the surface parking.
22 37. Thereafter the City and Developer began working on environmental studies that
23 would inform the Environmental Impact Report, the public, and City decision makers about the
24 Project.

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION 1

(VIOLATION OF CEQA) 2

3 55. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in

4 their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.

5 56. CEQA requires a three-step analysis to determine the level of environmental

6 review of an activity. The first step is to determine whether CEQA applies because the activity •:

7 a is a project. In this case, the City's proposed issuance of a tract map and various discretionary
8 land use entitlements are a project within the meaning of CEQA Guideline section 15378(a).

4 The actions of the City confirm this conclusion because initially the City issued a Notice of
10 Preparation of an Environmental Impact Report for the Project.
11 57. The second step of the CEQA analysis is to determine whether despite being a 8 d11'dnoJo MET |auueyO 1LZ06 12 CARS MANS SIl!H Auereg project subject to CEQA, the project meets the requirements of any statutory or categorical
13 exemption where the Legislature waived the benefits of environmental review or the mitigation
14 of impacts. Initially, the City concluded there was no applicable statutory or categorical BJIYS|!M €888 15 exemption that applied to the Project in this case, and proceeded to the third step, preparation of
16 an initial study to determine the level of environmental review applicable to the Project (negative
17 declaration, mitigated negative declaration or environmental impact report)

18 58. Following the passage of AB 1197, the City and Developer stopped preparing

19 environmental studies, acting as if no further studies or mitigation of potential effects of the

20 Project were required any law, apparently believing without supporting data that the Project
21 complied with the requirements of A.B. 1197.
22 The Project Obtained No Capital Investment To Build Supportive Housing Prior To The
City's Consideration of the Notice of Exemption 23

24 59. As summarized previously, A.B. 1197 was enacted as "special legislation" solely
25 applicable to the City of Los Angeles, and to make it take effect immediately the Legislature
26 adopted an urgency clause. The bill enacted Pub. Res. Code. Section 21080.27. This new

18 27

28

statutory exemption provides that CEQA "does not apply to any activity approved by or carried
2 out by the City of Los Angeles in furtherance of providing emergency shelters or supportive
3 housing in the City of Los Angeles." § 21080.7(b)(1).

60. As used in section 21080.27(b)(1), "[s]upportive housing' means supportive
5 housing as defined in Section 50675.14 of the Health and Safety Code, that meets the eligibility
6 requirements of Article 11 (commencing with Section 65650) of Chapter 3 of Division 1 of Title
7 7 of the Government Code or the eligibility requirements for qualified supportive housing or

8 qualified permanent housing set forth in Ordinance No. 185,489 or 185,492, and is funded, in
whole or in part, by any of the following:

17 of the City of Los Angeles at the November 8, 2016, statewide general election.
18 (E) The City of Los Angeles Housing Impact Trust Fund." § 21080.27(a)(3).
19 This list of five supportive housing funding sources was the exclusive means by which the
20 Project might become an eligible supportive housing project under the exemption statute.
21 Ordinance No. 185,489, known as the Interim Motel Conversion Ordinance, only applies to the
22 conversion of already constructed motels into supportive housing units. Ordinance No. 185,492,
23 the Permanent Supportive Housing Ordinance, only applies to projects of 120 units or less in
24 areas outside of downtown. Thus, if the Project does not have a funding commitment from one
25 of the five listed funds in Section 21080.27(a)(3), it does not meet the eligibility requirements for
26 exemption.

6 entity or entities that will provide supportive services,' "[t]he proposed funding source or

19 65,280 sq. ft. of residential floor area. The total nonresidential floor area is the total floor area

1 area to on-site delivery of exclusive tenant supportive services. The math shows the dedicated

2 supportive services is something less than 1.7% (685 sq. ft. / 39,879 sq. ft.).

3 69. Thus, based upon the Developer's own building plans, the floor area exclusively

7 uses). Accordingly, the zoning for the Project Site remains Open Space and ineligible for the
8 CEQA statutory exemption to rezone the Project Site.
9 72. Based upon the foregoing defects in the City's analysis and documentation of the

SIl!H AJOAeS 14 Project does not comply with the many Public Access provisions in the certified LUP. For
15 example, the Project will negatively impact beach parking as a result of the Project's proposed
16 automated parking system, which will severely slow and even discourage beach parking at this

18 construction (which will be significant). Also, Public Access for Canal boating is a key provision 17 location. The City also failed to consider the loss of beach parking during the Project's

19 of the Plans and it appears from the current project plans that canal boating will be less
20 accessible. To restrict Access in these ways, especially for the purposes of a non coastal-
21 dependent or non-coastal related use is a violation of the LUP.

107. IAP Section 1.3 Overview of the Mello Act states: "The Mello Act was adopted
2 by the State Legislature in 1982. The Act sets forth requirements concerning the demolition,
3 conversion and construction of housing within California's Coastal Zone. Each local jurisdiction

shall enforce three basic rules:

Rule 1. Existing residential structures shall be maintained, unless the local jurisdiction

6 finds that residential uses are no longer feasible. A local jurisdiction may not approve the
7 Demolition or Conversion of residential structures for purposes of a non-Coastal-

8 Dependent, non-residential use unless it first finds that a residential use is no longer
9 feasible at that location.

10 Rule 2. Converted or demolished Residential Units occupied by Very Low, Low or

11 Moderate Income persons or families shall be replaced. Converted or demolished Channei Law Group, d77 LLZ06 OS B  POIE HMM A A B OO † Beverly 12 Residential Units occupied by Very Low, Low or Moderate Income persons or families

14 Rule 3. New Housing Developments shall provide Inclusionary Residential Units. If
15 feasible, New Housing Developments shall provide inclusionary Residential Units
16 affordable to Very Low, Low or Moderate Income persons or families."

17 108. Rule makes it clear that a residential structure can only be replaced by a
18| residential use and not by a non-residential, non-coastal-dependent, mixed-use residential-
19 commercial project. However, the City ignored this requirement and incorrectly treated the
20 Mello Act as only an affordable housing law. The City's Mello Act Compliance Review
21 determination findings only address Rules 2 and 3 and not Rule 1. By allowing demolition of the
22 4-unit multi-family housing structure at 204-208 N. Venice Blvd., the City is not in compliance
23 with the first rule, to maintain the existing residential structure unless the project is for a coastal-
24| dependent use or the local jurisdiction finds that residential use is no longer feasible.
25 109. Before determining compliance with the Mello requirements for replacement
26 affordable units and inclusionary units, the Project must first meet the threshold requirement in
27

28 33

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Government Code Section 65590(c), which states: "The conversion or demolition of any'

2 residential structure for purposes of a nonresidential use which is not "coastal dependent," as
3 defined in Section 30101 of the Public Resources Code, shall not be authorized unless the local
. -....... ....................- 4 government has first determined that a residential use is no longer feasible in that location. If a
5 local government makes this determination and authorizes the conversion or demolition of the

6 residential structure, it shall require replacement of any dwelling units occupied by persons and

7 families of low or moderate income pursuant to the applicable provisions of subdivision (b)."

8 This provision is repeated in IAP Section 4.1 and in Settlement Agreement Section VI.C.1. and

0 is a condition precedent in order for HCID to conduct its determination of whether there are any

10 existing affordable units: "The Mello Act states that the Demolition or Conversion of residential

11 structures for the purposes of a non-Coastal-Dependent, non-residential use is prohibited, unless

..... ... -.. Channel Law Group, d17 0SL e}nS "PAIE OJJYS|!M €8£8 LIZ06 12 the local jurisdiction first finds that a residential use is no longer feasible at that location." This

8 13 required finding was not made for the Project.
Beverly Hills, 14 110. In addition, IAP Section 4.0 specifically states that one of the purposes of
15 completing a Mello Act Compliance Review is to identify applications to demolish or convert

16 residential structures for purposes of a non-Coastal-Dependent, non-residential use and that these
17 applications shall be denied unless the applicant proves with substantial evidence that a
18 residential use is not feasible at that location.

19 111. Given that the proposed use is non-residential and not coastal dependent, the

20 question at IAP Section 4.3, which requires feasibility to be assumed, must be answered. If the
21 applicant has not proven with substantial evidence that a residential use is infeasible, the Mello
22 Act Compliance Review stops, and the application shall be denied. The Project is clearly not
23 coastal dependent and, as per the requirements of IAP Section 4.3, continuation of the residential
24 use is feasible because it is adjacent to other existing, viable residential uses and the use has non-

25 conforming rights that permit a continued residential use.

112. It was an act of deception to not include the Government Code Section 65590(c)
2 finding in the Mello Act Compliance Review determination. Only if a local government makes
3 this threshold finding may it proceed to compliance with the replacement and inclusionary
requirements for low- and moderate-income dwelling units. Omitting any mention of
5 Government Code Section 65590(c) regarding maintaining residential structures is to omit a
significant part of the Mello Act law, one of its three main "rules," and thus is a violation of the

7 act. The City failed to make the required findings as it failed to consider the Mello Act's
8 threshold requirement contained in Government Code Section 65590(c), the Settlement
9 Agreement and the IAP.
10 113. The City exceeded its jurisdiction because the Project conflicts with the Mello
11 Act. Under article XI, section 7 of the California Constitution: "[a] county or city may make and Channel Law Group, d77 LIZ06 12 enforce within its limits all local, police, sanitary, and other ordinances and regulations not in
8 0GL EHNS "PALE BJLYSIM €888 13 conflict with general laws." Sherwin-Williams Co. v. City of Los Angeles, 4 Cal. 4th 893, 897
SII!H Auereg 14 (1993). The Mello Act is a state statute; therefore, any attempt to violate it or change its meaning
15 is in excess of the City's authority and exceeds its jurisdiction.
16 114. The City piecemealed the Project for purposes of the various Mello Act-related
17 findings. On page 1 of the Letter of Determination ("LOD"), the City describes the Project as
18 demolition of an existing surface parking lot and a four-unit residential structure and the merger
19 and re-subdivision of a 115,674 square foot site, for purposes of the construction, use and

20 maintenance of a mixed-use project consisting of 136 dwelling units and four unrestricted
21 manager units, supportive services, retail uses, a restaurant use and art studios. However, for
22 purposes of the Mello Act Compliance Review determination, on page 2 of the LOD the City
23 specifically removes the four commercial uses from the project description and erroncously
24 describes the Project as "..a Mello Act Compliance Review for the demolition of four
25 Residential Units and the construction of 140 new Residential Units within the Coastal Zone.»
26 Also, in the Mello Act Compliance Review determination the Project is erroneously described as
27

2 residential dwelling units," "the development of 140 Residential Units," and "a 100% affordable

4 115. In the May 17, 2021 Mello Act determination of affordable units letter from the
5 Los Angeles Housing Department ("HCID") to City Planning Department the Project was
..-.......: 6 erroneously described as the demolition of four existing residential units and construction of a

7 new 140-unit apartment building. If HCID had considered the Project correctly, as a mixed-use
8 residential-commercial development, it would not have been able to move to the next step of

9 determining affordable units because the threshold requirement of Government Code Section

10 65590(c) was not met. In past determination of affordable units letters, when a project has

11 entailed a demolition of a residential structure for purposes of a mixed-use residential-
LLZ06 OSA F B  SE 1 0 E M I A S S CS 'SillH ÁHeneg 12 commercial project, HCID has indicated that they are unable to issue a Mello Act determination

.....-e 14 which require that applications where demolition or conversion of residential structures occur for
use are denied unless the applicant proves with substantial evidence 15 purposes of non-residential
a 16 that a residential use is not feasible at that location. It appears that the applicant misinformed
17 HCID about the project description by leaving out the commercial portions of the Project. HCID
18 should not even have issued their Mello Act affordable unit determination because the

19 demolition of the existing apartment building is for purposes of a mixed-use residential-
20 commercial development, which is not allowed by the Mello Act, Settlement Agreement and the
21 IAP. The City has evaded the Mello Act requirements by piecemealing the project description
22 and preparing the findings based on a project description that only reflects a portion of the
23 Project, the residential portion. Using a piecemealed, partial project description the City claims
24 that the Project meets the Mello threshold requirement because a residential-only use is being

116. IAP Section 1.2.3 states: "Every Discretionary and Non-Discretionary

4 application must be reviewed and not just a part of the application. IAP Section 6.0 states: "For
5 Discretionary applications, the decision-maker shall issue the determination as written conditions
6 attached to the determination made with respect to the underlying case..." This means the entire
7 case is covered by the determination and not just a part of the case. A Mello Act Compliance
8 Review determination must be based on the same project application that is covered by the

15 in land use law is specific. The Project is in direct violation of the Mello Act, the Settlement
16 Agreement, and the IAP, all of which explicitly prohibit, in clear language, the conversion of a
17 residential structure to a non-residential use. Allowing the demolition of the multi-family
18 residential structure at 204-208 N. Venice Blvd. violates the clear meaning, spirit, and purpose of
19 the Mello Act. Besides violating the Mello Act, the City's approval of any demolition of a
20 housing structure for purposes of project that has non-residential uses is nonsensical because
21 this would allow a 100% residential structure to be replaced with the smallest possible amount of

approval of the Project because they live or own property within the impact area of the Project.

10 The Lack Of Adopted Los Angeles City Council Procedural Quasi-Judicial Hearing Rules
11 125. In accordance with Government Code Section 65804, the Los Angeles City Group, LLP Channel Law L1Z06 12 Planning Commission and Area Planning Commissions have adopted procedural hearing rules

15 126. Under the procedural rules of the planning commissions, generally speaking, such
16 administrative proceedings include presentation of the Project and appeal points by City
17 Planning staff, then the Appellant presents its case, then the Project Applicant presents its case,
18 then the Public is provided an opportunity to provide hearing evidence and argument testimony
19 (not Brown Act comment), then the Applicant and Appellant have an opportunity to provide
20 rebuttal, then the public hearing is closed, the Commission members deliberate and vote.
21 127. No similar orderly process is provided in the Rules of the Los Angeles City
22 Council for quasi-judicial land use appeal hearings at City Council Committee or Full Council
23 meetings. Government Code Section 65804 mandates that: "All local city and county zoning
24 agencies shall develop and publish procedural rules for conduct of their hearings so that all
25 interested parties shall have advance knowledge of procedures to be followed.3 (Emphasis

21 reasonable opportunity to present oral arguments for or against any proposed action. However, no person

SIlIH Auexeg 14 The City Required Constitutionally Protected Persons To Speak On The Project Mixed In

15 With All General Public Comment and Multi-Item Brown Act Public Speakers

137. In recent years, the City Council has adopted Council Rule No. 7, a bizarre Brown
16 Act public speaking rule that shuffles all public comment on every item on the meeting agenda to
17 the outset of the meeting. Council Rule No. 7 makes a one-size-fit-all public meeting "finding"
18 that 10 minutes of General Public Comment under the Brown Act is sufficient. The Rule also

19

20 makes a similar "finding" that regardless of the number of items on a City Council meeting

21 agenda, or the number of persons attending the meeting (in person and now virtually online), the
Council will only listen to its constituents for 20 minutes of Brown Act public comment

.. 1.e .m 22 concerning all items of business on the meeting agenda.
23 138.

24

25 a City Council Rule, and violations under the Brown Act that reasonable public comment be
permitted based upon the circumstance of each meeting, the City's treatment of the
26 constitutionally-protected persons attending its City Council meeting on December 1, 2021, by

.. 1 treating them as if they were mere Brown Act commenters, violated the fundamental principle of

2 the right to be heard under the due process clause.
3 139. The December 1, 2021 meeting was conducted under City Council Rule No. 7.

4 All speakers wishing to speak were required to raise their hand virtually so that they could be
5 called upon in the Zoom conducted City Council meeting. This included all property owners
6 (and all other persons with constitutionally protected rights) that Rule 8 guarantees in a public
7 hearing will be given a reasonable period of time to present information to the City Council. The
8 City Council President and City Attorney did not ask that property owners impacted by the
Project identify themselves so that they could be separately heard as provided in Council Rule
10 No. 8.

11 140. Even though City Council Rule No. 7 makes a finding that general public
Channel Law Group, d77 LLZ06 12 comment is a separate time period from comments for items on the meeting agenda, the City

8 OgZ Gyns "pAla eujysIm eseg 13 Council now combines all general public commenters and commenters on agenda items together.
'SIIH Apexeg 14 When combined with the Council's rule that a public speaker may only speak on two items on a
15 meeting agenda for one minute each and have one minute for general public comment, the new
16 multi-item public speaking period has become a confused jumble of speakers addressing topics
17 out of order and randomly. Each speaker may opt to speak on two items plus general comment.
18 Under this regime, ten public speakers exercising their right to speak for one minute cach on two
19 items and one minute on general public comment would consume 3 minutes each. Strict
20 adherence to the "finding" that 30 minutes of listening to the public was enough meant that as
21 few as 10 speakers might be heard.
22 141. This is how the City Council conducted its meeting on December 1, 2021, except
23 that the City Attorney gave a verbal warning that Appellant and Applicant would speak later on
24 the "fair hearing" items on the agenda. His comments did not indicate that the public speaking
25 segment was part of the "fair hearing." The public speaking segment was limited to 30 minutes
26 of speaking time but took about 40 minutes to carry out due to gaps of time between speakers. A

4 spoke in favor of the Project, and five persons spoke against the Project as proposed. Those nine

17 Council President left Council chambers during the public speaking portion of the meeting,
18 specifically during the first speaker, was out of the room approximately 37 minutes, and scurried
19 back into the room when the final public speaker asked: "Where is the City Council?". The City

20 Council President can be seen sitting down as the final public speaker was wrapping up his

21 remarks. For these minutes, the City Attorney effectively presided over the City Council's
22 meeting although he is not an elected member of that body.
23 144. At the end of the 30 minutes the City Attorney allowed for public comments on

24 all items on the agenda, including the Project which had been noticed by law as a Public

145. Next the City Council proceeded through the meeting agenda considering briefly
5 some other items on the agenda and voting on them. Subsequently, the two items on the

6 December 1, 2021 meeting agenda for the Project were called together for consolidated
7 consideration. Mr. Bonin leapt to his feet to speak but he was reminded that first the City

8 Council had to hear the presentations of the parties. At this point, because City Council members
could still be seen out of their seats continuing to talk to others and not paying attention,
10| including through the prior public speaking segment, the City Attorney reminded them again to
11 LIZ06 go 'SIl!H Aueneg pay attention because this was a "fair hearing."
12 146. Unlike at a planning commission hearing which has adopted procedural rules 'dnoJ5 MET |uueY) 13 under Government Code Section 65804, there was no presentation of the Project to the City
14 Council members by the City Planners, including no power point presentation of even what it
15 looked like. Additionally, there was no identification of the appeal issues raised by Appellant
16 Venice Vision or the City Planning staff's response to those appeal points.
17 147. Instead, Appellant's representative, who was patiently waiting to present appeal
18 arguments, could not be found by staff online in order to bring him into the virtual meeting.
19 While waiting for the staff to connect to Mr. Hall, the Council President called upon Council
20 Member Mike Bonin to provide his comments, even though Mr. Bonin had not heard the
21 Appellant's or Applicant's presentations. Mr. Bonin was given unlimited time to discuss the
22 Project and spent about 8 minutes extolling the Project generally and attacking the Appellant and
23 concerned constitutionally protected Persons as "obstructionist" and "vociferous and well-funded

5 to convey the magnitude of the problems with the Project. The amount of time to present appeal

6 issues to the City Council, was facially unreasonable, under Rule 8, which was not being applied
because of the erroneous placement of the Project on the meeting agenda, and under any fair

1 Thus, an activist from the other side of the City, who was not at the Venice site and had no

2 personal knowledge, distributed an email to many recipients, including the Mayor, Council

3 members and other officials, calling the incident "bomb-like."

18 Thus, the Chief of LAPD had issued a public statement placing the credibility of the
19 LAPD behind Mr. Bonin's earlier contention that the CO2 devices were "like a bomb" and

20 motivated by the development of the temporary homeless Bridge Homes site in Venice.
21 173. Mr. Bonin responded to all on this email chain:

received an email report from Pacific Division Captain Steve Embrich of the Major Crimes
5 Division investigation of the CO2 devices:
6 "As Chief Moore mentioned, our Major Crimes Division (MCD) has been pressing
7 forward with their investigation. have been in contact with Captain Robert Long,
8 Commanding Officer, Major Crimes Division who has provided us with timely updates
9 throughout the day. This morning MCD investigators returned to the MTA site and re-
10 canvassed the location in daylight. While conducting their follow-up investigation, they
11 located evidence of similar devices which appear to be much older and pre-date the e LIZ06 0GL eHNS "PAIE BJUS|IM E8€8 12 bridge housing construction.

15 construction. Although, it appears that we do not have physical evidence of a direct

17 still vital and necessary. Captain Morrison will be at the meeting to offer our full
18 support." (Emphasis added, bold depicts portions redacted from LAPD emails released to
Venice Vision.)
20 This email was widely distributed in the City to Mayor Eric Garcetti, Councilmembers Herb 19

21 Wesson and Nury Martinez, and Bonin's staff members. The portions in bold were redacted in
22 all copies of this email released to Venice Vision by LAPD, however, it was not redacted by Mr.
23 Bonin's office staff in their release of the same document. Thus, evidence provided to Venice
24 Vision by Mr. Bonin himself proves that from 2:44 p.m. January 3, 2020 forward, Mike Bonin
25 and Chief Moore had actual knowledge there was no direct evidence of a link between the
26 devices and the Bridge Housing project.

3 facts we have observed at the scene ..." In the version of this email report to LAPD managers,

4 Detective Dorroh's conclusions were redacted.

5 176. Consistent with these findings, on January 3, 2020, at 3:09 p.m., the LAPD Media

6 Relations Department sent an email to redacted recipients:
7 "Around 5:50 PM officers responded to the area of Sunset and Main and requested the

17 the Detective were redacted in emails produced to Venice Vision.

18 178. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges that the LAPD Media

19 Relations statement was issued because very similar wording of the Major Crimes Division's

20 conclusion was picked up in an LA Magazine online article published that same afternoon.
21 "We don't believe it's related to the homeless shelter construction,' said Officer Bob Long of

22 the LAPD Major Crimes Division." Similarly wording also appeared that afternoon in a LA
23 Times article citing an anonymous source in LAPD. The fact that LAPD personnel leaked the
24 truth to the LA Times suggests there was already pressure to create a false narrative higher in the
25 chain of command at LAPD.

T evidence of a direct threat to the Bridge Housing," Petitioner is informed and believes, and

2 thereon alleges that Mr. Bonin personally intervened with LAPD officials to continue to try to
3 weaponize the incident in order to publicly paint opponents to his homelessness strategies, like

4 Venice Vision and other groups and individuals in the community, as guilty of a criminal act.

180. Appellant is informed and believes, and thereon alleges that Mr. Bonin also

6 directed his staff to more widely distribute to the community and press his morning Facebook

7 statement without modification although at that time he knew LAPD investigators had

8 found devices older than the Bridge Housing project construction project, severely
undermining the legitimacy of his assumption the devices were placed by someone opposed

10 to his homeless policies including the Bridge Housing site and the Reese Davidson Project.
11 181. L1Z06 OS1B0 PNE S I A  B Beverly Hills, At 5:17 p.m. on January 3, 2020, Allison Wilhite, Mr. Bonin's staff director of
Channel Law Group, d77 12 Bridge Housing, widely distributed in the Venice community Mr. Bonin's Facebook statement
13 with this preface, solely focused on linking the CO2 canisters to opposition to the Bridge
14 Housing project:
15 "Hello,

16 As you may have heard, last night, LAPD responded to a report of suspicious devices
17 that looked like bombs at the site of the future A Bridge Home in Venice. Streets
18 were closed and nearby homes were evacuated for several hours while the LAPD Bomb

19 Squad analyzed the devices. Fortunately, there were no explosives.
20 Nevertheless, this incident is unsettling.
21 The A Bridge Home is intended to be a safe a haven for those living on our streets in
22 Venice, providing them stability and security while they seek the services and housing
23 they SO urgently need. While our service providers will be working hard to support the
24 clients on site, the City will also be working hard to deliver on its promise of increased
25 public safety to the neighborhood. Dedicated LAPD resources will be added to the

incident. Thank you for your continued engagement with our office and willingness to
participate in tough, but necessary, conversations about the A Bridge Home in Venice."

... -. (Emphasis added.) Then the Facebook statement was reproduced on the same message.

This further statement from Mr. Bonin's office at 5:17 p.m. failed to communicate any of the
8 conclusions of the Major Crimes Division at 2:44 p.m. that the devices appeared to have been

9 created BEFORE construction of the Bridge Housing project began. Even worse, it persisted in

14 motive in hyping the story contrary to reports in the LA Times:
SIl!H Ájeneg 15 "FYI the LA Times reported that "A law enforcement official [...] who spoke on the

21 with zero evidence and apparently without even consulting the police first, given the

22 statement they made to the Times." (Emphasis added.)

23 183. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges that Mr. Bonin

24 additionally would not accept the Major Crimes Division report and instead strong-armed LAPD

25 to issue a press release shaped by his own requested edits and embellishments related to an

3 Chief Moore and others, but all of those versions of the LAPD's statement have been redacted in
emails obtained by Appellant. However, at 6:17 p.m. January 3, 2020, Mr. Rubenstein
5 forwarded this proposed version to Mr. Bonin:

6 "Councilman-

Here is the update and statement we are going to issue...
8 Please reach it [sic] if you have any issues.
9
10 The Los Angeles Police Department's Major Crimes Division is investigating the

26 Petitioner is unaware of why LAPD would be consulting a City Councilmember to edit its own
27 press release. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges that permitting a
28 59

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

councilmember to edit an official police department press release is highly irregular from, normal

2 processes and procedures of the LAPD.

3 185. At 6:27 p.m., Mr. Bonin responded that the proposed press release did not

4 sufficiently link the devices to the Bridge Home site or confirm that LAPD was continuing to

5 investigate any link between the Bridge Housing project and finding of the devices:

6 "Joshua
7 Thanks for sending this. A couple points.
8 1/As I understand it, several of the devices were found inside the bridge housing site. The
9 statement says "near" and makes it sound like that was not necessarily the case they were

SIl!H Ájereg 14 email will be perceived as downplaying the significance and dismissing that concern
15 altogether.
16 Mike" (Emphasis added.)
17 186. Mr. Bonin asked for these changes to the LAPD press release even though he
18 knew that the Major Crimes Division had already concluded "we do not have physical evidence
19 of a direct threat to the bridge housing project." Petitioner does not know if Mr. Bonin's
20 conversation with Chief Moore occurred before or after the Major Crimes Division had reported
21 its conclusion of no link to the Bridge Home site or Venice's homeless population. Either way,
22 Mr. Bonin was intent to have LAPD state the device(s) were found on site and that the motive of
23 the devices continued to be investigated consistent with his morning Facebook post to the public
24 demonizing persons who questioned his homeless strategies in Venice.
25 187. From 6:31 p.m. to 6:45 p.m., Mr. Rubenstein sought to discuss these points on the
26 phone. He said to Mr. Bonin: "Great looking forward to it...I did make changes and addressed all

* concerns accept [sic] the motivation part and that I can discuss with you."

2 188. After their later conversation, LAPD emails show Rubenstein substituting a new
3 paragraph keeping alive the notion that LAPD was investigating the motivations behind the CO2
4| devices, and who left them at the locations they were found.
5 189. At 8:50 p.m., in time for the 11:00 p.m. television newscasts, LAPD issued this

6 release:

7 "Los Angeles: The Los Angeles Police Department's Major Crimes Division is

8 January 3, 2020 unleashed a torrent of angry comments on his Facebook account, and inquiries

9 from community leaders, including some supporters of Mr. Bonin, to release more information
10 about the incident.

11 191. At 3:05 p.m. on January 3, 2020, just minutes after Captain Embrich informed

22 "intimidate" him and "to slow or halt progress on providing bridge housing."

192. In response, Chief Moore said "I've asked for a statement from our PIO to
5 clarify... apologies for the confusion."
6 193. By 7:48 p.m., Christopher Wrede, alarmed that Allison Wilhite had just made
7 another mass distribution of Mr. Bonin's Facebook page statement, again contacted Chief Moore
8 asking for the LAPD to release clarifying information, including the pictures of the devices

found.
10 "As you can see here, Allison Whilhite from Councilman Bonin's office furnished a new

17 reflects any new information from your PIO [Public Information Officer].
18 At this point, Councilman Bonin is telling the public that devices intended to look like
19 bombs were placed at the Bridge Home Venice site in an apparent attempt to derail the
20 project and terrorize prospective residents.
21 Does that accurately reflect the LAPD's view of the situation? If so, what information can

23 of their children to draw their own conclusions? If not, what efforts are being made to

- particularly in connection with an issue as contentious as homelessness. And it seems a
N little odd, frankly, that all public information relating to such an incident would come
exclusively through Councilman Bonin's office.
Competent and reliable information from the LAPD -- including pictures of the devices at
issue -- is urgently needed. I plan to request an update at the VNC [Venice Neighborhood
Council] meeting next month, but obviously Venice residents should not have to wait that
long.'
8 194. Although Chief Moore was aware of Major Crimes Division's earlier report of

10  resources of LAPD behind Mr. Bonin's narrative with this terse reply: "Christian - The 4 "no physical evidence of any direct threat" he again placed the credibility of himself and the

13 Soon thereafter, Joshua Rubinstein issued to the public the LAPD press release set forth above,

14
BJJyS|!M E8E8 15 195. The local NBC affiliate ran a television newscast a story that stated the devices as edited by Mr. Bonin himself.

17

The next day, at 3:31 p.m. on Saturday, January 4, 2020, Christopher Wrede, the devices were not explosive.
18 196.

19 concerned of the lack of information from LAPD, sent another email to Chief Moore:

20
"Dear Chief Moore: 21 I am writing because I still have not seen a statement from a the LAPD setting forth a 22
reliable account of what transpired at the site of the Bridge Home Venice project 23
yesterday. As to the nature of the devices in question, some media are reporting (with 24
attribution to the LAPD) that the devices were "small pipe bombs with carbon dioxide 25
canisters" that were intended to detonate, while other media are reporting (also with 26
attribution to the LAPD) that the devices merely "look[ed] like" explosives. 27

64 28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE .-..---

Needless to say, there is a world of difference (at least in the mind of concerned parents

2 with young children in school just a few blocks away) between actual explosives that
failed to detonate, on the one hand, and devices that just happen to look like explosives,
on the other, and it is hard to understand why (all these hours and news stories later) the
LAPD has failed to provide accurate, consistent information to Venice residents as to the

6 nature of the devices involved.

7 Similarly, we are getting mixed messages as to what may have been behind the

8 placement of the mystery devices. Most media are running with Councilman
9 Bonin's theory (which is also attributed to the LAPD in some reports) that the devices
10 whether or not explosive were placed to derail the Bridge Home Venice project and
11 target the homeless community, yet a Los Angeles a Magazine article dated January 3
Channel Law Group, d77 0gL BUNS "PALE BIIUSI!M E8€8 -LZ06 12 quotes Officer Bob Long of the LAPD Major Crimes Division as stating "We don't

8 13 believe it's related to the homeless shelter construction."

Beverly Hills, 14 If the LAPD does not, in fact, "believe" that the placement of the mystery devices was
15 "related to the homeless shelter construction," you should release a statement to that

16 effect immediately. In addition to casting a pall over our community, the stories adopting
17 Councilman Bonin's theory make express reference to the Venice Stakeholder
18 Association's (VSA) recent lawsuit challenging the Bridge Home Venice project --

19 obviously inviting unwarranted and injurious inferences as to the conduct and character
20 of the VSA and its members.

21 Similarly, if the LAPD is of the view that actual explosives were placed at the Bridge
22 Home Venice site in connection with an anti-homeless campaign of some sort, a
23 statement should be released to that effect. Virtually everyone in Venice lives within a
24 few blocks of a homeless encampment, shelter or housing project. They have a right to
25 know if they and their families are in danger."

17 suspects in the criminal investigation, midday on January 8, 2020, Ira Koslow, President of the
18 Neighborhood Council, forwarded the Sheila Harper email to Mr. Bonin and his staff and

19 observed:

20 "Dear Mike,

21 am forwarding this one email as a representative of the type of mail and publicity some

22 of our Board members are getting. The tone of your Facebook post as well as Matt

24 few Board members. The police are still investigating the bomb scare and have not

25 stated any people of interest, although Matt Fisher has stated there is video evidence

Respectfully submitted,

To Petitioner's knowledge, neither Mr. Bonin nor his staff responded, or ever clarified the issue.
7 Apparently, Mr. Bonin remained silent while his political surrogates demonized others in the
8 community, including Venice Vision and its leaders, including allowing such comments to reside
on his Facebook page. These words place people in danger, as well as their reputations.

® 202. On January 9, 2020, Christopher Wrede, followed up with Captain Embrich: ME7|euueYO Group, d17 LLZ06 A  AINE THALSIAA SOCO SIl!H Áuereg 12 "Dear Captain Embrich:
13 see that the LAPD website continues to state -- consistent with Councilmember Bonin's
14 news release, statements to the press and multiple social media posts -- that the
15 "suspicious devices" found in Venice over the New Year's holiday may relate to terror
16 activity targeting the Bridge Home Venice site (and, by implication, members of Venice's
17 homeless community).
18 As I have already conveyed to you and your colleagues, I find this hard to square with the
19 LAPD's statements on and around January 3 that the devices in question were most
20 definitely not explosive, that they were found in locations other than the Bridge Home
21 Venice site, and that they did not appear to be connected to the Bridge Home Venice
22 project.
23 Now, I hear reports that many of the devices in question are quite old and that they
24 appear to be C02 containers modified to release CO2 -- and spin around -- when dropped
25 from a sufficient height.
26 Can you provide any updates on your investigation? Also, can you tell me whether the

3 the devices in question are make-shift toys of some sort (albeit not "toys" of the sort any
parent would want their kids to come across).
Finally, per our prior exchange, I was wondering if a new Senior Lead Officer was
appointed for Venice yesterday as planned. If so, could you provide me with his or her
7 name and contact information? I won't be coy: I do not believe Councilman Bonin's
8 terror-theory and feel that the media coverage surrounding it has damaged Venice,

10 Bridge Home Venice project in court and elsewhere. If there is any possibility,

15 203. A few minutes later, Mr. Bonin, who was copied on this email, forwarded this
16 email to his staff but, as with each email sent to him by Mr. Wrede and others, Mr. Bonin
17 himself did not reply or undertake an affirmative act to correct the public record.
18 204. On February 12, 2020, in response to two unanswered inquiries from Mr. Wrede

19 7 dated February 7 and February 11, 2020, concerning the status of the LAPD investigation, Chief
20 Michel Moore, who obviously had moved on, asked his staff: "Horace. Let me know whatever
21 came of our investigation." He received an answer, but consistent with the LAPD's participation
22 in withholding the facts from Venice Vision and persons whose names have been smeared, the
23 answer from LAPD staff was redacted.

24 205. Based upon the particularized allegations set forth above, there existed an
25 "unacceptable probability of actual bias" of Councilmember Mike Bonin toward Venice Vision
26 as the land use appellant before the City Council hearing on the appeal, and toward property

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 owners, business owners and tenants who opposed the Reese Davison Project owed a fair

2 hearing under the constitution. The unacceptable probability existed because there was

3 substantial evidence supporting these conclusions:

4 Once he became aware of the police call to the Bridge Housing site, and without

5 waiting for the results of the police investigation, Los Angeles City Councilmember Mike Bonin (a)

6 issued a public statement drawing a link between the Bridge Housing project and the discovery
7 of three CO2 cartridges taped to pieces of wood/metal and perhaps a lag screw. Without any
8 reasonable factual basis or awaiting LAPD assessment of them, Mr. Bonin claimed these devices

9 were "bomb like". Mr. Bonin opined that if the placement of the devices on or near the Bridge
"intimidate" him it failed. In this action, Mr. Bonin sought to raise the
11 improper innuendo that opponents of his homeless housing policies were domestic terrorists who 10 Housing project was to

13 Councilmember's policy initiatives.
14 (b) Mr. Bonin used this public statement to try to portray himself as courageously BJJYSI!M E8E8 15 standing up to this act, undeterred. It was a political calculation to lionize himself over those
16 who would question the wisdom of his policy program.
(c) Mr. Bonin's Facebook page drew comments that accused members of the Venice
18 Neighborhood Council, including Venice Vision's leaders and members, as having placed these 17

19 bomb-like devices, yet Mr. Bonin never corrected or condemned these false accusations of
20 criminal conduct when they were specifically brought to his attention as damaging to the names

21 and reputations of community members he knew to be innocent.
22 (d) To bolster the credibility of his premature statements, Mr. Bonin enlisted or
pressured LAPD Chief Michel Moore to state it was an attack on the homeless Bridge Housing 23

2 Bridge Housing project to the CO2 cartridges, all when he had specific contrary information

3 from the Major Crimes Division detectives who investigated the facts.
(f) The Major Crimes Division investigation was complete within a short period of
5 time, however, Mr. Bonin and Chief Michel Moore continued to publicly state the investigation
6 was ongoing, refused to release unredacted public records that would show the pictures of the
7 devices Mr. Bonin called "bombs" and reveal the entire report and conclusions of the Major
8 Crimes Division investigation.

(g) Because of the failure of Mr. Bonin and Chief Moore to release accurate

10 information about the incident and its investigation, their silence in the face of third parties

14 tenants in public hearings involving issues, including the related Reece Davidson Project.
15 (h) Due to these actions and inactions of Mr. Bonin, as the Los Angeles City
16 Councilmember to whom his colleagues looked to for guidance whether or not to grant or deny
17 the quasi-judicial land use appeals of Venice Vision represented an unacceptable probability that
18 Mr. Bonin had and exercised continuing actual bias toward Venice Vision and its leaders such
19 that California law required his removal from the quasi-judicial decisionmaking process.
20 206. In a complaint filed with the Los Angeles City Council and the City Ethics
21 Commission, Venice Vision requested City officials to intervene and demand that Mr. Bonin
22 recuse himself or be removed by the City Council from hearing the quasi-judicial appeals
23 associated with the Reese Davidson Project. Such an order should issue on the basis of actions
24 Mr. Bonin took seeking to improperly divert taxpayer resources and credibility of the Los
25 Angeles Police Department ("LAPD") to issue and propagate a media narrative that falsely
26 assumed, implied, or asserted that opponents of his homelessness policies, including Venice

4 he has used his power as City Councilmember to prevent persons whose reputations have

5 been sullied by his actions to clear their names. In the words of one Venice community
activist reacting to Mr. Bonin's staff widely distributing his false narrative, such actions were
