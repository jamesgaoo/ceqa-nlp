- PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

INTRODUCTION

2 1. This action challenges the failure of the City of San Marcos, its Planning Division, and its

3 City Council, (collectively, "the City") to comply with the California Environmental Quality Act
4 ("CEQA") in approving the Diamond Street Industrial project, located at the intersection of Melrose
5 Drive and Diamond Street in San Marcos (*Project"). The Project is a tentative parcel map to

6 consolidate 13 existing industrial lots into 2 parcels (16.12-acre Parcel A & 6.77-acre Open Space Parcel
7 B) on a 22.89-acre property in the Light Industrial (L-I) Zone. The Project authorizes Lot A to be mass
8 graded for an industrial pad. However, the Project - and its environmental review - does not encompass
9 any post-grading development activities. Instead, the Project's Mitigated Negative Declaration
10 ("MND") states: "Any future development of an industrial building(s) on Lot A would be subject to Site
11 Development Plan review and additional CEQA review." As such, the City has impermissibly
12 "piecemealed" the Project in violation of CEQA, and has committed numerous other critical CEQA
13 violations as set forth in this Petition.
14 2. CEQA requires preparation of an environmental impact report ("EIR") - not a mere
15 MND - whenever substantial evidence of a fair argument exists that the Project will have a significant
16 impact on the environment. The Project authorizes mass grading of native habitat in a documented
17 wildlife corridor, with only speculative commitments to preserving the rest of the site and will have a
18 significant impact on biological resources. Although the City claims not to know the end use of the
19 Project, it pre-commits to an industrial building(s) by authorizing the mass grading of the hillside,
20 clearing of rare plant communities, and removing of habitat occupied by endangered species, including
21 the California gnatcatcher.
22 3. The Project would further result in significant environmental impacts that have not been
23 disclosed to the public or City decision makers, analyzed or mitigated. Thus, the City's reliance on an
24 MND to approve the Project violates CEQA.
25 4. The Project purports to allow only the construction of a 16-acre building pad, although a
26 mere building pad would serve no purpose. Despite the certainty that the building pad will become an
27 industrial facility, and likely up to a 221,000-square-foot warehouse, the City's MND subscribes to the
28 fiction that the Project is a mere building pad. Consequently, the MND fails to evaluate the
29 environmental impacts of either the construction or operation of the actual Project, in clear violation of
30 CEQA's longstanding prohibition on the piecemealing of environmental review.
31 5. This is particularly important because diesel trucks will be required for building pad
32 construction, building construction, and for the daily operation of any industrial or warehouse facilities.

2 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Diesel particulate matter is a known carcinogen. Warehouse or other industrial warehouse facilities may
2 generate thousands of diesel truck trips each day, according to the City's Transportation Impact Analysis
3l Guidelines. High diesel and other transportation-related emissions near industrial and warehouse
4 facilities have converted many neighborhoods into "diesel death zones" where residents experience
5 drastically elevated rates of respiratory and cardiovascular disease, ranging from asthma and COPD to
6 heart attacks. The health impacts of transportation-related pollution are especially prevalent in children
7 and the elderly. For this reason, the California Air Resources Board states that warehouses
8 accommodating more than 100 truck trips per day should be located no less than 1,000 feet from
9 residential neighborhoods. Yet this Project will be located within 200 feet of homes. The MND's
10 failure to analyze - or even to disclose to the public - the likely diesel emissions of Project operation
11 deprived the public of the opportunity to understand the Project's likely impact on the hundreds of
12 families living near the Project. Crucially, the failure to disclose the Project's operations in the MND
13 also prevented City decisionmakers from crafting alternatives, mitigation measures, and conditions of
14 approval designed to protect public health.
15 6. This piecemealed review also results in the City's failure to provide residents and City
16 decision makers with the information needed to evaluate the Diamond Street Industrial Project's true
17 impacts with regard to greenhouse gas emissions, traffic and transportation, noise, nighttime lighting and
18 glare, and other key environmental and livability concerns.
19 7. The City's failure to adequately disclose, analyze, and avoid or mitigate the
20 environmental impacts of mass grading an endangered species-occupied hillside to construct a likely
21 warehouse near homes violates CEQA and requires issuance of a Writ of Mandate.
22

23 JURISDICTION

24 8. This Court has jurisdiction over the writ action under section 1094.5 of the Code of Civil
25 Procedure and Public Resources Code section 21168.
26 9. This Court also has jurisdiction over the writ action under section 1085 of the Code of
27 Civil Procedure, and sections 21167, 21168.5 of the Public Resources Code.
28 10. This case is properly classified as an unlimited civil case, and therefore within the
29 jurisdiction of this Court, because it is not one of the types of cases listed as limited civil cases in
30 Code of Civil Procedure sections 86, 86.1 or 87.

STATEMENT OF FACTS
2 The Project Site.
21. The Diamond Street Industrial Project would be constructed on a 23-acre site located on
the north side of the intersection of Melrose Drive and Diamond Street in the Questhaven/La Costa
Meadows Neighborhood. The rocky, steep site is surrounded by open space and conserved habitat
areas to the north, northwest, and east; by residences and the La Costa Meadows Industrial Park to the
south across Melrose Drive; and by residential uses in the University Commons (Old Creek Ranch)
Specific Plan Area to the west. The site has historically been used for hiking, wildlife viewing, and
mountain biking.
10 22. Despite its light industrial zoning, the Project site is undeveloped and covered with native
11 vegetation, and it is home to a variety of native plant and animal species. In a 5-hour visit in June
12 2021, biologist Dr. Shawn Smallwood detected 49 vertebrate species onsite, 13 of which wildlife
13 agencies grant special status. These included federally threatened California gnatcatchers, as well as
14 other California species of special concern, including San Diegan tiger whiptail, olive-sided flycatcher,
15 and western red bat. Raptors, such as red-tailed hawks, Cooper's hawks, and kestrels foraged. He
16 considered the site "highly productive," with fledglings and chicks, territorial and breeding behavior,
17 and foraging. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife confirms California gnatcatcher
18 occupation of the Project site. The City, as well, recognizes the site's biological richness and its
19 importance to wildlife by delineating a wildlife corridor in the City's General Plan.
20 23. The site contains mulefat scrub, coastal sage-chaparral transition, Diegan coastal sage
21 scrub, and other increasingly rare native plant communities. Due to the site's biological richness and
22 its importance to wildlife in the area, the City's General Plan recognizes a wildlife corridor along the
23 site.

24 24. Residential uses adjoin the Project site to the south and to the west. Homes on the bluff
25 look across the Project site, while homes located across Melrose Drive occur immediately below the
26 site near its proposed road access. The closest homes sit 200 feet from the Project site.
27 The Project and Administrative Process.
28 25. On November 17, 1986, the City Planning Commission approved a Tentative Subdivision
29 Map (TSM 292) which contained 13 industrial lots on the site. The lots range from one-half to four
30 acres in size. Final Map 12781 was recorded in 1991.
31 26. In April 2020, Real Parties in Interest submitted an application to the City for a Tentative
32 Parcel Map (TPM20-001) to consolidate 13 industrial lots into two parcels, a 16-acre Parcel A and a 7- a

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 acre Parcel B.

27. The Project would entail mass grading of Parcel A "for a building pad including retaining

3 walls, slope landscaping, and an access road from Melrose Drive." The mass grading operations for the
mountainous site will be extensive. The MND states the Project grading activities will take
approximately 6 months. The Project will grade approximately 359,670 cubic yards (cy) of earth
material (122,750 cy of cut and 236,920 cy of fill) and will import 144,170 cy of material. The MND
discloses that there will be approximately 60 heavy diesel dirt hauling truck trips per day during the six
months of grading operations. However, expert consultants, SWAPE, found that the MND

9 significantly underestimated the number of dirt hauling truck trips. The Project is actually expected to
10 cause approximately 81 diesel dirt hauling truck trips per day during the six months of grading. The
11 City conceded that SWAPE "indicates correctly the number of trips," yet the City failed to update

12 the body of the MND with the accurate information, which is a failure to meet CEQA's disclosure
13 obligations. (TPM20-0001, Staff Report Attachment J, Response to Appeal Letter #1, Comment 5.)
14 28. While the site would be mass graded for the construction of a building, the City maintains

15 "an industrial building(s) is not proposed as part of this project." Even so, allowable uses "can range
16 from office to manufacturing to warchousing allowed by right." (See October 26, 2021 Staff Report.)
17 The City allows a building height of 60 feet. Parcel B would be left as open space.

18 29. On May 3, 2021, the City released a Mitigated Negative Declaration (ND21-002) for the
19 Project that purported to analyze the Project's impacts under CEQA. Despite the fact that the Project
20 would require extensive grading on a steep hill, in an area of documented California gnatcatcher
21 occurrence, and despite the Project site's close proximity to homes above and below the site, the MND
22 concluded that there was no substantial evidence of a fair argument that a significant environmental
23 impact could occur. Notably, the MND defined the Project as a building pad and did not include the
24 building or buildings that would be constructed on the building pad. Thus, the MND omitted any
25 disclosure, analysis, or mitigation of the potential environmental impacts of the construction or
26 operation of the Project.
27 30. Petitioner's members and other interested persons made oral and written comments on

28 the Project and raised each of the legal deficiencies asserted in this Petition.
29 31. The comment period for the MND ran from May 3 to June 2, 2021. Members of
30 Diamond Street Neighbors submitted comments to the City on May 25, 2021 and on June 2, 2021.
31 Additional comments critical of the Project and its environmental review were submitted by the
32 California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW), Supporters Alliance for Environmental

8 (VIOLATION OF CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT)

9 45.

10 46. Petitioner incorporates all previous paragraphs as if fully set forth.

11 CEQA prohibits a lead agency from approving a project that may have a significant

12 impact on the environment without first preparing, considering, and certifying an EIR. The City

13 violated CEQA by adopting an MND for the Project, despite substantial evidence supporting a fair

14 argument that the project may have a significant impact on the environment.
47. The purpose of the initial study is to provide the lead agency with adequate information
15 regarding a project to determine the appropriate environmental review document and "documentation
16

17 of the factual basis for the finding in a negative declaration that project will not have a significant

18 effect on the environment." (Ctr. For Sierra Nevada Conservation v. County of El Dorado (2012) 202
Cal. App. 4th 1156, 1170, citations omitted.) There must be
19 basis within the record to support the

20 conclusions reached by the initial study. (Lighthouse Field Beach Rescue v. City of Santa Cruz (2005)

21 131 Cal.App.4th 1170, 1201.) "Where an agency. . . fails to gather information and undertake an

22 adequate environmental analysis in its initial study, a negative declaration is inappropriate." (El

23 Dorado County Taxpayers for Quality Growth v. County of El Dorado (2004) 122 Cal. App. 4th 1591,
1597, citations omitted.)

24 48.

25 There is substantial evidence in the record to support a fair argument that the Project may

26 have significant project level and cumulative adverse effects on the environment, including, but not

27 limited to, biological resources, air quality and human health, land use and planning, greenhouse gas
emissions, noise, traffic, aesthetics, and recreation.
28 a. The Project's Environmental Review is Impermissibly Piecemealed.
29 49.

30 CEQA requires environmental review to evaluate the "whole of a project" and not simply

31 its constituent parts when determining whether it will have a significant environmental effect. (CEQA

32 Guidelines ยง 15003(h).) The purpose is So that, "environmental considerations do not become
submerged by chopping a large project into many little ones -- each with a minimal potential impact on

8 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

the environment -- which cumulatively may have disastrous consequences." (Bozung v. Local Agency
Formation Commission (1975) 13 Cal.3d 263, 283-284.)
3 50. In lieu of evaluating the full Project, the MND merely evaluates the construction of a
4 "building pad," the preparation of the Project site for the construction of a building or buildings. While
environmentally destructive in its own right, this building pad would have no independent utility and is
admittedly not the planned use of the site.
51. In claiming that the Project is merely a building pad, the MND purports to analyze the
8 Ienvironmental impacts of clearing and grading the site, but it fails to account for the construction of the
building or buildings or for the operational impacts of the building or buildings. Thus, the Project is
10 chopped into multiple smaller projects, in violation of CEQA.
11 52. Moreover, the building's construction will require the use of diesel trucks and
12 earthmoving equipment and will generate air emissions, noise and ground vibrations. These impacts
13 are not disclosed, analyzed, or mitigated in the MND.
14 53. The building's operations will have impacts related to air quality, noise, nighttime
15 lighting, transportation and traffic, and greenhouse gas emissions. None of these impacts are analyzed
16 or mitigated in the MND.
17 54. The City claims that any analysis would be speculative given that it has not determined
18 the exact use of the building pad; however, the City allows the by-right development of industrial
19 facilities, including warehouses, on the site. Thus, the development of the site as a warehouse or other
20 industrial use is not speculative, but reasonably foreseeable. An EIR must analyze reasonably
21 foreseeable effects of future phases of the project under review. (Laurel Heights Improvement
22| Association v. Regents of the University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d at 376, 396.)
23 55. Additionally, the Project site has been advertised as a 221,000 square foot warehouse.
24 Warehouses of that size generate thousands of diesel truck trips per year, with significant air quality,
25 health, noise, and lighting impacts that have not been disclosed, analyzed, or mitigated in this MND.
26 56. Although the City claims that future development of an industrial building on the site will
27 require a site development plan and environmental review, the City is also clear that industrial uses
28 such as warehouses are permitted "by right" and may not require substantive future environmental
29 review.

30 57. Thus, the MND has impermissibly piecemealed the construction of the building pad from
31 the construction and operation of the building that will be placed on the building pad. In addition, the
32 MND fails to adequately assess the Project's cumulative impacts by failing to provide required analysis

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 9

1 of the environmental impacts of all reasonably foreseeable development and operations. The MND

2 states that "since no development is proposed, there would be no long-term operational considerations
3 that could contribute to a cumulative impact." This violates CEQA's prohibition on piecemealing and
4 requires issuance of a Writ of Mandate.

5 58. The piecemealing of Project review further results in impermissible deferral of required

6 environmental analysis and mitigation to speculative future CEQA reviews. As the City provides for
7 by-right approval of uses including warehouses, subject only to site plan, it is unclear if future

8 environmental review would require analysis and adequate, concrete mitigation.

9 b. The City has Unlawfully Pre-committed to Industrial Development.
10 59. CEQA requires a lead agency to complete the environmental review of a project before
11 foreclosing alternatives and committing to a course of action. (Save Tara V. City of West Hollywood
12 (2008) 45 Cal.4th 116, 121-22.) Yet the City's approval of a building pad commits the City to mass
13 grading the Project site and removal of important biological resources, despite the City's claim that it
14 does not yet know what will be built on the Project site.
15 60. The City claims that it is common practice to construct a building pad before the
16 completion of environmental review for a project. However, "[t]he CEQA process is intended to be a
17 careful examination, fully open to the public, of the environmental consequences of a given project,
18 covering the entire project, from start to finish. This examination is intended is to provide the fullest
19 information reasonably available upon which the decision makers and the public they serve can rely in
20 determining whether or not to start the project at all, not merely to decide whether to finish it. The EIR
21 is intended to furnish both the road map and the environmental price tag for a project, so that the
22 decision maker and the public both know, before the journey begins, just where the journey will lead,
23 and how much they-and the environment-will have to give up in order to take that journey." (NRDC v.
24 City of Los Angeles (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 268, 271.) Under the City's process, the decision maker
25 has voted to give up occupied gnatcatcher habitat and rare native plant communities before even
26 knowing where the journey will lead.
27 61. This precommitment prior to the completion of CEQA review for whatever will be built
28 and operated on the building pad violates CEQA. Meaningful environmental review requires studying
29 the whole of the project. The environmental review and approval must wait until late enough in the
30 planning process so there is meaningful environmental information for environmental assessment.
31 (CEQA Guideline, ยง15004(b).)

c. Biological Resources Impacts.
62. The Project site is biologically productive, hosting both rare plant communities and at
3 least 13 California species of special concern, including the California gnatcatcher, which is listed as
4 "threatened" under the Federal Endangered Species Act.

5 63. The MND fails to adequately disclose the Project site's biological resource baseline,
6 resulting in its understatement of the environmental impacts of mass grading the site. For example,
7 during Dr. Smallwood's 5-hour visit to the site, he identified 13 species of special concern and 49
8 species in total. The MND's biological resources analysis identified 16 total species and none of the
species of special concern observed by Dr. Smallwood. Tellingly, the MND's biological resources
10 analysis also failed to detect loud, vibrant, or otherwise conspicuous species.
11 64. The MND's analysis, consequently, failed to disclose, analyze, or mitigate the Project's
12 impacts to these 13 special status species, depriving the public and decisionmakers of vital information.
13 65. The MND's analysis further failed to analyze the Project's deprivation of habitat to the
14 49 vertebrate species located onsite. Bird abundance has declined nearly 30 percent across the United
15 States in the last half-century due to habitat loss. Based on observed site productivity in June 2021, Dr.
16 Smallwood estimates that the Project site has a capacity of 785 bird nest sites. Further, Dr. Smallwood
17 estimates that the Project would eliminate the reproductive capacity of the site, resulting in a loss of
18 259,100 birds to the California in the first century after building pad construction. An EIR is required
19 to analyze this significant impact on biological resources.
20 66. The Project site provides a wildlife linkage that has become more important as
21 development and habitat loss accelerate in Southern California. Claiming, arbitrarily, that only the
22 northern portion of the site is a wildlife corridor, the MND fails to analyze or mitigate impacts to
23 wildlife movement across the site that would be caused by the construction of a 16-acre building pad
24 and the later operation of an industrial facility. An EIR is required.
25 67. Despite the loss of 89 million to 340 million birds per year, nationwide, due to traffic
26 collisions, the MND fails to disclose, analyze, or mitigate the Project's traffic-related impact on birds.
27 The MND similarly fails to disclose, analyze, or mitigate the potential traffic impacts on other wildlife.
28 68. The MND fails to disclose, analyze, or mitigate the Project's (building) construction or
29 operational impacts on wildlife. Wildlife traffic fatalities attributable to warehouse operations onsite
30 could reach 110,700 wildlife fatalities over 50 years.
31 69. The MND's biological resources analysis was inadequate, deprived the City of informed
32 decision making, and must be repeated in an EIR.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 11

1 70. The Project's mitigation for impacts to biological resources is vague, speculative, and
2 deferred, preventing full mitigation of impacts and substantial evidence for conclusions that the
3 Project's impacts will be less than significant. Other mitigation measures lack substantial evidence for

4 conclusions that they will actually avoid or reduce impacts to biological resources below a level of

5 significance. An EIR is required.

6 71. The MND failed to analyze the Project's cumulative impacts on biological resources,

7 which are significant, given the failure to analyze the Project's building construction and operation
8 phases, as well as the acceleration of habitat loss in Southern California.

9 72. Thus, a fair argument exists that the Project will have a significant impact on rare plant
10 communities, on sensitive wildlife species, and on a wildlife corridor. An EIR is required.
11 d. Air Quality Impacts.

12 73. CEQA requires a lead agency to "use its best efforts to find out and disclose all that it
13 reasonably can." (Guidelines ยง 15144.)
14 74. However, based on the fiction that the Project's industrial use is unknown, the MND
15 declined to analyze the air quality impacts related to the construction or operation of the Project, in
16 violation of CEQA.

17 75. For these same reasons, the MND defers any analysis of health impacts to wholly

18 speculative future environmental review process. A screening-level analysis of the Project's Health
19 Risk Analysis performed by expert consultants, SWAPE, found that the Project would have excess
20 lifetime cancer risk far in excess of the San Diego Air Pollution Control District's threshold of 10 in
21 one million. An EIR is required to analyze this significant adverse health impact.
22 76. The MND also contains air quality deficiencies including, but not limited to:
23 77. The MND also assumes that impacts of diesel construction equipment will be mitigated

24 or avoided because the Conditions of Approval will require Tier IV equipment. However, as this
25 condition does not appear in the final Project approval, the MND's conclusions lack substantial
26 evidence. An EIR is required to disclose, analyze, and actually mitigate the environmental and health
27 impacts of the use of diesel construction equipment.
28 78. The Project's air quality impacts would also cause a significant land use and planning
29 impact due to a conflict with a land use plan, policy, or regulation adopted for the purpose of avoiding
30 or mitigating an environmental effect. Although the California Air Resources Board states that
31 warehouses should not be located within 1,000 feet of residential neighborhoods to prevent adverse
32 health impacts, the City declined to adopt a condition of approval prohibiting the otherwise by-right

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
12

P development of a warehouse. The MND also failed to disclose, analyze, or mitigate the health and air
2 quality impacts of constructing and operating a warehouse within 200 feet of homes.

3 79. The MND underestimated the Project's construction and operational emissions by using
4 input information in the California Emissions Estimator Model (*CalEEMod") that was inconsistent
5 with the Project's description in the MND. For example, the MND's air quality analysis
6 underestimated the number of hauling truck trips and applied emissions reductions for Tier IV diesel
7 equipment that were not justified by the Project's mitigation and Conditions of Approval.
8 80. Expert consultants, SWAPE, ran the CalEEMod model using site-specific information
9 and parameters that were consistent with the Project description in the MND. Based on the entire
10 potential industrial development, SWAPE estimated that the Project would have significant air quality
11 impacts - such as those related to volatile organic compounds - that were not disclosed, analyzed, or
12 mitigate in the MND. An EIR is required.
13 e. Greenhouse Gas Impacts.
14 81. Similarly, the MND failed to disclose, analyze, or mitigate the Project's greenhouse gas
15 emissions as related to its construction or operation. The building pad is being constructed for the
16 express purpose of enabling the construction and operation of an industrial facility; accordingly, the
17 MND's omission of analysis of the greenhouse gas impacts of the construction and operational phases
18 of the Project violates CEQA. An EIR is required.
19 82. SWAPE's expert review of the MND concluded that it underestimated the Project's
20 annual greenhouse gas emissions, in part because it input incorrect and unsubstantiated values into the
21 model used for calculating greenhouse gas emissions.
22 83. SWAPE conducted its own screening-level greenhouse gas emissions assessment of the
23 industrial Project using the CalEEMod model. SWAPE determined that the Project's potential net
24 greenhouse gas emissions exceeded the City's Climate Action Plan threshold of 500 metric tons of
25 carbon dioxide equivalent - by a factor of five. This is substantial evidence of a fair argument that the
26 Project will have significant greenhouse gas impacts. An EIR is required.
27 84. The MND also failed to incorporate feasible and concrete mitigation for the Project's
28 likely greenhouse gas emissions, including, but not limited to zero-emission off-road construction

29 equipment, binding requirements to use Tier IV diesel construction equipment, electrical hookups to
30 the grid in lieu of diesel generators, solar photovoltaic systems, CalGreen Tier 2 green building
31 standards, and others.
32

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 13

f. Aesthetic Impacts.

2 85. It is well settled that "[a] project that interferes with scenic views has an adverse aesthetic
effect on the environment." (Bowman v. City of Berkeley (2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 572, 586.)

4 86. The Project's 16-acre building pad will enable the by-right construction of an industrial
facility up to 60 feet high.

6 87. Even so, the MND fails to analyze the Project's significant impacts on public views,

7 scenic vistas, and scenic resources. While private views are not protected, public views of vistas and
8 scenic resources are is protected. An EIR is required to analyze the Project's likely significant views

9 from the streets, trails, and sidewalks above.
10 g. Noise Impacts.
11 88. Homes surrounding the Project site already experience high levels of community noise.

12 Despite this, the City failed to establish a baseline of community noise before determining in the MND
13 that the Project would not cause significant impacts. Even incremental noise increases are
14 environmentally significant when baseline noise levels are high. (Los Angeles Unified School Dist. V.

15 City of Los Angeles (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1019, 1026.)
16 89. The City and MND recognize that the Project site adjoins two residential neighborhoods,
17 with homes located a mere 200 feet away. While the MND purports to disclose the temporary noise
18 impacts of building pad construction, it fails to assess the impacts of the site's topography on how the
19 noise of grading activities will affect nearby homes. The MND also ignores the impulsive nature of
20 heavy truck trips and construction, assuming that if noise levels are averaged over a whole day, there

21 will be no impact. This is not how people experience noise.
22 90. The MND also admittedly declines to analyze the noise impacts of Project building
23 construction or the permanent noise impacts of long-term operations. While the City may not know the
24 exact specification of the industrial use that will occur onsite, the City permits, by-right, the
25 construction and operation of industrial facilities including warehouses on the site. Such uses are
26 reasonably foreseeable and should have formed the basis of the site's environmental review.
27 91. The construction of a 16-acre industrial facility near homes will likely have significant
28 noise and vibration impacts that require analysis in an EIR. The long-term operation of a 16-acre
29 industrial facility, such as a by-right allowed warehouse, will certainly have significant noise impacts
30 that require disclosure, analysis, and mitigation in an EIR. Warehouses typically operate 24 hours per

31 day.
32 92. The MND fails to analyze the noise and vibration impacts of operation of an industrial or

14 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

warehouse facility, including the traffic noise generated by up to thousands of diesel truck trips per day,
2 in addition to idling, reversing, and other noise emissions. An EIR is required to disclose, analyze, and
3 mitigate this significant environmental impact.

4 93. The City's failure to analyze the permanent noise impacts of the Project results in its
5 failure to consider and adopt feasible mitigation measures, such as insulation of impacted residences
and businesses, sound walls, retrofitting of doors and windows, funding and installation of ventilation
7 systems, and the funding and installation of weather stripping and caulking for impacted residences and
8 businesses.

9 h. Recreation Impacts.
10 94. The Project would have a significant effect on the environment because it would reduce
11 available recreation activities. The Project site currently contains a dirt road and pedestrian trails that
12 are used by hikers and mountain bikers, In addition, the Project will intersect a dirt path along the
13 north side of Melrose Drive with a 40-foot-wide industrial driveway. The Project's removal of these
14 facilities presents a significant impact on recreation that must be analyzed in an EIR.
15 i. Traffic and Circulation Impacts.
16 95. The Project will have a significant effect on the environment by increasing traffic and
17 impeding transportation. As with many of the Project's other environmental impacts, the MND fails to
18 analyze the Project's traffic and circulation impacts as related to actual construction or operation, even
19 though industrial facilities such as warehouses are permitted "by right."
20 96. According to the City's Transportation Impact Analysis Guidelines, industrial
21 warehousing uses are expected to generate 5 trips per 1000 square feet or 60 trips per acre. The site is
22 marketed for an up to 221,000 square foot industrial warehouse "coming soon" on the 16.12-acre
23 Parcel A. Based on the square footage and acreage, it is thus foreseeable that a warehouse on the site
24 would generate about 1,036 vehicle trips (1,105 trips based on square footage and 967 trips based on
25 acreage). Industrial/business park industrial uses (as opposed to warehousing) generate 16 trips per
26 1000 square feet or 200 trips per acre, which would mean the project would generate about 3,380
27 vehicle trips under this scenario, according to the City's own planning documents.
28 97. The highly likely imposition of hundreds - or thousands - of diesel truck trips per day on
29 local roads requires, and the significant increase in vehicle miles travelled (VMT) attributable to the
30 site requires, analysis and mitigation in an EIR. The EIR for the industrial use must be prepared before
31 the City pre-commits itself to this path by approving the site grading for the industrial use.
32 98. The MND also declines to adequately disclose and analyze the Project's impacts on

15 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 adjacent bicycle and pedestrian facilities that will be bisected by the Project. According to the City's
2 Transportation Impact Analysis Guidelines: "A proposed project will result in a significant impact if it
3 will conflict with or impact existing or proposed public transit, bicycle, or pedestrian facilities, or
4 otherwise decrease the performance or safety of such facilities." There is an existing Class I Bikeway

5 (Bike Path) on Melrose Drive adjacent to the Project site. A Class I Bikeway is bike path within an

6 exclusive right-of-way physically separated from vehicular roadway and intended specifically for non-
7 motoring use. The Project will bisect this Bike Path with a 40-foot-wide industrial driveway, forcing

8 bicyclists and pedestrians to compete with heavy diesel trucks to continue their use of the facility. The

9 Project will decrease the performance and safety of the Bike Path, as well as Melrose Drive for road
10| bicyclists. These significant circulation impacts require consideration in an EIR.
11

12 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

13 WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for relief as follows:
14 1. For a peremptory writ of mandate ordering the City of San Marcos to:
15 A. To set aside the Project Entitlements, including the tentative parcel map (TPM20-
16 0001), Resolution No. 2021-8941, and the MND (ND21-002);
17 B. To suspend any and all activities pursuant to the challenged decisions, determinations,
18 and approvals that could result in an adverse change or alteration to the physical
19 environment until the City of San Marcos has taken all actions necessary to bring the
20 Project's environmental review, decisions, and determinations into full compliance with
21 CEQA;
22 C. To prepare, circulate, review and certify a legally adequate EIR for the Project so that
23 the City will have a complete disclosure document before it, the potential significant
24 impacts of the Project will be identified for the decision-makers and public, and the City
25 will be able to formulate realistic and feasible alternatives and mitigation measures to
26 avoid those impacts;
27 D. To take such further specific action as shall be necessary to bring their decisions,
28 determinations, and approvals into full compliance with CEQA.
29 2. For an order enjoining Respondent and Real Parties in Interest from taking any action to
30 construct any portion of the Project or to develop or alter the Project site in any way that could
31 result in a significant adverse impact on the environment unless and until a lawful approval is
32 obtained from Respondent after the preparation and consideration of an adequate EIR and

16 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

adoption of all feasible alternatives and mitigation measures;
2 3. For costs of the suit;

3 4. For reasonable attorneys ' fees; and

4 5. For such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

Re: Challenge under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) to
City of San Marcos' approval of the Diamond Street Industrial Project

Dear Mr. Scollick,

Please take notice that Diamond Street Neighbors plan to file a Petition for a Writ of
Mandate challenging the City of San Marcos' approval of the Diamond Street Industrial
Project, which will be located at the intersection of Melrose Drive and Diamond Street.
The project is a tentative parcel map that authorizes mass grading of a hillside inhabited by rare plants and species. As the site will ultimately be developed for industrial uses, in close proximity to existing homes, petitioners believe the City improperly piecemealed the environmental review of the Project and relied on an MND instead of an EIR in violation
of CEQA.

Sincerely,
m Michelle Black
