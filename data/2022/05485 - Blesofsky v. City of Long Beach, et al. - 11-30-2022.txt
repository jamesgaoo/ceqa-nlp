PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

-

2 Petition for Writ of Mandate

3

4 Petitioner, WARREN BLESOFSKY ("Petitioner"), alleges through this Verified Petition for
Writ of Mandate ("Petition"), as follows:

5 1. Petitioner challenges the sale by Respondent CITY OF LONG BEACH (City") of the

6 property commonly known as 1720 Termino Avenue from the City to Real Party MWN

7

8 COMMUNITY HOSPITAL, LLC ("MWN") ("Transfer"). Petitioner further challenges the City's
determination that the Transfer was Categorically Exempt from the California Environmental Quality

9

10 Act ("CEQA") pursuant to CEQA Guidelines Section 15312 ("Class 12 Categorical Exemption" or
"Categorical Exemption").

11

12 2. Petitioner requests that this Court vacate, set aside, rescind and void the Transfer because

13 Respondent failed to comply with the provisions set forth under CEQA, exceeded the scope of the
Categorical Exemption, and therefore failed to proceed in a manner required by law.

14

15 3. Petitioner seeks a Peremptory Writ of Mandate under Code of Civil Procedure sections
1085 and 1094.5, directing Respondent to vacate, rescind and set aside the Transfer and the

16 environmental determination because Respondent failed to comply with CEQA.

17

18 PARTIES

19

20 4. Petitioner BLESOFSKY is an individual and a resident of the City who is concerned about

21 environmental protection, public health, public corruption and lawful governance in the City.

22 Petitioner has a direct and substantial beneficial interest in ensuring that Respondent complies with

23 laws relating to environmental protection. Petitioner is adversely affected by Respondent's failure to

24 comply with CEQA in approving the Transfer. Petitioner has standing to assert the claims raised in

25 this Petition because Petitioner's environmental interests are directly and adversely affected by
Respondent's approval of the Transfer.

26

27

28 Pub. Resources Code, § 21000, et seq.
2
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 5. Respondent, CITY OF LONG BEACH, is a charter city incorporated under the laws of the

2 State of California. The City is the lead agency under CEQA.

3 6. Petitioner is informed and believes and based thereon alleges that Real Party in Interest

4 MWN COMMUNITY HOSPITAL, LLC ("MWN') is a Limited Liability Company organized in

5 California that is the legal owner of the property subject to the challenged Transfer.

6 7. Petitioner is ignorant of the true names and capacities of Real Parties sued herein as ROES

7 1-25, inclusive, and therefore sues these Real Parties by fictitious names. Petitioner will amend this

8 Petition to allege the true names and capacities of fictitiously named Real Parties in Interest.

9 Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that each Respondent designated herein as a

10 ROE has some responsibility for the events and happenings alleged in this Petition.

11 8. Petitioner and other interested persons made oral and written comments on the Transfer and

12 raised the legal deficiencies asserted in this Petition.

13
JURISDICTION AND VENUE
14

15 9. This Court has jurisdiction over the writ action under Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085

16 and 1094.5, and Public Resources Code sections 21168 and 21168.5. Venue for this action properly

17 lies in the Los Angeles Superior Court because Respondent and the property subject to the Transfer

18 are located in Los Angeles County.

19 TRANSFER BACKGROUND, ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW AND
20 APPROVAL

21 10. The Petition challenges the transfer of an 8.7-acre parcel commonly known as 1720

22 Termino Avenue, 1760 Termino Avenue and 4111 Wilton Street in the City of Long Beach with

23 associated Assessor Parcel Numbers 7253-016-901, 7253-016-902, 7253-017-900 and portions of

24 7253-016-900, 7253-017-900, 7253-016-901 and 7253-016-902 ("Property").

25 11. The Property is improved with a hospital equipped with an emergency department, 158

26 beds and acute care facilities previously known as the Long Beach Community Hospital Medical

27 Center ("Community Hospital").

28

3
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

•

1 12. Prior to the Transfer, the Property was owned by the City, which leased it to various

2 operators over the years for the operation of an acute care hospital.

3 13. In 2018, Long Beach Memorial Medical Center, a California nonprofit corporation and the

4 previous operator of Community Hospital, shut down the hospital. The City entered into a Transition

5 Agreement with Long Beach Memorial Medical Center to continue operating outpatient clinic

6 facilities including pediatric outpatient clinics and rehabilitation facilities. The City also entered into

7 an exclusive negotiating agreement with MWN to provide for the operation of an acute care hospital
with emergency and urgent care services and certain other medical office buildings. 8

9 14. The Transition Agreement provided the operator the option of purchasing the property,

10 purportedly at fair market value, while subtracting losses from operating expenses from the purchase

11 price. The City agreed to a fair market value of $17.71 million dollars while MWN claimed operating

12 losses of $26.65 million dollars, resulting in MWN obtaining the property for a price of $0.

13 15. On or about February 15, 2022, the City authorized an amendment to the covenants

14 restricting uses of the Property to prohibit acute care services and to permit various "wellness

15 campus" uses including behavioral health services, recuperative care, social services, education,

16 government offices, housing, and specialized services.

17 16. On or about October 4, 2022, the City Council of the City of Long Beach declared the

18 Property as surplus, authorized the City Manager to execute a purchase and sale agreement with

19 MWN and determined that the Transfer was exempt from CEQA. The City determined the transfer

20 was categorically exempt from CEQA pursuant to CEQA Guidelines Section 15312 which exempts

21 the sale of surplus government property.

22 17. On or about October 18, 2022, the City executed a grant deed transferring the Property to

23 MWN.

24 CEOA'S SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS
25 ....

26 18. In 1970, the California Legislature enacted CEQA, a as a means of forcing public agency

27 decision makers, such as Respondent, to document and consider the environmental implications of its
. -.... .. 28 actions. CEQA's fundamental goal is to fully inform the public and the decision makers as to the

4
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 environmental consequences of proposed projects and to assure members of the public that their

2 elected officials are making informed decisions. CEQA requires governmental authorities, such as

3 Respondent, to fully evaluate potential environmental effects of projects, and to seek feasible means

4 to reduce or avoid significant environmental damage that otherwise could result from their actions.

5 19. CEQA limits agencies from approving projects with significant adverse impacts when

6 feasible alternatives can substantially lessen such impacts. CEQA is California's broadest

7 environmental law and helps to guide public agencies such as the City during issuance of permits and

8 approval of projects. Courts have interpreted CEQA to afford the fullest protection of the environment

9 within the reasonable scope of the statutes. CEQA applies to all discretionary projects proposed to be

10 conducted or approved by a City, including private projects requiring discretionary government

11 approval. See Pub. Resources Code, 8§ 21000 - 21178, and Title 14 Cal. Code Regs., section 753.

12 20. A strong presumption in favor of requiring preparation of an Environmental Impact Report

13 ("EIR") is built into CEQA which is is reflected in what is known as the "fair argument" standard, under

14 which an agency must prepare an EIR whenever substantial evidence in the record supports a fair
15 argument that a project may have a significant effect on the environment. No Oil, Inc. V. City of Los

16 Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 75, 82; Friends of "B" St. V. City of Haywood (1980) 106 Cal.App.3d

17 988, 1002.

18 21. "The EIR is the primary means of achieving the Legislature's considered declaration that it

19 1S the policy of this state to 'take all action necessary to protect, rehabilitate, and enhance the

20 environmental quality of the state.' [Citation. ] The EIR is therefore 'the heart of CEQA.' [Citations.]

21 An EIR is an 'environmental "alarm bell" whose purpose it is to alert the public and its responsible

22 officials to environmental changes before they have reached ecological points of no return.333 Laurel

23 Heights Improvement Assn. v. Regents of Univ. of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 392.

24 22. Under CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines, if a project is not exempt and may cause a

25 significant effect on the environment, the agency must prepare an EIR. Pub. Resources Code,

26 §§ 21100; 14 Cal. Code Regs. §15064(a)(1), (f)(1). "Significant effect upon the environment" is

27 defined as "a substantial or potentially substantial adverse change in the environment." Pub.

28 Resources Code, § 21068; 14 Cal. Code Regs., § 15382. A project "may" have a significant effect on

5
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 the environment if there is a "reasonable probability" that it will result in a significant impact. No Oil,

2 Inc. v. City of Los Angeles, supra, 13 Cal.3d at 83 n.16; Sundstrom V. Cnty. of Mendocino (1988) 202

3 Cal.App.3d 296, 309. This standard sets a "low threshold" for preparation of an EIR. Pocket

4 Protectors v. City of Sacramento (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 903, 928; Bowman V. City of Berkeley

5 (2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 572, 580; Citizen Action to Serve All Students v. Thornley (1990) 222

6 Cal.App.3d 748, 754; Sundstrom V. Cnty. of Mendocino, supra, at p. 310.

7 23. CEQA requires that an agency properly conduct environmental review for a project,

8 defined as the "whole of an action, which has a potential for resulting in either a direct physical

9 change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment[.1

10 14 Cal. Code Regs., § 15378.

11 VIOLATION OF CEOA

12 Abuse of Discretion; CCP §§ 1085, 1094.5
13

14 24. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in their

15 entirety, as though fully set forth herein.

16 25. The City erred in determining that the Transfer was exempt from CEQA pursuant to

17 Guidelines § 15312 because it exceeds the scope of the Categorical Exemption. As stated in

18 Guidelines $ 15312, the Categorical Exemption applies only to "sales of surplus government

19 property" (emphasis added):

20 Class 12 consists of sales of surplus government property except for parcels of land
21 located in an area of statewide, regional, or areawide concern identified in Section 15206(b)(4). However, even if the surplus property to be sold is located in
22 areas, its sale is exempt if: any of those

23 (a) The property does not have significant values for wildlife habitat or other environmental purposes, and
24 (b) Any of the following conditions exist:
25 (1) The property is of such size, shape, or inaccessibility that it is incapable of
26 independent development or use; or

27 (2) The property to be sold would qualify for an exemption under any other class of categorical exemption in these guidelines; or
28

6
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

(3) The use of the property and adjacent property has not changed since the time of
2 purchase by the public agency.

3 26. The Transfer exceeded the scope of the Categorical Exemption because it provided for

4 changes in the use of the including the permanent winding down of all hospital and medical services

5 at the Community Hospital and re-use of the Community Hospital for a "wellness campus" including

6 uses other than an acute care hospital.

7 27. The City improperly segmented environmental review of the Transfer and change of use
by approving the covenant amendments separately from the Transfer in order to exempt them from

9 CEQA review as required by law.

10 28. The City erred in determining that the Transfer was exempt from CEQA pursuant to

11 Guidelines 15312 because the Transfer exceeds the narrow scope of the Categorical Exemption as it

12 consists of both a sale of surplus government property and the change of use of said property.

13 29. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondent prejudicially abused its discretion by

14 failing to proceed in the manner required by law. Accordingly, Respondent's actions must be set aside.

15 NOTICE OF COMMENCEMENT OF CEQA PROCEEDING
16

17 30. On November 18, 2022 prior to filing this Petition, Petitioner, through its counsel, served

18 the City with notice of Petitioner's intention to immediately commence a proceeding against

19 Respondents for violation of CEQA in connection with the Project. A copy of the letter providing

20 such notice is attached to this Petition as Exhibit A and is incorporated herein by this reference. This

21 letter satisfied Petitioner's duties under Public Resources Code section 21167.5.

22 31. On November 18, 2022 Petitioner, through its counsel, served the California Attorney

23 General with notice of the commencement of this lawsuit, together with a true and correct copy of this a

24 Petition. A copy of such notices (without the petition attached to such notices) are attached to this

25 Petition as Exhibit B and are incorporated herein by this reference. Such notice satisfies Petitioner's

26 duties under Public Resources Code section 21167.7 and California Code of Civil Procedure, section

27 388.
