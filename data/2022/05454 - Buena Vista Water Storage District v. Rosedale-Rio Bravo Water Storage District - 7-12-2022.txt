PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Petitioner BUENA VISTA WATER STORAGE DISTRICT ("Petitioner" or "Buena Vista")
2 hereby alleges as follows:

3 INTRODUCTION

4 1. Pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") (Pub. Resources Code,
§ 21000, et seq.) and the CEQA Guidelines (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15000, et seq.), Buena Vista
brings this action on behalf of itself and on behalf of the landowners and water users within its
boundaries, as well as on behalf of the public interest. This Petition challenges the actions by
8 Respondent ROSEDALE-RIO BRAVO WATER STORAGE DISTRICT'S ("Respondent's" or
/"Rosedale's") failure to comply with CEQA in approving the Onyx Ranch South Fork Valley Water
10 Project (the "Project") and certifying the Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") for the Project.

11 2. The Project substantially and significantly changes historic Kern River operations,
12 practices and sharing. By changing the place of use and purpose of use of a significant quantity of Kern
13 River water, the Project will potentially deprive Buena Vista and others of significant quantities of high
14 quality, pristine Kern River water. At a minimum, the Project will potentially result in a reduction to
15 Buena Vista's and others Kern River water supply and rights and an increased reliance on groundwater
16 from an overdrafted basin. The Project proposes using purported water rights associated with several
17 parcels of land along the South Fork of the Kern River in the Kern River Valley to transfer water by
18 changing the points of diversion, place of use, and purpose of use. These flows would then be passed
19 through the Isabella Reservoir and released from Isabella Dam to flow further downstream in the Kern
20 River' and eventually diverted by Rosedale within and near its service area west of the City of
21 Bakersfield, more than 50 miles from the upstream diversion points. With the Project, Rosedale
22 proposes to transfer and deliver an undefined amount of water per year to its service area for irrigation
23| use and groundwater recharge.

24 3. In short, this Project will divert a potentially significant volume of water which will
25 result in significant impacts to the environment, Buena Vista, and existing Kern River water users and
26 rights holders. Water flowing through the Kern River is subject to a complex water allocation process,

27

28 For purposes of this Petition, the "Kern River" refers to the portion of the river downstream of Isabella Reservoir.
2
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE®

- which is based on a hierarchy of diversions established by long-standing water rights, and countless
2 judgments, agreements, policies, and other procedures that make up the "Law of the River," including
3 the Miller-Haggin Agreement (and its various amendments), the Shaw Decree, the Kern River Water

4 Rights and Storage Agreement, and numerous other agreements and judicial opinions. Precise
5 monitoring of the flow of the river is necessary to calculate the particular water rights.

6 4. The EIR fails to provide sufficient information or demonstrate that Rosedale holds any

7 Kern River water rights or that it has a legal right to change the point of diversion and place of use of

8 Kern River water historically relied upon upstream of the Isabella Reservoir. Further, Rosedale has not
demonstrated any right to store or move water through the Isabella Reservoir or the Kern River and
10 related conveyance facilities. To comply with CEQA, the EIR must provide substantial evidence to
11 support Rosedale's proposed transfer and to describe the environmental impacts potentially arising
12 therefrom. While the EIR acknowledges the potential need for various agreements to move the water
13 through the Isabella Reservoir to downstream diversion points, it fails to provide information
14 demonstrating the scope and validity of Rosedale's claimed water rights and the substance of the
15 various agreements and arrangements required to transfer water downstream. Rosedale has failed to
16 adequately describe its alleged water rights for purposes of CEQA and to meaningfully explain and
17| describe the Project's technical, economic, and environmental characteristics. The Project has the
18 potential to shift a significant quantity of water away from existing Kern River water rights holders,
19 which will result in a variety of significant environmental impacts. Rosedale, however, has decided to
20 ignore these impacts, as well as any Project alternatives or mitigation measures that could have avoided
21 the impacts while still allowing Rosedale to achieve the purpose of the Project. Accordingly, the EIR 1S
22 not legally sufficient.

23 5. The EIR additionally fails to comply with CEQA because it ignores significant impacts
24 that may occur In the Isabella Reservoir, the Kern River channel, or Rosedale's service area. The
25 Project will significantly affect Kern River hydrology and materially affect the rights and interests of
26 existing Kern River diverters, like Buena Vista.

27 6. Buena Vista and others raised all of the above complaints throughout Rosedale's EIR
28 process. Buena Vista and others identified specific environmental issues that were not adequately

3
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

addressed in the Draft EIR. The published Final EIR failed to meaningfully address the comments and
2 concerns raised by Buena Vista and others.

3 7. Disregarding the concerns of Buena Vista and other interested parties, Rosedale certified

4 legally deficient EIR, apparently having already committed to a specific course of action. Rosedale
5 has already determined that the Project Site (as defined in Paragraph No. 29) has little or no value,

6 except for the possible transfer of water accruing to the claimed water rights. As such, Rosedale was

7 committed to particular course and its environmental review was not meaningful and in violation of

8 CEQA.

8. Buena Vista is beneficially interested in Rosedale's compliance with its duties and
10 responsibilities under applicable laws, including CEQA. Buena Vista is beneficially interested in
11 Rosedale's performance of its duties to apply all applicable laws and consider rationally and in good
12 faith all record evidence in deciding whether to approve public projects.

13 9. Through this action, Buena Vista seeks a writ a of mandate commanding Rosedale to set
14 aside its certification of the EIR for the Project, its approval of the Project based thereon, its
15 implementation of the Project in whole or in part, and related relief.

16 10. This action involves enforcement of important rights affecting the public interest.
17| Issuance of the relief requested herein will confer a substantial benefit on the public, including without
18 limitation landowners and water users within Buena Vista, and will result in the enforcement of
19 important public rights by requiring Rosedale to comply with all legal requirements applicable to the
20 Project, including CEQA.

21 PARTIES

22 11. Buena Vista is presently, and has been at all times relevant hereto, a California Water
23 Storage District organized and existing under and pursuant to California Storage Water District Law
24 (Water Code, § 39000 et seq.) Buena Vista's boundaries are located exclusively within the boundaries
25 of the County of Kern, State of California. Buena Vista is authorized by California Water Storage
26 District Law to commence and maintain this action on behalf of itself and its landowners and water

27 users. Buena Vista is the primary owner of certain Kern River water rights, known as the Second Point
28 Right. Buena Vista maintains public projects for diversion, delivery, groundwater replenishment,

4
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- storage, and use of water for beneficial use within its boundaries. Buena Vista's pre-existing water
2 rights would be directly affected by the Project as the storage of water in Lake Isabella and
3 transportation of water in the Kern River channel pursuant to the Project would necessarily displace or

4

5 replace certain quantities of water to which Buena Vista is entitled. The Project will deprive Buena

6 Vista, its landowners and water users, of significant quantities of water, water recharge and recovery
capacity, and will otherwise result in significant environmental effects within Buena Vista's
7 boundaries, none of which were adequately evaluated in the EIR.

8 12. Respondent Rosedale is a California Water Storage District formed pursuant to the
9 California Water Storage District Law for the purpose of managing the groundwater aquifer underlying
10| its service area to support approximately 27,500 acres of irrigated agricultural uses and approximately
11 7,500 acres of residential, commercial, and industrial uses. Rosedale is a local government agency
12 subject at all times to the obligations and limitations of all applicable state, federal, and other laws,
13 including CEQA. Rosedale is the lead agency under CEQA for the preparation of required
14 environmental analysis pertaining to the Project and for otherwise complying with CEQA and the
15 CEQA Guidelines. The five-member Rosedale Board of Directors oversees the management and
16 operation of Rosedale and is ultimately responsible for certifying the EIR and approving the Project.

17 13. The true names and capacities, whether individual, corporate, or otherwise, of DOES:
18 through 25 are unknown to Buena Vista, who therefore sues Respondents by such fictitious names and
19 will seek leave to amend this Petition when they have been ascertained.

201 14. The true names and capacities, whether individual, corporate, or otherwise of Real
21 Parties in Interest ROES 1 through 10, inclusive, are unknown to Buena Vista who, therefore, sues said
22 Real Parties in Interest by fictitious names and will seek leave to amend this Petition when they have

23 been ascertained.

24

25 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

15. This Petition is brough pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5, as
26 well as Public Resources Code sections 21167, 21168, and 21168.5. This court has jurisdiction over
27 this action pursuant to the above provisions and because each of the Respondents and Real Parties
28 named in this litigation are present and operating within the jurisdictional limits of the County of Kern.

5
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

16. Venue is proper in this court under Code of Civil Procedure sections 393 and 395
2 because all acts and omissions complained of in this litigation took place within this judicial district.

3 STANDING

4 17. Buena Vista has a direct and substantial beneficial interest in Rosedale's full and

5 complete compliance with CEQA, and all other applicable laws, in approving the Project.

6 18. Rosedale owed a mandatory duty to act within the boundaries of its legal authorities
7 under CEQA before exercising its discretion to approve the Project.

8 19. Buena Vista has the right to enforce the public right and duties that CEQA imposes on

9 the City and Successor Agency.

10 20. Buena Vista has no other plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of
11 law and will suffer irreparable injury unless this court issues the relief requested in this Petition.
12 EXHAUSTION

13 21. Buena Vista objected to approval of the Project prior to the close of the public hearing
14 on the Project and before Rosedale issued the Notice of Determination ("NOD").

15 22. The grounds noncompliance with CEQA alleged in the Petition are consistent with the
16 objections to the Project raised by Buena Vista or by other members of the public and interested public
17 agencies prior to the close of the public hearing on the Project and before Rosedale issued the NOD.

18 23. If any grounds for noncompliance with CEQA alleged in this Petition were, for some
19 reason, not raised prior to the close of the public hearing on the Project before Rosedale issued the
20 NOD for the Project, it was because there was no meaningful opportunity for members of the public to
21 raise those objections or in writing prior to approval of the Project, or because Rosedale failed to give
22 notice required by law.

23 24. Buena Vista has exhausted its administrative remedies.

24 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

25 25. Buena Vista has performed all conditions imposed by law precedent prior to filing this
26 action, including complying with the requirement of Public Resources Code section 21167.5 by
27 providing a written notice to Rosedale that this action would be filed, a copy of which is attached
28 hereto as Exhibit A.

6
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

26. Buena Vista will also serve a copy of this Petition on the California Attorney General as
2 required by Public Resources Code section 21167.7.

3 27. Buena Vista as well as members of the general public will suffer irreparable harm if the

4 relief requested herein is not granted and the Project is carried out based on the EIR.

5 28. Buena Vista hereby and by a separate election notifies Rosedale that Buena Vista elects
6 to prepare the record of proceedings relevant to approval of the EIR and in compliance with Public
Resources Code section 21167.6, subdivision (b)(2). A copy of such notice is filed concurrently with
8 this Petition.

9 FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

10 The Onyx Ranch South Fork Valley Water Project

11 29. Rosedale is the owner of approximately 4,109 acres situated along the South Fork of the
12 Kern River in the Kern River Valley (the "Project Site"). These parcels are located in the
13 unincorporated area of northeastern Kern County, around the communities of Weldon and Onyx.

14 30. The Project Site is located approximately 50 miles east of the Rosedale service area and
15 approximately 5 miles from the eastern boundary of the Isabella Reservoir along the South Fork of the
16 Kern River. The vast majority of the Project Site, approximately 3,418 acres, is located on lands known
17 as the Onyx Ranch. The other 691 acres of the Project Site are parcels located within lands known as

18 the Smith Ranch.

19 31. The EIR provides that the Project will modify points of diversion, place of use, and
20 purpose of use for the claimed water rights associated with the Project Site. Currently, the Project Site

21 IS used primarily for agricultural purposes, including crop production and irrigated pasture. Rosedale
22 proposes to convert the Project Site to non-irrigated pasture or native vegetation, allowing the water
23 previously diverted and used for irrigation to flow past the Project Site and remain in the South Fork of
24 the Kern River. As described in the EIR, this un-diverted water would flow downstream to the Isabella
25 Reservoir, be passed through the Isabella Reservoir and released below Isabella Dam, and then
26 continue to flow downstream in the Kern River channel to be diverted and delivered for recharge in
27| groundwater basins near Rosedale's service area west of the City of Bakersfield. In summation, the
28 Project proposes the transfer of water from the Project Site down to the valley floor.

7
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

32. The purpose of the Project, as stated in the EIR, is to "increase water supplies to the
2 RRBWSD's [Rosedale's] service area to mitigate the shortages in the RRBWSD's [Rosedale's]
3 contracted [State Water Project] water supply from the State of California, [and to] assist the RRBWSD
4 [Rosedale] in meeting its sustainability goals under the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act."

5 Rosedale's Environmental Review of the Project

6 33. On February 22, 2018, Rosedale issued a Notice of Preparation ("NOP") and Initial

7 Study ("IS") to inform responsible and trustee agencies, public agencies, and the public that it was
8 preparing an EIR for the Project, pursuant to CEQA. The NOP/IS was circulated for a 30-day public
9 review period that ended March 23, 2018. Rosedale held two public scoping meetings for the proposed
10 Project, both of which were held on March 6, 2018.

11 34. On May 22, 2020, Rosedale released a Draft EIR to evaluate the potential impacts of the
12 Project and circulated it for public review and comment for 60 days.

13 35. Within the public comment period, Buena Vista and other Kern River interests
14 submitted written comments to Rosedale regarding the Draft EIR, each of which identified numerous
15 problems with Rosedale's review of environmental impacts including, but not limited to, concerns
16 regarding the Draft EIR's failure to comply with CEQA's requirements for an accurate, stable, and
17 finite project description; failure to provide adequate evidence to support the Project's water rights and
18 Rosedale's ability to transfer and convey the water downstream; improperly narrow Project purpose,
19 which limited the analysis of the Project and possible project alternatives; and failure to describe or
20 analyze various downstream impacts. Numerous other parties submitted similar comments criticizing

21 the EIR and objecting to the Project.

22 36. In December of 2020, Rosedale released the Final EIR. The Final EIR failed to correct
23 most of the problems identified by Buena Vista and other interested parties.

24 37. On January 12, 2021, Rosedale's Board of Directors held a public hearing on the Final
25 EIR. Despite numerous written comments urging the Board of Directors to substantially revise and
26 recirculate the EIR, the Board voted to certify the Final EIR and approve the Project. A Notice of
27 Determination approving the Project was posted on January 13, 2021.

28

8
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Tolling of All Applicable Statutes of Limitation By All Interested Parties

2 38. On February 3, 2021, Rosedale, Buena Vista, City of Bakersfield, Kern County Water
3 Agency, North Kern Water Storage District, and Kern Delta Water District ("all interested parties")

4 entered into an agreement entitled "Tolling Agreement," whereby the parties agreed that all "time
5 periods or statutes of limitation" that would apply to the filing of an action alleging CEQA violations
6 related to the Project "shall be tolled until either (1) May 15, 2021; or thirty (30) days after written
7 notice of the intent by any Party to terminate the tolling period is given to each of the other Parties."
8 (Paragraph 2 of the subject Tolling Agreement.)
9 39. The Tolling Agreement was subsequently extended by the parties by way of several
10 written amendments, the last of which provided that the Tolling Agreement would extend through

11 March 18, 2022.

12 40. On March 18, 2022, all interested parties entered into an agreement entitled
13 "Cooperative Agreement for Onyx Interim Pilot Project" (hereinafter referred to as "Cooperative
14| Agreement"), again tolling all applicable statutes of limitation associated with the filing of any CEQA
15 claims related to the Project to the earlier of December 31, 2023, or the termination of the Cooperative
16 Agreement.

17 41. The Cooperative Agreement provided that any party could terminate it and the
18 associated tolling agreement by giving at least 30 days' notice.

19 42. On March 21, 2022, Buena Vista gave notice of its intent to terminate the "Cooperative
20 Agreement," effective May 20, 2022, including notice to the interested parties of its intent to terminate

21 the agreed upon tolling of all applicable statutes of limitation periods.

22 43. On May 19, 2022, prior to the termination of the Cooperative Agreement and the Tolling

23 Agreement, Buena Vista provided Rosedale and all the Interested parties with notice that it was
24| extending the date of termination until June 21, 2022.

25 44. In conjunction with the "Tolling Agreement," "Cooperative Agreement" and the
26 associated extensions, Buena Vista has filed this Petition for Writ of Mandate in accordance with all
27 applicable statutes of limitation, including Code of Civil Procedure section 860 and Public Resource
28 Code section 21167, subdivision (d).

9
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (Writ of Mandate Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure 10852 for Non-Compliance with CEQA)

3 45. Buena Vista hereby realleges and incorporates all previous paragraphs as if fully set

4 forth therein.

5 Inadequate Project Description

6 46. CEQA requires an "accurate, stable and finite project description,' known as "the sine
7 qua non of an informative and legally sufficient EIR.' (County of Inyo v. City of Los Angeles (1977) 71
8 Cal.App.3d 185, 193, emphasis added.) The adequacy of a project description is closely linked to the
9 adequacy of the environmental document's analysis of environmental effects. (Laurel Heights
10 Improvement Assn. V. Regents of the University of Cal. (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 398-399.) A complete
11 project description is required to ensure that all of the project's environmental impacts are considered.
12| (City of Santee V. County of San Diego (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 11438, 1454-1455.) An inaccurate
13 project description constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion because it precludes meaningful
14 evaluation of the environmental consequences of a proposed project both by the public and the
15 decisionmakers. (Sierra Club v. State Bd. of Forestry (1994) 7 Cal.4th 1215, 1236-1237.)
16 47. The Project proposes to change the point of diversion and place of use for water rights
17 associated with the Project site and convey the water allegedly generated by the Project through Lake
18 Isabella and then through the Kern River channel until Rosedale diverts the alleged new water supply
19 out of the Kern River at an unidentified location and into its service area. The Kern River and Lake
20 Isabella contain a finite amount of water, which is the property of Kern River interests, such as Buena
21 Vista. The Project would not practically increase the quantities of water in Lake Isabella and the Kern
22 River channel but rather displace and replace water owned by Kern River interests, including water to
23 which Buena Vista is entitled. Numerous commenters alerted Rosedale that the project description was
24 fatally flawed for failing to acknowledge, identify, or describe any other Kern River water rights'
25 holders, including Buena Vista and other entities downstream of Lake Isabella. Accordingly, the EIR
26 fails to address the Project's impacts on existing water right holders and merely concludes that the

27

28
Or in the alternative, Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5.
10
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Project can be implemented "without injury to other water right holders." (Draft EIR, p. 2-7.) The EIR,
2 however, lacks the information necessary to support such a conclusion. Specifically, the Project
3 description omits, among other things, the following information necessary to analyze potential impacts

4 to the environment and existing right olders:

5 a.

6 Identification of Kern River water rights, including rights held by Buena Vista and other
entities below Lake Isabella.

7 b.

8 Descriptions of the operation and management of Lake Isabella, the Kern River and the

-o prior rights and agreements that govern and regulate the Kern River including the

10 agreements, judgments, orders, policies and practices, which govern and control the

11 conveyance of water through the Kern River channel, and the diversion and use of water

from the Kern River.

12 C.

13 Explanation as to how or to what extent Rosedale would attempt to avoid reducing or

14 displacing water accruing to existing Kern River water rights, including rights held by
Buena Vista.

15 d The quantity of water to be diverted and subsequently conveyed by Rosedale.
16 The EIR must identify, consider, discuss, and analyze the potential environmental effects of the Project
17 on Buena Vista's Kern River water rights.

18 48. Further, as numerous agencies and organizations noted, the EIR's project description
19 omits important information regarding the coordinated release of water from Lake Isabella. The EIR
20 provides that Rosedale will "coordinate with the Kern River Watermaster, Kern River Interests, and
21 [Army Corps of Engineers] to facilitate the movement of the water through the Isabella Dam, or
22 alternative, secure temporary storage of the water in the Isabella Reservoir for later release to the
23 downstream [Rosedale] service area. (Draft EIR, pp. 2-22 to 2-23.) The EIR, however, fails to disclose
24 or identify the type of agreement(s) that Rosedale would obtain in order to "coordinate" the conveyance
25 of water into Lake Isabella, and out of Lake Isabella, and through the Kern River channel to Rosedale's
26 service area. Rights to storage of Kern River water in Lake Isabella are authorized and defined by a
27 complex legal framework with the Army Corps of Engineers and among the Kern River interests. In
28 this context, Rosedale's proposal to add potentially thousands of acre-feet of water to the reservoir,

11
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

with no storage rights, raises numerous potential impacts that are neither considered or described in the

2 EIR. The EIR fails to address or account for the legal and practical obstacles to the use of the Kern

3 River channel and Lake Isabella for storage and conveyance of water.

4 49. Consequently, the project description is inaccurate, and any analysis based on the flawed
5 description is not legally sufficient. Rosedale must prepare an EIR with an accurate project description

6 and accompanying adequate analysis in order to comply with CEQA.

7 50. As a result of the foregoing defects and others according to proof, Rosedale prejudicially

8 abused its discretion by certifying and relying upon an EIR that does not comply with CEQA.
Accordingly, Rosedale's certification of the EIR must be set aside.

10 Improper Piecemealing

11 51. CEQA requires that a lead agency consider the environmental effects of "all activities
12| involved in a project" (Pub. Resources Code, § 21002.1, subd. (d)), meaning that the "whole of an
13 action" must be analyzed (CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15003, subd. (h), 15378, subd. (a).) Improper
14 piecemealing, as it is known, renders an EIR inadequate and legally insufficient. (See, e.g., Berkeley
15 Keep Jets Over the Bay Com. V. Bd. of Port Commissioners (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1344, 1358.)
16 52. The Project ostensibly includes the development and/or use of downstream diversion
17 and conveyance facilities in and near the Rosedale service area. The EIR, however, fails to disclose the
18 infrastructure required to convey the diverted water to the Rosedale service area. Without a description
19 of the proposed downstream diversion and conveyance facilities, the EIR does not properly consider
20 the environmental effects of the Project including impacts to aesthetics, agricultural resources, air

21 quality, biological resources, cultural resources and tribal cultural resources, geology and soils,
22 greenhouse gas emissions, hazards and hazardous materials, hydrology and water quality, water supply,
23| groundwater basin, land use and planning, utilities and service systems, energy, wildfire, growth
24 inducement and population and housing.

25 53. The EIR also excludes discussion of a critical aspect of the Project: the transfer of water
26 from Lake Isabella downstream to Rosedale's place of use. (See 1 50.) There are important operational
27 issues with this aspect of the Project, which could have significant effects on storage operations in the
28 reservoir as well as conveyance of water downstream from the reservoir. The storage and release of

12
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- water from Lake Isabella is a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the Project, and the future
2 "coordination" of that aspect given the complexity of storage restrictions in Lake Isabella may change
3 the scope of the project and alter its environmental effects.

4 54.

5 The EIR cannot defer consideration of impacts related to the conveyance of water
downstream to Rosedale's place of use. (See Lighthouse Field Beach Rescue v. City of Santa Cruz
6 (2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 1170, 1208 ["requirements of CEQA cannot be avoided by piecemeal
7 review"].) Rosedale must prepare an EIR that includes a description of all Project components and
8 accompanying adequate analysis in order to comply with CEQA.
9 55. As a result of the foregoing defects and others according to proof, Rosedale prejudicially
10 abused its discretion by certifying and relying upon an EIR that does not comply with CEQA.
11 Accordingly, Rosedale's certification of the EIR must be set aside.

12

13 56. Inadequate Description of the Environmental Setting and Baseline

CEQA defines the "environment" subject to analysis in an EIR as the entire "area which
14 will be affected by a proposed project." (Pub. Resources Code, § 21060.5) That physical environment
15 must be adequately described in the EIR to provide a solid foundation for the assessment of
16 environmental impacts. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15125, subd. (a); Neighbors for Smart Rail v. Exposition
17 Metro Line Construction Authority (2013) 57 Cal.4th 439, 447.) The "environment" of a project can
18 extend beyond the project area, and impacts beyond that area must be analyzed. (Muzzy Ranch Co. v.
19 Solano County Airport Land Use Com. (2007) 41 Cal.4th 372, 387-388, citing County Sanitation Dist.
20 No. 2 of Los Angeles County v. County of Kern (2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 1544, 1582-1583.) Defining the
21 project area to exclude an area where significant impacts will occur is contrary to CEQA. (Bakersfield
22 Citizens for Local Control v. City of Bakersfield (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1184, 1216.)

23 57. The EIR fails to identify and describe the environmental setting and baseline conditions
24 that would be affected by the Project.
25 58. The EIR defines the environmental setting narrowly, including only the Onyx and Smith
26 Ranches. (Draft EIR, p. 2-2.) Even the broader "Local Setting" encompasses only the South Fork and
27| Lake Isabella (Id. at p. 2-4.) The EIR, among other things, failed to include an adequate description of
28 the Project's environmental setting in that:

13
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

a. the EIR failed to adequately describe the physical conditions on and/or under nearby

2 landowners' and water users' lands, including those within Buena Vista's boundaries,
which may be affected by the Project;
† b. the EIR failed to adequately describe the Kern River channel and the associated water

5 facilities and operations and activities existing along the Kern River from Lake Isabella
to the proposed place of use within Rosedale;

C. the EIR failed to adequately describe existing diversion facilities, canals, and projects

8 existing in the vicinity of the Kern River;
9 d. the EIR failed to adequately describe historic diversion and use of water on the Project
10 site;

11 e The EIR failed to conduct adequate surveys for special-status plant and animal species;
12 and,

13 f. the EIR failed to adequately describe the service area for Rosedale, as well as for Kern

14 River interests, such as Buena Vista, that will experience a reduction of its Kern River

15 water supplies as a result of the Project.

16 59. These failures precluded the EIR from meaningfully analyzing the direct and reasonably
17 foreseeable indirect impacts of the Project on the existing environmental setting, including those
18 features of the existing environment described above, and deprived the public, including Buena Vista
19 and Buena Vista's landowners and water users, of an opportunity to meaningfully comment on the
20 Project and its impacts on the existing environment, which include impacts to aesthetics, agricultural
21 resources, air quality, biological resources, cultural resources and tribal cultural resources, geology and
22 soils, greenhouse gas emissions, hazards and hazardous materials, hydrology and water quality, water
23 supply, groundwater, wildfire, land use and planning, utilities and service systems, energy, growth
24 inducement and population and housing.

25 60. As a result of the foregoing defects and others according to proof, Rosedale prejudicially
26 abused its discretion by certifying and relying upon an EIR that does not comply with CEQA.
27 Accordingly, Rosedale's certification of the EIR must be set aside.

28

14
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

P Inadequate Range of Alternatives; Impermissibly Narrow Statement of Project Objectives

2 61. CEQA requires an EIR to "describe a range of reasonable alternatives to the project
3 which would feasibly attain most of the basic objectives of the project but would avoid or substantially
4 lessen any of the significant effects and evaluate the comparative merits of the alternatives." (CEQA

5 Guidelines, § 15126.6, subd. (a); see also CEQA Guidelines, § 15002, subd. (a)(3); e.g., Citizens of

6 Goleta Valley v. Bd. of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 566.) The "rule of reason" governs the

7 "nature [and] scope" of this range. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15126.6, subd. (a).)

8 62. While the alternatives discussed must be able to attain most of the basic objectives of the
9 project, a lead agency abuses its discretion where it adopts artificially narrow project objectives that
10 preclude consideration of reasonable alternatives for achieving the project's underlying purpose. (North
11 Coast Rivers Alliance v. Kawamura (2015) 243 Cal.App.4th 647, 669; County of Inyo v. City of Los
12 Angeles (1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 185, 203.)

13 63. The underlying purpose of the Project is to increase water supplies in Rosedale's service
14 area to mitigate shortages in Rosedale's contracted State Water Project supply and to assist Rosedale in
15 meeting its sustainability goals under the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (Water Code, §
16 10720 et seq.). (Draft EIR, p. 2-7.) The EIR, however, narrows this goal, providing that the "purpose of
17 the proposed project is to enable [Rosedale] to change the points of diversion and place of use of the
18 surface water on the Onyx and Smith Ranches in order to move the water downstream for diversion and
19 use in [Rosedale's] service area." (Ibid.) By narrowing the Project purpose in such a fashion, the EIR
20 improperly limits the analysis of the Project and possible project alternatives and confuses the means of
21 meeting the objective with the objective itself. This type of narrow statement of project objectives is
22 invalid.

23 64. The EIR fails to analyze an adequate range of alternatives. There is no indication that

24| Rosedale considered actual, practical, or meaningful alternatives to the Project, including alternative
25 sources of supply or alternatives designed to reduce its water demands. The EIR includes only two
26 alternatives: the No Project Alternative and the 50 Percent Diversion Alternative. The EIR, however,
27 rejects alternative locations for the Project without sufficiently explaining why other sources of water
28 were unavailable or infeasible. For example, several commenters suggested that Rosedale consider

15
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

alternatives including conservation, recycled water, more efficient irrigation methods, transfers or

2 exchanges with local water districts, or expanded conjunctive use and groundwater banking. Without so

3 much as a list of possible alternative sources, it is impossible to analyze whether those sources would

4 meet Project objectives or result in reduced impacts.

65. Rosedale must prepare an EIR that includes an adequate reasonable range of alternatives
in order to comply with CEQA.

66. As a result of the foregoing defects and others according to proof, Rosedale prejudicially
8 abused its discretion by certifying and relying upon an EIR that does not comply with CEQA.
Accordingly, Rosedale's certification of the EIR must be set aside.

10 Inadequate Evaluation and Mitigation of Project Impacts; Improper Deferral of Mitigation

11 67. CEQA requires the lead agency a for a project with the potential to cause significant
12 adverse impacts on the physical environment to first certify an EIR that complies with the requirements
13 of the statute. These requirements include, but are not limited to, fully disclosing and meaningfully
14 analyzing the Project's potentially significant environmental impacts, which includes direct
15 environmental impacts, as well as reasonably foreseeable indirect environmental impacts. (CEQA
16 Guidelines, § 15126.2, subd. (a).) A direct environmental impact is a change in the physical
17| environment caused by the project that is immediately related to the project occurring at the same time
18 and place as the project. (CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15064, subd. (d)(1), 15358, subd. (a)(1).) An indirect
19 environmental impact is a change in the physical environment that is not immediately related to the
20 project but that is caused indirectly by the project and occurs later in time or farther removed in
21 distance than direct effects. (CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15064, subd. (d)(2), 15358, subd. (a)(2).)
22 68. An EIR must contain a sufficient degree of analysis to provide decision makers with
23 information which allows them to make a decision which intelligently takes account of both the direct
24 and indirect environmental consequences of a project. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15151.) Drafting an EIR
25 necessarily involves some degree of forecasting, and an agency must use its best efforts to find out and
26 disclose all that it reasonably can. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15144.) An EIR should, when looked at as a
27 whole, provide a reasonable, good faith disclosure and analysis of the project's environmental impacts.
28 (Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. V. Regents of University of Cal. (1988) 47 Cal.3d 379, 392.)

16
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

69. CEQA also mandates that a lead agency adopt feasible and enforceable mitigation
2 measures that would reduce or avoid a project's significant environmental impacts. (Pub. Resources
3 Code, §§ 21061, 21100, subd. (b)(3), 21002.) When it is clear with certainty than an impact can
4 feasibly be mitigated but is not yet possible to specifically define the mitigation measure, CEQA allows
5 an EIR to defer identification of the specifics of the required mitigation to a future timeonly if the
6 EIR commits the agency to adequately mitigate the potential impacts and defines : specific
performance standard that would be required to be met, while deferring the final choice of mitigation.
8 (CEQA Guidelines, § 15126.4, subd. (a)(1)(B).)

70. Rosedale violated CEQA by certifying an EIR for the Project that is inadequate and fails
10| to comply with the requirements of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines. Among other things, the EIR:
11 a. Fails to adequately disclose, analyze, and mitigate the Project's reasonably foreseeable
12 significant adverse impacts on the environment, including impacts to aesthetics,

13 agricultural resources, air quality, biological resources, cultural resources and tribal
14 cultural resources, geology and soils, greenhouse gas emissions, hazards and hazardous

15 materials, hydrology and water quality, water supply, groundwater basin, wildfire, land

16 use and planning, utilities and service systems, energy, and growth inducement.

17 b. Fails to adequately disclose, analyze, and mitigate the Project's reasonably foreseeable
18 significant adverse impacts on the environment, including direct impacts related to a

19 reduction in the quantity of Kern River water available for Buena Vista and the other

20 Kern River Interests.

21 C Fails to adequately disclose, analyze, and mitigate the Project's reasonably foreseeable
22 significant indirect adverse impacts on the environment resulting from a decrease in
23 water supplies available to Kern River Interests like Buena Vista including impacts
24 related to aesthetics, agricultural resources, air quality, biological resources, cultural
25 resources and tribal cultural resources, geology and soils, greenhouse gas emissions,
26 hazards and hazardous materials, hydrology and water quality, water supply,
27 groundwater, wildfire, land use and planning, utilities and service systems, energy,

28 growth inducement and population and housing.

17
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

d. Fails to adequately disclose, analyze, and mitigate the Project's reasonably foreseeable
significant adverse impacts on the environment downstream from Lake Isabella.

e. Fails to adequately disclose, analyze, and mitigate the Project's reasonably foreseeable
significant adverse impacts on biological resources including riparian habitat and
special-status plant and animal species. The EIR's conclusions and mitigation measures

6 are not supported by substantial evidence.

7 f Fails to adequately analyze cumulative impacts of the Project.

8 71. The EIR fails to provide adequate information regarding the Project and its attendant
9 environmental effects to allow for the issuance of required subsequent discretionary approvals by
10 responsible agencies.

11 72. The mitigation set forth in the EIR and adopted by Rosedale does not meet CEQA's
12 standards. Mitigation is inappropriately deferred. As noted by commenters, the proposed and adopted
13 mitigation is ineffective and unenforceable, and is insufficient to reduce impacts.

14 73. Rosedale must prepare an EIR fully disclosing and meaningfully analyzing direct, as
15 well as reasonably foreseeable indirect, impacts of all Project components on the environment inclusive
16 of Lake Isabella and the areas affected by the Project downstream of Lake Isabella.

17 74. a As a result of the foregoing defects and others according to proof, Rosedale prejudicially
18 abused its discretion by certifying and relying upon an EIR that does not comply with CEQA.
19 Accordingly, Rosedale's certification of the EIR must be set aside.

20 Significance Determinations Not Supported by Substantial Evidence

21 75. In violation of CEQA, the EIR's significance determinations of environmental effects,
22 including impacts to aesthetics, agricultural resources, air quality, biological resources, cultural
23 resources and tribal cultural resources, geology and soils, greenhouse gas emissions, hazards and
24| hazardous materials, hydrology and water quality, water supply, groundwater, wildfire, land use and
25 planning, utilities and service systems, energy, growth inducement and population and housing, are
26 unsupported by substantial evidence.

27 76. Rosedale must prepare an EIR the conclusions of which are supported by substantial
28 evidence in order to comply with CEQA.

18
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

77. As a result of the foregoing defects and others according to proof, Rosedale prejudicially
2 abused its discretion by certifying and relying upon an EIR that does not comply with CEQA.
3 Accordingly, Rosedale's certification of the EIR must be set aside

4 Failure to Address Alleged Areas of Controversy

5 78. An EIR must identify and summarize "[a]reas of controversy known to the Lead Agency
6 including issues raised by agencies and the public." (CEQA Guidelines, § 15123, subd. (b)(2).)

7 79. The EIR's discussion of alleged areas of controversy is incomplete and inadequate. The
8 EIR lists "areas of controversy and issues of concern" which were identified in "comments made
9 during the 30-dayt public review period in response to information published in the NOP and Initial
10 Study. (Draft EIR, pp. 1-7 and 1-8.) Despite that claim, the EIR fails to address or even identify the

11 most significant area of controversy with regard to the Project--uncertainty over the existence and
12 extent of the water rights Rosedale seeks to develop and utilize in connection with the Project. The EIR
13 further fails to acknowledge prior disputes among the Kern River interests and other local water
14 districts, including Rosedale, which could impact Rosedale's ability to implement the Project or to
15 transport water developed through the Project.

16 80. A number of local agencies raised and identified a number of specific concerns with
17| regard to Rosedale's claimed water rights in their comments. The EIR's listing of areas of controversy
18 and issues of concern, with no further explanation or information, Is not in compliance with CEQA
19 requirements. Even if Rosedale disagrees with various objections to and complaints about the Project,
20 the environmental documentation must still summarize the main points of disagreement regarding
21 controversies and issues of concern. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15151; Browning-Ferris Industries v. City
22 Council (1986) 181 Cal.App.3d 852.)

23 81. a As a result of the foregoing defects and others according to proof, Rosedale prejudicially
24 abused its discretion by certifying and relying upon an EIR that does not comply with CEQA.
25 Accordingly, Rosedale's certification of the EIR must be set aside.

26 Inadequate Response to Comments on the Draft EIR; Failure to Recirculate

27 82. Public agencies must provide a good faith, reasoned analysis in response to comments
28 received on the EIR and conclusory statements unsupported by factual information will not suffice.

19
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Agencies must address recommendations and objections in detail and explain why specific comments

2 and suggestions were not accepted. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15008, subd. (c).)

3 83. CEQA requires recirculation where the draft EIR is "so fundamentally and basically

4 inadequate and conclusory in nature that meaningful public review and comment were precluded."

5 (CEQA Guidelines, § 15088.5.) Additionally, if significant new information is added to an EIR after
6 notice of public review has been given, but before final certification of the EIR, the lead agency must
a issue a new notice and recirculate the EIR for comments and consultation. (Pub. Resources Code, §
8 21092.1; CEQA Guidelines, § 15088.5; Vineyard Area Citizens for Responsible Growth v. City of
Rancho Cordova (2007) 40 Cal.4th 412, 447.) Recirculation is required when the addition of new
10 information deprives the public of a meaningful opportunity to comment on substantial adverse project
11 impacts or feasible mitigation measures or alternatives that are not adopted. (CEQA Guidelines, §
12 15088.5, subd. (a).)

13 84. The EIR does not comply with CEQA because Respondent failed to adequately respond
14 to comments suggestions, and recommendations made by Buena Vista and others with regard to the
15 Project's description, environmental setting, impacts, alternatives, areas of controversy, and other
16 matters, as alleged herein.

17 85. Among other things, the EIR for the Project wholly failed to analyze direct
18 environmental effects downstream of Lake Isabella and the indirect impacts of reducing water supply
19 of the existing Kern River interests. In violation of CEQA, Rosedale failed to revise and recirculate the
20 EIR to address these deficiencies.

21 86. Rosedale was required to recirculate the EIR to allow for meaningful public review and
22 comment as to new information added to the Final EIR regarding, e.g., the calculation designed to
23 quantify the Project's future water diversions

24 87. As a result of the foregoing defects and others according to proof, Rosedale prejudicially
25 abused its discretion by certifying and relying upon an EIR that does not comply with CEQA.
26 Accordingly, Rosedale's certification of the EIR must be set aside.
