18014792.1 a07/14/22 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE FOR VIOLATION OF
CEOA AND COMPL. FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 INTRODUCTION

2 1. Petitioner brings this action, on its own behalf and on behalf of the general public

3 and in the public interest, for judicial review and invalidation of the actions, determinations,

4 decisions, and approvals made by the Respondents including the Respondents' determinations on

5 or about June 14, 2022, relating to the alteration of truck routes within the southern portion of the

6 City of Perris, and along the border of the City of Menifee, which resulted in the de-designation

7 of a portion of Ethanac Road as a designated truck route, resulting in a significant change and

8 harm to the existing environment and other adverse environmental impacts despite Respondents'
failure to comply with the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), the California

10 Vehicle Code, the California Planning and Zoning Law, and other applicable state and local laws.

11 2. Petitioner seeks relief from Respondents' hasty, ill-considered, and unlawful
12 actions, including the Respondents' failure to comply with CEQA (collectively referred to herein
13 as the "Approvals"), and requests that the Approvals be declared void and invalid, and that
14 Respondents be mandated to set aside the Approvals and be permanently enjoined from taking any
15 further action in furtherance of, or in implementation of, the Approvals. Petitioner also seeks
16 issuance of temporary and preliminary injunctive relief and an alternative writ of mandate
17 enjoining Respondents from taking any further action in furtherance of, or in implementation of,
18 the Approvals unless and until the Respondents first rescind their unlawful actions and approvals,
19 and fully comply with the applicable requirements of state and local law, including CEQA, and
20 comply with the writs or orders of this Court.

21 3. The disputed approvals include the Respondents' approval of General Plan
22 Amendment No. GPA 22-05068 and an Ordinance Amendment No. OA22-05069, which were
23 approved on or about June 14, 2022, by Respondents' adoption of a Resolution and an Ordinance
24 (collectively the "Approvals"), both of which include Respondents' unjustified determination that
25 the Project could not have an impact on the environment, and the adoption of a negative
26 declaration under CEQA. Ethanac Road bisects the border between Perris and Menifee, with
27 Perris owning the northern portion of the road and Menifee owning the southern portion.
28 Respondents purported to demolish the long-established system of designated truck routes

attorneys at law 2509/031858-0034 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE FOR VIOLATION OF
18014792.1 a07/14/22 CEOA AND COMPL. FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

throughout the City of Perris, and along the border with the City of Menifee, in a transparent
2 attempt to divert and displace truck traffic and the resulting impacts to other areas within the City
3 and the surrounding environs, without regard to the rights and interests of the Petitioner, and many
4 others in the neighboring communities or the public at large. The Approvals and the resulting
5 amendments along with the resulting modifications to the truck routes are hereinafter referred to as
6 the "Project."

7 4. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that the disputed
8 Approvals were adopted arbitrarily without adequate public notice or public review, and without
9 any effort at compliance with the requirements of CEQA, without adequate consideration of
10 adverse impacts on the environment or the regional welfare, or probable impairment of public
11 health and safety, and which create inconsistencies and conflicts with the City's General Plan.

12 5. In adopting the Approvals, the Respondents improperly and unlawfully relied on a
13 negative declaration in finding that the Project would not result in any significant impacts, which
14 conclusions are not supported by substantial evidence in the record, and which were contrary to
15 evidence in the record raising at least fair argument that the Approvals would result in significant
16 adverse environmental impacts, precluding reliance upon a negative declaration and requiring
17| further public environmental review and analysis. Respondents' actions also violated CEQA's
18 prohibitions against piecemeal review of public projects, considering only a portion of the City's
19 recent attempts to rearrange and reorganize the truck routes within the City, in order to minimize
20 or avoid public review and analysis of the potential impacts of the larger project, i.e., the City's
21 wholesale rearrangement of truck routes. As a result, the Respondents failed to consider
22 significant adverse impacts of the Project, including impacts to the environment, regional welfare,
23 and communities that are located outside of the City's limits, and improperly failed to consider
24 possible mitigation measures or feasible alternatives to the proposed Project as required by CEQA.

25 6. In addition, Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, the
26 Respondents' actions on the Approvals were in conflict with the California Vehicle Code,
27 Planning and Zoning Law, as well as the City's own General Plan and Municipal Code.

28 7. Petitioner, and other interested parties, duly raised these issues and objections,

& Rutan & Tucker, LLP -3-
attorneys at law 2509/031858-0034 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE FOR VIOLATION OF
18014792.1 a07/14/22 CEOA AND COMPL. FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 verbally and in writing, at appropriate times during the administrative process leading up to
2 Respondents' disputed Approvals. Petitioner has exhausted all available administrative remedies,

3 but Respondents have persisted in acting in derogation of their obligations under CEQA, the
4 Vehicle Code, the Planning and Zoning Law, and in derogation of the public's rights and interests

5 in compliance with those laws.

6 8. Petitioner now brings this action in the public interest, for enforcement of the
7 important public rights and environmental interests intended to be protected by CEQA and for the
8 enforcement of the Vehicle Code, the State Planning and Zoning Law, and the City's own General
9 Plan and policies, as well as statutory and constitutional rights to adequate notice, fair public
10 hearings, due process and equal protection of the laws.

11 PARTIES

12 9. City of Menifee is a California city and municipal corporation organized and
13 existing under the laws of the State of California.

14 10. Respondent City of Perris is a municipal corporation, organized and existing under
15 the laws of the State of California, located in the County of Riverside. The Respondent City
16 Council is the elected governing body of the Respondent City, which erroneously adopted the
17 invalid and unlawful Approvals challenged in this action. The City together with the City Council
18 collectively are referred to herein as "the City" or "Respondents."

19 11. Petitioner exhausted all available administrative remedies by timely objecting
20 orally and/or in writing to Respondents' approval of the Project.

21 12. Petitioner is ignorant of the true names and capacities of those sued herein as
22 DOES through 100, inclusive, and therefore sues those respondent/defendant by such fictitious
23 names. Petitioner will amend this Petition to allege the true names and capacities of these
24 fictitiously named respondent/defendant when they have been ascertained. Petitioner designates
25 all other unknown persons or entities claiming any interests in the subject of this litigation as
26 DOES respondent/defendant.

27 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

28 13. This Court has jurisdiction over this proceeding pursuant to CCP sections 1085,

& Rutan & Tucker, LLP -4-
attorneys at law 2509/031858-0034 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE FOR VIOLATION OF
18014792.1 a07/14/22 CEOA AND COMPL. FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 1094.5, and 1060, and CEQA, including but not limited to PRC sections 21168 and 21168.5.

2 14. Venue in this Court is proper pursuant to CCP section 394, in that Respondents are
3 located within the County of Riverside.

4 FACTUAL BACKGROUND

5 15. Through their recent arbitrary and unilateral actions and Approvals, the
6 Respondents ostensibly seek to remove truck routes from areas of the City of Perris that the
7 Respondents wish to protect from the asserted impacts of such uses. However, in doing so, the
8 Respondents failed, and in some instances refused, to acknowledge the harmful impacts that are
9 likely to result from displacing and removing truck routes both within the City, and through
10 neighboring communities.

11 16. The City's policies and decisions were, on their face, intended to displace and shift
12 the impacts that could result from these truck routes to new areas, or the surrounding environment
13 and communities, and yet, the City steadfastly refused to consider or quantify what those impacts
14 could be. Instead, the City improperly curtailed its purported "analysis" of impacts to those
15 impacts that would result strictly within the jurisdictional limits of the City, in disregard of the
16 express written objections of Petitioner and others. Accordingly, Petitioner seeks relief from the
17 City's arbitrary actions.

18 17. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that the City of Perris
19 first prohibited trucks throughout the City in 1972, but also designated certain truck routes through
20 the adoption of Perris Municipal Code ("PMC") Ch. 10.40 pursuant to its authority under
21 California Vehicle Code § 35701. Chapter 10.40 was then subsequently updated in 1992.

22 18. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that since
23 Chapter 10.40's initial adoption, Ethanac Road has been designated as a truck route within the
24 City of Perris.

25 19. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that many local
26 governments, public agencies, property owners, businesses, and members of the public have
27 reasonably and justifiably relied upon that designation of Ethanac Road as a truck route, and have
28 made investments, expenditures, plans and permanent improvements in such reliance.

18014792.1 a07/14/22 CEOA AND COMPL. FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 20. Petitioner is further informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that the
2 segment of Ethanac Road that was recently de-designated as a truck route by the unilateral and
3 disputed actions of Respondents is on the boundary between the City of Perris and City of
4 Menifee, and is subject to the jurisdiction of both the City of Perris and the City of Menifee.

5 21. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that in October 2021,
6 the City drafted an Initial Study and Negative Declaration under CEQA, entitled "Negative
7 Declaration for the City of Perris Proposed Truck Routes" (Neg. Dec. No. 2364) (hereafter

8 referred to as the "Northern Negative Declaration"), to review the possible impacts of a proposed
9 project which was defined in that negative declaration as certain amendments to the "Perris
10 Municipal Code, Circulation Element of the City of Perris Comprehensive General Plan 2030, and
11 the Perris Valley Commerce Center Specific Plan in order to identify a consistent list of adopted
12 truck routes within the northern portion of the City and extending south along Perris Boulevard
13 to Case Road." (Emphasis added.)

14 22. On November 17, 2021, the City's Planning Commission held a public hearing to a
15 consider proposed amendments to the City's Municipal Code and the applicable Perris Valley
16 Commerce Center ("PVCC') Specific Plan to alter the truck routes within the northern portion of
17 the City of Perris. Most relevant here, the City purported to add some truck routes, and to
18 eliminate the following truck routes:

19 a. Eliminate the truck route on Perris Blvd from Harley Knox Blvd to Case
20 Road;

21 b. Eliminate the truck route on Ramona Expressway from the I-215 to the
22 eastern city limits; and

23 C. Eliminate the truck route on Evans Road from Ramona Expressway to

24 Placentia Avenue.

25 23. Following a hearing, the Planning Commission recommended that the City Council

26 approve those proposed modifications to the City's designated truck routes.

27 24. On December 14, 2021, the City Council conducted a public hearing, adopted the
28 Northern Negative Declaration for that project, and ultimately approved the proposed

& Rutan & Tucker, LLP -6-
attorneys at law 2509/031858-0034 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE FOR VIOLATION OF
18014792.1 a07/14/22 CEOA AND COMPL. FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 modifications to truck routes within the City.

2 25. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that during the City

3 Council's December 14, 2021 public hearing, various Councilmembers made statements that
4 indicated that they were seeking to prevent allowing truck traffic that originated from outside the

5 City to come through the City, and further indicated an unwillingness to consider the impacts of
6 such a prohibition on the neighboring communities, including those communities that share
7 jurisdiction over existing truck routes.

8 26. The City staff subsequently prepared materials for consideration of possible

9 additional substantial changes to the established truck routes in southern and central areas of the
10 City

11 27. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that in or about
12 May 2022, the City hired a consultant to prepare a new Initial study and Negative Declaration
13 under CEQA, entitled "Negative Declaration for the City of Perris Proposed Truck Routes 2
14 (GPA22-05068 and OA22-05069), ND No. 2372" (referred to herein as the "Southern Negative
15 Declaration"), to review the possible impacts of a new proposed project, which was defined as
16 "amendments to the Perris Municipal Code and the Circulation Element of the City of Perris
17 Comprehensive General Plan 2030 in order to identify a consistent list of adopted truck routes
18 primarily within the southern and central portions of the City." (Emphasis added).

19 28. That Southern Negative Declaration was created to purportedly analyze the
20 impacts arising from a distinct proposal to substantially change, de-designate, and reconfigure the
21 truck routes in the remainder of the City that had not been considered in the Northern Negative
22 Declaration. Indeed, this second negative declaration, the Southern Negative Declaration, was

23 even entitled as the "City of Perris Proposed Truck Routes 2.33

24 29. The authors of the Southern Negative Declaration asserted that the Project "does

25 not have the potential to significantly impact the local environment. Therefore, in accordance with
26 CEQA, this Negative Declaration has been prepared."

27 30. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that the City made the
28 Southern Negative Declaration available for public review and comment but only for a 20-day

& Rutan & Tucker, LLP -7-
attorneys at law 2509/031858-0034 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE FOR VIOLATION OF

1 period between May 11, 2022 and May 31, 2022.

2 31. The City staff prepared a proposed General Plan Amendment, GPA No. GPA22-
3 05068, which proposed to amend the General Plan's Circulation Element to remove the following
4 segments of existing roadway from the General Plan's Circulation Element Truck Routes Map:

5 a. Evans Road - from its northerly city limits at the extension of Orange Street

6 to its intersection with the extension of Nuevo Road.

7 b. Goetz Road - from Case Road to Ellis Avenue.

8 C. Goetz Road • from the San Jacinto River to Ethanac Road.

9 d. Case Road - from Goetz Road to Perris Boulevard.

10 e. Ethanac Road - from the Western City Limits to Barnett Road.

11 32. The General Plan Amendment, GPA 22-05068, will also add the following road

12 segment to the map: Case Road - from "G" Street to the I-215 Freeway (Bonnie Drive).

13 33. The City staff also prepared a proposed Ordinance Amendment, OA No. OA 22-
14 05069, which purports to make revisions to the City's Municipal Code to reflect the alterations to
15 the City's General Plan's Circulation Element, including the removal of the segment of Ethanac
a 16 Road as a truck route from the western limits of the City of Perris to Barnett Road. The foregoing
17 items are referred to collectively as "the Project."

18 34. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that sometime in
19 March or April of 2022, and before the Respondents published or released any information to the
20 general public on this Project, the City staff had informed at least one government agency of their
21 intent to pursue applications seeking to substantially change the truck routes in the remainder of
22 the City (i.e., the southern half, including Ethanac Road). Other public records indicate that City
23 staff began seeking to consult with the relevant tribes on this Project in early March 2022.

24 35. Shortly after releasing the Southern Negative Declaration, towards the end of May
25 2022, the City released a new Staff Report and hearing item for consideration by the Planning
26 Commission, wherein City staff asked that the Commission recommend approval of the Project.

27 36. On June 1, 2022, the Planning Commission conducted the public hearing for this
28 Project. Despite the numerous and well-founded objections which were timely raised by

& Rutan & Tucker, LLP -8-
attorneys at law 2509/031858-0034 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE FOR VIOLATION OF
18014792.1 a07/14/22 CEOA AND COMPL. FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 Petitioner and other interested parties, the Planning Commission recommended that the City
2 Council approve the Project.

3 37. As stated in the following City Staff Report (June 14, 2022) to the City Council, the
4 Planning Commission "expressed that it is their responsibility to protect Perris residents from air
5 quality, noise, traffic, and quality of life from potential impacts resulting from activities, including
6 truck corridors that would impact residential neighborhoods on the north side of Ethanac Road,"
7 and ultimately voted to recommend approval of the Project, and adoption of the Southern Negative

8 Declaration. (Staff Report, p. 2.)

38. Less than two weeks later, the Project was hastily set for public hearing before the
10 City Council on June 14, 2022. The City Council approved a Resolution, which adopted the
11 Southern Negative Declaration, and approved the General Plan Amendment, and which went into
12 effect immediately. At that same time, the City Council approved an Ordinance, which approved
13 the Ordinance Amendment, and also adopted the Southern Negative Declaration. However, since
14 the amendment was adopted via ordinance, the Ordinance will not go into effect until 30 days after
15  its second reading.

16 39. Respondent's actions improperly subjects Petitioner, and the public generally, to
17 irreparable harm or the imminent risk of irreparable harm due to Respondents' failure to consider
18 or mitigate numerous environmental impacts resulting from the Approvals, including but not
19 limited to traffic, air quality, and land uses. Petitioner has no plain, speedy and adequate remedy
20 at law to set aside and correct Respondents' arbitrary actions, or to prevent or mitigate such harm
21 other than the relief sought in this action, including the issuance of immediate temporary and
22 preliminary injunctive relief.

23 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

24 (Against All Respondents- Petition for Writ of Mandate for Violations of CEQA)

25 40. Petitioner hereby incorporates the allegations of the foregoing paragraphs as though

26 set forth in full herein by this reference.

27 41. Pursuant to CEQA, before a public agency approves any discretionary project or
28 action, the agency must first identify, assess and publicly disclose the project's potential

& Rutan & Tucker, LLP -9-
attorneys at law 2509/031858-0034 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE FOR VIOLATION OF
18014792.1 a07/14/22 CEOA AND COMPL. FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

environmental effects. An agency may not approve a discretionary action that has the potential to
2 have significant environmental impacts if there are feasible alternatives or mitigation measures
3 that would avoid or substantially lessen the adverse environmental impacts.

4 42. In doing the things herein alleged, Respondents failed to comply with their
5 mandatory duties under CEQA in several substantial and prejudicial respects, including without
6 limitation, the following:

7 a. Respondents erroneously and unlawfully asserted that the Approvals would
8 not have the potential to significantly impact the environment, and therefore wrongfully adopted
9 the proposed Southern Negative Declaration; and

10 b. Respondents erroneously failed to consider and evaluate the impacts of the
11 Project on the surrounding environment, including (without limitation) the City of Menifee, or
12 persons, businesses, or other public agencies in that City or any other neighboring community; and

13 C. Respondents erroneously failed to consider and evaluate the regional
14 impacts of the Project on the surrounding environment, including the City of Menifee, or any other

15 neighboring community;

16 d. Respondents erroneously failed to consider and evaluate the cumulative
17 impacts of this Project and other similar projects in the same area, CEQA Guideline § 15330; and

18 e. Respondents erroneously and unlawfully failed to accurately describe or
19 disclose the full scope of the Project to the public; and

20 f. The disputed Project was presented as one component of the City's larger
21 project as a whole, which includes both the modification to the truck routes in the northern portion
22 of the City (which was approved in late 2021/early 2022) as well as this Project's alteration to the
23 truck routes in the remaining southern and central portions of the City, but Respondents
24 erroneously and unlawfully chopped the larger project (modifying all of the truck routes in the
25 City) into small components for piecemeal assessment, so as to minimize or avoid the
26 Respondents' obligations under CEQA to provide meaningful and comprehensive environmental
27 analysis of the "project as a whole" in violation of CEQA, e.g., CEQA Guidelines 15069, and
28 Laurel Heights Impr. Ass'n V. Regents of the Univ. of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 396;

18014792.1 a07/14/22 CEOA AND COMPL. FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 g. Respondents failed to timely and fairly disclose or consider reasonable

2 alternatives and feasible mitigation measures to the design option approved as part of the
3 Approvals for the Project; and

4 h. Respondents failed to comply with its mandatory duties under CEQA in

5 numerous other respects, as detailed in the objections previously submitted on behalf of Petitioner
6 and by others, which are a part of this record.

7 43. Respondents failed to adequately disclose or provide evidence and analysis
8 revealing that the Approvals will have significant adverse impacts that the City failed to address or
9 mitigate prior to their actions.

10 44. Respondents failed to make required findings when acting on the Approvals and/or
11 any findings made were not supported by substantial evidence in light of the whole record.

12 45. Respondents' actions in approving the Project were not in compliance with
13 procedures required by law, were not supported by substantial evidence in the public record, were
14 not reflected in legally adequate findings, and were arbitrary, capricious, and reflected a
15 prejudicial abuse of discretion.

16 46. Respondents became committed to, and unlawfully approved, the specific Project
17 before having conducted and completed the necessary environmental analysis under CEQA.

18 47. Petitioner is further informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that the Project as
19 approved will have significant adverse impacts on the environment, including, but not limited to,
20 the issues raised in Petitioner's comment letters and other interested parties' comment letters, and
21 other issues that were identified at the time of the hearing.

22 48. Petitioner has beneficial interest in the issues raised in this action and will be

23 directly and significantly impacted by the arbitrary and unreasonable actions of Respondents.

24 49. Petitioner has performed any and all conditions precedent to filing this action and
25 has exhausted any and all available and feasible administrative remedies to the extent required by
26 law by, inter alia, timely submitting written and oral comments objecting to the Respondents'
27 threatened actions, proceedings, and Approvals at each stage of the City's administrative process.
28 Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that to the extent any matter raised in this

1 Petition was not addressed in Petitioner's comments, such matters were raised by other persons or

2 entities who objected to the Project, or that Petitioner had no effective opportunity to raise such
3 comments before the complained of actions were taken, or that Petitioner was otherwise excused
4 from or not obligated to raise such issues before pursuing them in this action.

5 50. Pursuant to PRC section 21167.5, Petitioner has provided written notice of the
6 commencement of this action to Respondents.

7 51. Pursuant to PRC section 21167.7, and CCP section 388, Petitioner has or will
8 provide timely written notice of this action, including a copy of this Petition, to the State Attorney

9 General.

10 52. Petitioner brings this action pursuant to PRC sections 21168 and 21168.5 and Code

11 of Civil Procedure sections 1085, 1088.5 and 1094.5, which require that an agency's approval of a
12 project be set aside where, as here, the agency's actions and decisions are not supported by
13 substantial evidence in the record, or the agency has failed to proceed in the manner required by
14 law, or has prejudicially abused its discretion, or has acted arbitrarily and capriciously.

15 53. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 and/or 1085, a writ of mandate
16 should issue directing Respondents to rescind the Approvals, and prohibiting Respondents from
17 taking any subsequent action to implement or enforce the Approvals, unless and until they have
18 complied with CEQA, including, but not limited to, by preparing an environmental impact report
19 analyzing the impacts of the Project, and the whole effort to re-organize the truck routes
20 throughout the City, including this disputed Project, and feasible alternatives and mitigation
21 measures to avoid the impacts of the Project.

22 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

23 (Against All Parties -- Violation of Public Resources Code § 21091

24 Failure to Provide Sufficient Public Review Period)

25 54. Petitioner hereby incorporates the allegations of the foregoing paragraphs as though

26 set forth in full herein by this reference.

27 55. Public Resources Code § 21092 requires that a lead agency must provide public
28 notice of its preparation of a negative declaration for a reasonable period of time prior to its

& Rutan & Tucker, LLP -12-
attorneys at law 2509/031858-0034 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE FOR VIOLATION OF
18014792.1 a07/14/22 CEOA AND COMPL. FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 adoption of the negative declaration and Public Resources Code § 21091 requires that the lead
2 agency must provide an adequate period for public review of and comment on a proposed negative
3 declaration, and in the case of a negative declaration that addresses the impacts of a project that

4 can have a "regional" or "area wide significance," as in this case, that the review period must be at
5 least thirty (30) days. (PRC § 21091(b).)

6 56. Here, Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that the Project

7 would have a regional and/or areawide significance. The record shows that even City Staff
8 acknowledged that the Project may require modifications to the I-215 freeway, and/or
modifications to infrastructure within the City of Menifee or otherwise outside the jurisdiction of
10 the City of Perris. Further, by purporting to remove Ethanac Road as a designated roadway,
11 Respondents are admitting that they are altering a portion of a roadway that is operated by two
12 separate jurisdictions, the City of Menifee and the City of Peris. Accordingly, it is clear that the
13 Project is of regional significance.

14 57. Despite the Project being of regional significance, Petitioner is informed and
15 believes, and on that basis alleges, that the Southern Negative Declaration was only circulated for
16 a 20-day period, in violation of the plain requirements of PRC § 21091.

17 58. Petitioner brings this action pursuant to PRC sections 21168 and 21168.5 and Code
18 of Civil Procedure sections 1085, 1088.5 and 1094.5, which require that an agency's approval of a
19 project be set aside if the agency has prejudicially abused its discretion, or has acted arbitrarily and
20 capriciously. Pursuant to CCP § 1094.5(b), an agency abuses its discretion where, as here, an
21 agency has not proceeded in the manner required by law.

22 59. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 and/or 1085, a writ of mandate
23 should issue directing Respondents to rescind the Approvals, and prohibiting Respondents from
24 taking any subsequent action to implement or enforce the Approvals, unless and until they have
25 complied with CEQA's notice and comment period, and provided the requisite 30-day notice

26 period found in PRC § 21091.

N- THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

3 (Alternative or Peremptory Writ of Mandate - for Mandamus Relief Against All

4 60. Parties -- Ultra Vires Action (Vehicle Code § 35702))

5 Petitioner hereby incorporates the allegations of the foregoing paragraphs as though

set forth in full herein by this reference.

6 61. As recognized by the Southern Negative Declaration, under Vehicle Code § 35701,
7 cities have limited authority to "prohibit the use of a street by any commercial vehicle except for
8 public utility vehicles or any commercial vehicle on a direct route from an unrestricted street for
9 the purpose of making pickups or deliveries." (Southern Negative Declaration, p. 5.) Further,
10 "[i]n response to this authority, the City of Perris has over the years established approved truck
11 routes on select roadway segments within and around its jurisdiction."

12 62. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that the Respondents
13 approved the Project, and removed the impacted streets as designated truck routes pursuant to
14 Vehicle Code § 35701.

15 63. Indeed, even the recently-amended Municipal Code, reflects that the truck routes
16 are being prohibited pursuant to Vehicle Code § 35701. (See Perris Municipal Code, Ch. 10.40, n.1.)

17 64. However, the authority granted by Vehicle Code § 35701 is circumscribed by
18 Vehicle Code § 35702, which provides, in part: "No ordinance proposed under Section 35701 is
19 effective with respect to any highway which is not under the exclusive jurisdiction of the local
20 authority enacting the ordinance ..." (Veh. Code § 35702, emphasis added.)

21 65. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that Ethanac Road is
22 a highway that is not under the exclusive authority of the Respondent City, but rather lies partially
23 within the jurisdictions of both the City of Menifee and City of Perris. As such, the City of Perris
24 had no legal authority to de-designate Ethanac Road as a designated truck route. (See Skyline
25 Materials, Inc. V. City of Belmont (1961) 198 Cal.App.2d 449, p. 458 ["It is a not a boundary street
26 separating one city from another or from unincorporated territory and lying partially in each. Such
27 a boundary street doubtless would be within the prohibition [of § 35702]."].)

28 66.

& Rutan & Tucker, LLP Accordingly, the disputed actions of the Respondents, purporting to de-designate

attorneys at law -14-

2509/031858-0034
18014792.1 a07/14/22 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE FOR VIOLATION OF
CEOA AND COMPL. FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 the portions of Ethanac Road that are shared with the City of Menifee as a truck route were and
2 are ultra-vires action which is void.

3 67. The Court is therefore requested to issue its alternative Writ of Mandate,
4 commanding the Respondents to immediately rescind and permanently set aside such action, or in

5 the alternative to Show Cause based on applicable law and substantial and admissible evidence, in

6 a prompt and timely manner as to why they should not be so mandated.

7 68. Alternatively, Petitioner seeks a peremptory writ of mandate pursuant to CCP

8 § 1094.5 and/or § 1085, commanding Respondents to rescind their action to de-designate Ethanac
a 9 Road as a designated truck route.

10 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

11 (Against All Respondents - Alternative Writ of Mandate - To Set Aside Ordinance That

12 Unreasonably Disregards Regional Welfare)

13 69. Petitioners hereby incorporate the allegations of the foregoing paragraphs as though
14 set forth in full herein by this reference.

15 70. As the California Supreme Court has declared:

16 [MJunicipalities are not isolated islands remote from the needs and

17 problems of the area in which they are located; thus an ordinance, superficially reasonable from the limited viewpoint of the [enacting] municipality, may be

18 disclosed as unreasonable when viewed from a larger perspective. ...

19 These considerations impel us to the conclusion that the proper constitutional test is one which inquires whether the ordinance reasonably relates to

20 the welfare of those whom it significantly affects. If its impact is limited to the city boundaries, the inquiry may be limited accordingly; if, as alleged here, the

21 ordinance may strongly influence . an entire metropolitan region, judicial inquiry must consider the welfare of that region. (Associated Home Builders V. City of Livermore (1976) 18 Cal.3d 582, 607.)
22

23 71. The actions of the Respondents as alleged in detail above, including the actions and
24 Approvals resulting in the de-designation of critical portions of Ethanac Road for truck use, were
25 unreasonable and arbitrary, in conscious disregard of the public health, safety, and welfare of
26 adjoining communities and the region around the City of Perris impacted and influenced by the
27 Respondents' unilateral and exclusionary actions, and in excess of Respondents' statutory
28 authority or police power authority. Indeed, the Respondents expressly acknowledged on the

& Rutan & Tucker, LLP -15-

18014792.1 a07/14/22 CEOA AND COMPL. FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

record that their actions were intended to prohibit and exclude truck traffic that originated from

2 outside the City of Perris from coming through the City, and further indicated an unwillingness to
3 consider the impacts of such a prohibition on the neighboring communities.

4 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

5 (Against All Defendants -- For Declaratory And Injunctive Relief Pursuant to

6 Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1060, 526, and 527)

7 72. Petitioner hereby incorporates the allegations of the foregoing paragraphs as though
8 set forth in full herein by this reference.

73. An actual controversy exists between Petitioner and Respondents, involving the
10 invalidity and legal effect of the Project and resulting Approvals as described above.

11 74. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that Respondents contend
12 that the Approvals were properly and lawfully adopted, in full compliance with all state and local
13 laws, and result in prohibition of any vehicle over five tons from using Ethanac Road, and that

14 any property located directly to the south of the recently de-designated portion of Ethanac Road
15 may not lawfully be accessed from Ethanac Road by any vehicle over five tons, and will instead
16 be required to have any truck traffic use different streets in light of this prohibition.

17 75. Petitioner disputes such contentions.

18 76. Conversely, Petitioner contends that the Respondents did not proceed in the manner
19 required by law, that Respondents' actions were not supported by substantial evidence, that
20 Respondents' actions unlawfully disregard and impair the vested rights of Petitioner and others in

21 the lawful use of Ethanac Road as a designated truck route.

22 77. Petitioner also contends that, even assuming, arguendo, the City could legally de-
23 designate Ethanac Road under Vehicle Code § 35701, Vehicle Code § 35703 would specifically
24 allow any property located against Ethanac Road to continue to accommodate truck traffic for the
25 purposes of "making pickups or deliveries of goods, wares, and merchandise from or to any
26 building or structure located on the restricted street. . .." (See Vehicle Code § 35703.)

27 78. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that Respondents dispute
28 the foregoing contentions and maintain the contrary, such that an actual controversy now exists

& Rutan & Tucker, LLP -16-

18014792.1 a07/14/22 CEOA AND COMPL. FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 between the parties.

2 79. Accordingly, declaratory relief is appropriate as provided by Code of Civil

3 Procedure section 1060, and necessary to determine the controversies, to judicially declare that the
4 Respondents' attempts to de-designate Ethanac Road as a truck route are unlawful and void, and

5 that the property located along the restricted portions Ethanac Road both to the north and south,
6 will be allowed to continue to be accessed by vehicles in excess of five tones, and receive pickups

7 or deliveries of goods, wares and merchandise from or to any building or structure located, and to

8 provide appropriate declaratory and injunctive relief.

80. To remedy Respondents' violations of their obligations, as described above,
10 Petitioner seeks equitable relief, including a judicial declaration of the limitations of the
11| Respondents' Approvals, as well as preliminary and permanent injunctive relief.

12 SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION

13 (Against All Defendants For Declaratory And Injunctive Relief - Violations of

14 Commitments for Regional Transportation Planning and Improvements)

15 81. Petitioners hereby incorporate the allegations of the foregoing paragraphs as though

16 set forth in full herein by this reference.

17 82. Petitioners are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that Ethanac Road is

18 and has been recognized as an important route, part of a significant regional transportation
19 network between I-15 and I-215, for which plans, commitments, and funds have been devoted for

20 many years, including funding from jurisdictions other than the Respondent City of Perris.

21 83. For example, in 2014, the Riverside County Transportation Commission committed

22 $2 million of "2009 Measure A Western Riverside County New Corridors Program" funds to fund
23 a multi-jurisdictional study and planning for an improved east-west vehicular corridor between I-
24 15 and I-215, incorporating Ethanac Road.

25 84. In or about February 2017, the Riverside County Transportation Commission, the
26 Riverside County Transportation Department, the Cities of Menifee, Lake Elsinore, and Perris
27 entered into a formal written agreement (RTIC Agreement No. 16-31-102-00) providing for joint
28 funding and cooperation among those agencies in conducting the study and planning for the

& Rutan & Tucker, LLP -17-

18014792.1 a07/14/22 CEOA AND COMPL. FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 improved "Ethanac Corridor." Petitioners are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that
2 those jurisdictions have subsequently made plans to create an improved east-west vehicular
3 corridor between I-15 and I-215, incorporating Ethanac Road, expanding it up to five travel lanes
4 in each direction, and extending Ethanac Road to Highway 74 to the west as part of the "Ethanac

5 Expressway Project."

6 85. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereon allege, that Ethanac Road has
7 been also been included in the planning and financing of significant regional roadways and truck

8 routes conducted by the regional planning agency, Western Riverside Council of Governments,
9 Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereon allege, that fees and assessments collected by
10 WRCOG from developers and property owners, including Petitioners, have been justified and

11 calculated on the basis that a portion of such fees have been or will be used to improve Ethanac
12 Road as a recognized significant regional transportation corridor.

13 86. Respondents' actions and unilateral Approvals, as alleged above, are inconsistent
14 with, frustrate the purpose of, and violate such regional transportation commitments and
15 agreements.

16 87. An actual controversy exists between Petitioners and Respondents, involving the
17 invalidity and legal effect of the disputed Approvals as described above, and the Respondents'
18 obligations to make restitution or otherwise remedy the harms caused by their unilateral actions.

19 88. Petitioners seek equitable relief, including a judicial declaration of the rights and
20 obligations of the parties under such regional transportation commitments and funding
21 agreements, and injunctive relief enjoining the Respondents from implementing the disputed
22 Approvals.

23 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

24 WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully prays for judgment as follows:

25 1. For issuance of an alternative and peremptory Writ of Mandate:

26 a. Directing Respondents, and each of them, to immediately rescind and set
27 aside the Approvals, particularly the approvals of the de-designation of Ethanac Road, or to show

1 mandated;

2 b. Commanding Respondents to refrain from taking any further actions in
3 furtherance or implementation of the disputed Project Approvals without leave of Court upon a

7 project as a whole, and circulate it for public review and comment, consistent with the

9 subsequent action on the proposed Project.

10 2. For an alternative or peremptory writ pursuant to CCP con 1087, ordering the
11 Respondents to rescind and set aside their Approvals, to the extent they purported to prohibit truck
12 traffic on a highway that is subject to the jurisdiction of both the Cities of Perris and Menifee (i.e.,
13 Ethanac Road), or in the alternative to show cause at a hearing, a at which the City of Perris will
14 have to show cause as to why it has not complied;

15 3. For a peremptory Writ of Mandate commanding Respondents to vacate, rescind
16 and set aside the disputed Approvals, unless and until the Respondents are able to present their
17 Return to such Writ to the Court and Petitioner, demonstrating to the satisfaction of the Court that
18 Respondents have provided lawful public notice, prepared a new and legally-compliant initial
19 study, and a legally-compliant environmental impact report either for this particular Project or for
20 the whole truck-route reorganization project as a whole, and circulate it for public review and
21 comment, consistent with the requirements of CEQA, and to comply with all other requirements
22 of CEQA, prior to taking any subsequent action on the proposed Project

23 4. For the declaratory relief requested above;

24 5. For preliminary injunctive relief ordering the Respondents to refrain from
25 implementing or enforcing the Approvals, or undertaking any work on the Project, while this
