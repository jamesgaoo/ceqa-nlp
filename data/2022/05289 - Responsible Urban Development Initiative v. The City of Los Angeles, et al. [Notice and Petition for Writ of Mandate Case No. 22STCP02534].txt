25 Petitioner Responsible Urban Development Initiative (hereinafter "Petitioner") seeks a

26 writ of mandamus, declaratory, and injunctive relief against Respondents and Defendants City of

27 Los Angeles and Los Angeles City Planning Commission (sometimes collectively the "City"),

28 and alleges as follows:

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

T INTRODUCTION

2 1. This petition challenges the City's actions in approving: (a) "Off-Menu" Density

3 Bonus incentives (including by converting "on-menu" incentives to "off-menu" incentives) and

4 Waiver of Development Standards pursuant to Los Angeles Municipal Code ("LAMC") §

5 12.22.A.25(g); (b) a Conditional Use permit pursuant to LAMC § 12.24 § to provide relief from the

6 restrictions of LAMC § 12.11, allowing 86 dwelling units in lieu of 57 units believed to be

7 otherwise permitted in the [Q]C2-1VL Zone and allowing a Density Bonus for a Housing

8 Development Project to permit an increase in square footage of floor area from the zoned

9 maximum of 33,750 square feet to 84,662 square feet, far in excess of the 35-percent maximum

10 permitted in LAMC §§ 12.22.A.25 and U.26; (c) a Determination that the project is a Streamlined

11 Infill Project pursuant to SB 35 allegedly in compliance with Government Code § 65913.4(a),
BAKER & HOSTETLER LLP ATTORNEYS AT LAW STTEUNY 50T 12 despite its location in a very high fire hazard severity zone, which thereby bars the streamlined

13 process; and (d) a finding of Statutory Exemption from the California Environmental Quality Act

14 (*CEQA"), and other associated entitlements (collectively "Land Use Entitlements"). The

15 entitlements would allow the construction of an approximately 86-unit, seven-story, 83-foot and

16 ten-inch-tall, residential and commercial development in a very a high fire hazard severity zone in

17 the Silver Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles, located at 3209-3227 W. Sunset Blvd. (the

18 "Project"), and identified by the case number CPC-2021-2035-DB-CU-CUB-SPR-HCA. The

19 entitlements granted by the City enable Real Parties to develop the Project in a manner not

20 otherwise allowed by the underlying zoning, and in a manner that will create material issues of

21 safety, health, and environmental impact in the surrounding neighborhood.

22 2. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that the Project is

23 one of at least three major developments being built by the same developer, using subsidiary

24 limited liability corporations, along a vulnerable stretch of Sunset Blvd. that is the single major

25 east-west corridor through the Silver Lake neighborhood. Each of these projects has materially

26 increased density beyond zoning, materially decreased or erased parking requirements, materially

27 exceeded height restrictions such that this Project will create the tallest building in Silver Lake,

28 and will have the effect of dramatically changing the neighborhood in ways that will create issues

2
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

L of safety, health, and material environmental impact. The subject Project is not located in a TOC

2 zone, but is in an area that has only two bus lines, one of which was recently downgraded to

3 remove its downtown service.

4 3. The subject Project is located in a very high fire hazard severity zone, surrounded
5 by hillsides with narrow, winding streets. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon

6 alleges, that the developer's application and supporting papers did not disclose, or did not

7 sufficiently disclose, that the Project is located in a very high fire hazard severity zone and

8 therefore is not eligible for streamlined review. Insufficient available parking means that the

9 streets are already overcrowded, that red zones are routinely filled with illegally parked cars, and
10 that fire trucks and other large emergency vehicles have difficulty accessing the neighborhood.

11 Petitioner is informed and believes. and based thereon alleges, that the Project and its companion
MVT LV SAINJOLLY d77 8371315OH 5 NIXV8 12 developments have been approved on the fictional claim that, if there is no underground onsite 53730NY $01 13 parking for most residents, the residents who move into the building will be willing to forego
14 owning a car. Reality suggests that this Project and its companion developments will introduce
15 hundreds of new cars into the surrounding neighborhood, searching for free parking on narrow
16 and already-crowded streets, blocking access for emergency vehicles, and forcing residents to
17 drive throughout the neighborhood in search of parking far from their homes, thereby introducing
18 substantial additional vehicle emissions into the atmosphere. The developers may wish to avoid
19 the cost of providing their residents with available parking, but this does not reduce car traffic in
20 Los Angeles. Instead, it puts the costs of such parking economic, safety and environmental
21 costsonto the backs of surrounding residents.

22 4. Petitioner seeks a writ of mandamus invalidating the City's determination that the
23 Project is exempt from the California Environmental Quality Act, based upon violations of
24 CEQA. Petitioner further seeks a writ of mandamus, inter alia: (a) invalidating and setting aside
25 the Project; and (b) compelling the City to comply with CEQA prior to consideration of any
26 further resolutions, legislative actions or other approvals concerning the Project.
27 5. Petitioner alleges that the City's determination that the Project qualifies as a
28 Streamlined Infill Project violates the provisions of California Government Code 65913.4, and

3
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

-

2 Public Resources Code § 21080, including but not limited to the Project's location in a very high

3 fire hazard severity zone. Petitioner seeks a writ of mandamus invalidating and setting aside such
approvals.

4 6.

5 Petitioner further alleges that the City's approval of "off-menu" incentives for the

6 Project violates LAMC § 12.22.A.25(g), and Government Code § 65915(d)(1)(B), including but

7 not limited to the manner by which the City permitted limited "on-menu" incentives to be freely

8 granted as near-unlimited "off-menu" incentives, thereby erasing regulatory limitations designed

9 to cap such incentives. Petitioner seeks a writ of mandamus invalidating and setting aside such
approvals.

24 JURISDICTION AND VENUE
25 14. This Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of this Petition, and venue is
26 properly in Los Angeles County, State of California, for the following reasons:
27 a. Plaintiff is an association of homeowners and residents of Los Angeles
28 County, California;

5
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

b. The Project site is located in Los Angeles County, California; and

2 C. The Respondents' wrongful conduct complained of herein took place in

3 this judicial district.

4 15. This Petition is timely. The Corrected Letter of Determination from which this

5 Petition is taken was dated and mailed as of March 29, 2022. The City Council had five council

6 days (Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday) under Section 245 of the LA City Charter to review and take

7 jurisdiction of the matter, or it would become final. The last day for the City Council to have

8 acted under Charter § 245 was April 8, 2022. Ninety days from April 8, 2022 is July 7, 2022. On

9 July 6, 2022, counsel for Plaintiff served a Notice of Intent to Sue on the Defendants by personal
10 service, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit B.

11 SUMMARY OF FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS BAKER & HOSTETLER LLP MVT LY SAUNXOLLV 12 A. The Silver Lake Neighborhood and Sunset Corridor $3730NV 507 13 16. The Project is located on W. Sunset Blvd., between Silver Lake Blvd. and
14 Micheltorena Street, in a designated very high fire hazard severity zone, a designation that bars
15 streamlined review of a construction project. Such status was ignored by the City in its review of
16 the Project.

17 17. The neighborhood that lies directly behind the Project is a hillside of narrow,
18 winding streets, that are overcrowded with parked cars. The result is that large trucksincluding
19 emergency vehicles such as fire trucks have insecure access to the neighborhood. At the same
20 time, the hillside has only three outlets onto a major street to serve as evacuation routes. A line of
21 evacuating cars along streets that are frequently one-lane-only would bar access to any emergency
22 vehicles. The designation of this neighborhood as very high fire hazard severity zone is
23 supported by substantial grounds, and the City's willingness to ignore this designation is an abuse
24 of discretion.

25 18. The Project is one of three large residential/commercial projects being constructed
26 by the same developer-RYDA-on a short stretch of Sunset Blvd. The property On which the
27 Project is to be constructed is not in a TOC zone. All three RYDA projects appear designed to
28 take advantage of a mantra that seems present in considerations given to development projects in

6
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

- Los Angeles at this time: that all increased density is good for Los Angeles, and that increased

2 density without parking means that only residents without cars will move into the developments.

3 This mantra presumes without consideration that there is sufficient public transit near each

4 development, that residents will work in arcas accessible by public transit, and that residents in

5 large and sprawling city will abandon the idea of owning a car rather than merely reduce the

6 number of times each week when they drive that car. It is a mantra that allows developers to

7 forego the expense of underground parking, while burdening every neighborhood with a flood of

8 cars each time a new development is constructed.

9 19. Petitioner's concern is not as simple as "parking." Rather, the concern is the

10 impact that a flood of cars will have on hillside neighborhoods of narrow, winding streets, with

11 insufficient parking, with accessibility concerns, within a high fire risk severity zone, and with
BAXER & HOSTETLER LLP MV'I LV SAINXOLLV 12
S9T3DNY S07 history of delayed responses from local fire departments because of traffic and accessibility

13 issues. Self-contained density would have a limited impact on a neighborhood. Density that

14 depends on surrounding streets to serve as a parking lot in order to reduce the developer's costs is

15 density that will create material issues of health and safety in a neighborhood such as Silver Lake.

16 B. The RYDA Project

17 20. RYDA is a very active developer in the Silver Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles.

18 Several of RYDA's recent projects in Silver Lake have been renovations of existing buildings

19 that maintain the neighborhood's character, and are admirable in their design and execution. The

20 Project at issue in this Petition, however, is one of three residential/commercial buildings that

21 RYDA has planned to develop along a short stretch of W. Sunset Blvd., between Silver Lake

22 Blvd. and Micheltorena St., that will have a material impact on the health, safety, and
23 environment of the neighborhood.

24 21. The Project is located at 3209-3227 W. Sunset Blvd. Petitioner is informed and

25 believes, and based thereon alleges, that the original proposal that came before a public hearing in

26 September 2021 proposed 82 residential units with 69 parking spaces, plus 9,376 square feet of

27 commercial and officc space that had no dedicated parking. The Project also originally requested

28 a variety of "off-menu "incentives, and many waivers of development standards, including a 42.5

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

2 percent increase of density (based on units, not square footage), permission to build to 7 stories
instead of 3 stories, a 32 percent reduction in residential parking, a 100 percent reduction in
3 retail/commercial parking, and a height increase from the permitted 45 feet to nearly 82 feet,

4

5 among others. Many of these "off-menu" incentives and waivers are simply "on-menu"

6 incentives that have been improperly described as "off-menu" incentives as the means to erase all

7 limitations and requirements for such incentives, and obtain unprecedented variances beyond
zoning and regulations.

8 22. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that the Project was

10 then revised by the developer to increase density, decrease parking, and request further "off-menu

11 incentives" and waivers. At the final hearing it appeared from somewhat incomplete

BAKER & HOSTETLER LUP ATTORNEYS AT LAW 12 documentation sent by the City to local residents that RYDA increased the proposed units from

6373DNY S 13 82 to 86 units, with the same 69 parking spots, but with no requirement that any of the parking be

14 dedicated for residents, but that it serve as both commercial and residential parking without any

15 specific designation for either (except for very low-income requirements). The City's notice

16 further stated that the developer had requested that its original request for a rear setback reduction
to 15 feet 9 and 9 inches be reduced further to a rear setback of 0. a

17 It's original request for a

18 reduction of open space by 20% became a 24% requested reduction. The proposal became even

19 taller, as RYDA's original request for a height increase from 45 feet to 81 feet and 10 inches was
amended to request 83 feet and 10 inches-a height that has
20 no comparison or precedent

21 anywhere in Silver Lake. The highest building in Silver Lake at this time is five storics. This

22 Project will create a new precedent in height, along with a new precedent in requiring the
neighborhood to carry

23 the costs of the development's lack of parking. While the City has placed

24 an obligation on the developer to provide parking for the low-income units from the 69 untethered

25 parking spots, the remainder will most certainly go to the highest bidder - commercial or those

26 tenants who are willing to pay a high price for limited a parking. The rest of the Project's residents,

27 employees, and commercial customers, will default to neighboring streets that have no space for
them simply because therc is no

28 other option. If the Los Angeles average for car ownership is

8
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

even approximated by the residents of his development, it would add yet another approx. 75-100
2 new vehicles parking on packed hillside streets.

23. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that the City held a
4 public hearing on the Project on January 13, 2022, at which multiple objections were heard, along

5 with written objections filed prior to the hearing. The City granted the Project's requests for
6 incentives and a waivers in a Corrected Letter of Determination dated March 29, 2022 (the

7 "LOD"), attached hereto as Exhibit A.

8 24. In the LOD, the CPC also found that the Project is exempt from CEQA and that
9 there is no substantial evidence demonstrating that an exception to a categorical exemption to
10 CEQA Guidelines, Section 15300.2, applies. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based
11 thereon alleges, that the City of Los Angeles has not yet rendered a final decision on the CEQA
ATTORNEYS AT LAW J77 X9TL3LSOH 2 aaxva 12
S'IRUNY aspect of the Project, and will amend this Petition upon such ruling becoming final.
13 C. The Project Exceeds Permitted Incentives and Waivers

14 25. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that neither the
15 LOD, the developer's Application, nor supporting materials, disclosed that the Project is to be
16 built in a high fire hazard severity zone, nor that the Project is therefore ineligible for streamlined
17 review.

18 26. In the LOD, the City approved a Conditional Use Permit to allow a Density a Bonus
19 increase far greater than is permitted by LAMC Section 213.33 A.25. The City granted a series
20 of waivers and "off-menu" incentives far in excess of what is permitted under applicable
21 regulations, including by converting various "on-menu" incentives to "off-menu" incentives in
22 direct violation of City regulations, including:
23 a. An"Off-Menu" Incentive to permit a "100 percent decrease in residential
24 parking";

25 b. An "Off-Menu" Incentive to permit a "100 percent decrease in required
26 commercial parking";
27 c. An "Off-Menu" Incentive to permit an "increase of Floor Area Ratio (FAR) from
28 1.5:1 to 3.76:1";

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

d.

AW N A "Waiver of Development Standards to permit an increase in stories from three
stories to seven stories";

e. A "Waiver of Development Standards to permit a reduction in side yard setbacks

5 from 10 feet to zero feet";

f. A "Waiver of Development Standards to permit a reduction in rear yard setbacks

7 from 20 feet to zero feet"; and

g.

8 A "Waiver of Development Standards to permit a height increase from 45 feet to

9 27. 83 feet and 10 inches", among other approved conditions.

10 The City approved a Density Bonus for a Housing Development Project to permit

11
d77 XIT13150H N H3XVg an increase in square footage of floor area from the zoned maximum of 33,750 square feet to

LOS ANGELES ATTORNEYS AT LA 12 84,662 square feet, far in excess of the 35-percent maximum permitted in LAMC §§ 12.22.A.25

and U.26.

13 28.

14 Perhaps most importantly, the CPC eoncluded that "pursuant to CEQA Guidelines,

15 Section 15332, Class 32, that the project is exempt from CEQA and that there is no substantial

16 evidence demonstrating that an exception to a categorical exemption pursuant to CEQA

17 Guidelines, Section 15300.2 applies."

29.

18 Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that the City granted

19 the above-listed Off-Menu Incentives and waivers of development standards, including its

20 decision that "there is no substantial evidence demonstrating that an exception to a categorical

21 exemption pursuant to CEQA" that applies, without consideration of relevant evidence, and

22 without consideration of the cumulative impact that RYDA's three major residential/commercial

23 projects will have on the same small area. Two of these three RYDA projects are located in a

24 very high fire hazard zone. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that the

25 evidence provided to support such decisions were conclusory statements presented without

26 support, such as claims that the Project will have no impact on traffic in the surrounding hillsides,

27 without any legitimate survey of study having been carried out, and without any cumulative

28 impact having been considered. The traffic study that the developer presented to the city was

10
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

F

2 based on 2021 traffic patterns, during the peak of Covid when traffic patterns were at
unprecedented low levels.

3 30.

4 Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that the City

5 violated the intent, purpose, and meaning of applicable regulations and laws by treating various

6 incentives that are regulated as limited "on-menu incentives" as "off-menu incentives" in order to

7 provide the Project with excess "incentives" than are permitted under applicable law, and without

8 the requisite showing that any incentives that might have been permitted as "on-menu" incentives

9 would have been necessary for the Project's low-income units to be affordable for the developer,

10 and should somehow be permitted as "off-menu" incentives with fewer limits.

31.

11
BAKER & HOSTETLER LLP The developer's justification presented to the City for a refusal to excavate parking

ATTORNEYS AT LA OS ANGELES 12 is the claim that it would be expensive because of the water table, while the need for an approx.

13 150% increase in density by square footage is necessary to make the Project affordable. A more

14 reasonable way to describe this is that the property on which the Project is to be located is

15 property that cannot support a seven-story building in an a economical and responsible manner.

16 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

17 (Violation of CEQA And CEQA Guidelines; Does Not Comply with CEQA)

32. (Against All Defendants)

18 Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference herein each and every allegation

19 contained in paragraphs 1 through 31 of this Petition as though set forth in full hereat.

33.

20 Petitioner is informed and belicves, and based thereon alleges, that the decision of

21 the CPC pertaining to CEQA remains subject to final approval of the City of Los Angeles. This

22 Petition will be amended once such decision is addressed by the City. As the decision of the CPC

23 is final, and therefore this claim is ripe, it is filed at this time to preserve the claim.
34.

24 CEQA requires a lead agency for a project to comply with the requirements of the

25 statute. The lead agency must also provide for public review and comment on the project and

26 associated environmental documentation. An agency must provide sufficient environmental

27 analysis such that decision-makers can intelligently consider environmental consequences when
acting on proposed projects.

28

11
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

L 35. The CPC violated the statute by concluding, without sufficient evidence or

2 consideration, that "there is no substantial evidence demnonstrating that an exception to a

3 categorical exemption pursuant to CEQA" applies to the Project.

4 36. The statutory exemption identified by the CPC does not apply to the Project.

5 CEQA Guidelines, Section 15332, Class 32, exempts projects that "would not result in any

6 significant effects relating to traffic, noise, air quality ..." The CPC failed to consider evidence

7 provided during and prior to the public hearing demonstrating that the Project--alone or by the

8 cumulative impact of all three RYDA projects-will have a material effect on traffic and air

9 quality in the surrounding neighborhood.

10 37. The business that has stood for decades on the property to be utilized by the

11 Project is an auto body repair and painting business. The developer disclosed that the site has
d71 83713150H * M3NYE VTLY SAINVOLLY 12
LOS ANGELES been used for the storage of hazardous waste onsite since 1951. And while the developer

13 proposed a plan for removal of underground storage tanks, the CPC failed to recognize that the

14 existence of long-standing hazardous waste storage next to residential lots, and construction on

15 that lot, would create "significant effects relating to ., air quality" and environmental impact,

16 thereby requiring a CEQA review.

17 38. As a result of the CPC's violations of CEQA, Petitioner has been harmed in that

18 Petitioner and other members of the public were not fully informed about the significant

19 environmental impacts of the Project prior to the CPC's approval of the Project as Statutorily
20 Exempt, and as the CPC did not sufficiently take into account evidence provided by members of
21 the public demonstrating a material environmental impact. As a result of the foregoing defects,
22 the CPC prejudicially abused its discretion by adopting findings that do not comply with the
23 requirements of CEQA and by approving the Project in reliance thereon. Accordingly, the CPC's
24 approval of the finding that the Project is Statutorily Exempt from CEQA, and approval of the
25 Project and the Land Use Entitlements, must be set aside. Petitioner as well as members of the

26 general public will suffer irreparable harm if the relief requested herein is not granted and the
27 Project is allowed to operate in the absence of full and adequate CEQA review, and absent
28 compliance with all other applicable provisions of CEQA and other laws.

SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION (Violation Of Senate Bill (SB) 35, Government Code $ 65913.4) § 2 (Against All Defendants)

3 39. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference herein each and every allegation

4 contained in paragraphs 1 through 38 of this Petition as though set forth in full hereat.

5 40. A Streamlined Infill Project is required to satisfy all of the objective planning

6 standards enumerated in Government Code § 65913.4. The Project fails this requirement in

7 several inanners.

8 41. Government Code § 65913.4(a)(6)(D) provides that the streamlined process does

9 not apply if the development is located on a lot within a "a very high fire hazard severity zone,"

10 a unless excluded by a local agency. The Project is located on lots on the north side of Sunset

11 Blvd., in a very high fire hazard severity zone. These lots have not been exempted from such
BAKER & HOSTETLER LLP MVT LV SAINJOLLY 12 designation by the Los Angeles Fire Department, and are diselosed as such on the City's Zimas
3139NV 507 13 website for the pages for each such lot. See https://www.lafd.org/fire-zone.And see
14 http://zimas.lacity.org("Additional" tab). The City violated Government Code
15 65913.4(a)(6)(D) by permitting the Project to proceed by the streamlined process. Petitioner is

16 informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that the City did not exclude the Project from

17 the lot's designation as a very high fire hazard severity zone, and that if such exclusion is

18 claimed, it was carried out without notice and without due process. As the California Court of

19 Appeals recently explained, "[d]eveloping new homes and stores in a very high fire hazard area a

20 risks exacerbating the hazard by putting more people and property in harm's way and increasing

21 the chance of a wildfire starting." League to Save Lake Tahoe Mountain v. County of Placer, 75

22 Cal.App.4th 63, 136 (2022). A large volume of new cars introduced onto already-overparked,

23 often-one-lane streets, where red zones are routinely occupied, will reduce the neighborhood's

24 ability to safely respond to fire events, and reduce the fire department's accessibility to the

25 neighborhood. The City failed to properly analyze the cumulative impact that ongoing

26 development in this high fire severity risk zone will have on public safety and the environment,

27 including the contribution of two RYDA projects-and this specific Project in particular-to that

28 cumulative impact.

13

- 42.

2 Even if the City could have avoided the Project's status as lying within a very high

3 fire hazard severity zone, the City provided Off-Menu items and incentives far in excess of what

4 is permitted under applicable law, including by improperly treating many "on-menu" incentives

5 as "off-menu" incentives in a manner that erased all "on-menu" limitations and restrictions.

6 Government Code § 65913.4 provides that a development "shall be deemed consistent with the

7 objective zoning standards related to housing density, as applicable, if the density proposed is

8 compliant with the maximum density allowed within that land use designation[-]" SB 35

9 Guidelines § 300(c)(1) elaborates that a development is consistent with density requirements if it

10 includes "up to the maximum density allowed within the land use element designation of the

11 parcel" after accounting for a density bonus under Density Bonus Law.

BAKER & HOSTETLER LLP 43.

ATTORNEYS AT LAW 12
31A0NY $01 The Project, however, is not eligible for streamlined approval nor the conditional

13 use authority in LAMC § 12.24.U.26, not only because of its location in high fire risk severity

14 zone, but also because the Project's claimed 50% density increase-which is actually approx.

15 150% by square footage- exceeds the 35% maximum density increase authorized in Government

16 Code 65915. The Project fails to comply with the applicable objective zoning standards and

17 thus is not eligible for ministerial review pursuant to SB 35. The issue is not whether additional

18 density would be needed to make low-income units cost effective. Petitioner acknowledges that

19 the developer would be entitled to certain permitted density increases. The issue is whether a

20 developer has an automatic right to demand cumulative and near-unlimited "off-menu incentives"

21 and waivers to make the market-rate units even more profitable---such as adding a second

22 commercial floor to increase rents, erasing parking requirements for both the increased

23 commercial space and the increased market-rate residental units, thereby requiring greater height

24 and a seventh floor to incorporate the combined commercial and residential increases, and

25 requiring that all setbacks be erased. Califormia's density bonus law was intended to encourage

26 low-income housing. It was not intended to erase all development standards, nor regulations to

27 protect the health, safety and environmental health of a neighborhood.

44.

28 Petitioner is informed and believes, and based therein alleges, that the [Q]C2-1VL
zoning of the subject property permits a maximum square footage of floor area of 33,750 square

14
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

1

2 feet, and that the City granted the developer a density bonus to iucrease the square footage by

3 more than 150% to 84,662 square feet, far in excess of the 35-percent maximum permitted in

4 LAMC §§ 12.22.A.25 and U.26. The Project is therefore inconsistent with the objective zoning
standards as enumerated in Government Code § 65913.4.

5 45.

6 Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that the City's
waiving of yard, height, floor area, parking, setback and open space standards is also in violation

7

8 of SB 35 and Government Code § 65913.4 because those deviations from the objective zoning

9 standards are inconsistent with the purpose of streamlined review, and provide deviations far in

10 excess of what is permitted under applicable law. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based

11 thereon alleges, that the City abused its discretion in that the findings required in the LAMC for

ATTORNEYS AT LAW BAKER & HOSTETLER LLP 12 the Project were ignored and instead morphed and transmuted into a combined set of "off-menu"

6373DNY S0T 13 incentives and other entitlements which lack any discernible objective standard of review.

14 Further, as to the findings that were made and the subsequent approvals, those "Findings" were
unsupported in fact or in law.

16 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION (Violation Of SB 1818; Code of Civ. Proc. §§ 1094.5(b) and 1085) (Against All Defendants)
17 46.

18 Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference herein each and every allegation

19 contained in paragraphs 1 through 45 of this Petition as though set forth in full hereat.
47.

20 Pursuant to the directive set out in Government Code § 65915(a), Respondent has

21 enacted an ordinance intended to implement the directives set out in Government Code §§ 65915-

22 65918 (the "SB 1818 Density Bonus Law"). That implementation ordinance (LAMC

23 §12.22.A.25) establishes two sub-categories of "concessions" or "incentives" (i.e., relief from the
City's zoning laws and site development standards).

24 48.

25 Category One constitutes a set of 8 *on-menu" incentives which are "deemed" to

26 represent "concessions" or "incentives" that, by definition, automatically result in identifiable,

27 financially sufficient, and actual cost reductions. (LAMC § 12.22.A.25(f)). No economic pro-

28 forma justifying the need for the "incentives" or "concessions" is required.

15
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

1 49. Category Two consists of all other "incentives" or "concessions" requested which

2 are not "on-menu." (LAMC § 12.22.A.25(g)(3)). This category of "off-menu" incentives requires

3 the project proponent to submit "a pro-forma or other documentation to show that the waiver or

4 modification of any development standard(s) are needed in order to make the Restricted

5 Affordable Units economically feasible". LAMC § 12.25.A.25(g)(3)(i)(a).

6 50. Respondent City and the CPC have violated the SB 1818 Density Bonus Law

7 (Government Code § 65915) by approving the Project's "off-menu" incentive items, even though

8 such incentives are defined in LAMC $12.22.A.25 as "on-menu" incentives, and by approving
such incentives without support from a competent economic pro-forma which affirmatively

10 demonstrated how and why the density bonus "incentives" and "concessions" sought are needed

11 in order to economically provide for the construction and operation of the affordable units
477 MITI3ISOH  MIXVA MVTLV SAINJOLLY 12 contemplated under the project. LOS ANGELES 13 51. Further, Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that the

14 City and CPC treated on-menu incentives as "off-menu" incentives in order to avoid regulatory

15 restrictions on the granting of such a volume of incentives. By treating the developer's request

16 for a 100% reduction in a residential parking, a 100% reduction in commercial parking, and a
17 more-than-100% increase in the Floor Area Ratio as "off-menu incentives," and by treating a

18 variety of other concessions as "waivers," the City and CPC essentially erased LAMC §

19 12.22.A.25(g)(3) by demonstrating that its limitations can be avoided simply by labeling an

20 incentive "off-menu" or a "waiver." Such actions were an abuse of discretion and a violation of

21 applicable law.

22 52. Government Code § 65915 § and LAMC § 12.22.A.25 prohibit the grant of a
23 Density Bonus if doing so will result in a specific adverse impact upon public health and safety or

24 the physical environment. Petitioner alleges that Respondents abused their discretion and failed to
25 act in the manner required by law by failing to acknowledge evidence placed into the record by

26 residents demonstrating the material risks to health, safety, and the environment that will arise
27 from the size and density of the Project, and the lack of remotely sufficient parking, granted in the

28 form of "off-menu incentives" and waivers.

FINDINGS

Density Bonus/Affordable Housing Incentives Compliance Findings

1. Pursuant to Section 12.22 A.25(g)(2)(i)(c) of the LAMC and Section 65915(e) of the California Government Code, the decision-maker shall approve a density bonus and requested incentive(s) unless the Commission finds that:

a. The Incentives do result in identifiable and actual cost to provide for affordable housing costs as defined in California Health and Safety Code Section 50052.5 or Section 50053 for rents for the affordable units.

The record does not contain substantial evidence that would allow the City Planning Commission to make a finding that the requested incentives do result in identifiable and actual cost to provide for affordable housing costs per State Law. The California Health and Safety Code Sections 50052.5 and 50053 define formulas for calculating affordable housing costs for Very Low, Low, and Moderate Income Households. Section 50052.5
addresses owner-occupied housing and Section 50053 addresses rental Households.
Affordable housing costs are a calculation of residential rent or ownership pricing not to exceed 25 percent gross income based on area median income thresholds depending on affordability levels.
Based on the set-aside of 17% percent of the base density for Very Low Income Households, the applicant is entitled to three (3) incentives under both Government Code Section 65915 and the LAMC. The request for FAR increase, residential parking reduction and commercial parking reduction qualify as requested Incentives. The remaining requests to allow for an increase in height and maximum stories and reduction in side and rear yard setbacks, and reduced open space requirements are waivers of development.

Residential Parking

Pursuant to LAMC Section 12.21.A.4 the proposed project is required to provide 109 residential parking spaces for 14 studios, 49 one-bedroom units, and 23 two-bedroom units. The applicant is requesting an off-menu incentive to permit zero residential parking spaces pursuant to LAMC Section 12.22.A(g)3.
The requested reduction in residential parking will allow the affordability of construction costs for the residential units. Granting the incentive would result in a building design that encompasses a greater quantity of units while allowing for the construction of additional affordable units. This Incentives supports the applicant's decision to set aside a minimum of ten (10)dwelling units for Very Low Income Households for 55 years.
Commercial Parking
Pursuant to LAMC Section 12.21.A.4 the proposed project is required to provide 50 commercial parking spaces for 8,353 square feet of commercial floor area. The applicant is requesting an off-menu incentive to permit zero commercial parking spaces pursuant to LAMC Section 12.22.A(g)3; and
The requested reduction in residential parking will allow the affordability of construction costs for the residential units. Granting the incentive would result in a building design that encompasses a greater quantity of units while allowing for the construction of

CPC-2021-2035-DB-CU-CUB-SPR-HCA F-2

additional affordable units. This Incentives supports the applicant's decision to set aside a minimum of ten (10) dwelling units for Very Low Income Households for 55 years.

Floor Area Ratio (FAR)

The subject property is zoned [Q]C2-1VL. The property's residential zoning permits a
maximum FAR of 1.5 to 1, equal to a maximum of 22,500 square feet of total building
area. The applicant is requesting an off-menu incentive for a 150 percent increase in FAR, up to 3.76 to 1 to allow for a total building area of 84,662 square feet.
The requested increase in FAR will allow for the construction of affordable units in addition to larger-sized dwelling units. Granting of the incentive would result in a building design and construction efficiencies that provide for affordable housing costs; it enables the developer to expand the building envelope so that additional affordable units can be constructed and the overall space dedicated to residential uses is increased. The increased building envelope also ensures that all dwelling units are of a habitable size while providing a variety of unit types. This Incentives supports the applicant's decision to set aside 10 dwelling units for Very Low Income Households for 55 years.
b. The waiver[s] or reduction[s] of development standards will not have the effect of physically precluding the construction of a development meeting the [affordable set-aside percentage] criteria of subdivision (b) at the densities or with the concessions or incentives permitted under [State Density Bonus Law]" (Government Code Section 65915(e)(1)

A project that provides at least 5 percent of its base density for Very Low Income Households may request other "waiver[s] or reduction[s] of development standards that will have the effect of physically precluding the construction of a development meeting the [affordable set-aside percentage] criteria of subdivision (b) at the densities or with the concessions or incentives permitted under [State Density Bonus Lawl" (Government Code Section 65915(e)(1)).

Stories

The subject is zoned [Q]C2-1VL with Height District 1VL which allows for a maximum height of three (3) stories. The proposed project is a seven-story mixed-use residential building, therefore has requested an increase in stories to allow seven (7) stories in lieu of the permitted three (3) stories.

Height

The subject is zoned [Q]C2-1VL with Height District 1VL which allows for a maximum height of 45 feet. The project is requesting a waiver of development standards to allow for an increase in height for a maximum 83 feet and 10 inches in lieu of the otherwise
permitted 45 feet in height.

Side Yard Setback

Pursuant to LAMC Section 12.14-C, the site requires a side yard setback not less than five (5) feet. For a building more than two (2) stories in height, one-foot shall be added to the depth of such side yard for each additional story above the second story. The proposed project is a seven-story mixed-use residential building, therefore has requested a 100% reduction to allow for a zero side yard setback in lieu of the 10 feet
required side yard setback.

CPC-2021-2035-DB-CU-CUB-SPR-HCA F-3

Rear Yard Setback

Pursuant to LAMC Section 12.14-C, the site requires a rear yard setback not less than
15 feet. For a building more than three (3) stories in height, one-foot shall be added to the depth of such side yard for each additional story above the second story. The proposed project iS a seven-story mixed-use residential building, therefore has requested a 100% reduction to allow for a zero rear yard setback in lieu of the 19 feet required side yard setback.

Open Space

Pursuant to LAMC 12.21.g the proposed project is required to provide 9,175 square feet of open space for the 86 residential units. The project is requesting a waiver of development standards to allow a 24 percent reduction in open space to allow a total a 6,973 square feet of open space for the entire project. The project proposes to provide a total 7,020 square feet of open space.
As proposed, the granting of these waivers will allow for the construction of the affordable residential units given the quantity of units allowed under the density bonus and within the 3.76 to 1 floor area ratio granted under the Incentives
c. The Incentive will have a Specific Adverse Impact upon public health and safety or the physical environment or any real property that is listed in the California Register of Historical Resources and for which there is no feasible method to
satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the Specific Adverse Impact without rendering the
development unaffordable to Very Low, Low and Moderate Income Households. Inconsistency with the zoning ordinance or general plan land use designation shall not constitute a specific, adverse impact upon the public health or safety.
There is no evidence that the proposed density bonus incentives will have a specific
adverse impact upon public health and safety or the physical environment, or any real property that is listed in the California Register of Historical Resources. A "specific adverse impact" is defined as "a significant, quantifiable, direct and unavoidable impact, based on objective, identified written public health or safety standards, policies, or conditions as they existed on the date the application was deemed complete" (LAMC Section 12.22-A,25(b).

The project does not involve a contributing structure in a designated Historic
Preservation Overlay Zone or on the City of Los Angeles list of Historical-Cultural Monuments. The project is located in a Hillside area and Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone. There is no evidence in the record which identifies a written objective heaith and safety standard that has been exceeded or violated. Based on the above, there is no basis to deny the requested incentives. Therefore, there is no substantial evidence that the project's proposed incentives will have a specific adverse impact on the physical environment, on public health and safety, or on property listed in the California Register of Historic Resources.

d. The incentives are contrary to state or federal law.
None of the incentive are contrary to state of federal law.

CPC-2021-2035-DB-CU-CUB-SPR-HCA F-4

Conditional Use Findings

2. That the project will enhance the built environment in the surrounding neighborhood or will perform a function or provide a service that is essential or beneficial to the community, city or region.

The property has a frontage along Sunset Boulevard. The subject property is comprised of nine (9) lots consisting of approximately 22,449 square feet of lot area with a street frontage of approximately 225 linear feet along Sunset Boulevard. The project site is currently developed a one- and two-story auto shop with adjoining surface level parking lot, all of which are proposed to be demolished as part of the project.
The project involves the demolition of an existing one- and two-story auto shop with an adjoining surface level parking lot and the construction, use, and maintenance of a new 84,662 square-foot, seven-story mixed-use residential development consisting of 86 residential units (with 10 units reserved for Very Low Income Households). The project will include a total 69 parking spaces within an at-grade parking garage.
Conditional Use - Density Bonus Above 35%
The project will perform a function by replacing an existing auto shop and surface level parking lot with a new 86-unit development thereby adding to the city's housing stock. The existing auto shop with adjoining surface level parking a lot is not a permitted use allowed under the Q Condition and does not utilize the site's full potential in providing a function that is essential and beneficial to the city and the region.
The additional 15 percent density bonus (beyond the 35 percent permitted through a by-right density bonus) approved herein results in an additional nine (9) units, for a total of 86 units. In exchange, the project will set aside 17 percent of the base density, or 10 units for Very Low Income Households for a minimum of 55 years.
Conditional Use - Alcohol

The project also proposes the sale and dispensing of a full-line of alcoholic beverages for on
and off-site consumption in conjunction with two (2) on-site establishments.
A variety of commercial uses are an intrinsic part of the service amenities necessary for the
conservation, development, and success of a vibrant neighborhood. In particular, the Silver Lake-Echo Park-Elysian Valley neighborhood is known for its bar, restaurant, small retail businesses and recreational experiences. The availability of restaurants and bar with alcoholic beverage services for on and off-site consumption will offer a dining and drinking amenity that caters to the local community, on-site residents of the subject mixed-use residential building and visitors to Sunset Boulevard. The grant will allow this service and does not represent the introduction of a use uncommon to the area, as there are restaurants and bars in the vicinity that sell alcoholic beverages.
The grant with conditions ensures the project will continue to be compatible with surrounding uses, and will continue to allow the hotel and restaurant establishments to be competitive and viable dining options in the area. Conditions from the previous grant have been carried over, and address mode and character, safety and security and responsible management. Therefore, the availability of alcoholic beverages in conjunction with the hotel operation will provide a convenient and beneficial service to the local community, employees, patrons and residents in the neighborhood.

CPC-2021-2035-DB-CU-CUB-SPR-HCA F-5

Therefore, the proposed 86-unit development, including the 10 units set aside for Very Low Income Households and the allowed sale and dispensing of a full-line of alcoholic beverages
within two on-site establishments, the project will perform a function that is essential and beneficial to the city and the region.

3. That the project's location, size, height, operations and other significant features will
be compatible with and will not adversely affect or further degrade adjacent properties, the surrounding neighborhood or the public health, welfare, and safety.
The proposed project consists of the construction of a new seven-story 86 dwelling unit mixed-
use residential development. The project site is currently developed with a one- and two-story auto shop with a surface level parking lot which will be demolished as part of the proposed
development.

Conditional Use - Density Bonus Above 35%

The property is located within the Silver Lake-Echo Park-Elysian Valley Community Plan, a densely populated portion of the City of Los Angeles. The project site is located in an urbanized area surrounded by residential and commercial zones and are generally developed. The subject property is located along Sunset Boulevard, an urbanized area surrounded by residential and commercial zones. Surrounding the project site are a variety of multi-story residential buildings as well as a wide variety of commercial uses along Sunset Boulevard, including but not limited to; restaurants, bars, retail stores, mini-shopping centers, mixed-use residential buildings, and surface level parking lots. The subject property is not adjacent to any single-family zoned properties. Rather, it is surrounded by properties zoned for commercial and medium residential uses. Therefore, the construction of the housing development will serve to benefit the neighborhood rather than degrade it.
The façades are well-articulated and features a prominent ground level that distinguishes it from the remaining levels. The residential lobby and commercial uses including retail and restaurants located at the ground level will engage pedestrians at this level along Sunset Boulevard, which will likely receive the majority of the local circulation. Well-designed landscaping will create a pleasing transition the pedestrian realm of the sidewalk to the façade of the building. Therefore, the project is compatible with the surrounding neighborhood and will not adversely affect nor degrade adjacent properties, surrounding neighborhood, or the public health, safety, or welfare.
With the exception of the requests herein, the proposed project is otherwise entirely consistent with the requirements of the underlying zone. The project's significant features, including the proposed building's use, density, and FAR, are permitted by the underlying zone and the provisions of Density Bonus law. The project has been designed to include landscaping, open space amenities, and on-site parking.

Conditional Use - Alcohol

In addition, the sale and dispensing of a full-line of alcoholic a beverages for on and off-site consumption is a service that is compatible with the surrounding neighborhood. The project is located along Sunset Boulevard, a commercial boulevard with a variety of dining venues and bars. The added sale of alcoholic beverages at the subject mixed-use residential building will blend in with current establishments in the community while also being a nearby service to on-site residents and community members alike.
Following review of the administrative record, the project and its operating characteristics were found to be consistent with the surrounding neighborhood. The operating conditions in

CPC-2021-2035-DB-CU-CUB-SPR-HCA F-6

conjunction with the Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Program (MViP) will allow the City the opportunity to monitor and verify compliance of the conditions incorporated in this grant. The conditions imposed by this grant include but are not limited to the installation of a camera surveillance system, the utilization of electronic age verification devices to deter underage drinking and purchases, and the requirement that the operator monitor the area under their control in an effort to prevent the loitering of persons on a the premises as a means to alleviate the potential effects from the sale of alcohol.
Given the proposed project's location within the Silver Lake-Echo Park-Elysian Valley Community Plan area, along with the existing development in the immediate vicinity of the subject property and its proximity to commercial thoroughfares, the project's location, size, height, operations, and other significant features will be compatible with and will not adversely affect adjacent properties, the surrounding neighborhood, or the public health, welfare, and safety.

4. That the project substantially conforms with the purpose, intent and provisions of the General Plan, the applicable community plan, and any applicable specific plan.
The project site is located within the Silver Lake-Echo Park-Elysian Valley Community Plan, which is one of 35 Community Plans which together form the land use element of the General Plan. The Community Plan designates the site for General Commercial land uses
corresponding to the C Zone. The project site is zoned [Q]C2-1VL and is thus consistent with is the existing land use designation. The subject property is not located within the boundaries of and is not subject to any specific plan or community design overlay.
The proposed project conforms to the following goals, objectives and policies -of-the Community Plan:
Goal 1: A safe, secure, and high quality residential environment for all community residents.

Objective 1.1: Achieve and maintain a housing supply and distribution of multiple family, low income and special needs housing opportunities in the Community Plan Area.

Policy 1.1.6: Promote the preservation of existing single and multi-family neighborhoods.

Objective 2.4: Reinforce the identity of distinct commercial districts through the use of design guidelines and development standards.
Policy 2.4.2: Require that mixed-use projects and development in pedestrian- oriented areas be designed and developed to achieve a high level of quality, distinctive character and compatibility with existing uses.
The project is a residential development with 10 units restricted for families or persons of Very Low Income and maximizes the property's development potential. The project's Very Low Income and market rate units satisfy both the needs of affordable housing as well as the City's need for more housing overall. The project will result in the net addition of 10 covenanted affordable dwelling units in a community in-need of more affordable housing.
The project is further consistent with other elements of the General Plan, including the Framework Element, the Housing Element, and the Mobility Element. The Framework Element was adopted by the City of Los Angeles in December 1996 and re-adopted in August

CPC-2021-2035-DB-CU-CUB-SPR-HCA F-7

2001. The Framework Element provides guidance regarding policy issues for the entire City of Los Angeles, including the project site. The Framework Element also sets forth a Citywide comprehensive long-range growth strategy and defines Citywide polices regarding such
issues as land use, housing, urban form, neighborhood design, open space, economic development, transportation, infrastructure, and public services. The project supports the following goal and objective of the Framework Element:
Goal 3C: Multi-family neighborhoods that enhance the quality of life for the City's existing and future residents.

Obiective 3.7: Provide for the stability and enhancement of multi-family residential neighborhoods and allow for growth in areas where there is sufficient public infrastructure and services and the residents' quality of life can be maintained or improved.

The project enhances the quality of life for the City's existing residents by providing a modern and upgraded residential structure in an area that would benefit from new housing supply. The increased density is compatible with the nearby surrounding area. The project is located along Sunset Boulevard, a major commercial boulevard with multiple transit options. Residents will be able to utilize transit and are within walking distance to grocery stores, department stores, and various restaurants.

The Housing Element of the General Plan will be implemented by the recommended action herein. The Housing Element is the City's blueprint for meeting housing and growth challenges. It identifies the City's housing conditions and needs, reiterates goals, objectives, and policies that are the foundation of the City's housing and growth strategy, and provides the array of programs the City has committed to implement to create sustainable, mixed- income neighborhoods across the City. The Housing Element includes the following objectives and policies relevant to the instant request:
Goal 1: Housing Production and Preservation.
Obiective 1.1: Produce an adequate supply of rental and ownership housing in order
to meet current and projected needs.
Policy 1.1.2: Expand affordable rental housing for all income groups that need assistance.

Policy 1.2.2: Encourage and incentivize the preservation of affordable housing, including non-subsidized affordable units, to ensure that demolitions and conversions do not result in the net loss of the City stock of decent, safe, healthy or affordable housing.

Goal 2: Safe, Livable, and Sustainable Neighborhoods.
Obiective 2.2: Promote sustainable neighborhoods that have mixed-income housing, jobs, amenities, services and transit.

Objective 2.5: Promote a more equitable distribution of affordable housing opportunities throughout the City.

Policy 2.5.2: Foster the development of new affordable housing units citywide and within each community plan area.

CPC-2021-2035-DB-CU-CUB-SPR-HCA F-8

The project provides 86 total units, including 10 units affordable for Very Low Income Households. In doing so, the project promotes the objectives of the Housing Element by
adding to the City's housing stock and contributing to the need for mixed-income housing. The project site is currently developed with an auto-shop with a surface level parking lot. The project will expand affordable rental housing while utilizing the property to its full potential, resulting in a net gain of 86 units to the City's housing stock. It is within close proximity to various major employment and retail centers, along with several major transportation lines, thereby connecting residents to jobs, amenities, services, and transit.

The Mobility Element of the General Plan, also known as Mobility Plan 2035, provides policies with the ultimate goal of developing a balanced transportation network for all users. The project supports the following policies of the Mobility Element:
Policy 3.3; Promote equitable land use decisions that result in fewer vehicle trips
by providing greater proximity and access to jobs, destinations, and other neighborhood services.

Policy 5.2: Support ways to reduce vehicle miles traveled (VMT) per capita.
Policy 5.4: Continue to encourage the adoption of low and zero emission fuel sources, new mobility technologies, and supporting infrastructure.
The project proposes a residential development that will provide 86 market-rate units and 10 units reserved for Very Low Income Households. Accordingly, the project fulfills the Community Plan, Framework Element, and Housing Element goals and objectives of providing quality housing for all persons in the community, including those who otherwise might not be housed. The project utilizes development incentives to provide a higher number of residential units than would otherwise be permitted, thereby facilitating the creation of a higher number of affordable units and addressing the need for affordable housing in the City. Additionally, the project is a Density Bonus development located along Sunset Boulevard a commercial boulevard well-served by transit. Thus, the project will contribute towards the creation of sustainable neighborhoods and a reduction in vehicle trips and VMT.
In addition, the project has been conditioned to comply with the electric vehicle requires of state law. The project has also been conditioned to provide solar infrastructure. Together, these conditions further support applicable policies in the Health and Wellness Element, Air Quality Element, and Mobility Element of the General Plan by reducing the level of pollution/greenhouse gas emissions, ensuring new development is compatible with alternative fuel vehicles, and encouraging the adoption of low emission fuel sources and supporting infrastructure. These conditions also support good planning practice by promoting overall sustainability and providing additional benefits and conveniences for residents, workers, and
visitors.

Additionally, the Silver Lake-Echo Park-Elysian Valley Community Plan text is silent in regard to alcohol sales. In such cases, the City Planning Commission must interpret the intent of the Plan. The Silver Lake-Echo Park-Elysian Valley Community Plan serves to address a number of issues and opportunities present in the area and recognizes the importance of retaining a viable and vibrant commercial sector. The restaurant use is consistent with this zone and land use designation. Additionally, the project is consistent with the following objectives and policies of the Community Plan:

Goal 2: An economically vital commercial sector and strong viable commercial areas that offer a diversity of goods and services to meet the needs of the community in the plan area. Commercial

CPC-2021-2035-DB-CU-CUB-SPR-HCA F-9

areas should satisfy market demand, maximize convenience
and accessibility while preserving and enhancing the unique
historic and cultural identities of the district.

Policy 2-2.3: The first floor street frontage for structures, including mixed-use projects and parking structures located in pedestrian-oriented
areas, should incorporate commercial uses.

Policy 2-3.1: Proposed developments should be designed to enhance and be compatible with existing adjacent development.

The project will allow the proposed mixed-use residential building to add a desirable a service of the sale of a full-line of alcoholic beverages for on and off-site consumption to the surrounding community. Thus, the project furthers the function and identity of Sunset Boulevard a commercial corridor in the Silver Lake-Echo Park-Elysian Valley Community Plan area. Thus, the project furthers the function and identity of Sunset Boulevard. The project will provide a desirable commercial service to the surrounding neighborhood and primarily to on- site residents within an existing area designated for such uses. The project maintains an existing and desirable commercial pattern of zoning and land use that is consistent and compatible with other properties and uses in the surrounding neighborhood.
The project contributes to and furthers several applicable goals, objectives, and policies of the plans that govern land use and development in the City. Therefore, the project substantially conforms with the purpose, intent, and provisions of the General Plan and the Silver Lake- Echo Park-Elysian Valley Community Plan.
Conditional Use Findings - Density Bonus Above 35%

5. The project is consistent with and implements the affordable housing provisions of the Housing Element of the General Plan.
The City's Housing Element for 2013-2021 was adopted by City Council on December 3, 2013. The Housing Element of the General Plan will be implemented by the recommended action herein. The Housing Element is the City's blueprint for meeting housing and growth challenges. It identifies the City's housing conditions and needs, reiterates goals, objectives, and policies that are the foundation of the City's housing and growth strategy, and provides the array of programs the City has committed to implement to create sustainable, mixed- income neighborhoods across the City.
As discussed, the project, including 76 market-rate units and 10 units reserved for Very Low Income Households, is consistent with many of the goals and objectives of the Housing Element of the General Plan.

6. The project contains the requisite number of Restricted Affordable Units, based on the number of units permitted by the maximum allowable density on the date of application, as follows:

a. 11% Very-Low Income Units for a 35% density increase; or

b. 20% Low Income Units for 35% density increase; or

C. 40% Moderate Income Units for a 35% density increase in for-sale projects.

CPC-2021-2035-DB-CU-CUB-SPR-HCA F-10

The project may then be granted additional density increases beyond 35% by providing additional affordable housing units in the following manner:

a. For every additional 1% set aside of Very-Low Income Units, the project is granted an additional 2.5% density increase; or
b. For every additional 1% set aside of Low Income Units, the project is granted an additional 1.5% density increase; or

C. For every additional 1% set aside of Moderate Income Units in for-sale projects, the project is granted an additional 1% density increase; or
d. In calculating the density increase and Restricted Affordable Units, each component of any density calculation, including base density and bonus density, resulting in fractional units shall be separately rounded up to the next whole number.

The subject property is zoned [Q]C2-1VL, which limits density to one (1) dwelling unit per 400 square feet of lot area. The subject property a has a total lot area of 22,449 square feet, and as such, the permitted base density on the subject property is 57 units.1 In exchange for reserving a portion of the units for affordable housing, the applicant is entitled to a maximum 35 percent density bonus by-right. The applicant is seeking an additional 15 percent density bonus (or a total of a 50 percent density bonus) through a Conditional Use to allow for the proposed 86 dwelling units to be built on the site.
Pursuant to the LAMC and California Government Code Section 65915, a Housing Development Project that sets aside certain percentage of units as affordable, either in rental or for-sale units, shall be granted a corresponding density bonus, up to a maximum of 35 percent. While these provisions are limited to 35 percent, Government Code Section 65915(f) states that "the amount of density bonus to which an applicant is entitled shall vary according to the amount by which the percentage of affordable housing units exceeds percentage established." As such, in instances where a project is seeking a density bonus increase that is more than 35 percent, the amount of required units that are set aside as affordable shall vary depending on the requested amount of density bonus. Therefore, it is appropriate that any project that requests a density bonus increase beyond 35 percent would extend the existing set-aside charts located in Section 12.22-A,25 of the LAMC. LAMC Section 12.24- U,26, which implements this provision of State law, states, as a Conditional Use, a project may be granted additional density increases beyond the 35 percent maximum by providing additional affordable housing units. Consistent with this Section, the table below illustrates how the maximum allowable Density Bonus increases for every unit set aside for Very Low Income Households (2.5 percent density increase for every additional one (1) percent of Very Low Income units provided), based on the base density and the chart prescribed in Section 12.22-A,25 of the LAMC.

Assembly Bili 2501 clarifies that density calculations that result in a fractional number are to be rounded up to the next whole number. This applies to base density, number of bonus units, and number of affordable units required to be eligible for the density bonus.

CPC-2021-2035-DB-CU-CUB-SPR-HCA F-11

Density Bonus Percentages (Table 1)

*Existing set-aside chart as listed in Section 12.22-A,25 of the LAMC
For the subject property, a 35 percent by-right density bonus would allow for 77 units (equal to an increase of 19.95 rounded up to 20 units beyond the 57-unit base density) to be constructed on the project site. As illustrated in Table 1 above, in order to qualify for the 35 percent by-right density bonus, the project would be required to set aside 11 percent of the base density, or seven (7) units, for Very Low Income Households. The applicant is seeking an additional 15 percent density bonus (for a total of a 50% density bonus from the base density) through a Conditional Use to allow for a total of 86 dwelling units, representing an increase of nine (9) units beyond what would otherwise be permitted through the by-right 35 percent density bonus. In order to obtain the additional requested 15 percent density bonus,
as shown in Table 1, the project must set aside at least 17 percent of the base density, equal
to 10 units, for Very Low Income households in exchange for the requested Density Bonus. As such, the Density Bonus request results in seven (7) affordable units and the Conditional Use request results in an additional three (3) units for a total of a 10 affordable units.

7. The project meets any applicable dwelling unit replacement requirements of the California Government Code Section 65915(c)(3).

The project proposes the demolition of an existing auto-shop with adjoining surface level parking lot. Per the SB 330 Determination Letter dated December 22, 2021, there are no replacement units on the project site. Therefore, the project will meet the applicable dwelling unit replacement requirements of the California Government Code Section 65915(c)(3).
8. The project's Restricted Affordable Units are subject to a recorded affordability restriction of 55 years from the issuance of the Certificate of Occupancy, recorded in a covenant acceptable to the Housing and Community Investment Department, and subject to fees as set forth in Section 19.14 of the LAMC.

CPC-2021-2035-DB-CU-CUB-SPR-HCA F-12

The proposed project has been conditioned to record a covenant for affordability restriction of a period of 55 years from the issuance of the Certificate of Occupancy, to the satisfaction of the Housing and Community Investment Department, and subject to fees as set forth in
Section 19.14 of the LAMC.

9. The project addresses the policies and standards contained in the City Planning Commission's Affordable Housing Incentives Guidelines.

The City Planning Commission approved the Affordable Housing Incentives Guidelines (under Case No. CPC-2005-1101-CA) on June 9, 2005. The Guidelines were subsequently approved by the City Council on February 20, 2008, as a component of the City of Los Angeles Density
Bonus Ordinance. The Guidelines describe the density bonus provisions and qualifying criteria, incentives available, design standards, and the procedures through which projects may apply for a density bonus and incentives. HCIDLA utilizes these Guidelines in the preparation of Housing Covenants for Affordable Housing Projects. The Guidelines prescribe
that the design and location of affordable units be comparable to the market rate units, the
equal distribution of amenities, HCIDLA monitoring requirements, affordability levels, and
procedures for obtaining HCIDLA sign-offs for building permits.

The project will result in 86 new dwelling units, of which 10 will be reserved for Very Low Income Household occupancy and the remainder will be offered as market rate units. In order
to ensure that there is equal distribution of amenities, the project has been conditioned to provide the private balconies in accordance with the requirements of the LAMC. All residents of the proposed project will have access to all common open space amenities within the building and each unit will have adequate private open space. The restricted units will comply with affordability requirements in the Guidelines set forth by HCIDLA in conformance with US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Additionally, as part of the building permit process, the applicant will execute a covenant to the satisfaction of HCIDLA who will ensure compliance with the Guidelines. Therefore, the project will address the policies and standards contained in the Guidelines.

Conditional Use Findings - Alcohol
10. The proposed use will not adversely affect the welfare of the pertinent community.
The Conditional Use permit for the sale of a full-line of alcoholic beverages for on and off-site consumption within two establishments located at the ground floor of the proposed mixed-use development will not adversely affect the welfare of the community. The subject property is zoned [Q]C2-1VL, which allows for commercial uses. The subject site with a frontage along Sunset Boulevard enhances the character of the area and provides an additional service to residential mixed-use. The additional service of a full-line of alcoholic beverages will be convenient for on-site residents and walking distance from the surrounding neighborhood and visitors in the area. The proposed development will continue to positively impact the financial health of the property and improve the economic vitality of the area via increased tax revenue.
Conditional authorization for the sale of a full-line of alcoholic beverages for on and off-site consumption is allowed through the approval of the City Planning Commission subject to certain findings. Given the scope of the conditions and limitations established herein, the surrounding land uses will not be significantly impacted by any of the proposed conditional uses. Negative impacts commonly associated with the sale of alcoholic beverages, such as criminal activity, public drunkenness, and loitering are mitigated by the imposition of conditions requiring responsible management and deterrents against loitering. Employees will undergo training on the sale of alcoholic beverages, including training provided by the Los Angeles Police Department Standardized Training for Alcohol Retailers (STAR) Program. Additionally,

CPC-2021-2035-DB-CU-CUB-SPR-HCA F-13

other conditions related to excessive noise, noise prevention, and litter will safeguard the residential community. Therefore. will the imposition of such conditions, the sale and dispensing of a full line of alcoholic beverages at this location will not adversely affect the welfare of the pertinent community.

11. The granting of the application will not result in an undue concentration of premises for the sale or dispensing for consideration of alcoholic beverages, including beer and
wine, in the area of the City involved, giving consideration to applicable State laws and
to the California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control's guidelines for undue
concentration; and also giving consideration to the number and proximity of these establishments within a one thousand foot radius of the site, the crime rate in the area
(especially those crimes involving public drunkenness, the illegal sale or use of narcotics, drugs or alcohol, disturbing the peace and disorderly conduct), and whether
revocation or nuisance proceedings have been initiated for any use in the area,

According to the California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) licensing criteria, there are 22 alcohol consumption licenses allocated to the census tract (Census Tract 1954.00).

Within 600 feet from the subject site there are seven other establishments with active alcohol
licenses from the California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) and there are zero establishments with alcohol licenses between 600 feet and 1,000 feet from the subject
property.

According to statistics provided by the Los Angeles Police Department's Central Los Angeles Division Unit, within the Crime Reporting District. 1171, which has jurisdiction over the subject property, a total of 151 crimes were reported in 2020, including 99 for Part I and 51 for Part Arrests, compared to the Citywide average of 170 crimes and arrests, and compared to the High Crimes average of 141 crimes for the same reporting period.
Alcohol-related Part II crimes reported by LAPD include, Narcotic Drug Laws (0), Liquor Laws (0), Public Drunkenness (2), Disturbing the Peace (0), Disorderly Conduct (0), and Driving Under the Influence (1).

The proposed mixed-use residential development is 84,662 square-feet with 86 total residential units and 8,353 square feet of commercial floor area will provide the sale of a full- line of alcoholic beverages for on and off-site consumption as an incidental purchase to other goods including dining options, therefore the approval of the subject Conditional Use Permit will not provoke a higher crime rate. In this case, the project will continue to provide a unique amenity to workers, visitors, and residents. The project will also continue to enhance the physical environment and, as conditioned, will not negatively impact the area.
a As a primary use for a residential building, the project alone is unlikely to have a significant impact on local crime. The City Planning Commission has also incorporated numerous operational conditions to the grant that address noise, safety, and security to ensure the proposed use iS conducted with due regard for surrounding properties and to reduce any potential crime issues or nuisance activity. Therefore, the granting of the request herein will not result in undue concentration.

12. The proposed use will not detrimentally affect nearby residentially zoned communities in the area of the City involved, after giving consideration to the distance of the proposed use from residential buildings, churches, schools, hospitals, public

CPC-2021-2035-DB-CU-CUB-SPR-HCA F-14

playgrounds and other similar uses, and other establishments dispensing, for sale or other consideration, alcoholic beverages, including beer and wine.

The project site is zoned for commercial uses and will continue to be a utilized as such with
the restaurant use. The following sensitive uses are located within a 1,000-foot radius of the
site:

Sensitive Uses

N/A

Alcohol Uses

Daisy's Market 3216 Sunset Boulevard
All Day Baby 3200 Sunset Boulevard
Spoon and Pork 3131 Sunset Boulevard
Diablo 3129 Sunset Boulevard
Los Globos 3040 Sunset Boulevard

Consideration has been given to the distance of the subject establishment from the above- referenced sensitive uses. The grant has been well conditioned, which would protect the health, safety, and welfare of the surrounding neighbors. The potential effects of excessive noise or disruptive behavior have been considered and addressed by imposing conditions related to noise and loitering. The project is consistent with the zoning and in keeping with the existing uses adjacent to the development. This project will contribute to the neighborhood and will serve the neighboring residents and the local employees as well as visitors. Therefore, as conditioned, the project will not detrimentally affect residentially zoned properties or any other sensitive uses in the area.

The project proposes a residential development that will provide 86 market-rate units and 10 units reserved for Very Low-Income Households. Accordingly, the project fulfills the Community Plan, Framework Element, and Housing Element goals and objectives of providing quality housing for all persons in the community, including those who otherwise might not be housed. The project utilizes development incentives to provide a higher number of residential units than would otherwise be permitted, thereby facilitating the creation of a
higher number of affordable units and addressing the need for affordable housing in the City. Additionally, the project is a Density Bonus development located along Sunset Boulevard a commercial boulevard well-served by transit. Thus, the project will contribute towards the creation of sustainable neighborhoods and a reduction in vehicle trips and VMT.

In addition, the project has been conditioned to comply with the electric vehicle requires of
state law. The project has also been conditioned to provide solar infrastructure. Together,

CPC-2021-2035-DB-CU-CUB-SPR-HCA F-17

these conditions further support applicable policies in the Health and Wellness Element, Air Quality Element, and Mobility Element of the General Plan by reducing the level of pollution/greenhouse gas emissions, ensuring new development is compatible with alternative fuel vehicles, and encouraging the adoption of low emission fuel sources and supporting infrastructure. These conditions also support good planning practice by promoting overall sustainability and providing additional benefits and conveniences for residents, workers, and visitors.

The project contributes to and furthers several applicable goals, objectives, and policies of the plans that govern land use and development in the City. Therefore, the project substantially conforms with the purpose, intent, and provisions of the General Plan and the Silver Lake- Echo Park-Elysian Valley Community Plan.
14. That the project consists of an arrangement of buildings and structures (including height, bulk and setbacks), off-street parking facilities, loading areas, lighting, landscaping, trash collection, and other such pertinent improvements that is or will be compatible with existing and future development on neighboring properties.
The arrangement of the proposed development is consistent and compatible with existing and future development in neighboring properties. The subject site is located within the Silver Lake-Echo Park-Elysian Valley Community Plan along Sunset Boulevard. The immediate surrounding properties consist of multi-story residential buildings and commercial uses.
The proposed project will include 86 residential units of which 10 will be set aside for Very Low Income Households. The project includes one (1) parking level with 69 automobile parking spaces. The subject property is one parcel of land totaling 22,449 square feet.

Height, Bulk and Setbacks

The proposed building reaches a maximum height of 83 feet 10 inches with seven (7)-stories as permitted by a request for an increase in height and stories to deviate from the underlying zoning regulations as further described in the findings above. The site setbacks are regulated by the C and R4 zones. The required front yard along Sunset Boulevard is zero feet, the required side yard setbacks is 10 feet and the rear yard setback is 19 feet. The project will provide a zero front yard setback along Sunset Boulevard, a zero side yard setback, and a zero rear yard setback.

Additionally, on August 14, 2019, the Director of Planning approved a Transit Oriented
Communities Affordable Housing Incentive Program and Site Plan Review (Case No. DIR- 2019-1957-TOC-SPR) for a project including 104 dwelling units with nine (9) reserve for Extremely Low Income (ELI) households, located at 3301-3327 West Sunset Boulevard.
As such the proposed project will be compatible with surrounding residential uses and support access to services readily available within adjacent commercially-zoned corridors by redeveloping an auto-shop use with much needed housing in the City of Los Angeles, in a design and configuration compatible with the adjacent variety of housing types including multi-
story residential buildings and mixed-use residential buildings to the north, east and south.

all applicable code requirements. None of the proposed parking will be visibte from the street. This on-site amenity allows the project to be self-contained and compatible with existing and future development.

Lighting

Lighting for the proposed project has been conditioned to be designed and installed with shielding, such that the light source cannot be seen from adjacent residential properties, the public right-of-way, nor from above. Therefore, the lighting will be compatible with the existing
and future developments in the neighborhood.

On-Site Landscaping

Various types of vegetation and trees are integrated into the landscape design of the development to enhance common space areas such as the roof terraces and to buffer from neighboring properties. The proposed project's landscaping creates a pedestrian-friendly ground floor that helps unify and bolster continuity between the neighborhood and the project site as a whole along Sunset Boulevard. Additionally, perimeter landscaping will provide a privacy buffer and screening between the subject development and the adjoining properties. Therefore, the on-site landscaping will be compatible with the existing and future developments in the neighborhood.

Trash Collection

The project will include centralized on-site trash collection for both refuse and recyclable materials, in conformance with the LAMC. Compliance with these regulations will allow the project to be compatible with existing and future development. Additionally, all trash and
recycling areas are conditioned to be enclosed and not visible to the public. Trash collection will occur within a loading zone. The trash room is not visible from the public right-of-way. Therefore, as proposed and conditioned, the project is compatible with existing and future development on neighboring properties.
As described above, the project consists, of an arrangement of buildings and structures (including height, bulk, and setbacks), off-street parking facilities, loading areas, lighting, landscaping, trash collection, and other such pertinent improvements that will be compatible with existing and future development on adjacent and neighboring properties.
15. That any residential project provides recreational and service amenities in order to improve habitability for the residents and minimize impacts on neighboring properties.
The proposed project will include 14 studios, 49 one-bedroom units, and 23 two-bedroom units. The project provides a number of indoor and outdoor common area amenities
throughout the facility. The project will provide commercial uses and a lobby on the first floor, leasing offices on the second floor, a lounge room, coworking office room, and fitness room

CPC-2021-2035-DB-CU-CUB-SPR-HCA F-19

on the third floor and an additional coworking office room on the seventh floor, as well as a
roof deck with outdoor furniture.

As described above, many services that the facility's residents require are provided on-site;
thus, minimizing impacts on neighboring properties.
The combination of these various recreational features and design features would provide adequate amenities for the building residents, and minimize any impacts on neighboring
properties.

Interim Appeal Filing Procedures CITY PLANNING

Fall 2020

Consistent with Mayor Eric Garcetti's "Safer At Home" directives to help slow the spread of COVID-19, City
Planning has implemented new procedures for the filing of appeals for non-applicants that eliminate or
minimize in-person interaction.

OPTION 1: Online Appeal Portal
(planning.lacity.org/development-services/appeal-application-online)

Entitlement and CEQA appeals can be submitted online and payment can be made by credit card or
e-check. The online appeal portal allows appellants to fill out and submit the appeal application directly to the Development Services Center (DSC). Once the appeal is accepted, the portal allows for appellants to submit a credit card payment, enabling the appeal and payment to be submitted entirely electronically. A
2.7% credit card processing service fee will be charged - there is no charge for paying online by e-check.
Appeals should be filed early to ensure DSC staff has adequate time to review and accept the documents,
and to allow Appellants time to submit payment. On the final day to file an appeal, the application must be
submitted and paid for by 4:30PM (PT). Should the final day fall on a weekend or legal holiday, the time for
filing an appeal shall be extended to 4:30PM (PT) on the next succeeding working day. Building and Safety appeals (LAMC Section 12.26K) can only be filed using Option 2 below.

OPTION 2: Drop off at DSC
An appellant may continue to submit an appeal application and payment at any of the three Development
Services Center (DSC) locations. City Planning established drop off areas at the DSCs with physical boxes
where appellants can drop.

Re:
Case No. CPC-2021-2035-DB-CU-CUB-SPR-HCA Notice of Intent to Sue

CEQA: ENV-2021-2036-CE

Dear City of Los Angeles/City of Los Angeles City Planning Commission:
On behalf of the Responsible Urban Development Initiative ("RUDI"), and potential co- plaintiffs, we respectfully submit this Notice of Intent to Sue in connection with the above- captioned Case pending before the City of Los Angeles City Planning Commission (the "CPC"). RUDI intends to file suit in the California Superior Court, County of Los Angeles against the
City of Los Angeles (the "City") and the CPC (collectively, with the City, "Defendants") to request a Petition for Writ of Mandamus and for Injunctive Relief arising from the Defendants' approval of the project addressed by the above-referenced Case No. (the "Project") in violation of California Environmental Quality Act, CEQA, Public Resources Code 5§ 21000, et seq.; Govt. Code §§ 65913.4, 65915; and Los Angeles Municipal Code §§ 12.22.A.25, 12.24.U.26.
On March 29, 2022, the CPC issued a Corrected Letter of Determination (the "LOD") in which the CPC granted approval for the Project, including: (i) determining that the Project is a Streamlined Infill Project pursuant to SB 35 allegedly in compliance with Government Code 65913.4(a), despite its location in a very high fire hazard severity zone, which thereby bars the streamlined process, and without consideration of the Project's location in such zone; (ii)
impermissibly granting various on-menu incentives that were not justified by the Project, and
doing so by converting them to "Off-Menu Incentives" and granting relief far in excess of what

Costa Mesa Denver Columbus
Washington, DC would have been permitted as "On-Menu Incentives"; (iii) granting a Conditional Use permit

pursuant to LAMC § 12.24 to provide relief from the restrictions of LAMC § 12.11, allowing 86 dwelling units in lieu of 57 units believed to be otherwise permitted in the [Q]C2-1VL Zone and
allowing a Density Bonus for a Housing Development Project to permit an increase in square footage of floor area from the zoned maximum of 33,750 square feet to 84,662 square feet, far in excess of the 35-percent maximum permitted in LAMC §§ 12.22.A.25 and U.26; and (iv) finding that the Project is exempt from CEQA and that there is nO substantial evidence demonstrating
that an exception to a categorical exemption to CEQA Guidelines, Section 15300.2, applies,
without sufficient consideration of competent evidence addressing the health, safety and environmental impact of the Project's lack of sufficient parking for residents and commercial tenants, and without sufficient review of the environmental waste stored on the lot on which the
Project will be located.

We understand that the LOD has become final with respect to both Defendants in all respects
other than the CEQA determination, and therefore RUDI must file suit before the deadline for
such action expires, five Council days, and then ninety days thereafter, from the date of the LOD.
Despite this notice, and the lawsuit that we intend to file on behalf of RUDI to file, we hope to engage in productive discussions with the Defendants and reach a positive outcome that will benefit the City, the neighborhood of Silver Lake, and the residents who live around the location
of the Project.

Sincerely,

David J. Richardson
Counsel to the Responsible Urban Development Initiative
