23 TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA:

24 PLEASE TAKE NOTICE that, under Public Resources Code section 21167.7 and Code of
25| Civil Procedure section 388, Petitioner City of San Dimas (the "City" or "Petitioner") filed a Petition
26 for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief against Respondent Metro
27 Gold Line Foothill Extension Construction Authority (the "Authority") on August 26, 2022 in the
28 Superior Court for the County of Los Angeles. The City's Petition alleges that the Authority

01171.0024/813395.1
NOTICE TO ATTORNEY GENERAL

violated the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") by engaging in a CEQA action in

2 modifying an approved project to design, contract, and construct the Los Angeles to Pasadena Metro
Gold Line extension project (the "Gold Line Extension").
Specifically, the City challenges the Authority's July 27, 2022 certification of the final
Supplemental Environmental Impact Report 3 ("Final SEIR 3") and adoption of Resolution No.

6 2022-R-14 on the following grounds:

a. The Final SEIR 3 violates CEQA because it does not consider an adequate range of
8 alternatives capable of reducing the project's significant impacts;

9 b. The Final SEIR 3 does not adequately address the increased traffic and traffic
10 queuing on surrounding roadways, including small residential roads, to access the parking facility,

11 and the Authority's conclusion that drivers will typically use major streets is not substantiated by
12 any evidence;

13 C. The Final SEIR does not adequately address pedestrian or cyclist safety and relies
14 solely on the 2013 Final EIR for the unmodified project;

15 d. The aesthetics discussion in Final SEIR 3 is deficient, as the analysis only considers
16 the view impacts from some, but not all, of the residential properties in the area. Furthermore, the
17 analysis is limited to only a portion of the Project area and concludes that there is no significant
18 change in use; and

19 e. The greenhouse gas mitigation measures are illusory and do not pass muster under
20 CEQA.

21 The City seeks a writ of mandate (1) vacating and setting aside the Authority's certification
22 of the Final SEIR 3 and adoption of Resolution No. 2022-R-14, and (2) directing the Authority to
23 conduct a new environmental review process that complies with CEQA's requirements, and prepare,
24 circulate, and consider a new and legally adequate supplemental EIR and otherwise comply with
25 CEQA in any subsequent action taken. The Petition will also seek a declaratory judgment that the
26 Final SEIR 3 is deficient as an environmental document under CEQA, and that Respondents may
27 not use the Final SEIR 3 to modify the Project and relocate the parking facility. In addition, the
a 28 Petition will seek a temporary stay; temporary restraining order; and preliminary and permanent

01171.0024/813395.1 -2-

injunctions should issue restraining the Authority from constructing and operating the project
2 modifications contained in the Final SEIR 3 until the Authority fully complies with the requirements

23 INTRODUCTION

24 1. The Metro Gold Line Foothill Extension Construction Authority (the "Authority")
25  is an independent transportation planning, design, and construction agency created by the California

26 State Legislature in 1998 to design, contract, and construct the Los Angeles to Pasadena Metro Gold
27 Line extension project (the "Gold Line Extension"). In 2013, the Board of Directors for the
28 Authority certified and approved the Final Environmental Impact Report (Â°2013 FEIR"), which was

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
01171.0024/807832.2

1 prepared in connection with the construction of the Gold Line Extension in general, and with the
2 segment connecting Azusa to Montclair in particular. Once completed, the Gold Line Extension

3 will connect the City of Los Angeles with the San Gabriel Valley and the Inland Empire.

4 2. As construction of the Gold Line Extension has progressed, the Authority has made
numerous changes to the original project detailed in the 2013 FEIR to account for changed and/or

6 unanticipated local conditions. These changes have been incorporated through several addendums

7 and supplemental environmental impact reports since certifying and adopting the 2013 FEIR.

3. This Petition for Writ of Mandate ("Petition") seeks to invalidate the most recent

9 supplemental environmental impact report (abbreviated as "Final SEIR 3" below) to the Gold Line
10 Extension, certified and approved by the Authority's Board of Directors on July 27, 2022 in
11 Resolution No. 2022-R-14, "Resolution of the Metro Gold Line Foothill Extension Construction

12 Authority Certifying the Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Report 3 regarding Metro Gold
13 Line Foothill Extension Project Phase 2B (Azusa to Montclair) San Dimas Parking Facility
14 Relocation."

15 4. This Petition challenges Resolution No. 2022-R-14 on the following grounds:

16 a. The Final SEIR 3 violates CEQA because it does not consider an adequate range of
17 alternatives capable of reducing the project's significant impacts;

18 b. The Final SEIR 3 does not adequately address the increased traffic and traffic
19 queuing on surrounding roadways, including small residential roads, to access the parking facility,
20 and the Authority's conclusion that drivers will typically use major streets is not substantiated by
21 any evidence;

22 c. The Final SEIR 3 does not adequately address pedestrian or cyclist safety and relies
23 solely on the 2013 Final EIR for the unmodified project;

24 d. The aesthetics discussion in Final SEIR 3 is deficient, as the analysis only considers
25 the view impacts from some, but not all, of the residential properties in the area. Furthermore, the
26 analysis is limited to only a portion of the Project area and concludes that there is no significant
27 change in use; and

28 ///

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
01171.0024/807832.2 -2-

e. The greenhouse gas mitigation measures are illusory and do not pass muster under

2 CEQA.

3 5. For these reasons, the Authority's certification of the Final SEIR 3 constituted an
4 abuse of discretion and must be overturned. This Petition, thus, also seeks a writ of mandate: (1)

5 Directing Respondents to suspend all activities with respect to the parking facility relocation; (2)

6 directing Respondents to comply with CEQA with respect to the parking facility relocation; (3) a
7 stay of actions to carry out the parking facility relocation; and (4) an award of attorneys' fees and

costs.

9 PARTIES

10 6. Petitioner City of San Dimas ("City" or "Petitioner") is a municipal corporation and
11 general law city duly organized and legally incorporated as of August 4, 1960, and validly existing

12 under the laws of the State of California.

13 7. Respondent Metro Gold Line Foothill Extension Construction Authority (the
14 "Authority") is an independent transportation, design, and construction agency created by the
15 California State Legislature through Senate Bill 1847 (1998) (later updated through Assembly Bill
16 706 (2011) and Assembly Bill 1600 (2012)), which were codified under the Public Utilities Code
17 sections 132400 et seq. The Authority was created to succeed the Los Angeles County Metropolitan
18 Transportation Authority ("LACMTA") in designing, awarding contracts for, and constructing the
19 Gold Line Extension and as the lead agency for purposes of the California Environmental Quality
20 Act ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code sections 21000 et seq. review. The Authority has special
21 and limited jurisdiction and possesses only those powers that have been specifically granted to it by
22 statute and others necessarily implied.

23 8. Real Party in Interest City of San Dimas as Successor Agency to the City of San
24 Dimas Redevelopment Agency (the "Successor Agency") is the successor agency to the former City
25 of San Dimas Redevelopment Agency, which was terminated by virtue of Assembly Bill ABX1-26.
26 The Successor Agency was formed to undertake the actions required pursuant to the Community
27 Redevelopment Law, including winding down the affairs of the Redevelopment Agency.

respondents, Petitioner will file an amendment to the Petition identifying such respondent by name.
FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

Metro Gold Line Foothill Extension Construction Authority

9 10. Public Utilities Code section 132400 defines the Gold Line Extension as a light rail
10 project along the rail right-of-way that connects Union Station in the City of Los Angeles with the

11 City of Montclair. The PUC authorizes the Authority to plan and construct any "fixed mass transit
12 guide way eastward to Claremont," and includes the oversight and management of the Gold Line
13 Extension. The Gold Line Extension was amended to expand as far as the regional transit hub in the
14 City of Montclair ("Montclair Transcenter"). Once Project construction is complete, the Authority
15 will transfer operations of the Gold Line back to LACMTA, a relationship that is formalized in a
16 Master Cooperative Agreement approved by both agencies' Boards of Directors in 2010.

17 Environmental Review of the Gold Line Extension

18 11. In 2003, after having taken over management of the Gold Line Extension from
19 LACMTA pursuant to legislative action, the Authority completed the first segment of the Gold Line
20 Extension, which extended the rail system from Union Station in the City of Los Angeles to the City
21 of Pasadena.

22 12. In 2006, the initial Draft Environmental Impact Report ("DEIR") for the Gold Line
23 Extension was completed. This DEIR covered the entire corridor between the Sierra Madre Villa
24 station in the City of Pasadena through to the City of Montclair. However, the Final Environmental
25 Impact Report ("FEIR") study analyzed two (2) alternative construction options: (1) a light-rail
26 transit ("LRT") Full-Build option, which would complete the entire extension to the City of
27 Montclair; and (2) an LRT Phased-Build option, which would extend to the City of Azusa in the

28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
01171.0024/807832.2 -4-

first phase (known as "Phase 2A"), and would extend to the City of Montclair in the second phase
2 (known as "Phase 2B").

3 13. In 2007, the Authority's Board of Directors certified and approved the FEIR, opting

4 for the LRT Phased Build option.

5 14. In 2010, the Authority began constructing the second segment of the Gold Line
6 Extension, which extended the rail system from the City of Pasadena to the City of Azusa. This

7 segment was completed in 2015.

8 15. In March 2013, the Authority's Board of Directors certified the Final Environmental

O Impact Review (*2013 FEIR") for the next phase of the extension, pursuant to the California
10 Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA," Public Resource Code sections 21000 et seq.), prepared in
11 connection with approval of the approximately 12.3-mile extension of the Gold Line Extension
12 segment connecting the Azusa-Citrus Station in the City of Azusa to the Montclair Transcenter in
13 the City of Montclair. This extension will include six new stations in the cities of Glendora, San
14 Dimas, La Verne, Pomona, Claremont, and Montclair.

15 Environmental Review of Modifications to the Gold Line Extension

16 16. In May 2014, the Authority considered certain refinements to the Gold Line
17 Extension associated with grade separation of Garey Avenue in the City of Pomona. The Authority's
18 environmental review of these refinements took the form of an addendum ("Addendum No. 1) to

19 the 2013 FEIR.

20 17. In November 2014, the Authority considered certain additional refinements to the

21 Gold Line Extension, specifically addressing the construction of the segment between the City of
22 Pasadena and the City of Montclair in two phases, as well as technical changes to the engineering
23 design. The Authority's environmental review of these refinements took the form of an addendum
24 ("Addendum No. 2) to the 2013 FEIR.

25 18. In March 2016, the Authority considered certain additional refinements to the Gold
26 Line Extension, specifically to evaluate whether implementation of the proposed Project changes
27 would result in new significant impacts or increase the severity of previously identified significant
28 environmental effects, or would otherwise require the preparation of a supplemental or subsequent

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
01171.0024/807832.2 -5-

EIR ("SEIR") under CEQA. The Authority's environmental review of these refinements again took
2 the form of an addendum (*Addendum No. 3") to the 2013 FEIR. Advanced conceptual engineering
plans for the Project were also completed in 2016.

4 19. In September 2017, the Authority considered certain additional refinements to the
Gold Line Extension, specifically to evaluate modifications that include increasing the height and/or
footprint of some parking structures; closing an at-grade crossing and restructuring a grade
separation; relocating traction power supply substation facilities, and creating new access to city
facilities; as well as minor alignment shifts throughout the extension. The Authority's
environmental review of these refinements again took the form of another addendum ("Addendum

10 No. 4") to the 2013 FEIR.

11 20. In June 2019, the Authority prepared and considered a Supplemental Environmental
12 Impact Report to evaluate environmental effects of revisions to the 2013 FEIR and proposed project
13 modifications. The project modifications included revised phasing construction and operation of
14 the Project, as well as a new traffic mitigation measure. Specifically, the Authority proposed to
15 conduct and operation the Project in three construction phases, rather than the two construction
16 phases established in Addendum No. 2. The project modifications also included a new traffic
17 mitigation measure that would restripe a portion of a street, as well as a minor rail alignment
18 adjustment. The Supplemental Environmental Impact Report ("SEIR 1") was certified in July 2019.

19 21. In January 2021, the Authority prepared and considered another Supplemental
20 Environmental Impact Report to evaluate environmental effects of further proposed project
21 modifications to the 2013 FEIR. The project modifications included a change from parking
22 structures to surface parking lots for the Glendora, San Dimas, La Verne, and Pomona locations, as
23 well as a parking structure at Claremont. The project modifications were prompted by the
24 Supportive Transit Parking Program Master Plan ("STPP"), adopted by the Metro Board in January
25 2018. The change to surface parking lots would reduce the total number of available parking spaces
26 at the stations so that the number of parking spaces aligned with the number of parking spaces
27 identified in the STPP, Appendix F, "Gold Line Foothill Extension Phase 2B Parking Analysis." At

28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
01171.0024/807832.2 -6-

some stations, the project modifications would also result in minor changes related to the
2 configuration of vehicle and pedestrian access.

22. With respect to San Dimas in particular, the number of parking spaces would be
4 reduced from 450 in the 2013 SEIR to 289 spaces as a result of the project modifications, a reduction
of 161 spaces. The project modifications caused concern with the City and its residents that there
may be insufficient parking at the station, which will lead to spill-over parking in the surrounding
commercial and residential areas, causing serious parking issues. These concerns were raised to the
Authority during both the written public comment period and the public hearing. While the
Authority responded to the City's written comments, it did not commit to resolving the anticipated
10 parking issues. Nevertheless, the second Supplemental Environmental Impact Report ("SEIR 2")
11 was certified in January 2021.
12 Environmental Review of Modifications to the Gold Line Extension in the City of San Dimas

13 in Supplemental Environmental Impact Report 3

14 23. The original location for station parking in San Dimas (reviewed in FEIR 2013 and
15 SEIR 2) was the City's Maintenance Yard, a 2.18-acre property owned by the City and located at
16 301 S. Walnut Avenue. If the parking facility was located at the City's Maintenance Yard, however,
17 the City would be forced to relocate its Yard site at significant cost to the City of approximately $25
18 million.

19 24. As a result, the City and the Authority began considering a different location for
20 station parking south of the Project right-of-way between Monte Vista Avenue and San Dimas

21 Avenue. Specifically, the City and the Authority considered the San Dimas Park & Ride, which is

22 owned by the City and operated as a commuter bus line by Foothill Transit, as well as two
23 neighboring parcels (owned by the Successor Agency) northwest of the Park & Ride to be
24 potentially utilized for access to the proposed parking facility in order to avoid traffic on Cataract
25 Avenue and other neighborhood streets (the Park & Ride and two neighboring parcels are referred
26 to as the "New Parcels). The Park & Ride has 175 parking spaces, which are utilized not only by
27 commuters of the Foothill Transit bus line, but patrons of the City's historic downtown, its
28 businesses, and the community at large. A true and correct copy of the site plan, which includes the

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
01171.0024/807832.2 -7-

original parking facility and the proposed parking facility, is attached hereto as Exhibit "A" and

2 incorporated herein.

25. To document the City and the Authority's intentions, the parties entered into a
binding Letter of Intent on June 17, 2021, under which the parties agreed to work together in good
faith toward execution of a mutually agrecable purchase and sale agreement for the purchase of the
New Parcels, subject to the Authority securing all CEQA approvals necessary for the Authority's
contemplated use of the New Parcels.

8 26. To evaluate the environmental effects of the proposed new location of the parking
facility and its modification to the Project, the Authority prepared and considered another
10 supplemental environmental impact report. The draft supplemental environmental impact report
11 ("Draft SEIR 3) was made available on February 18, 2022.

12 27. In addition to the proposed new parking facility, the project modifications also
13 considered in Draft SEIR 3 included the following:

14 a. A new access road to the parking facility along Commercial Street (south of the
15 proposed parking facility).

16 b. A "Kiss & Ride" area for pick-up and drop-off;

17 c. Bus drop-off for Foothill Transit services at the intersection of Bonita Avenue (north
18 of the proposed parking facility) and San Dimas A venue (east of the proposed parking facility);

19 d. Redevelopment of the existing parking lot to accommodate the 289 parking spaces
20 identified in SEIR 2 for the original parking facility;

21 e. Proposed vehicular access from Commercial Street and Monte Vista Avenue (west
22 of the proposed parking facility);

23 f. Pedestrian access via a pedestrian crossing and signal on San Dimas Avenue, west
24 of the station platform and south of the Project right-of-way. Pedestrian access would no longer be

27 The site map does not highlight the two neighboring parcels owned by the Successor Agency, but which are located in the upper left portion of the site map between Bonita Avenue and W. 28 Railway Street.

01171.0024/807832.2 -8-

1 provided from the eastern side of the station platform, and pedestrian and bicycle access would no
2 longer be provided from Walnut Avenue, east of the station platform;

3 g. Fencing and landscaping along the perimeter of the proposed parking facility, and
4 along the new access road on Commercial Street; and

5 h. "Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design" features to provide a safe,
6 secure, and comfortable transit system.

7 In the Draft SEIR 3, the Authority stated it would work with the City to install traffic calming
8 elements around the parking facility, such as speed humps/bumps and signage. The Authority also
9 claimed in the Draft SEIR 3 that the 3 Project elements, "including alignment, stations, and grade
10 crossings, would be the same as presented in the 2013 FEIR and subsequent environmental actions,
11 with the exception of the revised parking configurations and associated changes to vehicle and

12 pedestrian access discussed herein.3

13 28. On April 1, 2022, the City served the Authority with a letter providing its comments
14 on the 3 Draft SEIR 3 and raised numerous concerns about the Authority's inadequate environmental
15 analysis. The City's comment letter focused on deficiencies in the following areas: 1) Project
16 description; 2) transportation and parking; 3) aesthetics; 4) air quality and greenhouse emissions; 5)
17 community parks and open space; 6) cultural resources; 7) noise and vibration; 8) safety and
18 security; 9) water quality and resources; and 10) general comments. A true and correct copy of the
19 April 1, 2022 letter is attached hereto as Exhibit "B" and incorporated herein.

20 29. On July 14, 2022, the Authority served the City with a letter responding to the City's a
21 comments and concerns of April 1, 2022. While the response letter addressed some of the
22 deficiencies raised by the City, the response letter failed to address others. A true and correct copy
23 of the July 14, 2022 letter is attached hereto as Exhibit "C" and incorporated herein.

24 30. On July 21, 2022, the final SEIR 3 ("Final SEIR 3") was made available on the
25 Authority's official website, and the City was advised that the Authority would be considering
26 i certification of the Final SEIR 3 and 3 approval of the project modifications on July 27, 2022.
27 ///

28 ///

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
01171.0024/807832.2 -9-

31. The Final SEIR 3 did not correct the deficiencies raised by the City in the Draft SEIR
3. Specifically, the 3 Final SEIR 3 maintained the following deficiencies and incomplete analyses of
concern to the City:
a. The Final SEIR 3 violates CEQA because it does not consider an adequate range of
I alternatives capable of reducing the Project's significant impacts. Specifically, the Final SEIR 3
fails to adequately respond to potentially feasible alternatives previously studied, and contractually
agreed to between the Authority and the City (and the Successor Agency), including an alternative
wherein the Authority had agreed to the purchase of two additional parcels of land owned by the
Successor Agency. The acquisition of these parcels would result in significant changes to the Project
10 affecting access to the proposed parking facility from Cataract Avenue, ingress, egress, parking
11 availability, traffic on neighborhood streets, and other aspects of the Project. The Final SEIR 3
12 completely ignores this alternative. While the Authority will be gaining 289 parking spaces for its
13 own commuters, the City will be losing 175 parking spaces in the heart of its downtown for bus
14 commuters, businesses, patrons, and the community at large, which will have a cumulative impact
15 on traffic, air quality, greenhouse gas, noise, and other environmental impacts on the surrounding
16 residential and commercial properties which have not been adequately analyzed. The loss of this
17 available daily parking currently dedicated to ride share users will severely impact traffic patterns
18 and flows in the downtown area and restrict availability for commuters to take advantage of ride
19 sharing benefits.

20 b. The Final SEIR 3 does not adequately address the increased traffic and traffic
21 queuing on surrounding roadways, including small residential roads, to access the parking facility,

22 and the Authority's conclusion that drivers will typically use major streets is not substantiated by
23 any evidence. Additional studies are necessary to address the impacts on traffic on these adjacent
24 residential roads resulting from the Project.

25 3 c. The Final SEIR 3 does not adequately address pedestrian or cyclist safety and relies
26 solely on the 2013 Final ElR for the unmodified Project. Instead of studying the effects of the Project
27 on pedestrians or cyclists or developing any mitigation for such impacts, the Authority simply states
28 in its Response to Comments that they "will work with the City of San Dimas to identify and fund

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
01171.0024/807832.2 -10-

traffic control on Commercial Street and Monte Vista Avenue as warranted to reduce potential
automobile and pedestrian/bicycle conflicts." The Final SEIR 3 itself, however, fails to adequately
address pedestrian or cyclist safety.
d. The aesthetics discussion in Final SEIR 3 is deficient, as the analysis only considers
the view impacts from some, but not all, of the residential properties in the area. Furthermore, the
analysis is limited to only a portion of the Project area and concludes that there is no significant
change in use. However, the analysis ignores the impacts created from another part of the Project
8 which develops a new access road within an existing park, and the removal and alteration of

9 vegetation and changed lighting impacts from such road. Furthermore, the Final SEIR 3 does not 3
10 address the impacts on the community resulting from the removal of this park space.

11 e. Greenhouse gas (GHG") mitigation measures are illusory and do not pass muster
12 under CEQA. The Final SEIR 3 concludes the Project would not result in a significant impact on
13 climate change, but this conclusion is not supported by adequate analysis or substantial evidence.
14 The Authority responds to the City regarding this deficiency in comments that, "[b]ased on
15 experience with Phase 2A of the Gold Line and other project openings, the traveling public quickly
16 adjusts to an understanding of available parking and will adjust their travel to/from stations
17 accordingly." This type of conclusory opinion based on nothing more than a single prior experience
18 is not a sufficient study under CEQA of the potential impacts and does not appear to be seriously
19 designed to mitigate the Project's GHG emissions.
20 f. All other concerns raised by the City and set forth in detail in Exhibit "A."

21 32. As a result, on July 26, 2022, the City sent another letter to the Authority, advising
22 that it continued to have major concerns with the relocation of the parking facility and the
23 Authority's environmental analysis, as several of the deficiencies and potential impacts raised by
24 the City were not adequately addressed. The City, thus, requested that the Authority delay the
25 certification action in order to address the appropriate mitigations for the Project. A true and correct
26 copy of the July 26, 2022 letter is attached hereto as Exhibit "D" and incorporated herein.

27 33. Notwithstanding the City's ongoing concerns and request for delayed action, the
28 Authority's Board of Directors proceeded with a public hearing to consider and certify the Final

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
01171.0024/807832.2 -11-

SEIR 3 on July 27, 2022. During the portion of the public hearing on the agenda item, the City
2 Manager and City's consultant for the City provided comment on behalf of the City in opposition
to the certification of the Final SEIR 3. The Authority's Board of Directors, however, voted to
4 certify the Final SEIR 3 and adopt Resolution No. 2022-R-14, "Resolution of the Metro Gold Line
Foothill Extension Construction Authority Certifying the Final Supplemental Environmental Impact
6 Report 3 regarding Metro Gold Line Foothill Extension Project Phase 2B (Azusa to Montclair) San

7 Dimas Parking Facility Relocation. On July 28, 2022, the Notice of Determination was filed.

8 PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

0 34. Petitioner files this Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and
10 Injunctive Relief pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 526, 527, 1060, and 1085, as well as
11 Public Resources Code sections 21168, 21168.5, and 21168.9. Petitioner has no effective remedy
12 to challenge the certification at issue in this action other than by means of this lawsuit.

13 35. This action was timely filed within thirty (30) days of the Authority's filing of the
14 Notice of Determination approving the 3 SEIR 3 on July 28, 2022. Petitioner performed all conditions
15  precedent to filing this action by complying with the requirements of Public Resources Code section
16 22167.5 in serving notice of intent to file this action on August 24, 2022. A true and correct copy
17 of the Notice of Intent to File and its attached proof of service is attached hereto as Exhibit "E."

18 36. The City will send a copy of this Petition and Complaint to the California Attorney
19 General within ten (10) days of filing, thereby complying with the requirements of Public Resources
20 Code section 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure section 388.

21 37. Pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.6(b)(2), the City elects to prepare
22 the record of proceedings in this action. Concurrently with this Petition and Complaint, the City is
23 filing a notice of election to prepare the administrative record.

24 38. The City has performed any and all conditions precedent to filing the instant action

25 and has exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent possible and required
26 by law. The City submitted and made numerous objections highlighting the Final SEIR 3's
27 inadequacy as an environmental document and the Authority's failure to comply with CEQA.
28 ///

01171.0024/807832.2 -12-

39. The City has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law
2 unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to set aside their

3 certification of the Final SEIR 3. In the absence of such remedies, Respondents' project

4 modifications will remain in effect in violation of state law, and the City, the environment, residents,
and property owners of the City will be irreparably harmed. No money damages or legal remedy

6 could adequately compensate for that harm.

7 LEGAL BACKGROUND

40. The California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code sections 21000-
21177, is a comprehensive statute designed to provide for long-term protection of the environment.

10 It accomplishes this in two ways.

11 41. First, CEQA is designed to inform decisionmakers and the public about the potential
12 significant environmental effects of project. (CEQA Guidelines Â§ 15002(a)(1).) Such disclosure
13 ensures that "long term protection of the environment shall be the guiding criterion in public
14 decisions." (Pub. Res. Code Â§ 21001(d).) The EIR is the "heart" of this requirement. (See No Oil,
15 Inc. v. City of Los Angeles (1974) 13 Cal. 3d 68, 84.) The EIR has been described as "an
16 environmental 'alarm bell' whose purpose it is to alert the public and its responsible officials to
17 environmental changes before they have reached ecological points of no return." (Co. of Inyo v.
18 Yorty (1973) 32 Cal.App.3d 795, 810.)

19 42. Second, CEQA requires public agencies to avoid or reduce environmental damage
20 whenever feasible by considering changes in projects through project alternatives or mitigation
21 measures. (CEQA Guidelines Â§15002(a)(2) and (3); see also Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Bd. of
22 Supervs. (1990) 52 Cal. 3d 553, 564; Laurel Heights Improvement Ass'n v. Regents of the Univ. of
23 Cal. (1988) 47 Cal. 3d 376, 399.) An accurate and complete project description is central to this
24 requirement so "affected outsiders and public decision-makers [can] balance the proposal's benefit
25 against its environmental cost, consider mitigation measures, assess the advantage of terminating
26 the proposal (i.e., the 'no project' alternative), and weigh other alternatives in the balance." (Co. of
27| Inyo v. City of Los Angeles (1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 185, 192-93.)
28  ///

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
01171.0024/807832.2 -13-

43. As the lead agency for the Gold Line Extension, under Public Resources Code

2 section 21081 and CEQA Guidelines section 15091, the Authority is prohibited from approving a
project for which an EIR was prepared unless either the project will not have a significant effect on

4 the environment, or the agency has adopted findings that all significant environmental effects have
been eliminated or reduced substantially and that any remaining effects found to be unavoidable are
6 acceptable on the basis of overriding concerns.

7 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

8 (Petition for Writ of Mandate - Code of Civil Procedure Â§ 1085)

9 44. Petitioner incorporates herein by reference the allegations of paragraphs 1 through
10 43 inclusive.

11 45. CEQA requires an EIR to include an accurate and complete project description that
12 fully discloses and fairly evaluates the nature and objectives of a project. (CEQA Guidelines co.
13 15124.) An accurate and complete project description is necessary so that the lead agency and the
14 public have enough information to "ascertain the project's environmentally significant effects,
15 assess ways of mitigating them, and consider project alternatives." (Sierra Club v. City of Orange
16 (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 523, 533; Save Round Valley Alliance v. Co. of Inyo (2007) 157 Cal.App.4th
17 1437, 1448.)

18 46. The Final SEIR 3 violates CEQA because it does not consider an adequate range of
19 alternatives capable of reducing the Project's significant impacts. Specifically, the Final SEIR
20 fails to adequately respond to potentially feasible alternatives previously studied, and contractually
21 agreed to between the Authority and the City (and the Successor Agency), including an alternative
22 wherein the Authority had agreed to the purchase of two additional parcels of land owned by the
23 Successor Agency. The acquisition of these parcels would result in significant changes to the
24 Project, affecting access to the proposed parking facility from Cataract Avenue, ingress, egress,
25 parking availability, traffic on neighborhood streets, and other aspects of the Project. Final SEIR 3
26 completely ignores this alternative. While the Authority will be gaining 289 parking spaces for its
27 own commuters, the City will be losing 175 parking spaces in the heart of its downtown for bus
28 commuters, businesses, patrons, and the community at large, which will have a cumulative impact

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
01171.0024/807832.2 -14-

on traffic, air quality, greenhouse gas, noise, and other environmental impacts on the surrounding
2 residential and commercial properties which have not been adequately analyzed. The loss of this
available daily parking currently dedicated to ride share users will severely impact traffic patterns

4 and flows in the downtown area and restrict availability for commuters to take advantage of ride
sharing benefits.

47. By certifying the Final SEIR 3 with an incomplete analysis of the Project's impacts,
the Authority committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion, failed to proceed in a manner required by
law, and acted without substantial evidentiary support.
9 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

10 (Petition for Writ of Mandate Code of Civil Procedure Â§ 1085)
11 48. Petitioner incorporates herein by reference the allegations of paragraphs 1 through
12 47, inclusive.

13 49. When an EIR identifies significant environmental impacts that may result from a
14 project, the lead agency must make one or more specific findings for those impacts. (Pub. Res. Code
15 Â§ 21081; CEQA Guidelines Â§Â§ 15091(a), 15121(b)). The CEQA Guidelines require an EIR to
16 identify and analyze the impacts of a project with "a sufficient degree of analysis to provide
17 decisionmakers with information which enables them to make a decision which intelligently takes
18 account of environmental consequences." (CEQA Guidelines Â§ 15151.)

19 50. The CEQA Guidelines add a requirement that each finding must be accompanied by
20 || a brief explanation of the rationale for that finding. (CEQA Guidelines Â§ 15091(a); see Village
21 Laguna of Laguna Beach, Inc. V. Board of Supervs. (1982) 134 Cal.App.3d. 1022, 1034; City of
22 Rancho Palos Verdes v. City Council (1976) 59 Cal.App.3d 869.) e omission of relevant

23 information is deemed prejudicial if it prevents informed decision making and public participation,
24 "regardless of whether a different outcome would have resulted if the public agency had complied
25 with those provisions." (Washoe Meadows Community v. Dep't of Parks & Rec. (2017) 17
26 Cal.App.5th 277, 290 (citing Pub. Resources Code, Â§ 21005(a).)

27 51. The Final SEIR 3 does not adequately address the increased traffic and traffic
28 queuing on surrounding roadways, including small residential roads, to access the parking facility,

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
01171.0024/807832.2 -15-

and the Authority's conclusion that drivers will typically use major streets is not substantiated by
2 any evidence. Additional studies are necessary to address the impacts on traffic on these adjacent

3 residential roads resulting from the Project.

4 52. The aesthetics discussion in Final SEIR 3 is also deficient, as the analysis only
considers the view impacts from some, but not all, of the residential properties in the area.

6 Furthermore, the analysis is limited to only a portion of the Project area and concludes that there is

7 no significant change in use. However, the analysis ignores the impacts created from another part
of the Project that develops a new access road within an existing park and the removal and alteration
of vegetation and changed lighting impacts from such road. Furthermore, the Final SEIR 3 does not

10 address the impacts on the community resulting from the removal of this park space.

11 53. Likewise, greenhouse gas ("GHG") mitigation measures are illusory and do not pass
12 muster under CEQA. The Final SEIR 3 concludes the Project would not result in significant impact

13 on climate change, but this conclusion is not supported by adequate analysis or substantial evidence.
14 The Authority responds to the City regarding this deficiency in comments that, "[b]ased on
15 experience with Phase 2A of the Gold Line and other project openings, the traveling public quickly
16 adjusts to an understanding of available parking and will adjust their travel to/from stations
17 accordingly." This type of conclusory opinion based on nothing more than single prior experience

18 is not a sufficient study under CEQA of the potential impacts and does not appear to be seriously
19  designed to mitigate the Project's GHG emissions.

20 54. Respondents violated CEQA by adopting inadequate findings. The City's findings
21 do not provide adequate reasoning or the analytic route from facts to conclusions, as required by
22 law. In certifying the Final SEIR 3 without a complete analysis of the impacts of the project
23 modifications, the Authority committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion, failed to a proceed in a
24 manner required by law, and acted without substantial evidentiary support.
25 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

26 (Petition for Writ of Mandate - Code of Civil Procedure 8 1085)

27 55. Petitioner incorporates herein by reference the allegations of paragraphs 1 through
28 54, inclusive.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
01171.0024/807832.2 -16-

56. Under the CEQA Guidelines, the lead agency is required to consult with other public
agencies in a variety of circumstances which are relevant here in light of the impacts the proposed
modifications to the Project will have on City streets and the safety of pedestrians and cyclists. (See
4 e.g., CEQA Guidelines Â§Â§ 15006, 15063, 15083, 15086.) One of those circumstances is when the
lead agency prepares a Supplemental or Subsequent EIR for changes to a project. Pub. Res. Code
Â§ 21080.1.)

57. The Final SEIR 3 does 3 not adequately address pedestrian or cyclist safety and relies
solely on the 2013 Final EIR for the unmodified Project. Instead of studying the effects of the Project
on pedestrians or cyclists or developing any mitigation for such impacts, the Authority simply states
10 in its Response to Comments that they "will work with the City of San Dimas to identify and fund
11 traffic control on Commercial Street and Monte Vista Avenue as warranted to reduce potential
12 automobile and pedestrian/bicycle conflicts." 3 The Final SEIR 3 itself, however, fails to adequately
13 address pedestrian or cyclist safety.

14 58. By wrongfully adopting a supplemental EIR without properly consulting with the
15 City, the Authority violated CEQA requirements to consult with the City about the environmental
16 impacts which would result from the project modifications, mitigations measures or changes to the
17 modifications which would eliminate, reduce, or mitigate those impacts. In doing so, the Authority
18 committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion, failed to proceed in a manner required by law, and acted
19 without substantial evidentiary support.
20 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

21 (Declaratory Relief - Code of Civil Procedure Â§ 1060)

22 59. Petitioner incorporates herein by reference the allegations of paragraphs 1 through
23 58, inclusive.

24 60. An actual controversy has arisen and now exists relating to the rights and duties of
25 the parties herein. The City contends that, because of the Final SEIR 3's fatal defects as an
26 | environmental document, it does not satisfy the requirements of CEQA and that Respondents cannot
27 rely on the Final SEIR 3 to modify the Project and relocate the parking facility. In contrast,

28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
01171.0024/807832.2 -17-

Respondents contend that the Authority may rely on the Final SEIR 3 to modify the Project and

2 relocate the parking facility.

3 61. There is an ongoing controversy between the parties regarding the legal effect of the

4 Final SEIR 3. The City, therefore, seeks declarations that the Final SEIR 3 is deficient as an
5 environmental document under CEQA, and that Respondents may not use the Final SEIR 3 to
6 modify the Project and relocate the parking facility.

7 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

8 (Injunctive Relief - Code of Civil Procedure Â§ 526, 527)

9 62. Petitioner incorporates herein by reference the allegations of paragraphs 1 through
10 61, inclusive.

11 63. The Authority's project modifications have the potential to cause significant effects
12 on the environment. Those effects must be properly reviewed in compliance with CEQA and
13 adequately mitigated to the extent feasible.

14 64. As a result of the Authority's non-compliance with CEQA, certification of the Final
15 SEIR 3, and adoption of Resolution No. 2022-R-14, the City, the environment, residents, and
16 property owners of the City have and will continue to suffer irreparable injury, in that the adverse
17 environmental impacts of the project modifications have not been adequately analyzed and/or
18 mitigated.

19 65. The City has exhausted all administrative remedies, and further efforts would be
20 futile, resulting in irreparable harm.

21 66. A temporary stay; temporary restraining order; and .preliminary and permanent
22 injunctions should issue restraining the Authority from constructing and operating the project
23 modifications contained in the Final SEIR 3 until the Authority fully complies with the requirements
24 of CEQA.

Subject: Comments on Draft Supplemental EIR (DSEIR) Metro Gold Line Extension Phase 2B - Evaluating Relocation of the San Dimas Parking Facility

Dear Ms. Buch:

Please allow this letter to serve as the City of San Dimas' comments on the above-referenced Draft Supplemental Environmental Impact Report 3 ("Draft SEIR 3") for the relocation of the San Dimas parking facility. This letter follows a letter previously submitted to Metro Gold Line Foothill Extension Construction Authority (the "Authority") on November 17, 2021 regarding the Notice of Preparation of the Draft SEIR 3, which raised significant concerns about the relocation of the parking facility from the City Yard to the proposed Park and Ride location on the City and its community.

Despite our efforts to work with Metro Gold Line to address the impacts on the City and the surrounding community, the Draft SEIR 3 does not adequately address our concerns, as detailed
below.

Project Description

1. The Draft SEIR 3 does not accurately describe the proposed Project Modifications. The Project Description states the "Project Modifications also include roadway improvements to accommodate vehicles accessing the parking facility along Commercial street". However, no specific information regarding these improvements is provided. Further, there iS no mention of the modifications to Freedom Park that are proposed. The Project Modifications would result in a portion of the existing Freedom Park site to be improved with an access road. Additionally, the Kiss and Ride Drop Area appears to further encroach into Freedom Park, which is not disclosed in the Project Description. Additionally, throughout the Draft SEIR 3, reference is made only to the existing Park & Ride lot when discussing the Project Modifications. As a result, it is unclear if the Draft 3 SEIR 3 adequately assesses impacts as they relate to the proposed improvements and

Response to Draft SEIR Metro Gold Line Extension -Relocation of the San Dimas Parking Facility San Dimas CA, 91773 2
April 1, 2022

the conversion of a portion of Freedom Park to an access road.

2. Draft SEIR 3, Page 3-20, Traffic Circulation, incorrectly states the primary entrance for Park & Ride and Kiss & Ride access will shift from Walnut Avenue to San Dimas Avenue. Entrances to the parking lot relocation are located on Commercial Street and Monte Vista
Avenue which are residential streets.

3. Draft SEIR 3, Page 4, Project Modifications, incorrectly states that "Access will occur only from the western side (San Dimas Avenue) of the station platform. No access to the San Dimas station will be provided from the eastern (Walnut Avenue) side of the platform as a result of the station parking facility". Pedestrian access from Walnut Avenue was not directly connected to the Park and Ride located at the Maintenance Yard. In fact, the only direct access to the station for Park and Ride patrons under that proposal design layout was via a subterranean pedestrian tunnel (under the Metro Line track) that connected directly to the center platform at the station.
While the project modification does not incorporate First/Last Mile Plan around the relocated station parking, the City feels strongly that the Authority should reinstate the pedestrian connection to the station from Walnut Avenue as originally planned because the previous layout was independent of the station parking. In addition, this connectivity to Walnut Avenue is within the Authority's construction work areas and should be constructed as part of the project because it provides access for residents living on the east side of the station.

4. Figure 1-3 fails to identify the correct parking lot footprint as it does not depict the location of the proposed access road or exit for the Kiss and Ride Area. In reviewing an EIR, a paramount consideration is the right of the public to be informed in a manner that enables it to intelligently weigh the environmental consequences of any contemplated action and have an appropriate voice in the formulation of any decision. An accurate, stable and finite project description is required for an informative and legally sufficient EIR. Because of the importance of the project description, when the project changes significantly, the failure to prepare a subsequent or supplemental EIR deprives the public, who relied on the EIR, of information and meaningful participation. (City of San Jose v. Great Oaks Water Co. (1987) 192 Cal.App.3d 1005, 1017.) The Draft SEIR 3 fails to 3 meet these requirements.
In addition, the Draft SEIR 3 fails to include in its review the two parcels located at the intersection of Bonita and Cataract, Assessor Parcel Numbers 8390-021-915 and 916. As indicated by the Letter of Intent between the Authority and the City, these parcels are included in the new parcels to be acquired and likewise subject to the requirement that the Authority secure all CEQA approvals necessary for the use of the parcels. The requirements of CEQA cannot be avoided by piecemeal review, which results from a chopping a large project into many little ones, which cumulatively may have substantial impact and perhaps disastrous consequences. (Rio Vista Farm Bureau Center v. County of Solano (1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 351, 370; Environmental Prot. Info. Ctr. v. Cal. Dept. of Forestry and Fire Prot. (2008) 44 Cal. 4th 459, 503.)
Moreover, failure to purchase and utilize those two parcels for station parking/access is a violation of the Letter of Intent, as the Letter of Intent requires the parties to "work together in good faith toward execution of a mutually agreeable purchase and sale agreement" for
those two parcels.

Response to Draft SEIR Metro Gold Line Extension -Relocation of the San Dimas Parking Facility San Dimas CA, 91773 3
April 1, 2022

By failing to include the two parcels on Bonita and Cataract, the Authority is piecemealing its environmental review of the proposed modification without the legally required environmental review of the project's impacts. An inaccurate or incomplete project description undermines CEQA's purposes because it thwarts a full analysis of project impacts, thus minimizing the project's effects. (City of Santee v. County of San Diego (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 1438, 1454; San Joaquin Raptor Rescue Center V. County of Merced (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 645, 656.) Thus, when an EIR gives "conflicting signals to decision-makers and the public about the nature and scope of the activity being proposed," the courts have found it "fundamentally inadequate and misleading." (San Joaquin Raptor Rescue Center, 149 Cal.App.4th at 655-56.) The Draft SEIR 3 has the type of truncated project review that CEQA prohibits and creates uncertainty about the project's impacts.

Transportation and Parking
In our prior letter, we expressed our significant concern regarding the reduction in the number of parking spaces in the proposed relocated parking facility, as well as concerns regarding pedestrian routes and the impact on traffic in the residential neighborhoods in the vicinity of the proposed parking facility. The Draft SEIR 3 fails to adequately analyze and mitigate these
concerns.

Meaningful analysis of impacts effectuates one of CEQA's fundamental purposes: To "inform the public and responsible officials of the environmental consequences of their decisions before they are made." (Laurel Heights Improvement Ass'n v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal. (1993) 6 Cal.4th 1112, 1123.) To accomplish this purpose, an EIR must contain facts and analysis, not just an agency's bare conclusions. (Citizens of Goleta Valley V. Bd. of Supers. (1990) 52 Cal. 3d 553, 568.) An EIR's conclusions must be supported by substantial evidence. (Laurel Heights Improvement Ass'n, 47 Cal.3d at 409.) The Draft SEIR 3 is vague and lacks supporting documentation to adequately assess Transportation impacts. The items detailed in the City's
response below address concerns, but the City cannot fully evaluate the Draft 3 SEIR 3 without additional studies and information that was not provided.
5. The Draft SEIR 3, under Section 3.2.7, Long Term Parking Impact, indicates that no parking impact will result from the station parking relocation. On the contrary, relocating the Gold Line Station's proposed 289 parking spaces to the existing Park and Ride location would result in the loss of an additional 175 valuable parking spaces (existing spaces not being accommodated or accounted for with the Gold Line Parking relocation to the City's Park and Ride) in the heart of San Dimas' historic downtown.

This loss of crucial and irreplaceable parking spaces in the downtown area would not only
adversely and negatively affect the downtown businesses, but also impact the community at large. The City hosts various annual parades, car shows, bike races. as well as the Memorial Day and Veterans Day observance days at Freedom Park. With the immediate loss of this daily available critical parking to the community any time of year, where do these patrons, visitors and attendees park?
The Draft SEIR 3 fails to address the adverse and negative impact on the loss of this critical and daily available parking and its subsequent affect to the immediate neighborhood, businesses, community, and community at large.

As previously mentioned, the Draft SEIR 3 acknowledges that the existing Park & Ride facility with 175 parking spaces serves as the patron parking for the bus lines, but does not discuss the removal of the parking spaces during construction. Thus, the short-term
impacts on the circulation system have not been considered. In addition, the Draft SEIR
3 fails to consider the current use of the parking facility by patrons of the Downtown businesses and the businesses themselves. The Draft SEIR 3 does not adequately analyze the impacts resulting from the loss of these parking spaces, narrowly relying on its use by patrons of Foothill Transit only.
In addition, the Draft SEIR 3 does not adequately address the increased traffic on surrounding residential roadways to access the parking facility, and the Authority's
conclusion that drivers will typically use major streets is not substantiated. "To facilitate CEQA's informational role, an EIR must contain facts and analysis, not just the agency's bare conclusions or opinions." (Habitat & Watershed Caretakers v. City of Santa Cruz (2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 1277, 1303.) An EIR's conclusions must be supported by substantial evidence. (Laurel Heights Improvement Ass'n v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal. (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 409.)

Moreover, there is a potential design hazard related to vehicles queueing at the San Dimas Avenue/Commercial Street traffic signal, which needs to be fully analyzed and addressed. The preparation and function of an EIR is to ensure that government officials who decide to build or approve a project do so with a full understanding of the environmental consequences. Equally important, the public is assured those consequences have been taken into account. (Vineyard Area Citizens for Responsible Growth, Inc. v. City of Rancho Cordova (2007) 40 Cal.4th 412, 449; Citizens Against Airport Pollution v. City of San Jose, supra, 227 Cal.App.4th at 796.)

Additionally, traffic delays with the proposed relocation of the parking facility, as well as deficiencies and inaccuracies related to pedestrian access need to be analyzed and mitigated. CEQA requires the Authority to evaluate the project's traffic safety impacts on pedestrians, cyclists, and transit riders. (See City of Maywood v. Los Angeles Unified Sch. Dist. (2012) 208 Cal. App. 4th 362, 392-95 (holding EIR was inadequate because it failed to analyze and mitigate project impacts on pedestrians).)

6. The loss of an approximately 2.25-acre Park and Ride property in the City's downtown would also result in the City losing its potential to develop this land for housing needs or TOD. A development that provides a balance of both community parking and housing provides more vibrancy to the downtown. Quite likely, based on current development proposals, this property may be developed with up to 52 residential units with ample parking available for the community.

7. The Authority states that, based on coordinated internal discussions between them and
Foothill Transit, commuter bus lines 492 and 499 would not operate to downtown Los Angeles once Phase 2B is completed and operational to Pomona.

a. The planned projected completion of Phase 2B is estimated to be mid-2025, plus another 6 months or more for Metro to render the service fully operational (which
is approximately 4 years away). In the meantime, where do patrons of the community park or get picked up during the construction of the station parking?

Has the Authority made any parking provisions for these commuters during this interim period as part of so-called coordinated arrangement with Foothill Transit? What are the short-term impacts on the circulation system associated with vehicles that currently utilize the San Dimas Park & Ride facility being diverted to a different location within the City?
b. With the Authority stating that Foothill will cease bus lines 492 and 499, does this imply that commuters will now have only one mode of public transportation to Downtown Los Angeles to choose from? With the opening of the I-10 Freeway express lane projected by end of 2023, the estimated commute time to Los Angeles will be much shorter than Metro's projected time to Downtown Los Angeles. Why will this alternative bus mode of transportation cease and, if so, where do these commuters park during the two-year gap of Phase 2B opening?
In addition, this parking facility is not limited or restricted to patrons of Foothill Transit and is available to rideshare, vanpool, etc., as well as serving as additional parking for the Downtown businesses and patrons. Without replacement of the existing 175 spaces, parking will be constrained, impacting Downtown businesses and adjacent residential neighborhoods. The reduced parking provided for the station is already likely to result in overflow parking onto adjacent residential neighborhoods, as acknowledged by the need for Parking Management Plans (PMPs). The removal of existing parking spaces that would occur with the Project Modifications would exacerbate this impact. The Draft SEIR 3 does not adequately analyze the impacts resulting from the loss of these parking spaces, narrowly relying on its use by patrons of Foothill Transit only.
c. The Authority has stated that an internal coordination or agreement has been concluded with Foothill Transit to cease operation of lines 492 and 499. Has this been discussed with the Foothill Transit Board? Are there any formal approvals in place? Why was the City not involved as part of this discussion? In fact, according to a June 25, 2021 Foothill Transit Board Executive Board Meeting staff report, the report states that the use of the City's Park and Ride for station parking will necessitate Line 499 being realigned to an alternate location for customers who currently utilize Line 499 at the park and ride. No action has or is being considered to cease operations of the lines, but rather, the consideration of the City's Park and Ride for Project parking will impact the location, traffic, and parking impacts for Foothill Transit passengers and as such has not been considered in the Draft SEIR 3. Further, according to the Foothill Transit leadership, Foothill Transit is waiting to see what occurs at the Park and Ride to initiate coordination. Thus, the Draft 3 SEIR 3 does not properly analyze the impacts resulting from changes to lines or worse is premised on faulty assumptions of changes to the lines.

d. The need for parking specifically at the City's Park and Ride is not just driven by the needs of Foothill Transit commuters. As noted, during the lockdown due to the pandemic, Foothill was operating with minimal bus service - possibly due to when a lot of commuters opted to stay and work from home. However, even during those times, the City's Park and Ride was heavily used on a daily basis. The daily patrons parking there are part of car pools, local business customers, employees, as well as transit riders, too. Currently, the Feed and Grain Store uses the Park and Ride for offloading supplies. This use will be eliminated in the proposed modifications,

with no mention of any mitigation measures.

The heavy daily use of the Park and Ride shows the latent need of parking in the heart of downtown. How does the Authority plan to replace this critically needed parking in the downtown?
Again, the Draft SEIR 3 fails to address the adverse and negative impact from the loss of this critical and daily available parking and its subsequent affect to immediate neighborhood, businesses, community, and the community at large.
In addition to the Park and Ride serving Foothill Transit riders, rideshare, vanpool, as well as serving as additional parking for the Downtown businesses and patrons, it provides parking for employees of the Curative Lab located at 430 S. Cataract Avenue. Employees are then shuttled to their location of employment. The loss of the availability to park at the Park and Ride will create impacts to the surrounding residential neighborhoods. Eliminating the parking for Curative Lab would result in traffic and parking impacts not reasonably contemplated when looking at just the Park & Ride. The Draft SEIR 3 does not address this or analyze the impacts. In addition, the Authority's analysis of parking during construction is deficient, and the loss of daily parking for commuters and patrons has not been adequately analyzed or mitigated. The Authority must also identify and adopt feasible mitigation measures to reduce those impacts, if feasible. (Pub. Res. Code Â§ 21083(b)(2); CEQA Guidelines Â§ 15064(h)(1).)
As a further example, the negative impact to the housing development located at San Dimas Avenue and Commercial Street has not been analyzed or mitigated. Not only will parking be reduced, but vehicle queueing will become an issue, which was an issue raised with the
Authority in our prior response letter. Consequently, the Authority must consider feasible mitigation measures in a revised and recirculated Draft SEIR 3.
8. The Draft SEIR 3 does not adequately address the increased traffic on surrounding residential roadways in order to access the parking facility. The statement that "typically, drivers would use major streets such as San Dimas Avenue and would choose a more direct route to the station parking facility" is not substantiated. Access to the station parking would occur from residential streets. With the permanent street closure to vehicular traffic on Monte Vista Avenue, vehicles accessing the parking facility from Monte Vista Avenue
have no other option but to travel through residential neighborhoods.

9. The Project Modifications propose a new access road from Commercial Street. This
access road would be located just west of an existing driveway providing access to the residential and live/work development located at the southwest corner of Commercial Street and San Dimas Avenue. The interaction of vehicles exiting the parking lot and queuing on Commercial Street at the San Dimas Avenue/Commercial Street traffic signal could potentially impede vehicles attempting to turn left from Commercial Street into the existing driveway causing vehicles to queue into the intersection; however, no mitigations are proposed. How will this impact emergency vehicle responses? Currently the businesses and residents park within the Park and Ride or on Commercial Street. Reference is made to a Parking Management Plan; however, it is unclear how the Gold Line Authority will develop the plan, and as it is a limited life organization, how will the parking plan be managed after the Gold Line Authority is dissolved? This potential design hazard needs to be addressed in the Draft SEIR 3.

10. Draft SEIR 3 Page 3-19 references "controlled parking entrances and exits". What kind of controls will be utilized? Depending upon the types of controls and location, there could be a potential for vehicles to queue onto neighboring residential streets. This potential needs to be addressed.

11. The approved SEIR 2 incorporates bus drop off and onboarding within the station parking lot. The proposed configuration in the Draft SEIR 3 eliminates buses in the parking lot. This has significant impacts on:
a. The ability to provide cross connection with other bus lines. b. The potential increase in bus stops on Bonita Avenue creates a potential backup on Bonita Avenue that may impact the freight crossing at Cataract Ave.
C. Eliminates bus staging which currently occurs in the Park and Ride Lot.
12. No mitigations or improvements were proposed for the Bonita/San Dimas Ave bus stops to accommodate additional ridership.

13. The intersection of San Dimas Avenue and Commercial Street will be severely impacted, including creating traffic back-ups at the northbound left turn lane to access the Park and Ride. This should be further studied and require mitigation measures to prevent northbound vehicles from turning into the Grove Station development to turn around and bypass the back-up created at the northbound left turn lane.

14. 3.1.4 Mitigation Measures and Recommendations - LTR-1 states that the Authority shall cooperate with the City and contribute funding for a new traffic signal at the intersection of San Dimas Avenue at Second Street when warranted.

a. The relocation of the station parking to the City Park and Ride will result in an exponential increase in traffic delays because all the commuters parked at the Park and Ride will cross San Dimas Avenue at the railroad crossing - both during peak AM and PM hours and intermittently during the off-peak hours. On page 3-8 it states that "a traffic evaluation was completed in May 2021 for the proposed east- west crosswalk just south of the Project ROW... The results of the operation and
queueing analysis for the northbound and southbound approaches at San Dimas Avenue indicated that the Project with Project Modifications would not resuit in a substantial increase in traffic delay, and signal operations for the crosswalk at San Dimas Avenue would result in minimal delays compared to the delays experienced at the nearby intersections."
Almost 90% of the commuters will opt to cross at this crosswalk - it's only ingrained human nature to cross at the shortest and closest point. The increase in pedestrian
crossing frequency and activities will further compound and add to delays already experienced by drivers when the train is stopping or leaving the station. This
additional delay, in particular for southbound San Dimas Avenue north of Bonita
Avenue, will initiate driver behavior to take "short cuts" through the residential streets. Neighborhoods were not designed for cut through traffic in order to avoid delays as traffic backs up at Bonita Avenue. Why was the traffic evaluation which
was completed in May 2021 not provided for review?

With the relocation of the station parking lot to the Park and Ride, the Authority

must consider installing a traffic signal as part of the current project now, rather than when fully warranted. Secondly, when it's fully warranted, how does the City collect its contribution? Upon completion of Phase 2B, the Authority is dissolved
and non-existent. Again, how does the City collect the contributions?

b. 3 The Draft SEIR 3 states that additional traffic would be expected on Monte Vista Avenue and Commercial Street to enter and exit the parking lot. Any subsequent impacts will be addressed by a Parking Management Plan (PMP) - a PMP that states it would prohibit on-street parking for transit patrons and any of the neighborhoods that are impacted by traffic would be addressed by means of the Authority working with City to install traffic calming elements around the parking lot such as speed humps/bumps and signage. This statement completely disregards and ignores the City's initial comments in the NOP to consider various traffic calming mitigation measures that would mitigate transit patrons traffic flow from the residential neighborhood.

Again, we reemphasize the City's NOP comments recommending various traffic calming measures, which would mitigate the traffic flow of transit patrons in and out of the residential neighborhood as a result of the Gold Line's proposal to relocate station parking to the Park and Ride, which will result in a substantial increase in traffic volume within the existing quiet neighborhood along Cataract Avenue, Railway Street, and Commercial Street. Therefore, to deter and restrict
traffic entering Commercial Street from Cataract Avenue or Railroad Street, and/or turning right onto Commercial Street when exiting from the station parking primary driveway/aisle, it is recommended that the following specific mitigation measures be considered and reviewed for implementation by the Authority:

I. Restrict commuter traffic from entering and exiting at Railway Street/Monte Vista Avenue/Park and Ride and allow access for
emergency vehicles only.

II. The acquisition of Successor Agency properties on Cataract Avenue and utilization of Metro Gold Line's right-of-way south of the rail lines to create a vehicular bypass to Railway Street and Commercial Street, thereby potentially reducing traffic impacts on surrounding residential
streets.

Ill. Extend Park and Ride driveway/aisle approximately 4 to 6 feet south of 6 the center line of Commercial Street leaving approximately 12 to 13- foot-wide lane open for eastbound traffic only.

IV. Extend this restricted eastbound lane up to Shirlmar Street by means of landscaped curb extensions with entry and exit allowing for street parking for the two residents on the north side of Commercial, adjacent to the Park and Ride.

V. The eastbound approach of Commercial Street at San Dimas Avenue should be modified to provide two eastbound lanes.

VI. The segment of Commercial Street between Shirlmar Street and the

Response to Draft SEIR Metro Gold Line Extension -Relocation of the San Dimas Parking Facility San Dimas CA, 91773 9
April 1, 2022

Park and Ride's primary entrance will be restricted to allow eastbound traffic only, thereby also providing emergency and vehicular connectivity for residents of this neighborhood to downtown and San Dimas Avenue.

VII. Extension of the primary Park and Ride driveway/aisle allows for smooth flow of traffic in and out of the station parking lot without much
delay.

VIII. Traffic signal timing and intersection improvements at San Dimas Ave/Commercial Street to mitigate impacts to the entrance of the HOA south of Commercial Street/west of San Dimas Ave resulting from queuing associated with the relocated station parking access.
The combination of the extended entrance and curb extension will minimize traffic from the station's Park and Ride entering into the neighborhood because patrons using the facility will be forced to use the main entrance which will keep the separation of traffic flow to the major arterials and off residential streets as intended.

15. In Section 4.13.3.4 Long - Term Safety Impacts, the Draft SEIR 3 details that the relocation of the station parking has the potential to result in increased safety impacts for motorists, bicyclists, and pedestrians as a result of the additional parking spaces provided, and potential additional vehicular activity associated with station access from the relocated parking facility. It further expounds that the Construction Authority will work with the City of San Dimas to identify and fund traffic and speed control devices, including traffic calming devices such as additional signage, active speed identification signs, speed humps/bumps and other devices .. to recue potential automobile and pedestrian/bicycle conflicts. However, none of these have been studied or proposed as mitigations. The Draft SEIR 3, in fact, ignores the conclusion of this section and indicates no mitigations are required. As referenced above, CEQA requires the Authority to evaluate a project's traffic safety impacts on pedestrians, cyclists, and transit riders. (See City of Maywood V. Los Angeles Unified Sch. Dist. (2012) 208 Cal. App. 4th 362, 392-95 (holding EIR was inadequate because it failed to analyze and mitigate project impacts on pedestrians).)
16. The realignment of the public alley north of Commercial Street to meet the Park and Ride's primary drive aisle restricts the eastbound right turn for residents, trash service, other utility vehicles and fire safety equipment. This layout needs to be redesigned in order to allow access for the residents. Also, these residents would need access rights to use the new access road.

17. Tables 3-6 and 3-7 show the level of service for the AM and PM peak hours for the following intersections:

San Dimas Avenue/Bonita Avenue
San Dimas Avenue/Arrow Highway Walnut Avenue/Arrow Highway
San Dimas Avenue/Railway Street
San Dimas Avenue/Commercial Street

Response to Draft SEIR Metro Gold Line Extension -Relocation of the San Dimas Parking Facility

April 1, 2022
With the relocation of the parking to the Park and Ride, motorists coming from the west ends of the City and adjacent cities to the west will travel through and add delays to the intersections of Cataract Avenue/Arrow Highway and Cataract Avenue/Bonita Avenue. The level of service analysis should include these additional two intersections.

18. On page ES-3, the Draft SEIR 3 states that the proposed San Dimas parking facility would also include a Kiss and Ride area to allow for pick-ups and drop-offs. Buses would no longer enter the parking lot. Instead, the bus drop-off for Foothill Transit would now be located at the intersection of Bonita Avenue and San Dimas Avenue. An intersection that would now be more congested since there are two existing Foothill Transit stops, located
at the northeast and southeast of the intersection of Bonita Avenue at San Dimas Avenue
for bus line 492. Where would the bus stop for commuter bus line 499 be located? The existing intersection was modified due to the Gold Line and is already congested, thus the addition of two new bus stops would compound further delays at an intersection that is already experiencing substantial delays. In addition, increased pedestrian crossing on San Dimas Ave south of the tracks will add to the delays at Bonita/San Dimas Ave, potentially backing up eastbound traffic across the freight tracks at Bonita/Cataract Ave.
19. The impacts to Cataract Avenue/Bonita Ave and Cataract Ave/Arrow Highway were not studied. These intersections are closest to the freeways and the entire west side of City. Much of the parking commuters will be approaching from this direction. These intersections will be severely impacted and need to be studied.
20. Where is the traffic study from May 2021 that was referenced in the DrÃ¤ft SEIR 3? Why was this not available for review?

Aesthetics
21. The Draft SEIR 3 Aesthetics discussion identifies eight residences located along the border of Commercial Street and states the fronts of these residences face away from the Project site and views of the Project site from the back are buffered. However, the analysis does not take into consideration the residential property located south of Commercial Street that directly faces Freedom Park and the proposed location of the new access road. Therefore, the aesthetics discussion is deficient, as the analysis only considers some of the residential properties in the area. An EIR's description of the environmental setting must be contain sufficient information to "permit the significant effects of the project to be considered in the full environmental context." CEQA Guidelines, Â§ 15125(c). "If the description of the environmental setting 'is inaccurate, incomplete or misleading, the EIR does not comply with CEQA." (Cleveland Nat'l Forest Found. v. San Diego Assn. of Governments (2017) 17 Cal.App.5th 413, 439.) An accurate description of the environmental setting is critical, because the significance of an activity may vary with the setting. CEQA Guidelines, Â§ 15064(b). A "project that is ordinarily insignificant in its impact on the a environment may in a particularly sensitive environment be significant." (Kings County Farm Bureau v. City of Hanford (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 692, 718, 721; CEQA
Guidelines, Â§ 15300.2(a)).)
22. In addition, the Draft SEIR 3 fails to 3 consider views of the Project site from pedestrians utilizing Commercial Street, fails adequately address the impacts of the portion of Freedom Park that is proposed to be removed in order to construct an access road, and fails to address the introduction of lighting from vehicle headlights which will impact certain

Response to Draft SEIR Metro Gold Line Extension -Relocation of the San Dimas Parking Facility San Dimas CA, 91773 11

residences. Because the Draft SEIR 3 fails to properly study these significant impacts on aesthetics, the Draft SEIR 3 fails to live up to its role as an informational document. The Authority's failure here "precludes informed decision making and informed public participation, thereby thwarting the statutory goals of the EIR process." (Ass'n of Irritated Residents v. County of Madera (2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 1383, 1391.)
23. The Draft SEIR 3 focuses the discussion and associated impact conclusions on the portion of the Project site that is comprised of the current San Dimas Park & Ride facility, relying on the fact that it is currently a parking facility and would continue to be a parking a facility: "As discussed, the vividness, intactness, and unity of the Project Site would remain similar to existing conditions with the implementation of the Project Modifications as the parcel would continue to be used as a paved parking facility". However, the Project Site extends beyond the existing San Dimas Park & Ride facility. The Draft SEIR 3 does not adequately address the portion of Freedom Park that is proposed to be removed in order to construct an access road or the Kiss and Ride Area. Views of Freedom Park in this area are intact with large mature trees and landscaping that provide visual relief from the surrounding development. The 2013 FEIR did not contemplate the removal of a similar resource, as a similar resource is not located within the previously considered parking location.
24. The Draft SEIR 3 does not discuss the Project's introduction of lighting associated with the headlights of vehicles exiting the parking lot from the proposed access road that would directly impact the residence located south of Commercial Street that fronts Commercial Street and Freedom Park; this condition does not currently exist and would not have occurred at the previously considered parking location.
Air Quality/Greenhouse Gas Emissions

25. The Draft SEIR 3 does not fully analyze the air quality impacts to surrounding residents and does not propose proper mitigation (i.e. upgrading residential air filtration systems and enhancing First/Last Mile improvements) to reduce the potential air quality impacts. The proximity of the relocated Gold Line station parking lot to the existing Park and Ride will result in an increase of traffic to the surrounding residential neighborhoods and if proper parking is not provided, these future riders will circulate and park within surrounding private and public parking lots or along residential or commercial streets. The result of these vehicles circulating around the surrounding residential neighborhoods looking for parking will increase emissions/air pollutions and therefore increase Green House Gas (GHG) Emissions and air quality impacts.
26. In this regard the Gold Line Authority (GLA) should also evaluate, quantify and mitigate the effects of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as part of the overall air quality assessment. This topic was not clearly addressed in the 2013 FEIR.

Community Parks and Open Space
27. The Draft SEIR 3 is deficient as it discounts the importance of the portion of Freedom Park proposed for acquisition because it does not contain park facilities or features. However, this area is vegetated, including mature trees and serves as an open space resource for the surrounding community. The removal of a portion of Freedom Park is a long-term impact which was not contemplated in the 2013 FEIR, and the Draft SEIR 3 fails to describe the magnitude and severity of this impact, including in communities and

Response to Draft SEIR Metro Gold Line Extension -Relocation of the San Dimas Parking Facility San Dimas CA, 91773 12
April 1, 2022

neighborhoods located in this area. The Draft SEIR 3 fails to identify feasible mitigation measures that would effectively reduce the Project's impacts on the visual character and
quality.

Cultural Resources

28. The Draft SEIR 3 indicates the AB 52 consultation process is ongoing and will be further documented as part of future CEQA documentation, but fails to identify what future CEQA documentation is being referenced. Under AB 52, if consultation has begun, an EIR cannot be certified unless the consultation process between the tribe and the lead agency has concluded. Thus, the 3 Draft SEIR 3 inadequately describes the AB 52 consultation
process.

Noise and Vibration
29. The Draft SEIR 3 inaccurately states that, when compared to the SEIR 2 location, residential structures abutting the relocated San Dimas parking facility are farther away from potential noise and vibration-intensive construction activities and concludes a reduction in both construction noise and construction vibration levels at adjacent receptors. SEIR 2 Table 4.11-4 shows a distance of 45 feet from the closest sensitive receptor to the reconfigured parking facility. Construction activities associated with the Project Modifications (new access road) would occur immediately adjacent to the residential property that abuts Freedom Park; the residence is located at a distance of less than 45 feet and should be analyzed accordingly.
Similar to the construction impacts discussion, the long-term impacts discussion identifies the closest noise-sensitive receptor as 60 feet. This measurement is to the parking area. The Draft SEIR 3 should also address the noise associated with the proposed access road which would be located immediately adjacent to a sensitive receptor.
30. No mitigations were proposed for the house adjacent to the new entrance onto Commercial Street. There will be significant queuing of vehicles exiting the station parking onto Commercial Street. This will create noise concerns for this residence.

31. The 2013 FEIR (page 3.11-17) states noise control measures when working near residences would be required, which includes conformance with the noise requirements of each City. "Limiting construction activities to weekday daytime hours (typically 7 a.m. to 6 p.m.) and employing typical measures for minimizing noise during construction requirement, combined with the mitigation described in Section 3.11.5, would mitigate construction impacts to a less than significant level." This is contradictory to the Draft SEIR 3 (Section 3.1.2.3), which states short-term construction impacts from temporary lane closures and detours "..would be limited by scheduling certain construction activities during night hours, outside of the AM and PM peak commuting periods, and through the use of clearly signed detour routes where necessary." The Draft SEIR 3 Noise analysis does not analyze nighttime construction activities. This inconsistency needs to be If addressed and remedied. If nighttime construction activities will occur, the noise analysis needs to identify any resulting noise impacts to sensitive receptors. To "inform the public and responsible officials of the environmental consequences of their decisions before they are made." (Laurel Heights Improvement Ass'n v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal. (1993) 6 Cal.4th 1112, 1123.) Again, the Authority must analyze noise impacts and potentially feasible mitigation measures for the significant nighttime construction noise impacts

caused by the Project.

Safety and Security
32. As acknowledged in the Draft SEIR 3 "[t]he relocated and reconfigured parking facility would be located in a more residential area than â¢previously approved, with adjacent residential land to the west and south. Therefore, the facility would be located in an area with a different safety and security setting than what was previously analyzed." As we had previously noted, there are safety and security concerns with relocating the parking facility to the Park & Ride. Specific attention should be provided to the interface between the Project site, the alley, and the residential uses located south of the alley and that currently there is a clear line of site across the alley between Monte Vista Avenue and San Dimas Avenue, as well as visibility from the existing Park & Ride facility. This visibility could be limited with the introduction of the access road and other improvements, resulting in security and safety concerns within the alley. The Draft SEIR 3 does not adequately address safety and security concerns. The Authority is legally required to mitigate or avoid the significant impacts of the projects it approves whenever it is feasible to do so. (Pub. Res. Code Â§ 21002.1(b).) "In the case of the adoption of a plan, policy, a regulation, or other public project, mitigation measures can be incorporated into the plan, policy, regulation, or project design." (CEQA Guidelines Â§ 15126.4(a)(2).). Â§
33. With the Station Parking being so close to residential properties, the frequency of calls to law enforcement will increase and the expected response time will be immediate. Draft SEIR 3 provides no details of how the Gold Line Authority will mitigate these requirements. This will impact local law enforcement and impact their ability to respond to other calls through the City. The Draft SEIR 3 must provide a detailed a plan for Metro and LASD Transit Services Bureau response to mitigate impacts to local safety and law enforcement. SS-4 security mitigations indicates a security plan for LRT operations shall be implemented but the mitigation measure references surveillance by law enforcement including local jurisdiction security personnel. Gold Line Authority is proposing the use of local enforcement without cost mitigations.

Water Quality and Resources
34. The Draft SEIR 3 long-term Impacts discussion states "[t]here would be a decreased amount of impervious surface compared to the Approved Project since the proposed San Dimas parking location is a smaller site than the approved location." This is not an accurate characterization. The approved location is already impervious and although the acreage of the parking facility may be reduced with the Project Modifications, the amount of impervious surface as a result of the Project Modifications would not be decreased. The Project Modifications would acquire a portion of Freedom Park for an access road, converting an existing pervious surface to impervious conditions. When an EIR gives "conflicting signals to decision-makers and the public about the nature and scope of the activity being proposed," the courts have found it "fundamentally inadequate and misleading." (San Joaquin Raptor Rescue Center v. County of Merced, 149 Cal.App.4th 645, 655-56.).

General Comments
35. The station parking design standards require the parking lot to meet local landscape design standards. The configuration of the parking lot as proposed does not comply with

City Code requirements. The increased landscaping requirements will result in the elimination of several parking stalls. This combined with the ADA requirements which were
also not addressed will likely reduce the number of stalls available to less than 289.

36. The project calls for trees to be relocated. What trees will be relocated and to what location?

37. Construction emissions will now be closer to residential homes than previous. Construction parking will impact the neighborhood and mitigation was not addressed.
The Draft SEIR 3's lackluster approach to impact analysis and mitigation violates CEQA. A lead agency cannot simply conclude that an impact is significant and unavoidable and move on. A conclusion of residual significance does not excuse the agency from (1) performing a thorough evaluation and description of the impact and its severity before and after mitigation, and (2) proposing all feasible mitigation to "substantially lessen the significant environmental effect." (CEQA Guidelines Â§ 15091(a)(1); see also id. Â§ 15126.2(b) (requiring an EIR to discuss "any significant impacts, including those which can be mitigated but not reduced to a level of
insignificance" (emphasis added).) Consequently, the Authority cannot legally certify the Draft SEIR 3 until it satisfies all the above CEQA requirements and, instead, it must consider further
feasible mitigation measures in a revised and recirculated Draft SEIR 3.

Monrovia, CA 91016-3633

Subject: Comments on Notice of Preparation of Draft Supplemental EIR (DSEIR) Metro Gold Line
Extension Phase 2B - San Dimas Parking Lot Relocation

Dear Ms. Buch:

The City of San Dimas appreciates the opportunity to provide comments on the referenced DSEIR. The
City of San Dimas continues to support the completion of the Gold Line Foothill Extension to Montclair,
as long as the City's and our community's concerns are fully mitigated to our satisfaction. The following
comments are based on the Notice of Preparation of a Draft Supplemental Environmental Impact Report received on October 15, 2021. The DSEIR needs to address and fully mitigate the following potential impacts regarding the proposed relocation of the San Dimas Gold Line Station parking lot to the existing Park and Ride lot.

Transportation and Parking
1. The City is extremely concerned about the impact to the surrounding residents and downtown
businesses caused by the reduction in number of parking spaces provided in the proposed relocated
station parking design. The original 2013 FEIR requirement of 450 parking spaces was reduced to 289
parking spaces (Supplemental EIR, 2021) due to implementing Metro's Supportive Transit Parking Program Management Plan constrained parking model. Relocating the Gold Line Station parking into the existing Park and Ride location would result in the loss of an additional 175 valuable parking spaces (existing 175 Park and Ride parking spaces not being reconstructed or accounted for with the Gold
Line parking relocation to the Park and Ride) in the heart of our downtown. Such a reduction in the number of parking spaces in downtown would negatively impact our downtown business community. Under parking the station and reducing valuable downtown parking capacity will result in impacts to private property, as well as, Municipal parking lots and public streets in the vicinity of the Gold Line station parking lot. These impacts and mitigation measures must be evaluated and assessed as a part of the Draft SEIR and clearly indicate how the project will not have an impact on the City's streets,
residential neighborhoods, and nearby businesses.

NOP Draft SEIR Metro Gold Line Extension - San Dimas Parking Lot Relocation 2
November 17, 2021

2. A Parking Management Study is needed to fully address overflow parking onto adjacent commercial and residential neighborhoods. The study must include a discussion related to the anticipated impacts and mitigation measures (i.e. required parking enforcement, fully funding additional City staffing and costs related to mitigating parking related impacts associated with the Gold Line, etc.) to offset the
impacts of the overflow parking and traffic created by the Gold Line Station.
3. Currently, the existing Park and Ride is developed with 175 parking spaces, in addition to a dedicated bus stop and bus shelter for Foothill Transit which supports regional transportation. The City is concerned about the potential impact to the Foothill Transit bus services and the need to provide additional bus patron parking, in addition to the approximately proposed 289 parking spaces to only accommodate the future Gold Line Station patrons. The bus service provides a critical mode of public
transportation and the proposed alternative would potentially eliminate this mass transit alternative.

In the 2013 FEIR, the Gold Line Authority (GLA) committed to conduct a Bus a Interface Study by completion of the Design Phase. To date, no study has been completed. This is an area of concern for the City given the change to the project scope and the elimination of Foothill Transit within the existing City Park and Ride Facility. This study will require Foothill Transit to reroute or eliminate valuable mass transit services. The GLA should complete this study without further delay.

4. The pedestrian routes from the relocated Gold Line parking within the proposed Park and Ride lot location need to be fully analyzed. The previous Gold Line parking location (City Yard) provided a direct and safe pedestrian pathway that went underneath the light rail tracks to the station. The
relocated parking lot within the Park and Ride will result in a pedestrian conflict at San Dimas Avenue in and will result in significant vehicular traffic impacts on north and south bound San Dimas Avenue, in addition to east and west bound traffic on Bonita Avenue and Arrow Highway. This will be the result of the number of peak hour pedestrian traffic crossing at San Dimas Avenue, in addition to the number of train crossing signals that are activated approximately twice (trains travelling east and west bound) every 6 minutes. Mitigation needs to be provided to prevent pedestrians from jaywalking across San Dimas Avenue and the longer traffic delays from the number of pedestrian crosswalk signals and the number of train signals disrupting the vehicular traffic movement along San Dimas Avenue.
Studies need to be conducted to fully analyze the impact to this crossing that simulate and evaluate the traffic impacts on San Dimas Avenue, in addition to the pedestrian safety and liability due to the
increase in pedestrian crossing along this crossing intersection.

5. The proposed Gold Line parking relocation to the Park and Ride will result in an increase of traffic
volumes within existing quiet single-family residential neighborhoods along Railway Street and Commercial Street. Therefore, traffic calming mitigation measures need to be fully analyzed that will fully mitigate and divert this traffic away from these residential neighborhood streets. These mitigation measures could include, but are not limited to:

a. Closure of the Monte Vista ingress/egress of Park and Ride;
b. Traffic calming mitigation measures on Railway and Commercial Streets, such as installation
of cul-de-sac(s), speed humps, or other potential traffic calming mitigation measures;
C. Consider an additional vehicular ingress/egress along San Dimas Avenue to reduce traffic related impacts to the surrounding residential neighborhoods.

d. The acquisition of Successor Agency properties on Cataract and utilization of Metro Gold
Line's right-of-way south of the rail lines a as a bypass to Railway and Commercial reducing traffic loads on those residential streets.

6. Mitigation measures shall be implemented to reduce the vehicular queuing exiting the proposed relocated Gold Line parking lot.

7. All ADA pedestrian pathway concerns within the proposed relocated parking lot and the surrounding rights-of-way shall be fully analyzed and mitigated.

Tree Preservation, Landscaping and Water Quality
8. The City of San Dimas is a Tree USA City and preservation of the mature trees is a priority. Any City- owned trees proposed for removal shall be evaluated per City's Tree Preservation Ordinance per Chapter 13.36. A Tree Removal Permit Application will be required to be submitted to the Parks and Recreation Department for review.

9 The proposed station and parking lot landscape and irrigation shall comply with the City's Water
Efficient Landscapes Chapter 18.14.

10. The City is concerned with the thermal effects of the parking lot as proposed and its contribution to
an urban heat island. The project must incorporate large shade trees, vegetation/landscape and
lighter colored pavement to mitigate these impacts.

11. The proposed station and parking lot shall provide Low Impact Development (LID) proposal to comply
with City, County and State water quality requirements.

Air Quality/Greenhouse Gas Emissions
12. The air quality impacts to surrounding residents shall be fully analyzed and mitigated (i.e. upgrading residential air filtration systems and enhancing First/Last Mile improvements). The proximity of the
relocated Gold Line station parking lot to the existing Park and Ride will result in an increase of traffic
to the surrounding residential neighborhoods and if proper parking is not provided, these future riders will circulate and park within surrounding private and public parking lots or along residential or commercial streets. The result of these vehicles driving around looking for parking will increase emissions/air pollutions and therefore increase Green House Gas (GHG) Emissions.

13. Revised and updated estimates to circulation, land use, ridership and traffic/parking are necessary to
prepare an appropriate analysis of the environmental effects on air quality with the revised project.
Utilizing the FEIR 2013 data will result in an inadequate analysis especially in light of the availability of new ridership data and changes in Metro policies regarding parking, parking fees and First/Last Mile
improvements.

14. In this regard the Gold Line Authority (GLA) should also evaluate, quantify and mitigate the effects of
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as part of the overall air quality assessment. This topic was not
clearly addressed in the 2013 FEIR.

Noise and Vibration
15. The impact to the surrounding residences from the additional traffic related noise shall be fully mitigated including but not limited to:

245 East Bonita Avenue â¢ San Dimas â¢ California 91773-3002 â¢ (909) 394-6200 â¢ Fax (909) 394-6209 â¢ sandimasca.gov

NOP Draft SEIR Metro Gold Line Extension â¢ San Dimas Parking Lot Relocation 4
November 17, 2021

a. Construction of new sound walls; and
b. Retrofitting all surrounding affected residence windows with dual pane glass and other
treatments to reduce the noise impact with special emphasis to residences experiencing the
highest traffic and noise flows.

Public Service/Safety Concerns
16. There are safety and security concerns by relocating the Gold Line parking to the existing Park and Ride due to it being surrounded by and in close proximity to single-family residences. There is some evidence that terminus or near-terminus stations are affected negatively by increased criminal activity. Such impacts have been evident with the opening of the Gold Line Phase 2B project. Mitigation measures need to be incorporated to address these concerns including but not limited to:

a. Funding and providing law enforcement presence, preferably a new satellite law enforcement
office located within the new parking lot;

b. Installation of camera systems in all parking facilities and use of security software which is compatible with local law enforcement needs and enhanced ability for cameras to pan, tilt, zoom and record, providing clear, high quality observation during night and day, as well as providing needed hardware and viewing capability at the local law enforcement offices; and
Installation of city approved parking lot and alley lighting that is shielded and does not spill
over or impact surrounding residences.

Community Parks and Open Space
17. The impact to the existing Freedom Park by reducing the parkland area and removing existing mature trees and landscaping in order to facilitate the construction of new vehicular ingress/egress
shall be fully mitigated.
a. Installing and maintaining adequate camera systems as specified in 16b to provide for
observation and response to Freedom Park as this location will be unduly impacted by
activity coming from the Park and Ride.

Land Use
18. The proposed project relocation will affect surrounding land uses especially as they relate to both traffic, parking, air quality, noise and safety impacts. There is clear evidence that surrounding land uses are severely impacted when station parking and access are inadequate or poorly designed. These
impacts can severely affect nearby parking facilities, businesses and residences.

Furthermore, the State legislature is mandating major land use changes around transit stations in both in
adopted and anticipated legislation. These changes in growth are induced by and directly related to the station location. These changes are intended to supersede existing zoning resulting in a growth inducing impact not considered at all by any of the EIRs for the project. These changes likely render much of the traffic and related analysis invalid.

Economic
19. Relocating the Gold Line parking to the Park and Ride will negatively impact the heart of our
downtown businesses by losing 175 valuable parking spaces. Due to this loss of parking, this not only effects the current businesses and their economic vitality but will affect the economics and
viability of the future expansion and development of the new San Dimas Downtown that the City is

currently in the process of generating a new Specific Plan for.

20. The proposed Park and Ride parking lot site plan eliminates and negatively impacts the existing Feed and Grain business (located within the barn at 150 S. Monte Vista) by eliminating their ability to use
the existing Park and Ride lot to offload merchandise. The impact to this business shall be fully
mitigated.

21. Analyze the property value impacts to the surrounding residential and commercial uses with the
relocation of the Gold Line parking to the Park and Ride lot.

22. The elimination of the Park and Ride lot used for bus parking, would negatively impact the City's Proposition C funds by reducing the amount of funds the City receives and which can be utilized to
support regional transportation improvements. This impact shall be fully mitigated.

The City of San Dimas looks forward to working cooperatively to address these major issues as part of the revised project in order to maximize the benefits for Metro, the GLA, the surrounding residents,
businesses and property owners. You are welcome to contact the City for assistance or further explanation
of any of these comments.

Subject: Comments on Draft Supplemental EIR (DSEIR) Metro Gold Line Extension Phase 2B - Evaluating Relocation of the San Dimas Parking Facility

Dear Ms. Buch:

Please allow this letter to serve as the City of San Dimas' comments on the above-referenced Draft Supplemental Environmental Impact Report ("Draft SEIR 3") for the relocation of the San Dimas parking facility. This letter follows a letter previously submitted to Metro Gold Line Foothill Extension Construction Authority (the "Authority") on November 17, 2021 regarding the Notice of 5-1
Preparation of the Draft SEIR 3, which raised significant concerns about the relocation of the parking facility from the City Yard to the proposed Park and Ride location on the City and its community.

Despite our efforts to work with Metro Gold Line to address the impacts on the City and the T surrounding community, the Draft SEIR 3 does not adequately address our concerns, as detailed 5-2 below.

Project Description
1. The Draft 3 SEIR 3 does not accurately describe the proposed Project Modifications. The Project Description states the "Project Modifications also include roadway improvements to accommodate vehicles accessing the parking facility along Commercial street". However, no specific information regarding these improvements is provided. Further, there iS no mention of the modifications to Freedom Park that are proposed. The Project Modifications would result in a portion of the existing Freedom Park site to be improved 5-3 with an access road. Additionally, the Kiss and Ride Drop Area appears to further encroach into Freedom Park, which is not disclosed in the Project Description. Additionally, throughout the Draft SEIR 3, reference is made only to the existing Park & Ride lot when discussing the Project Modifications. As a result, it is unclear if the Draft SEIR 3 adequately assesses impacts as they relate to the proposed improvements and

the conversion of a portion of Freedom Park to an access road. (Cont.)
2. Draft SEIR 3, Page 3-20, Traffic Circulation, Incorrectly states the primary entrance for Park & Ride and Kiss & Ride access will shift from Walnut Avenue to San Dimas Avenue. Entrances to the parking lot relocation are located on Commercial Street and Monte Vista 5-4
Avenue which are residential streets. I

3. Draft SEIR 3, Page 4, Project Modifications, incorrectly states that "Access will occur only T from the western side (San Dimas Avenue) of the station platform. No access to the San Dimas station will be provided from the eastern (Walnut Avenue) side of the platform as a result of the station parking facility", Pedestrian access from Walnut Avenue was not directly connected to the Park and Ride located at the Maintenance Yard. In fact, the only direct access to the station for Park and Ride patrons under that proposal design layout was via a subterranean pedestrian tunnel (under the Metro Line track) that connected directly to the center platform at the station. 5-5
While the project modification does not incorporate First/Last Mile Plan around the relocated station parking, the City feels strongly that the Authority should reinstate the pedestrian connection to the station from Walnut Avenue as originally planned because the previous layout was independent of the station parking. In addition, this connectivity to Walnut Avenue is within the Authority's construction work areas and should be constructed as part of the project because it provides access for residents living on the east side of the station.

4. Figure 1-3 fails to identify the correct parking lot footprint as it does not depict the location of the proposed access road or exit for the Kiss and Ride Area. In reviewing an EIR, a paramount consideration is the right of the public to be informed in a in a manner that enables it to intelligently weigh the environmental consequences of any contemplated action and have an appropriate voice in the formulation of any decision. An accurate, stable and finite 5-6 project description is required for an informative and legally sufficient EIR. Because of the importance of the project description, when the project changes significantly, the fajlure to prepare a subsequent or supplemental EIR deprives the public, who relied on the EIR, of information and meaningful participation. (City of San Jose v. Great Oaks Water Co. (1987) 192 Cal.App.3d 1005, 1017.) The Draft SEIR 3 fails to meet these requirements.
In addition, the Draft SEIR 3 fails to include in its review the two parcels located at the intersection of Bonita and Cataract, Assessor Parcel Numbers 8390-021-915 and 916. As indicated by the Letter of Intent between the Authority and the City, these parcels are included in the new parcels to be acquired and likewise subject to the requirement that the Authority secure all CEQA approvals necessary for the use of the parcels. The requirements of CEQA cannot be avoided by piecemeal review, which results from 5-7

chopping a large project into many little ones, which cumulatively may have substantial impact and perhaps disastrous consequences. (Rio Vista Farm Bureau Conter v. County of Solano (1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 351, 370; Environmental Prot. Info. Ctr. v. Cal. Dept. of Forestry and Fire Prot. (2008) 44 Cal. 4th 459, 503.)
Moreover, failure to purchase and utilize those two parcels for station parking/access is a T violation of the Letter of Intent, as the Letter of Intent requires the parties to "work together in good faith toward execution of a mutually agreeable purchase and sale agreement" for 5-8
those two parcels.

Response to Draft SEIR Metro Gold Line Extension -Relocation of the San Dimas Parking Facility

April 1, 2022

By failing to include the two parcels on Bonita and Cataract, the Authority is piecemealing its environmental review of the proposed modification without the legally required environmental review of the project's impacts, An inaccurate or incomplete project description undermines CEQA's purposes because it thwarts a full analysis of project impacts, thus minimizing the project's effects. (City of Santee v. County of San Diego 5-9 (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 1438, 1454; San Joaquin Raptor Rescue Center v. County of Merced (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 645, 656.) Thus, when an EIR gives "conflicting signals to decision-makers and the public about the nature and scope of the activity being proposed," the courts have found it "fundamentally inadequate and misleading." (San Joaquin Raptor Rescue Center, 149 Cal.App.4th at 655-56.) The Draft SEIR 3 has the type of truncated project review that CEQA prohibits and creates uncertainty about the project's impacts.

Transportation and Parking F
In our prior letter, we expressed our significant concern regarding the reduction in the number of parking spaces in the proposed relocated parking facility, as well as concerns regarding 5-10
pedestrian routes and the impact on traffic in the residential neighborhoods in the vicinity of the proposed parking facility. The Draft SEIR 3 fails to adequately analyze and mitigate these concerns.

Meaningful analysis of impacts effectuates one of CEQA's fundamental purposes: To "inform the public and responsible officials of the environmental consequences of their decisions before they are made." (Laurel Heights Improvement Ass'n v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal. (1993) 6 Cal.4th 1112, 1123.) To accomplish this purpose, an EIR must contain facts and analysis, not just an agency's bare conclusions. (Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Bd. of Supers. (1990) 52 Cal. 3d 553, 5-11 568.) An EIR's conclusions must be supported by substantial evidence. (Laure! Heights Improvement Ass'n, 47 Cal.3d at 409.) The Draft SEIR 3 is vague and lacks supporting documentation to adequately assess Transportation impacts. The items detailed in the City's response below address concerns, but the City cannot fully evaluate the Draft SEIR 3 without additional studles and information that was not provided.
5. The Draft SEIR 3, under Section 3.2.7, Long Term Parking Impact, indicates that no parking impact will result from the station parking relocation. On the contrary, relocating the Gold Line Station's proposed 289 parking spaces to the existing Park and Ride jocation would result in the loss of an additional 175 valuable parking spaces (existing spaces not being accommodated or accounted for with the Gold Line Parking relocation to the City's Park and Ride) in the heart of San Dimas' historic downtown.

This loss of crucial and irreplaceable parking spaces in the downtown area would not only 5-12 adversely and negatively affect the downtown businesses, but also impact the community at large. The City hosts various annual parades, car shows, bike races, as well as the Memorial Day and Veterans Day observance days at Freedom Park. With the immediate loss of this daily available critical parking to the community any time of year, where do these patrons, visitors and attendees park?
The Draft SEIR 3 fails to address the adverse and negative impact on the loss of this critical and daily available parking and its subsequent affect to the Immediate neighborhood, businesses, community, and community at large.

Response to Draft SEIR Metro Gold Line Extension -Relocation of the San Dimas Parking San Dimas CA, 91773 Facility
April 1, 2022

As previously mentioned, the Draft SEIR 3 acknowledges that the existing Park & Ride H facility with 175 parking spaces serves as the patron parking for the bus lines, but does not discuss the removal of the parking spaces during construction. Thus, the short-term impacts on the circulation system have not been considered. In addition, the Draft SEIR 5-13
3 fails to consider the current use of the parking facility by patrons of the Downtown businesses and the businesses themselves. The Draft SEIR 3 does not adequately analyze the impacts resulting from the loss of these parking spaces, narrowly relying on its use by patrons of Foothill Transit only,
In addition, the Draft SEIR 3 does not adequately address the increased traffic on F surrounding residential roadways to access the parking facility, and the Authority's conclusion that drivers will typically use major streets is not substantiated. "To facilitate CEQA's informational role, an EIR must contain facts and analysis, not just the agency's 5-14
bare conclusions or opinions." (Habitat & Watershed Caretakers v. City of Santa Cruz (2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 1277, 1303.) An EIR's conclusions must be supported by substantial evidence. (Laurel Heights Improvement Ass'n v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal. (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 409.)
Moreover, there is a potential design hazard related to vehicles queueing at the San Dimas Avenue/Commercial Street traffic signal, which needs to be fully analyzed and addressed. The preparation and function of an EIR is to ensure that government officials who decide to build or approve a project do sO with a full understanding of the environmental consequences. Equally important, the public is assured those consequences have been 5-15

taken into account. (Vineyard Area Citizens for Responsible Growth, Inc. v. City of Rancho Cordova (2007) 40 Cal.4th 412, 449; Citizens Against Airport Pollution v. City of San Jose, supra, 227 Cal.App.4th at 796.)
Additionally, traffic delays with the proposed relocation of the parking facility, as well as deficiencies and inaccuracles related to pedestrian access need to be analyzed and mitigated. CEQA requires the Authority to evaluate the project's traffic safety impacts on pedestrians, cyclists, and transit riders. (See City of Maywood v. Los Angeles Unified Sch. 5-16
Dist. (2012) 208 Cal. App. 4th 362, 392-95 (holding EIR was inadequate because It failed to analyze and mitigate project impacts on pedestrians).)
6. The loss of an approximately 2.25-acre Park and Ride property in the City's downtown would also result in the City losing its potential to develop this land for housing needs or TOD. A development that provides a balance of both community parking and housing 5-17 provides more vibrancy to the downtown. Quite likely, based on current development proposals, this property may be developed with up to 52 residential units with ample parking available for the community,
7. The Authority states that, based on coordinated internal discussions between them and Foothill Transit, commuter bus lines 492 and 499 would not operate to downtown Los Angeles once Phase 2B is completed and operational to Pomona.

a. The planned projected completion of Phase 2B is estimated to be mid-2025, plus 5-18
another 6 months or more for Metro to render the service fully operational (which is approximately 4 years away). In the meantime, where do patrons of the community park or get picked up during the construction of the station parking?

Has the Authority made any parking provisions for these commuters during this interim period as part of so-called coordinated arrangement with Foothill Transit? 5-18
What are the short-term impacts on the circulation system associated with vehicles (Cont.) that currently utilize the San Dimas Park & Ride facility being diverted to a different a location within the City?
b. With the Authority stating that Foothill will cease bus lines 492 and 499, does this imply that commuters will now have only one mode of public transportation to Downtown Los Angeles to choose from? With the opening of the 1-10 Freeway express lane projected by end of 2023, the estimated commute time to Los 5-19
Angeles will be much shorter than Metro's projected time to Downtown Los Angeles. Why will this alternative bus mode of transportation cease and, if so, where do these commuters park during the two-year gap of Phase 2B opening?
In addition, this parking facility is not limited or restricted to patrons of Foothill T Transit and is available to rideshare, vanpool, etc., as well as serving as additional parking for the Downtown businesses and patrons. Without replacement of the existing 175 spaces, parking will be constrained, impacting Downtown businesses and adjacent residential neighborhoods. The reduced parking provided for the station Is already likely to result in overflow parking onto adjacent residential 5-20
neighborhoods, as acknowledged by the need for Parking Management Plans (PMPs). The removal of existing parking spaces that would occur with the Project Modifications would exacerbate this impact. The Draft SEIR 3 does not adequately analyze the impacts resulting from the loss of these parking spaces, narrowly relying on its use by patrons of Foothill Transit only.
The Authority has stated that an internal coordination or agreement has been concluded with Foothill Transit to cease operation of lines 492 and 499. Has this - C.

been discussed with the Foothill Transit Board? Are there any formal approvals in place? Why was the City not involved as part of this discussion? In fact, according to a June 25, 2021 Foothill Transit Board Executive Board Meeting staff report, the report states that the use of the City's Park and Ride for station parking will necessitate Line 499 being realigned to an alternate location for customers who currently utilize Line 499 at the park and ride. No action has or is being considered 5-21
to cease operations of the lines, but rather, the consideration of the City's Park and Ride for Project parking will impact the location, traffic, and parking impacts for Foothill Transit passengers and as such has not been considered in the Draft SEIR 3. Further, according to the Foothill Transit leadership, Foothill Transit is waiting to see what occurs at the Park and Ride to initiate coordination. Thus, the Draft SEIR 3 does not properly analyze the impacts resulting from changes to lines or worse is premised on faulty assumptions of changes to the lines.
d. The need for parking specifically at the City's Park and Ride is not just driven by F the needs of Foothill Transit commuters. As noted, during the lockdown due to the pandemic, Foothill was operating with minimal bus service -- possibly due to when a lot of commuters opted to stay and work from home. However, even during those times, the City's Park and Ride was heavily used on a daily basis. The daily patrons 5-22
parking there are part of car pools, local business customers, employees, as well as transit riders, too. Currently, the Feed and Grain Store uses the Park and Ride for offloading supplies. This use will be eliminated in the proposed modifications,

Response to Draft SEIR Metro Gold Line Extension -Relocation of the San Dimas Parking Facility San Dimas CA, 91773 6 April 1, 2022

with no mention of any mitigation measures.
5-22 The heavy daily use of the Park and Ride shows the latent need of parking in the heart of downtown. How does the Authority plan to replace this critically needed (Cont.)
parking in the downtown?
Again, the Draft SEIR 3 fails to address the adverse and negative impact from the loss of this - critical and daily available parking and its subsequent affect to immediate neighborhood, 5-23
businesses, community, and the community at large.
In addition to the Park and Ride serving Foothill Transit riders, rideshare, vanpool, as well as serving as additional parking for the Downtown businesses and patrons, it provides parking T
for employees of the Curative Lab located at 430 S. Cataract Avenue. Employees are then shuttled to their location of employment. The loss of the availability to park at the Park and Ride will create impacts to the surrounding residential neighborhoods. Eliminating the parking for Curative Lab would result in traffic and parking impacts not reasonably contemplated when 5-24
looking at just the Park & Ride. The Draft SEIR 3 does not address this or analyze the impacts. In addition, the Authority's analysis of parking during construction is deficient, and the loss of daily parking for commuters and patrons has not been adequately analyzed or mitigated. The Authority must also identify and adopt feasible mitigation measures to reduce those impacts, if feasible. (Pub. Res. Code Â§ 21083(b)(2); CEQA Guidelines Â§ 15064(h)(1)).)
a As a further example, the negative impact to the housing development located at San Dimas T Avenue and Commercial Street has not been analyzed or mitigated. Not only will parking be reduced, but vehicle queueing will become an issue, which was an issue raised with the 5-25
Authority in our prior response Jetter. Consequently, the Authority must consider feasible mitigation measures in a revised and recirculated Draft SEIR 3.

8. The Draft SEIR 3 does not adequately address the increased traffic on surrounding residential roadways in order to access the parking facility. The statement that "typically, drivers would use major streets such as San Dimas Avenue and would choose a more direct route to the station parking facility" is not substantiated. Access to the station parking 5-26
would occur from residential streets. With the permanent street closure to vehicular traffic on Monte Vista Avenue, vehicles accessing the parking facility from Monte Vista Avenue have no other option but to travel through residential neighborhoods.
9. The Project Modifications propose a new access road from Commercial Street. This T access road would be located just west of an existing driveway providing access to the residential and live/work development located at the southwest corner of Commercial Street and San Dimas Avenue. The interaction of vehicles exiting the parking lot and queuing on Commercial Street at the San Dimas Avenue/Commercial Street traffic signal could potentially impede vehicles attempting to turn left from Commercial Street into the existing driveway causing vehicles to queue into the intersection; however, no mitigations 5-27 are proposed. How will this impact emergency vehicle responses? Currently the businesses and residents park within the Park and Ride or on Commercial Street. Reference is made to a Parking Management Plan; however, it is unclear how the Gold Line Authority will develop the plan, and as it is a limited life organization, how will the parking plan be managed after the Gold Line Authority is dissolved? This potential design hazard needs to be addressed in the Draft SEIR 3.

10. Draft SEIR 3 Page 3-19 references "controlled parking entrances and exits". What kind of controls will be utilized? Depending upon the types of controls and location, there could be a potential for vehicles to queue onto neighboring residential streets. This potential needs to be addressed. 5-28

11. The approved SEIR 2 Incorporates bus drop off and onboarding within the station parking - lot. The proposed configuration in the Draft SEIR 3 eliminates buses in the, parking lot. This has significant impacts on;

a. The ability to provide cross connection with other bus lines. b. The potential increase in bus stops on Bonita Avenue creates a potential backup a 5-29

C. on Bonita Avenue that may impact the freight crossing at Cataract Ave. Eliminates bus staging which currently occurs in the Park and Ride Lot.
12. No mitigations or improvements were proposed for the Bonita/San Dimas Ave bus stops to accommodate additional ridership. F 5-30

13. The intersection of San Dimas Avenue and Commercial Street will be severely impacted, T including creating traffic back-ups at the northbound left turn lane to access the Park and Ride. This should be further studied and require mitigation measures to prevent northbound vehicles from turning into the Grove Station development to turn around and 5-31

bypass the back-up created at the northbound left turn lane.

14. 3.1.4 Mitigation Measures and Recommendations - LTR-1 states that the Authority shall cooperate with the City and contribute funding for a new traffic signal at the intersection of San Dimas Avenue at Second Street when warranted.

a. The relocation of the station parking to the City Park and Ride will result in an exponential increase in traffic delays because all the commuters parked at the Park and Ride will cross San Dimas Avenue at the railroad crossing - both during peak AM and PM hours and intermittently during the off-peak hours, On page 3-8 it states that "a traffic evaluation was completed in May 2021 for the proposed east- west crosswalk just south of the Project ROW... The results of the operation and queueing analysis for the northbound and southbound approaches at San Dimas Avenue indicated that the Project with Project Modifications would not result in a substantial increase in traffic delay, and signal operations for the crosswalk at San Dimas Avenue would result in minimal delays compared to the delays experienced 5-32

at the nearby intersections."
Almost 90% of the commuters will opt to cross at this crosswalk - it's only ingrained human nature to cross at the shortest and closest point. The increase in pedestrian crossing frequency and activities will further compound and add to delays already experienced by drivers when the train is stopping or leaving the station. This additional delay, in particular for southbound San Dimas Avenue north of Bonita Avenue, will initiate driver behavior to take "short cuts" through the residential streets. Neighborhoods were not designed for cut through traffic in order to avoid delays as traffic backs up at Bonita Avenue. Why was the traffic evaluation which was completed in May 2021 not provided for review?
With the relocation of the station parking lot to the Park and Ride, the Authority

must consider installing a traffic signal as part of the current project now, rather than when fully warranted. Secondly, when it's fully warranted, how does the City 5-32
collect its contribution? Upon completion of Phase 2B, the Authority is dissolved (Cont.) and non-existent. Again, how does the City collect the contributions?

b. The Draft SEIR 3 states that additional traffic would be expected on Monte Vista Avenue and Commercial Street to enter and exit the parking lot. Any subsequent impacts will be addressed by a Parking Management Plan (PMP) - a PMP that states it would prohibit on-street parking for transit patrons and any of the neighborhoods that are impacted by traffic would be addressed by means of the 5-33
Authority working with City to install traffic calming elements around the parking lot such as speed humps/bumps and signage. This statement completely disregards and ignores the City's initial comments in the NOP to consider various traffic calming mitigation measures that would mitigate transit patrons traffic flow from the residential neighborhood.
Again, we reemphasize the City's NOP comments recommending various traffic Fe calming measures, which would mitigate the traffic flow of transit patrons in and out of the residential neighborhood as a result of the Gold Line's proposal to relocate station parking to the Park and Ride, which will result in a substantial increase in traffic volume within the existing quiet neighborhood along Cataract Avenue, Railway Street, and Commercial Street. Therefore, to deter and restrict 5-34

traffic entering Commercial Street from Cataract Avenue or Railroad Street, and/or turning right onto Commercial Street when exiting from the station parking primary driveway/aisle, it is recommended that the following specific mitigation measures be considered and reviewed for implementation by the Authority:

I. Restrict commuter traffic from entering and exiting at Railway F Street/Monte Vista Avenue/Park and Ride and allow access for 5-35
emergency vehicles only.

II. The acquisition of Successor Agency properties on Cataract Avenue and utilization of Metro Gold Line's right-of-way south of the rail lines to create 8 vehicular bypass to Railway Street and Commercial Street, 5-36
thereby potentially reducing traffic impacts on surrounding residentlal streets.

Ill. Extend Park and Ride driveway/aisle approximately 4 to 6 feet south of the center line of Commercial Street leaving approximately 12 to 13- 5-37
foot-wide lane open for eastbound traffic only.

IV. Extend this restricted eastbound lane up to Shirimar Street by means of landscaped curb extensions with entry and exit allowing for street parking for the two residents on the north side of Commercial, adjacent 5-38

to the Park and Ride.

V. The eastbound approach of Commercial Street at San Dimas Avenue 5-39 should be modified to provide two eastbound lanes. -

Vl. The segment of Commercial Street between Shirlmar Street and the T 5-40

Park and Ride's primary entrance will be restricted to allow eastbound traffic only, thereby also providing emergency and vehicular 5-40
connectivity for residents of this neighborhood to downtown and San (Cont.)
Dimas Avenue.

VII. Extension of the primary Park and Ride driveway/aisle allows for smooth flow of traffic in and out of the station parking lot without much - 5-41
delay.

VIII. Traffic signal timing and intersection improvements at San Dimas T Ave/Commercial Street to mitigate impacts to the entrance of the HOA 5-42 south of Commercial Street/west of San Dimas Ave resulting from queuing associated with the relocated station parking access.
The combination of the extended entrance and curb extension will minimize traffic T from the station's Park and Ride entering into the neighborhood because patrons using the facility will be forced to use the main entrance which will keep the 5-43
separation of traffic flow to the major arterials and off residential streets as intended.

15. In Section 4.13.3.4 Long - Term Safety Impacts, the Draft SEIR 3 details that the relocation of the station parking has the potential to result in increased safety impacts for motorists, bicyclists, and pedestrians as a result of the additional parking spaces provided, and potential additional vehicular activity associated with station access from the relocated parking facility. It further expounds that the Construction Authority will work with the City of San Dimas to identify and fund traffic and speed control devices, including traffic calming devices such as additional signage, active speed identification signs, speed humps/bumps and other devices to recue potential automobile and pedestrian/bicycle 5-44 conflicts. However, none of these have been studied or proposed as mitigations. The Draft SEIR 3, in fact, ignores the conclusion of this section and indicates no mitigations are required. As referenced above, CEQA requires the Authority to evaluate a project's traffic safety impacts on pedestrians, cyclists, and transit riders. (See City of Maywood v. Los Angeles Unified Sch. Dist. (2012) 208 Cal. App. 4th 362, 392-95 (holding EIR was inadequate because it failed to analyze and mitigate project impacts on pedestrians).)
16. The realignment of the public alley north of Commercial Street to meet the Park and Ride's T primary drive aisle restricts the eastbound right turn for residents, trash service, other utility vehicles and fire safety equipment. This layout needs to be redesigned in order to allow 5-45
access for the residents. Also, these residents would need access rights to use the new access road.

17. Tables 3-6 and 3-7 show the level of service for the AM and PM peak hours for the T following intersections:

With the relocation of the parking to the Park and Ride, motorists coming from the west ends of the City and adjacent cities to the west will travel through and add delays to the intersections of Cataract Avenue/Arrow Highway and Cataract Avenue/Bonita Avenue. 5-46

The level of service analysis should include these additional two intersections. (Cont.)

18. On page ES-3, the Draft SEIR 3 states that the proposed San Dimas parking facility would also include a Kiss and Ride area to allow for pick-ups and drop-offs. Buses would no longer enter the parking lot. Instead, the bus drop-off for Foothill Transit would now be located at the intersection of Bonita Avenue and San Dimas Avenue. An intersection that would now be more congested since there are two existing Foothill Transit stops, located at the northeast and southeast of the intersection of Bonita Avenue at San Dimas Avenue for bus line 492. Where would the bus stop for commuter bus line 499 be located? The 5-47

existing intersection was modified due to the Gold Line and is already congested, thus the addition of two new bus stops would compound further delays at an intersection that is already experiencing substantial delays. In addition, increased pedestrian crossing on San Dimas Ave south of the tracks will add to the delays at Bonita/San Dimas Ave, potentially backing up eastbound traffic across the freight tracks at Bonita/Cataract Ave.
19. The impacts to Cataract Avenue/Bonita Ave and Cataract Ave/Arrow Highway were not studied. These intersections are closest to the freeways and the entire west side of City. Much of the parking commuters will be approaching from this direction. These intersections will be severely impacted and need to be studied. 5-48

20. Where is the traffic study from May 2021 that was referenced in the Draft SEIR 3? Why was this not available for review? 5-49

Aesthetics
3 21. The Draft SEIR 3 Aesthetics discussion identifies eight residences located along the border of Commercial Street and states the fronts of these residences face away from the -

Project site and views of the Project site from the back are buffered. However, the analysis does not take into consideration the residential property located south of Commercial Street that directly faces Freedom Park and the proposed location of the new access road. Therefore, the aesthetics discussion is deficient, as the analysis only considers some of the residential properties in the area. An EIR's description of the environmental setting must be contain sufficient information to "permit the significant effects of the project to be considered in the full environmental context." CEQA Guidelines, Â§ 15125(c). "lf the description of the environmental setting 'is inaccurate, incomplete or misleading, the EIR does not comply with CEQA." (Cleveland Nat'l Forest Found. V. San Diego Assn. of 5-50

Governments (2017) 17 Cal.App.5th 413, 439.) An accurate description of the environmental setting is critical, because the significance of an activity may vary with the setting. CEQA Guidelines, Â§ 15064(b). A "project that is ordinarily insignificant in its impact on the environment may in a particularly sens/tive environment be significant." (Kings County Farm Bureau v. City of Hanford (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 692, 718, 721; CEQA Guidelines, Â§ 15300.2(a)).)
22. In addition, the Draft SEIR 3 fails to consider views of the Project site from pedestrians utilizing Commercial Street, fails adequately address the impacts of the portion of Freedom Park that is proposed to be removed in order to construct an access road, and fails to address the introduction of lighting from vehicle headlights which will impact certain 5-51

Response to Draft SEIR Metro Gold Line Extension -Relocation of the San Dimas Parking Facility San Dimas CA, 91773 11 April 1, 2022

residences. Because the Draft SEIR 3 fails to properly study these significant impacts on aesthetics, the Draft SEIR 3 fails to live up to its role as an informational document. The Authority's fallure here "precludes informed decision making and informed public 5-51

participation, thereby thwarting the statutory goals of the EIR process." (Ass'n of Irritated (Cont.)
Residents v. County of Madera (2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 1383, 1391.)
23. The Draft SEIR 3 focuses the discussion and associated impact conclusions on the portion T of the Project site that is comprised of the current San Dimas Park & Ride facility, relying & on the fact that it is currently a parking facility and would continue to be a parking facility: "As discussed, the vividness, intactness, and unity of the Project Site would remain similar to existing conditions with the implementation of the Project Modifications as the parcel would continue to be used as paved parking facility". However, the Project Site extends beyond the existing San Dimas Park & Ride facility. The Draft SEIR 3 does not adequately 5-52
address the portion of Freedom Park that is proposed to be removed in order to construct an access road or the Kiss and Ride Area. Views of Freedom Park in this area are intact with large mature trees and landscaping that provide visual relief from the surrounding development. The 2013 FEIR did not contemplate the removal of a similar resource, as a similar resource is not located within the previously considered parking location.
24. The Draft SEIR 3 does not discuss the Project's introduction of lighting associated with the headlights of vehicles exiting the parking lot from the proposed access road that would directly impact the residence located south of Commercial Street that fronts Commercial 5-53
Street and Freedom Park; this condition does not currently exist and would not have occurred at the previously considered parking location.
Air Quality/Greenhouse Gas Emissions
25. The Draft SEIR 3 does not fully analyze the air quality impacts to surrounding residents and does not propose proper mitigation (i.e. upgrading residential air filtration systems and enhancing First/Last Mile improvements) to reduce the potential air quality impacts. The proximity of the relocated Gold Line station parking lot to the existing Park and Ride will result in an incroase of traffic to the surrounding residential neighborhoods and if 5-54
proper parking is not provided, these future riders will circulate and park within surrounding private and public parking lots or along residential or commercial streets, The result of these vehicles circulating around the surrounding residential neighborhoods looking for parking will increase emissions/air pollutions and therefore increase Green House Gas (GHG) Emissions and air quality impacts.
26. In this regard the Gold Line Authority (GLA) should also evaluate, quantify and mitigate the effects of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as part of the overall air quality 5-55
assessment. This topic was not clearly addressed in the 2013 FEIR.
Community Parks and Open Space
27. The Draft SEIR 3 is deficient as it discounts the importance of the portion of Freedom Park proposed for acquisition because it does not contain park facilities or features. However, this area is vegetated, including mature trees and serves as an open space resource for 5-56
the surrounding community. The removal of a portion of Freedom Park is a long-term impact which was not contemplated in the 2013 FEIR, and the Draft SEIR 3 fails to describe the magnitude and severity of this impact, including in communities and

Response to Draft SEIR Metro Gold Line Extension -Relocation of the San Dimas Parking Facility
12 San Dimas CA, 91773 1â¢ April 1, 2022
neighborhoods located in this area. The Draft SEIR 3 fails to identify feasible mitigation 5-56 measures that would effectively reduce the Project's impacts on the visual character and (Cont.) quality.

Cultural Resources
28. The Draft SEIR 3 indicates the AB 52 consultation process is ongoing and will be further documented as part of future CEQA documentation, but fails to identify what future CEQA documentation is being referenced. Under AB 52, if consultation has begun, an EIR 5-57 cannot be certified unless the consultation process between the tribe and the lead agency has concluded. Thus, the Draft SEIR 3 inadequately describes the AB 52 consultation process.

Noise and Vibration
29. The Draft SEIR 3 inaccurately states that, when compared to the SEIR 2 location, -
residential structures abutting the relocated San Dimas parking facility are farther away from potential noise and vibration-intensive construction activities and concludes a reduction in both construction noise and construction vibration levels at adjacent receptors. SEIR 2 Table 4.11-4 shows a distance of 45 feet from the closest sensitive receptor to the reconfigured parking facility. Construction activities associated with the 5-58 Project Modifications (new access road) would occur immediately adjacent to the residential property that abuts Freedom Park; the residence is located at a distance of less than 45 feet and should be analyzed accordingly.
Similar to the construction impacts discussion, the long-term impacts discussion identifies the closest noise-sensitive receptor as 60 feet. This measurement is to the parking area. The Draft SEIR 3 should also address the noise associated with the proposed access road which would be located immediately adjacent to a sensitive receptor.
30. No mitigations were proposed for the house adjacent to the new entrance onto T Commercial Street. There will be significant queuing of vehicles exiting the station parking 5-59 onto Commercial Street. This will create noise concerns for this residence.
31. The 2013 FEIR (page 3.11-17) states noise control measures when working near residences would be required, which includes conformance with the noise requirements of each City. "Limiting construction activities to weekday daytime hours (typically 7 a.m. to 6 p.m.) and employing typical measures for minimizing noise during construction requirement, combined with the mitigation described in Section 3.11.5, would mitigate construction impacts to a less than significant level." This is contradictory to the Draft SEIR 3 (Section 3.1.2.3), which states short-term construction impacts from temporary lane closures and detours "...would be limited by scheduling certain construction activities during night hours, outside of the AM and PM peak commuting periods, and through the use of clearly signed detour routes where necessary." The Draft SEIR 3 Noise analysis 5-60 does not analyze nighttime construction activities. This inconsistency needs to be addressed and remedied. If nighttime construction activities will occur, the noise analysis needs to identify any resulting noise impacts to sensitive receptors. To "inform the public and responsible officials of the environmental consequences of their decisions before they are made." (Laurel Heights Improvement Ass'n v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal. (1993) 6 Cal.4th 1112, 1123.) Again, the Authority must analyze noise impacts and potentially feasible mitigation measures for the significant nighttime construction noise impacts

Safety and Security
32. As acknowledged in 3 the Draft SEIR 3 "[the relocated and reconfigured parking facility -
would be located in a more residential area than previously approved, with adjacent residential land to the west and south. Therefore, the facllity would be located in an area with a different safety and security setting than what was previously analyzed." As we had previously noted, there are safety and security concerns with relocating the parking facility to the Park & Ride. Specific attention should be provided to the interface between the Project site, the alley, and the residential uses located south of the alley and that currently there is a clear line of site across the alley between Monte Vista Avenue and San Dimas 5-61
Avenue, as well as visibility from the existing Park & Ride facility. This visibility could be limited with the introduction of the access road and other improvements, resulting in security and safety concerns within the alley. The Draft SEIR 3 does not adequately address safety and security concerns. The Authority is legally required to mitigate or avoid the significant impacts of the projocts it approves whenever it is feasible to it do so. (Pub. Res. Code Â§ 21002.1(b).) "In the case of the adoption of a plan, policy, regulation, or other public project, mitigation measures can be incorporated into the plan, policy, regulation, or project design." (CEQA Guidelines Â§ 15126.4(a)(2).).
33. With the Station Parking being so close to residential properties, the frequency of calis to - law enforcement will increase and the expected response time will be immediate. Draft SEIR 3 provides no details of how the Gold Line Authority will mitigate these requirements. This will impact local law enforcement and impact their ability to respond to other calls through the City. The Draft SEIR 3 must provide a detailed plan for Metro and LASD 5-62
Transit Services Bureau response to mitigate impacts to local safety and law enforcement. SS-4 securlty mitigations indicates a security plan for LRT operations shall be implemented but the mitigation measure references surveillance by law enforcement including local jurisdiction security personnel. Gold Line Authority is proposing the use of local enforcement without cost mitigations.

Water Quality and Resources -
34. The Drait SEIR 3 long-term Impacts discussion states "It]here would be a decreased amount of impervious surface compared to the Approved Project since the proposed San Dimas parking location is a smaller site than the approved location." This is not an accurate
characterization. The approved location is already impervious and although the acreage
of the parking facility may be reduced with the Project Modifications, the amount of impervious surface as a result of a the Project Modifications would not be decreased. The 5-63
Project Modifications would acquire a portion of Freedom Park for an access road, converting an existing pervious surface to impervious conditions. When an EIR gives "conflicting signals to decision-makers and the public about the nature and scope of the activity being proposed," the courts have found it "fundamentally inadequate and misleading." (San Joaquin Raptor Rescue Center v. County of Merced, 149 Cal.App.4th 645, 655-56.).

General Comments

The Draft SEIR 3's lackluster approach to impact analysis and mitigation violates CEQA, A lead agency cannot simply conclude that an impact is significant and unavoidable and move on. A conclusion of residual significance does not excuse the agency from (1) performing a thorough a evaluation and description of the impact and its severity before and after mitigation, and (2) proposing all feasible mitigation to "substantially lessen the significant environmental effect." 5-67

Â§ 15126.2(b) (requiring an EIR to discuss "any significant impacts, including those which can be mitigated but not reduced to a level of insignificance" (emphasis added).) Consequently, the Authority cannot legally certify the Draft SEIR 3 until it satisfies all the above CEQA requirements and, instead, it must consider further feasible mitigation measures in a revised and recirculated Draft SEIR 3.

Subject: Comments on Notice of Preparation of Draft Supplemental EIR (DSEIR) Metro Gold Line
Extension Phase 2B - San Dimas Parking Lot Relocation

Dear Ms. Buch:

The City of San Dimas appreciates the opportunity to provide comments on the referenced DSEIR. The T
City of San Dimas continues to support the completion of the Gold Line Foothill Extension to Montclair, as long as the City's and our community's concerns are fully mitigated to our satisfaction. The following comments are based on the Notice of Preparation of a Draft Supplemental Environmental Impact Report 5-68
received on October 15, 2021. The DSEIR needs to address and fully mitigate the following potential impacts regarding the proposed relocation of the San Dimas Gold Line Station parking lot to the existing
Park and Ride lot.

Transportation and Parking
1. The City iS extremely concerned about the impact to the surrounding residents and downtown businesses caused by the reduction in number of parking spaces provided in the proposed relocated station parking design. The original 2013 FEIR requirement of 450 parking spaces was reduced to 289 parking spaces (Supplemental EIR, 2021) due to implementing Metro's Supportive Transit Parking Program Management Plan constrained parking model. Relocating the Gold Line Station parking into the existing Park and Ride location would result in the loss of an additional 175 valuable parking spaces 5-69 (existing 175 Park and Ride parking spaces not being reconstructed or accounted for with the Gold Line parking relocation to the Park and Ride) in the heart of our downtown. Such a reduction in the
number of parking spaces in downtown would negatively impact our downtown business community. Under parking the station and reducing valuable downtown parking capacity will result in impacts to private property, as well as, Municipal parking lots and public streets in the vicinity of the Gold Line station parking lot. These impacts and mitigation measures must be evaluated and assessed as a part of the Draft SEIR and clearly indicate how the project will not have an impact on the City's streets,
residential neighborhoods, and nearby businesses.

NOP Draft SEIR Metro Gold Line Extension - San Dimas Parking Lot Relocation 2
November 17, 2021

2. A Parking Management Study is needed to fully address overflow parking onto adjacent commercial and residential neighborhoods. The study must include a discussion related to the anticipated impacts and mitigation measures (i.e. required parking enforcement, fully funding additional City staffing and 5-70
costs related to mitigating parking related impacts associated with the Gold Line, etc.) to offset the impacts of the overflow parking and traffic created by the Gold Line Station.
3. Currently, the existing Park and Ride is developed with 175 parking spaces, in addition to dedicated bus stop and bus shelter for Foothill Transit which supports regional transportation. The City is concerned about the potential impact to the Foothill Transit bus services and the need to provide additional bus patron parking, in addition to the approximately proposed 289 parking spaces to only 5-71

accommodate the future Gold Line Station patrons. The bus service provides a critical mode of public transportation and the proposed alternative would potentially eliminate this mass transit alternative.
In the 2013 FEIR, the Gold Line Authority (GLA) committed to conduct a Bus Interface Study by completion of the Design Phase. To date, no study has been completed. This is an area of concern for the City given the change to the project scope and the elimination of Foothill Transit within the 5-72
existing City Park and Ride Facility. This study will require Foothill Transit to reroute or eliminate valuable mass transit services. The GLA should complete this study without further delay.

4. The pedestrian routes from the relocated Gold Line parking within the proposed Park and Ride lot location need to be fully analyzed. The previous Gold Line parking location (City Yard) provided a direct and safe pedestrian pathway that went underneath the light rail tracks to the station. The relocated parking lot within the Park and Ride will result in a pedestrian conflict at San Dimas Avenue
and will result in significant vehicular traffic impacts on north and south bound San Dimas Avenue, in addition to east and west bound traffic on Bonita Avenue and Arrow Highway. This will be the result of the number of peak hour pedestrian traffic crossing at San Dimas Avenue, in addition to the number of train crossing signals that are activated approximately twice (trains travelling east and west bound) 5-73
every 6 minutes. Mitigation needs to be provided to prevent pedestrians from jaywalking across San Dimas Avenue and the longer traffic delays from the number of pedestrian crosswalk signals and the number of train signals disrupting the vehicular traffic movement along San Dimas Avenue.
Studies need to be conducted to fully analyze the impact to this crossing that simulate and evaluate the traffic impacts on San Dimas Avenue, in addition to the pedestrian safety and liability due to the increase in pedestrian crossing along this crossing intersection.

5. The proposed Gold Line parking relocation to the Park and Ride will result in an increase of traffic
volumes within existing quiet single-family residential neighborhoods along Railway Street and Commercial Street. Therefore, traffic calming mitigation measures need to be fully analyzed that will fully mitigate and divert this traffic away from these residential neighborhood streets. These
mitigation measures could include, but are not limited to:
5-74
a. Closure of the Monte Vista ingress/egress of Park and Ride;
b. Traffic calming mitigation measures on Railway and Commercial Streets, such as installation of cul-de-sac(s), speed humps, or other potential traffic calming mitigation measures;
C. Consider an additional vehicular ingress/egress along San Dimas Avenue to reduce traffic related impacts to the surrounding residential neighborhoods.

d. The acquisition of Successor Agency properties on Cataract and utilization of Metro Gold 5-74
Line's right-of-way south of the rail lines as bypass to Railway and Commercial reducing traffic loads on those residential streets. (Cont.)

6. Mitigation measures shall be implemented to reduce the vehicular queuing exiting the proposed - 5-75
relocated Gold Line parking lot.
7. All ADA pedestrian pathway concerns within the proposed relocated parking lot and the surrounding 5-76 rights-of-way shall be fully analyzed and mitigated.

Tree Preservation, Landscaping and Water Quality
8. The City of San Dimas is a Tree USA City and preservation of the mature trees is a priority. Any City- owned trees proposed for removal shall be evaluated per City's Tree Preservation Ordinance per 5-77
Chapter 13.36. A Tree Removal Permit Application will be required to be submitted to the Parks and Recreation Department for review.

9. The proposed station and parking lot landscape and irrigation shall comply with the City's Water Efficient Landscapes Chapter 18.14. - 5-78

10. The City is concerned with the thermal effects of the parking lot as proposed and its contribution to - an urban heat island. The project must incorporate large shade trees, vegetation/landscape and 5-79
lighter colored pavement to mitigate these impacts.

11. The proposed station and parking lot shall provide Low Impact Development (LID) proposal to comply with City, County and State water quality requirements. 5-80
H
Air Quality/Greenhouse Gas Emissions
12. The air quality impacts to surrounding residents shall be fully analyzed and mitigated (i.e. upgrading residential air filtration systems and enhancing First/Last Mile improvements). The proximity of the relocated Gold Line station parking lot to the existing Park and Ride will result in an increase of traffic 5-81 to the surrounding residential neighborhoods and if proper parking is not provided, these future riders will circulate and park within surrounding private and public parking lots or along residential or commercial streets. The result of these vehicles driving around looking for parking will increase emissions/air pollutions and therefore increase Green House Gas (GHG) Emissions.
13. Revised and updated estimates to circulation, land use, ridership and traffic/parking are necessary to prepare an appropriate analysis of the environmental effects on air quality with the revised project. Utilizing the FEIR 2013 data will result in an inadequate analysis especially in light of the availability of 5-82
new ridership data and changes in Metro policies regarding parking, parking fees and First/Last Mile improvements.

14. In this regard the Gold Line Authority (GLA) should also evaluate, quantify and mitigate the effects of T
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as part of the overall air quality assessment. This topic was not 5-83
clearly addressed in the 2013 FEIR.

Noise and Vibration
15. The impact to the surrounding residences from the additional traffic related noise shall be fully 5-84
mitigated including but not limited to:

a. Construction of new sound walls; and
b. Retrofitting all surrounding affected residence windows with dual pane glass and other 5-84

treatments to reduce the noise impact with special emphasis to residences experiencing the (Cont.)
highest traffic and noise flows.

Public Service/Safety Concerns
16. There are safety and security concerns by relocating the Gold Line parking to the existing Park and
Ride due to it being surrounded by and in close proximity to single-family residences. There is some evidence that terminus or near-terminus stations are affected negatively by increased criminal activity. Such impacts have been evident with the opening of the Gold Line Phase 2B project. Mitigation measures need to be incorporated to address these concerns including but not limited to:
a. Funding and providing law enforcement presence, preferably a new satellite law enforcement 5-85
office located within the new parking lot;

b. Installation of camera systems in all parking facilities and use of security software which is compatible with local law enforcement needs and enhanced ability for cameras to pan, tilt, zoom and record, providing clear, high quality observation during night and day, as well as providing needed hardware and viewing capability at the local law enforcement offices; and
c. Installation of city approved parking lot and alley lighting that is shielded and does not spill
over or impact surrounding residences.

Community Parks and Open Space
17. The impact to the existing Freedom Park by reducing the parkland area and removing existing mature trees and landscaping in order to facilitate the construction of new vehicular ingress/egress shall be fully mitigated. 5-86
a. Installing and maintaining adequate camera systems as specified in 16b to provide for observation and response to Freedom Park as this location will be unduly impacted by
activity coming from the Park and Ride.

Land Use
18. The proposed project relocation will affect surrounding land uses especially as they relate to both traffic, parking, air quality, noise and safety impacts. There is clear evidence that surrounding land
uses are severely impacted when station parking and access are inadequate or poorly designed. These
impacts can severely affect nearby parking facilities, businesses and residences.
5-87
Furthermore, the State legislature is mandating major land use changes around transit stations in both
adopted and anticipated legislation. These changes in growth are induced by and directly related to the station location. These changes are intended to supersede existing zoning resulting in growth inducing impact not considered at all by any of the EIRs for the project. These changes likely render much of the traffic and related analysis invalid.

Economic T
19. Relocating the Gold Line parking to the Park and Ride will negatively impact the heart of our downtown businesses by losing 175 valuable parking spaces. Due to this loss of parking, this not 5-88
only effects the current businesses and their economic vitality but will affect the economics and
viability of the future expansion and development of the new San Dimas Downtown that the City is

currently in the process of generating a new Specific Plan for. (Cont.)

20. The proposed Park and Ride parking lot site plan eliminates and negatively impacts the existing Feed and Grain business (located within the barn at 150 S. Monte Vista) by eliminating their ability to use 5-89 the existing Park and Ride lot to offload merchandise. The impact to this business shall be fully
mitigated.

21. Analyze the property value impacts to the surrounding residential and commercial uses with the 5-90
relocation of the Gold Line parking to the Park and Ride lot. F
22. The elimination of the Park and Ride lot used for bus parking, would negatively impact the City's Proposition C funds by reducing the amount of funds the City receives and which can be utilized to - 5-91
support regional transportation improvements. This impact shall be fully mitigated.
The City of San Dimas looks forward to working cooperatively to address these major issues as part of the revised project in order to maximize the benefits for Metro, the GLA, the surrounding residents, 5-92 businesses and property owners. You are welcome to contact the City for assistance or further explanation of any of these comments.

Comment Response 5-3
The Draft SEIR 3 fully analyzed the impacts as related to the proposed use of the park areas for the road access improvements. As illustrated in Figures 1-2 and 1-4, the new access road includes two lanes, one in each direction, for vehicles to enter and exit the parking facility across a portion of the area designated as Freedom Park. All areas illustrated in Figures 1-2 and 1-4 were evaluated as part of the CEQA analysis. As discussed in Section 1.2.3, fencing and landscape would be provided along the perimeter of the proposed parking facility footprint, and
along the new access road on Commercial Street. Further, as stated in Section 1.2.3,
"Landscaping would also be added to Freedom Park adjacent to the new access driveway in accordance with preliminary designs developed by the City of San Dimas." Although clearly disclosed in the project description the project description has been augmented to include
additional mention of partial acquisition of Freedom Park and that "the new access road would include two-lanes, one in each direction, to allow vehicles to turn right into the parking facility from Commercial Street, and left or right when exiting onto Commercial Street. Vehicles would
continue to exit the parking facility south on San Dimas Avenue and Monte Vista Avenue, and
west on Railway Street."
Section 4.6.3.3 states the new access road provided along Commercial Street would require the partial acquisition of the western portion of two parcels from the City a to build a two-way road along the western portion of Freedom Park. The two parcels required for partial acquisition include (8390-021-902) and (8390-021-903). The area where the access road would be placed
is currently a vegetated area that contains no park facilities or amenities. Use of this area for the
proposed access road would not impact the Freedom Park memorial monument, therefore, the Project Modifications would not impact the Veterans Monument. In addition, a sitting wall or
fence would be provided to Freedom Park as part of the Project Modifications. Public access to
the western portion of the park would be buffered during construction of the Project Modifications to allow for work vehicies to access the site, However, park access would remain open on the
eastern portion of Freedom Park during construction activities. The new roadway would be designed in accordance with city and LACOFD design requirements to allow access and adequate response times for emergency services. In addition, landscaped areas would be
provided on both sides of the roadway and along the perimeter of the parking facility, and would be in accordance with the City's tree preservation ordinance and design requirements.

Comment Response 5-4
Revised language in Section 3.3, Traffic Circulation, to describe vehicle access from Commercial Street via San Dimas Avenue to the proposed San Dimas parking facility, Reference to access via San Dimas Avenue was provided in order to reference the primary arterial access road, but the comment is correct that the direct access to the lot s via
Commercial and Monte Vista.

Comment Response 5-5
As discussed in Section 1.2.3, access to the San Dimas Gold Line Station platform would also
be revised under the Project Modifications. Access will occur only from the western side (San Dimas Avenue) of the station platform. No pedestrian or bicycle access to the San Dimas Station platform will be provided from the eastern (Walnut Avenue) side of the platform as a result of relocation of the station parking facility. Furthermore, additional right-of-way would be
required from the private properties along Walnut Avenue and Arrow Highway to construct pedestrian access to the east. This access point is no longer included based on the Project Modifications.

Comment Response 5-6
Figure 1-3 was intended to conceptually Ilustrate the difference in location from the Approved Project San Dimas parking location versus the Project Modifications San Dimas parking location, thus it did not include all access detail as provided in Figures 1-2 and 1-4. Minor inconsistency between the exhibits does not undermine the accuracy or stability of the project description. Figure 1-3 has been updated to also show the proposed access road and Kiss and
Ride area.

Comment Response 5-7
The Construction Authority no longer proposes acquisition of the parcels mentioned as part of
the Project Modifications. The City of San Dimas has engaged with a developer to utilize those two parcels, therefore, parcels 8390-021-915 and 8390-021-916 are not proposed to be cleared under CEQA as part of the Project Modifications.
Comment Response 5-8
Refer to comment response 5-7.

Comment Response 5-9

The Construction Authority no longer proposes acquisition of the two parcels mentioned as part of the Project Modifications, and thus there is no potential Construction Authority use to be
analyzed in the SEIR, There Is no contemplated future use, or acquisition, of the two referenced parcels for the identified site of the relocated parking lot, therefore, there is no confusion or conflicting signals. Additionally, the two additional parcels are not needed in any way for the rolocated parking lot. The City of San Dimas has engaged with a developer to utilize these two

parcels, therefore, parcels 8390-021-915 and 8390-021-916 are not cleared under CEQA as
part of the Project Modifications.

Comment Response 5-10

The parking reduction mentioned was evaluated in SEIR 2. It does not constitute an
environmental impact under CEQA. As discussed in Section 1.2.3 of SEIR 3, the existing
parking lot on the proposed site would be redeveloped to accommodate the same number of parking spaces as identified for the approved parking location in San Dimas. The total number
of parking spaces would be approximately 289, which would remain consistent with the
Approved Project.

CEQA Guidelines no longer require analysis of intersection level of service and instead consider vehicle miles traveled (VMT) as the primary measure of traffic impact. However, supplemental traffic analysis was conducted and found no substantial changes in traffic operations due to the Project Modifications.

As discussed in Section 4.13.3.3, during construction, motorists, pedestrians, and bicyclists would experience temporary safety hazards as part of construction of the Project Modifications. This would resuit from the number and proximity of vehicles and people adjacent to the Project Modifications locations. The potential for safety and security impacts would be minimized by compliance with OSHA, California OSHA, and Construction Authority safety and security programs, which are designed to reduce potential impacts during construction to less than significant levels, as previously discussed in the 2013 FEIR and subsequent environmental actions. Safety for pedestrians, bicyclists, and motorists would be maintained during construction through the use of signage, partial lane closures, construction barriers, and supervision by safety and security personnel at access points and throughout construction sites, in accordance with the 2013 FEIR and subsequent environmental actions. Implementation of
mitlgation measures identifled in the 2013 FEIR and subsequent environmental actions would further reduce potential short-term construction-related impacts associated with the Project Modifications to less than significant (SS-1).

Comment Response 5-11

The transportation analysis was conducted in accordance with CEQA Guidelines and SB 743
and in accordance with industry standards and customary practices, using VMT as the primary indicator of CEQA impact. The California Resources Agency determined that, in general, transportation impacts are best evaluated by using vehicle miles traveled (VMT). Guidelines
815064.3 require at lead agencies should presume that projects that reduce VMT, such as pedestrian, bicycle, and transit projects, would have a less than significant impact. Based on these guidelines, analysis of VMT was conducted utilizing the anticipated project ridership and changes in travel patterns as identified with the Metro Travel Demand Model. The analysis concluded that the project is anticipated to result in a study area reduction of VMT of approximately 40,074.

However, given that the publication of this document follows the July 1, 2020, date on which CEQA Guidelines Â§15064.3 and SB 743 apply, this Dreft SEIR 3 applies VMT as the determining factor for CEQA impacts and does not consider traffic delay to be an environmental impact under CEQA. Although no longer required as part of CEQA analysis, ridership, traffic
operations, and potential parking impacts are described in Section 3.2 of the Draft SEIR 3 for informational purposes, and for comparison to the prior environmental analyses. Detailed assumptions and analyses are provided in Appendix A (Transportation Technical Memorandum).

Comment Response 5-12
In accordance with CEQA Guidelines and SB 743, CEQA does not qualify parking as an
environmental impact. Furthermore, purchase of the current Foothill Transit Park & Ride was
completed via agreement with Metro in line with Prop A and Prop C local return guidelines, in which the parking facility is intended primarily for use as a transit commuter park & ride. The guidelines stipulate that the lot could be open for general parking during non-transit use time, e.g., evenings and weekends, provided that transit user demands are not adversely impacted. All revenues, (for example, parking, advertising or related revenue) genorated during the non- transit use time must be returned to the Jurisdictions' LR Account in the same proportion as the original LR investment in the facility. Thus, no right exists for use of the parking lot for anything that infringes on transit user demands, particularly during normal commute times.
The Construction Authority is responsible for developing a PMP to address the issues related to spillover parking. Additionally, the City will be compensated for the Parking lot by the Authority
and these funds are required to be used for a transportation use. Therefore, the City has the opportunity to use the acquisition funds for establishing a new parking facility for use by business patrons in downtown San Dimas.
Comment Response 5-13
In accordance with SB 743, CEQA does not qualify parking as an environmental impact. During construction of the Project Modifications, parking will be modifled in order to
accommodate the increase in spaces planned under the Project Modifications. The construction process is anticipated to last for less than 2 years prior to the opening of the Metro Gold Line service, while the Foothill service is still in operations. The Construction Authority has identified a phasing plan for construction that will maintain a portion of the parking lot for Foothill Transit users throughout the duration of construction. This will provide Foothill Transit service riders con- tinued access to the Park & Ride at the San Dimas location throughout most, if not all of the con- struction process. While construction will reduce the number of available Park & Ride spaces for existing Foothill bus service, this does not constitute an impact under CEQA. Additional consoli- dated information related to analysis of secondary effects is provided in Appendix A Attachment C of the Final SEIR 3.

Comment Response 5-14

CEQA Guidelines no longer require analysis of intersection level of service and instead consider
vehicle miles traveled (VMT) as the primary measure of traffic impact. However, a supplemental traffic analysis was conducted and found no substantial changes in traffic operations due to the Project Modifications.

The traffic analysis found an increase in delay in the PM Peak Intersection Operations of 7.7 seconds at San Dimas Ave/ Railway St and 4.5 seconds at San Dimas Ave/ Commerclal Street, however, both intersections will remain at a traffic level of service A or B (the lowest levels of traffic delay), Traditional traffic demand assignment diotates that drivers will use higher-classifl- cation streets (such as San Dimas Avenue) over minor access road (such as Monte Vista) when LOS operations are acceptable and can facilitate the demand without major delays. The traffic analysis results indicates that the LOS on San Dimas will be acceptable, which indicates that drivers will reasonably be expected to use San Dimas Avenue (and major crossing streets like Bonita Avenue and Arrow Highway) without cutting through neighborhood streets. Therefore, additional fraffic analysis on side streets is not deemed necessary.
Comment Response 5-15
The following general response is provided because the comment does not specify any specific hazards of concerns related to vehicle queue at the San Dimas Avenue/Commercial Street
intersection.

As discussed in Section 3.2.6.2 and shown in Table 3-7 of the Draft SEIR 3, the San Dimas
Avenue/Commercial Street intersection is anticipated to operate at LOS A. Typically, vehicle queue is minimal at this LOS level. However based on the analysis model (Synchro/SimTraffic
software), the 95th percentile queue for all approach lanes to the intersection are expected to be accommodated within the existing available storage. Therefore, vehicle queue at the San Dimas Avenue/Commercial Street intersection is not anticipated to cause potential design hazards.
Section 3, Transportation, of the Draft SEIR 3 and the Transportation Technical Memorandum
(Appendix A) of the Draft SEIR 3 have been modified to include the results of the queuing analysis for the San Dimas Avenue/Commercial Street Intersection (Attachment B of Appendix A). Inclusion of the queueing analysis at San Dimas Avenue/Commercial Street intersection does not change impact determinations.
Comment Response 5-16
As discussed in Section 3.12, the Project Modifications with the implementation of the mitigation measures (SS-3 through SS-10) identified in the 2013 FEIR and subsequent environmental
actions would reduco long-term impacts assoclated with the Project Modifications to less than significant. As described in the 2013 FEIR and subsequent environmental actions, station safety measures include adequate pedestrian queuing and refuge areas, as well as wide crosswalks to
facilitate pedestrian mobility. Additionally, the Construction Authority will work with the City of
San Dimas to identity and fund traffic control on Commercial Street and Monte Vista Avenue as
warranted to reduce potential automobile and pedestrian/bicycle conflicts.
The proposed crosswalk connects the proposed Gold Line parking lot (west of San Dimas
Avenue and south of the tracks) to the proposed Gold Line Station (east of San Dimas Avenue
and south of the tracks). The approximately 55 feet from curb ramp to curb ramp and 12 feet
wide crosswalk will cross San Dimas Avenue south of the tracks. The crosswalk will be
signalized for safety of the pedestrians.

Comment Response 5-17

The Project Modifications would involve a full acquisition of the Foothlll Transit Park & Ride lot. However, this land could be developed to include a shared subterranean parking facility incorporated a into a TOD. Metro's Joint Development division can engage with potential developers and create agreements similar to other successful TOD's implemented throughout the Metro rail network.
The project as proposed does not include a future development, but it is built not to preclude future development. The future development would be expected to provide a similar number of
parking spaces for use by transit users.

Comment Response 5-18
The Construction Authority is reporting information based on coordination conducted with
Foothill Transit staff to date. Determination for the continued operation, revision or discontinuation of service on bus lines 492 and 499 during and after construction of the Gold
Line Phase 2B is entirely within the purview of Foothill Transit and not under the control of the
Construction Authority or Metro. Short term impacts to circulation based on the Project Modiflcations are addressed by existing mitigation measures CTR-1 through CTR-3.
During construction of the Project Modifications, parking will be modified in order to
accommodate the increase in spaces planned under the Project Modifications. The construction
process is anticipated to last for less than 2 years prior to the opening of the Metro Gold Line service, while the Foothill service is still in operations. The Construction Authority has identified a phasing plan for construction that will maintain a portion of the parking lot for Foothill Transit users throughout the duration of construction. This will provide Foothill Transit service riders con- tinued access to the Park & Ride at the San Dimas location throughout most, if not all of the con- struction process, While construction will reduce the number of available Park & Ride spaces for existing Foothill bus service, this does not constitute an impact under CEQA. Additional consoli- dated Information related to analysis of secondary effects is provided in Appendix A Attachment C of the Final SEIR 3.

Comment Response 5-19
Based on coordination between the Construction Authority and Foothill Transit, Foothili Transit
Lines 492 and 499 would no longer operate their current express service to downtown Los Angeles once Phase 2B of the Metro L (Gold) Line Extension is completed to Pomona. However, Foothili Transit is the responsible agency for determining future bus operations. During construction of the Project Modifications, parking will be modified in order to accommodate the increase in spaces planned under the Project Modifications. The construction process is anticipated to last for less than 2 years prior to the opening of the Metro Gold Line service, while the Foothill service is still in operations. The Construction Authority has identified a phasing plan for construction that will maintain a portion of the parking lot for Foothill Transit users throughout the duration of construction.

This will provide Foothill Transit service riders continued access to the Park & Ride at the San
Dimas location throughout most, if not all of the construction process. While construction will re- duce the number of available Park & Ride spaces for existing Foothill bus service, this does not
constitute an impact under CEQA.
The Construction Authorlty does not have purview over Foothill Transit, they can continue to
operate their downtown service if desired, but they will need to identify another location for

In accordance with CEQA Guidelines and SB 743, CEQA does not qualify parking as an
environmental impact. Furthermore, purchase of the current Foothill Transit Park & Ride was
completed via agreement with Metro in line with Prop A and Prop C local return guidelines, in which the parking facility is intended primarily for use as a transit commuter park & ride. The guidelines stipulate that the lot could be open for general parking during non-transit use time, e.g., evenings and weekends, provided that transit user demands are not adversely impacted. Ail revenues, (for example, parking, advertising or related revenue) generated during the non-
transit use time must be returned to the Jurisdictions' LR Account in the same proportion as the original LR investment in the facility. Thus, no right exists for use of the parking lot for anything that infringes on transit user demands, particularly during normal commute times. Additionally, funds from Construction Authority purchase may be avallable for the City of San Dimas to
develop new parking if desired.
As discussed in Section 1.2.3, the Project Description states all jurisdictions would be provided
a PMP developed by the Construction Authority that would prohibit on-street parking for transit patrons and that these restrictions would be enforced by local jurisdictional law enforcement and Metro to prohibit overflow parking in nearby neighborhoods. It is the responsibility of the cities to
adopt and implement the PMP and accept Metro's offer for additional enforcement presence if it
is preferred.

The Construction Authority is reporting information based on coordination conducted with Foothill Transit staff to date. Determination for the continued operation, revision or discontinuation of service on bus lines 492 and 499 during and after construction of the Gold
Line Phase 2B is entirely within the purview of Foothill Transit and not under the control of the
Construction Authority or Metro. Foothill Transit can continue to operate their downtown service
if desired, but they may need to identify another location for parking. Given that the disposition of future Foothill Transit service has not been fully determined and is not within the purview of the Construction Authority, any evaluation of effects could only be based on speculation of changes that could occur. Therefore, further consideration for changes to the Foothill Transit
operations was not evaluated as they are not a part of the project or Project Modifications.

Additional information related to this issue is discussed in Attachment C of Appendix A in the in Final SEIR 3.

As discussed in Section 3.2.6.2 and shown in Table 3-7 of the Dreft SEIR 3, the San Dimas
Avenue/Commercial Street intersection is anticipated to operate at LOS A. Typically, vehicle queue is minimal at this LOS level. However, based on the analysis model (Synchro/SimTraffic
software), the 95th percentlle queue for all approach lanes to the intersection are expected to be accommodated within the existing available storage. Therefore, since the San Dimas Avenue/Commercial Street intersection is not anticipated to be substantially affected by the Project, the housing development located near the intersection is also not expected to be substantially affected.

The assessment of the traffic effects on surrounding residential roadways to the parking facility
was based on the location of the park & ride facility on San Dimas Avenue, and the access
points on Monte Vista Avenue and Commercial Street near San Dimas Avenue. It is a standard
traffic engineering premise that drivers will use higher-classification streets (such as San Dimas
Avenue), particularly when operations are acceptable. The traffic analysis results indicated that
the LOS will be acceptable, so drivers will reasonably be expected to use San Dimas Avenue
(and major crossing streets like Bonita Avenue and Arrow Highway) without cutting through neighborhood streets.

The traffic evaluation completed in May 2021 was summarized in a technical memorandum that
has been included in Appendix A of the Draft SEIR 3 Inclusion of this technical memorandum
does not change conclusions or impact identified in the in impact analysis.
As summarized in the technical memo, the delays for both approaches to the crosswalk along San Dimas Avenue during the peak hours are minimal and the projected queue lengths are within the available storage upstream of the signals. Therefore, the neighborhoods along San Dimas Avenue north of Bonita Avenue are not expected to be substantiaily affected by the proposed Project Modificatlons.
The Construction Authority affirms its commitment to contribute funding if a signal is warranted at San Dimas/Second intersection in the future. Analysis documented as part of SEIR 2
demonstrated acceptable level of service in the future with the Project Modifications proposed as part of that CEQA document. Substantial changes in future operations at that intersection are
not anticipated based on traffic pattern changes expected under SEIR 3, thus the mitigation
measure has not been further revised.

No CEQA impacts have been identified related to traffic that require additional mitigations. However, as discussed in Section 1.2.3, the Construction Authority will work with the City of San
Dimas to incorporate trafflc control measures if desired.
The supplementary traffic analysis conducted does not anticipate significant changes in traffic
volumes on Railway St that would result in safety impacts. Traditional traffic demand
assignment dictates that drivers will use higher-classification streets (such as San Dimas Avenue) over minor access road (such as Railway and Monte Vista) when LOS operations are acceptable and can facilitate the demand without major delays. The trafflo analysis results
indicates that the LOS on San Dimas will be acceptable, which indicates that drivers will

The CEQA transportation analysIs studied potential pedestrians, bicyclists, and transit rider impacts and found that no significant changes in vehicle traffic would occur due to the proposed changes and, thus no mitigation is required.
Traffic calming devices are not proposed as mitigation measures for any CEQA impact, therefore, are not required to be analyzed as mitigation. The Construction Authority nevertheless remains open to future coordination with the City of San Dimas on appropriate signage and control measures to improve parking access for transit patrons while reducing
effects on local residents.

Implementation of the mitigation measures (S8-3 through SS-10) identifled in the 2013 FEIR and subsequent environmental actions would reduce long-term impacts associated with the Project Modifications to less than significant. No further mitigation is required.

The design has been revised to accommodate right-turns from vehicles, inoluding large vehicles such as garbage trucks and fire engines while restricting access to the alley from the parking lot; see revised Figures 1-2 and 1-4. Vehicles will be able to exit the alley heading eastbound and turn right onto the parking lot driveway and head to Commercial Street allowing access to San Dimas Avenue. Further refinements can be made during final design. The Construction Authority anticipates prohibition of right turns from the parking lot westbound onto the alley via signage and also a bulb-out which will make it difficult to turn right into the alley.

As discussed in Section 3.2.2 of the Draft SEIR 3 and Section 1.2 of the Transportation Technical Memorandum (Appendix A), analysis for the proposed Project Modification only includes the six intersections where travel patterns are expected to change, as compared to the 24 intersections included in SEIR 2 for the San Dimas Station. It was determined that operations It at the other 18 intersections analyzed in SEIR 2 would remain substantially unchanged since travel patterns at these locations are not expected to change. The analysis for these intersections, which can be found in SEIR 2, still applies. Section 3.2.2 of the Draft SEIR 3 has been modified to further clarify the study area for the Project Modifications.
The conclusion that the travel patterns at these two intersections would remain substantially the same is based on professional judgement and knowledge of the area by a traffic expert. There is no clear evidence that the travel patterns would change. The new parking lot on San Dimas Avenue is located approximately 1/4 mile west from the previously-proposod parking lot on Walnut Avenue. Both locations are east of Cataract Avenue and Bonita Avenue and Arrow
Highway are the two major east-west streets on either side of both parking lots. Drivers coming

The multi-family residential property located on the south side of Commercial Street that faces north towards Freedom Park and the proposed driveway, would have views of construction activity related to the new access roadway. Approximately four of these units would have windows or property fronts that directly face Freedom Park and the proposed construction. However, views of construction as seen from this residential property would be temporary in

nature and buffered by several trees that line the border of Freedom Park, as well as additional vegetation, landscaping, and structures. Regarding surrounding properties, the front of the single-family residence adjacent to the multi-family property to the west faces away from Freedom Park and has a surrounding wall and tali bushes that would impede views of construction from that property. The single-family residences adjacent to Freedom Park to the west, on the north side of Commercial Street, also have a bordering wali, fence, and trees that would buffer views of construction. In addition, Mitigation Measure VIS-2 would consider temporary construction area screening in areas adjacent to roadways, residences, and businesses, which would minimize short-term construction Impacts.

Impacts to Freedom Park for the proposed access road would be less than significant, The area planned for the new roadway access is currently a vegetated area that contains no park facilities or amenities. Landscaping and a sitting wall or fence would be a provided to Freedom Park as part of the Project Modifications, which would be consistent with exiting land uses. In addition, im- pacts to residences resulting from vehicle headlights from usage of the proposed access road would be fleeting and temporary. This is consistent with the typical lighting environment experienced by residential properties in urban and suburban areas. Lighting from the vehicle headlights would be buffered by the proposed wall/fence and landscaping, as well as existing trees and vegetation that border Freedom Park.

In a binding letter of intent signed on June 17, 2021 between the City of San Dimas and Construction Authority, the City desiros that the Project's parking facility be located on the west portions of parcels (902 and 903) within Freedom Park for the new access road. The area
planned for the new roadway access is currently a vegetated area that contains no park facilities or amenities. Landscaping and a sitting wall or fence would be provided to Freedom Park as part of the Project Modifications, which would be consistent with existing land uses, Although the access road would require the removal of vegetation, including several trees, the new
landscaping would be relocated/replaced in accordance with the Construction Authority's Tree Removal Policy prepared for the Project to further delineate the boundaries of the Freedom Park amenities. Additionally, use of the relocated and reconfigured parking facility could increase visibility for transit patrons and encourage continued enjoyment of the park. Mitigation Measure VIS-1 would ensure impacts to tree removal are less than significant, as replacement/relocation of trees would be determined by a qualified arborist and follow applicable landscape guidelines and design strategies consistent with the Metro Rail Design Criteria (MRDC), the Construction Authority's Tree Removal Policy, and in compliance with the city's tree preservation ordinances.

As discussed in Comment Response 5-51, impacts to residences resulting from vehicle headlights from usage of the proposed access road would be fleeting and temporary, Lighting from the vehicle headlights would be buffered by the proposed wall and landscaping, as well as

existing trees and vegetation that border Freedom Park. Although the introduction of vehicle headlights from the proposed access road would somewhat aiter existing conditions, vehiole lighting conditions do currently exist in the surrounding setting. Freedom Park and the San Dimas parking facility are located in an urban area with commercial and residential businesses with regular traffic from vehicles, particularly vehioles that use the current parking facility. The introduction of vehicle headlights from the proposed access road would not significantly alter existing lighting conditions.
This multi-family residential use is located in a Downtown/Old Town area of San Dimas where
there is an existing higher level of lighting (both pedestrian level lighting and standard street lighting) already present. Being in the city's downtown area, this property is already currently subject to additional lighting from vehicle headlights traveling in a downtown area that attracts people/drivers/vehicles from throughout the oity. Specifically, vehiole headlights are currently temporarily directed onto the first level of this property when vehioles travelling southbound on San Dimas Avenue turn right onto Commercial Street. Currently vehicle headlights are temporarily directed onto the first level of the residential building when vehicles turn into the
property's driveway on the south side of Commercial Street (turning right into the complex from traveling eastbound on Commercial; turning left into the complex from traveling westbound on Commercial). So headlights from the new driveway would not be something new the residents are not already experiencing. Any vehicle headlights from vehioles exiting the new proposed project driveway on the north side of Commercial Street would be temporary and fleeting as the vehicles would generally be in constant movement. There are some bushes and small trees
directly in front of some parts of the residential building that could help to block some new
lighting.

As discussed in Section 4.2.3.3, the modified parking configuration would be located on
approximately 2.57 acres of land that is currently used as an existing Park & Ride lot for Foothill
Transit. It is anticipated that the reconfiguration and relocation of the parking facility would result
in less construction (duration and equipment) than previously disclosed in the 2013 FEIR and subsequent environmental actions. In addition, the relocation of the parking facility would also result in fewer relocations of facilities that would have been required under the location approved in the SEIR 2, such as the City maintenance yard and commercial properties. Since overall construction duration, equipment, and activities are anticipated to be less, overall construction emissions are also anticipated to be lower than previously disclosed in the 2013
FEIR and subsequent environmental actions. In addition, actual emissions from construction
equipment may be lower than what was quantified in the 2013 FEIR and subsequent environmental actions due to advancements in engine technology, retrofits, and oquipment fleet turnover as stricter regulatory standards take effect. Thus, as construction occurs in later years, exhaust-related emissions are antioipated to result in lower levels of emissions,
As discussed in Section 1.2.3, the Project Modifications would reconstruct the existing transit
parking facility to provide approximately 114 additional parking spaces over the existing number
(for total of approximately 289 spaces), which is consistent with the approved Project. The

Gold Line Foothill Extension Phase 2B Parking Analysis report completed for Metro used the Supportive Transit Parking Program (STPP) model to determine the number of parking spaces needed for the station. This model is used for Metro rail projects throughout the county and is consistent with regional growth demands. Parking management plans and parking enforcement are expected to occur around the station to prevent the effects of overflow parking in the surrounding areas. Based on experience with Phase 2A of the Gold Line and other project openings, the traveling public quickly adjusts to an understanding of available parking and will adjust their travel to/from stations accordingly. Therefore, substantial VMT associated with
parking searches is not anticipated. Furthermore, the Project Modifications would provide
infrastructure that supports alternative modes of access for bicycles and pedestrians, which would encourage alternative modes of transportation, reducing the number of vehicles in the
area. During operations, the Project Modifications would not impact ridership levels or result in a change to the anticipated VMT saving associated with implementation of the Project. Therefore, Project Modifications would still reduce criteria air pollutant emissions and the associated air quality impacts to human health. Thus, the Project with implementation of the Project Modifications would continue to represent a regional air quality benefit and reduce air quality impacts to human health in the region.
As described in Section 4.2.3.4, the Project Modifications would result in changes to local traffic circulation in the surrounding area; however, the affected intersections would not experience a significant change in vehicle volumes or delay that would cause a significant localized air quality impact to the surrounding area. Since the modified San Dimas Station parking location would be located on an existing San Dimas Park & Ride lot, vehicle activity associated with the modified San Dimas Station parking lot would not result in a substantial new source or type of emissions to the surrounding residential neighborhood. The type of vehicle traffic to and from the station
would be primarily light duty autos and trucks, which are not substantial sources of toxic air
contaminant emissions, such as diesel PM. Further, as described in Section 3.1.2.4, the Project would continue to result in a in net reduction of 40,074 vehicle miles traveled per day in the Study Area, and therefore, reduce the associated criteria air pollutant and GHG emissions in the Study Area, and offset any vehicle circulation activity that could occur.
Comment Response 5-55
Impacts related to greenhouse gas emissions associated with implementation of the Project are described and evaluated in Section 4.4, Climate Change, of the Draft SEIR. As stated in Section 4.4.3.3, the modified parking configuration would require less construction equipment and a shorter construction duration than originally assumed in the 2013 FEIR. In addition, the Project Modifications would result in fewer relocations of facilities that would have been required under the location approved in the SEIR 2. Therefore, the short-term GHG emissions impacts of the Project Modifications would be no greater than those identified by the 2013 FEIR and subsequent environmental actions. As described in Section 4.4.3.4, long-term operation of the Project, with implementation of the proposed Project Modifications would continue to result in substantial VMT savings of 370,805 per day for the region and 40,074 per day for the Study Area. Therefore, the Project, with the Project Modifications, would continue to reduce GHG
emissions and result in a net reduction in GHG emissions. Long-term impacts of the Project

Modifications would be no greater than those identified by the 2013 FEIR and subsequent environmental actions, and no new or more severe significant impacts would occur. Therefore, no new mitigation is required.

Section 4.6.3.3 states the new access road provided along Commercial Street would require the partial acquisition of the western portion of two parcels from the City to build a two-way road along the western portion of Freedom Park. The two parcels required for partial acquisition inciude (8390-021-902) and (8390-021-903). The area where the access road would be placed is currently a vegetated area that contains no park facilities or amenities. Use of this area for the
proposed access road would not impact the Freedom Park memorial monument, therefore, the Project Modifications would not impact the Veterans Monument. In addition, landscaping and a sitting wall or fence would be provided to Freedom Park as part of the Project Modifications. Public access to the western portion of the park would be buffered during construction of the Project Modifications to allow for work vehicles to access the site. However, park access would remain open on the eastern portion of Freedom Park during construction activities. The new roadway would be designed in accordance with city and LACOFD design requirements to allow access and adequate response times for emergency services. In addition, landscaped areas would be provided on both sides of the roadway and along the perimeter of the parking facility, and would be in accordance with the City's tree preservation ordinance and design requirements. Section 4.6.3.4 also states, new landscaping would be provided to replace existing vegetation and to further delineate the boundaries of the Freedom Park amenities. Additionally, use of the relocated and reconfigured parking facility could increase visibility for transit patrons and encourage continued enjoyment of the park. Public access to the park would
remain open during operations.
As discussed in Section 4.1.3.3, the Project Modifications have the potential to result in short- term impacts to visual resources that would include temporary visual obstructions, distractions, and interferences within the existing visual environment due to the presence of construction equipment and construction objects (e.g., staged/stockpiled building materials, traffic barricades, signage, construction personnel, and lighting should work be conducted in the evening hours). These activities would be visible from residences, businesses, roadways, and portions of the City of San Dimas Freedom Park adjacent to the areas where the modifications are planned. Visitors of the Veterans Monument at the City of San Dimas Freedom Park would
have northwest-facing views of construction activity. However, the size of the three monument structures as well as the bordering wall/fence and landscaping of the park would obstruct views of construction. In addition, approximately two residences located on the west side of Monte
Vista Avenue would have east-facing views of construction activity. The east-facing views would be partially impeded by surrounding landscaping with trees and vegetation. Approximately eight residences are located along the southern border of Commercial Street. However, the fronts of these residences face away from the Project Site, and views of the Project site from the back are buffered by the residences' parking garages, storage structures, fences, gates, and/or back- yards. In addition, since the Project Site currently serves as the San Dimas Park & Ride parking lot, construction would entail less equipment, materials, and construction activities than

those evaluated In the 2013 FEIR for the approved parking location. Construction activities are not expected to create new shadow effects on sensitive users. Implementation of mitigation
measures identified in the 2013 FEIR and subsequent environmental actions would reduce
short-term construction-related visual quality impacts associated with the Project Modifications
to less than significant (VIS-1 though VIS-3).

Noise analyses were based on the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) Noise and Vibration Impact Assessment guidance manual established for transit facilities including transit parking facilities. In accordance with this methodology, distance is typically measured from the center of a parking facility to the nearest receptor locations when determining operational noise effects. However, the operational noise analysis completed utilized a more conservative estimate of distance to sensitive receptors of 60 feet, based on the distance from the nearest edge of the parking lot. The distance from construction activities was based on the parking facility area and anticipated construction activities. As a result of the proximity of the new access driveway to residential development, the noise levels from the driveway access point on Commercial Street were predicted separately from the noise from the parking lot. The nearest noise sensitive receiver to the middle of the access drive is the residence located 43 feet west on Commercial
Street.

Additional supplemental analysis was prepared to confirm that there would not be operational or construction impacts as a result of the driveway location. This analysis concluded that noise levels would be below the level of moderate impact and would be further reduced as a result of the wall that is present along the western edge of the proposed access driveway. The additional analysis and other changes to the noise analysis have been clearly identified in a revised Noise
Memorandum that is provided as Appendix C to the Final SEIR 3.

The safety analysis determined that implementation of the mitigation measures (SS-3 through SS-10) identified in the 2013 FEIR and subsequent environmental actions would reduce long- term impacts associated with the Project Modifications to less than significant. As described in the 2013 FEIR and subsequent environmental actions, station safety measures include
adequate pedestrian queuing and refuge areas, as well as wide crosswalks to facilitate
pedestrian mobility. Additionally, the Construction Authority will work with the City of San Dimas to identify and fund traffic control on Commercial Street and Monte Vista Avenue as warranted to reduce potential automobile and pedestrian/bicycle conflicts.
As discussed in Section 1.2.3, a combination of screen wall, other fencing and/or landscaping may be provided along the perimeter of the proposed San Dimas parking lot along Monte Vista Avenue and on the southern edge of the Project Modifications near the alley. Additionally, the Project site would continue to be used as a parking facility. As discussed in e Section 4.1.3.4, mitigation measures VIS-4 and VIS-5 would ensure that the facility design, landscaping, and lighting are approprlate for the site and fit the surrounding community, which would also enhance the unity and intactness of the views of the site.

Comment Response 5-62
As discussed in Section 4.6.3.3, potential short-term construction impacts to police protection services would be related to traffic and disruptions along access routes. Construction vehicles
could temporarily increase traffic congestion and road closures, or road constriction based on the construction of the Project Modifications. Intermittent traffic congestion would be temporary and would not substantially affect police response times. A Traffic Management Plan (TMP), as described in Chapter 3 of this Draft SEIR 3, would be implemented to address traffic lssues
during construction (CTR-3). The TMP would include provisions for coordinating with police departments to maintain emergency service coverage during Project Modification construction, consistent with the 2013 FEIR and subsequent environmental actions. Short-term police protection impacts associated with the Project Modifications would be less than significant. Additionally, the affected police and fire departments would not experience impacts that would not be considered typical for operation of parking facilities. The Project Modifications would not substantially increase the demand for local police or fire protection services as the LASD Transit Services Bureau would address most emergency calls. It is anticipated that construction of
surface lots as opposed to parking garages allows police and emergency service providers to have greater visibility and accessibility of the parking facilities, which may reduce the amount of time it takes to respond to calls. Additionally, the existing site is already used as a parking lot, so impacts would be similar to existing conditions, and may only incrementally increase due to the increase in the number of parking spaces. Therefore, the Project Modifications would not result in the need for additional long-term police officers or firefighters.

Comment Response 5-63
As discussed in Section 4.14.3.4, the Project would Introduce new impervious surfaces; however, the extent would be minimal and would not alter the drainage or increase the amount
of runoff significantly since most of the areas where parking facilities would be developed are already developed with buildings and other impervious materials. Furthermore, the Project Modifications would largely be located on an area of current impervious surface since it is already in use as a parking facility. The relocated and reconfigured parking facility would include landscaped areas such as parking islands, areas adjacent to pedestrian walkways and other site perimeter locations. There would be a decreased amount of impervious surface associated with the Project compared to the Approved Project since the proposed San Dimas parking location is approximately 2.57 acres as compared with the Approved Project location which is a site of approximately 3.36 acres. Although there would not be less impervious area in the City of San Dimas, the Project Modifications result in less impervious area devoted to the project. Bioswales could be added within the Project Modifications footprint if space permits to capture and treat potential runoff pollutants that can accumulate as a result of parked vehicles.
Comment Response 5-64
The Park & Ride Facility will be designed to Metro Rail Design Criteria and local landscape
codes to the extent practicable. The Construction Authority is not required to adhere to City Code requirements. It is anticipated that the parking lot can accommodate 289 spaces,
including appropriate ADA and landscaping features.
Comment Response 5-65
As discussed in Section 4.1.3.3, the new proposed parking facility would be constructed in the City of San Dimas, which contains its own tree protection ordinance as discussed in the 2013
FEIR and subsequent environmental actions. Potential removal of trees may be protected by the City's ordinance when the site is being cleared to construct the proposed surface parking lot. While the Construction Authority is not subject to local ordinances, it has opted to voluntarily comply with local tree protection ordinances to the extent feasible. The construction of the
relocated parking facility may require two or more existing trees to be removed from the City of San Dimas Freedom Park related to the potential new driveway, in addition to trees and shrubs located in planters within the existing parking lot. Although the Project Modifications would require minor landscaping including tree replacement/relocation, the required permitting and replacement/relocation of trees would maintain a similar level of vividness with the
implementation of the Project Modifications. Trees and landscaped areas that require removal would be replaced/relocated in accordance with the Construction Authority's Tree Removal Policy prepared for the Project.

Comment Response 5-66
Since overall construction duration, equipment, and activities are anticipated to be less, overall construction emissions are also anticipated to be lower than previously disclosed in the 2013 FEIR and subsequent environmental actions, Since construction activities associated with the

Project Modifications would occur on an approximate 2.57-acre site, the daily emissions associated with the construction activities for the relocation of the parking facility would be less concontrated than the assumptions and thresholds (1-acre projeot site) used in the representative project analysis in the 2013 FEIR and new impacts are not anticipated. In addition, actual emissions from construction equipment may be lower than what was quantifled in the 2013 FEIR and subsequent environmental actions due to advancements in engine
technology, retrofits, and equipment fleet turnover as stricter regulatory standards take effect. Thus, as construction occurs in later years, exhaust-related emissions are anticipated to result in lower levels of emissions. With the incorporation of mitigation measures CON-1 through
CON-19, short-term impacts of the Project Modifications would be no greater than those identified by the 2013 FEIR and subsequent environmental actions. Additional information is
provided in Appendix A Attachment C.
Parking for construction equipment will primarily occur on the construction site and not result in
impacts on the neighborhood.

Comment Response 5-67
The CEQA analysis included in Draft SEIR 3 is equivalent with prior Project analysis for consistency and is in line with engineering and design information currently available. As
discussed in Section ES.1.3, no new or more severe impacts have been identified with
implementation of the Project Modifications, and the modifications do not resuit in new
significant impacts beyond those previously identified for the Project. As such, implementation of the Project Modifications would not result in new or significant impacts per CEQA Guidelines,
and no additional alternatives beyond those considered in the 2013 FEIR need to be analyzed.
Further, all previously identifled mitigation remains in place and applicable to the proposed project modifications.

In accordance with CEQA Guidelines and SB 743, CEQA does not qualify parking as an
environmental Impact. Furthermore, purchase of the current Foothill Transit Park & Ride was
completed via agreement with Metro in line with Prop A and Prop C local return guidelines, in
which the parking facility is intended primarily for use as a transit commuter & park & ride. The guidelines stipulate that the lot could be open for general parking during non-transit use time, e.g., evenings and weekends, provided that transit user demands are not adversely impacted. All revenues, (for example, parking, advertising or related revenue) generated during the non- transit use time must be returned to the Jurisdictions' LR Account in the same proportion as the original LR investment in the facility. Thus, no right exists for use of the parking lot for anything
that infringes on transit user demands, particularly during normal commute times.

The proposed use would reserve all spaces for Metro Park & Ride patrons during normal commute times. However, there is potential to enter an agreement with Metro to use the parking
facility on weekends and after commuting hours, which would allow use for businesses and
events in downtown San Dimas.

Comment Response 5-70
As discussed in Section 1.2.2. of the Draft SEIR 3, the Construction Authority will prepare a Parking Management Plan (PMP) to address the concerns identified. Adoption and
implementation of the PMP is the responsibility of the city along with acceptance of the offer for enforcement from Metro.

Elimination of the Foothill Transit line is not part of the Project or Project Modifications. Foothill
Transit may modity or cancel the bus service once the LRT service opens. The replacement of
bus service with LRT service is considered a transit enhancement.

Comment Response 5-72
The Construction Authority completed analysis related to the Bus Interface Study and has
conducted coordination with Foothill Transit staff on future bus operations. The shuttle bus
evaluated in the 2019 SEIR is not part of the current service plan, therefore, this analysis was not included in the ridership evaluation. The Construction Authority continues to work with Foothill Transit and other bus service providers on appropriate transit service conditions. Commitments made in the 2013 FEIR and subsequent environmental actions remain in effect.

Section 3.1.2.4 of the Draft SEIR 3 describes the pedestrian features included in the Project to address safety concerns related to the connection between the proposed parking lot and the
San Dimas station. In addition, the safety analysis presented in Section 4.13.3 determined that
Implementation of the mitigation measures (SS-3 through SS-10) identified in the 2013 FEIR and subsequent environmental actions would reduce long-term impacts associated with the Project Modifications to less than significant. As described in the 2013 FEIR and subsequent environmental actions, station safety measures include adequate pedestrian queuing and refuge areas, as well as wide crosswalks to facilitate pedestrian mobility. Additionally, the Construction Authority will work with the City of San Dimas to identify and fund traffic control on Commercial Street and Monte Vista Avenue as warranted to reduce potential automobile and
pedestrian/bicycle conflicts.

Comment Response 5-74
Please refer to response to comment 5-37. In addition, a supplemental evaluation (not required by CEQA) was conducted to determine the transportation effects of the proposed Project
Modifications to the surrounding roadway system compared to the previous proposed location. A discussion of this supplemental evaluation is provided in Section 3.2 of the Draft SEIR 3.

Based on the results of the evaluation, no substantial changes in traffic operations due to the Project Modifications are anticipated. The traffic analysis found an increase in delay in the PM Peak Hour Intersection Operations of 7.7 seconds at San Dimas Ave/ Railway St and 4.5 seconds at San Dimas Ave/ Commercial Street, however, both intersections will remain at a
traffic level of service A or B (the lowest levels of traffic delay). Therefore, the residential neighborhoods is not anticipated to be substantially affected by the proposed Project Modification.

Since no CEQA impacts are identified no mitigation is required. Nevertheless, the Construction Authority has committed to work with the City of San Dimas to identify project features, signage and other design considerations to improve transit patron access and reduce effects on
surrounding residences.
Traditional traffic demand assignment diotates that drivers will use higher-classification streets (such as San Dimas Avenue) over minor access road (such as Monte Vista) when LOS
operations are acceptable and can facilitate the demand without major delays. The traffic analysis results Indicates that the LOS on San Dimas will be acceptable, which indicates that drivers will reasonably be expected to use San Dimas Avenue (and major crossing streets like Bonita Avenue and Arrow Highway) without cutting through neighborhood streets. Therefore, additional traffic analysis on side streets is not deemed necessary.
Comment Response 5-75
Typically, vehicle queue is minimal when the intersection is operating at LOS A as shown in Table 3-7 of the Draft SEIR 3. However based on the analysis model (Synchro/SimTraffic
software), the 95th percentile queue for all approach lanes to the intersection are expected to be accommodated within the existing available storage. Therefore, vehicle queue is not anticipated to cause potential design hazards.
Section 3, Transportation, of the Draft SEIR 3 and the Transportation Technical Memorandum
(Appendix A) of the Draft SEIR 3 have been modified to include the results of the queuing analysis for the San Dimas Avenue/Commercial Street intersection (Attachment B of Appendix A). Inclusion of the queueing analysis at San Dimas Avenue/Commercial Street intersection
does not change conclusions or impact identified in the impact analysis.

As discussed in Section 4.3.3, the City of San Dimas where the new proposed parking facility would be constructed contains its own tree protection ordinance as discussed in the 2013 FEIR and subsequent environmental actions. As discussed in Section 1.2.3, the Project Modifications would require the removal of large trees within Freedom Park for implementation of the new access road, and trees located within landscaped planters in the existing parking lot. The

potential removal of trees within Freedom Park and in landscaped planters within the existing
parking lot, may be protected by the City's ordinance when the site is being cleared to construct
the proposed surface parking lot. While the Construction Authority is not subject to local ordinances, it has opted to voluntarily comply with local tree protection ordinances to the extent feasible. Trees and landscaped areas that require removal would be replaced/relocated in accordance with the Construction Authority Tree Removal Policy prepared for the Project. This would be conducted via implementation of mitigation measures identifled in the 2013 FEIR and
subsequent en vironmental actions that would reduce potential short-term, direct construction-
related impacts associated with the Project Modifications to less than significant (B-2).
Comment Response 5-78
As discussed in Section 4.14.3.4, the relocated and reconfigured parking facility would include
landscaped areas such as parking islands, areas adjacent to pedestrian walkways and other site perimeter locations. The Construction Authority is not bound by City requirements, however, intends to work with the City of San Dimas to provide appropriate landscaping and irrigation.
Comment Response 5-79
As discussed in Section 4.1.3.4, although the Project Modifications would require minor
landscaping Including tree removal, the required permitting and relocation of trees would
maintain a similar level of vividness with the implementation of the Project Modifications. Trees and landscaped areas that would be removed during construction would be relocated/replaced in accordance with the Construction Authority's Tree Removal Policy prepared for the Project, which would maintain existing thermal levels and would not contribute to the urban heat island.
Similarly, the amount of impervious surface would remain similar to existing conditions as implementation of the Project Modifications would not cause significant change to the landscape. The Project site would continue to be used as a parking facility, The Project Modifications would result in less project-associated impervious surface than the Approved Project.

Comment Response 5-80
As discussed in Section 4.14.3.3, the Project Modifications would not result in increased levels of ground disturbance, therefore no increase of potential short-term surface water impacts is anticipated. The Project Modifications would be required to comply with all applicable water quality permits and regulations. Consistent with the Project, construction of the Project
Modifications would be required to comply with NPDES permits described in Section 3.14.1 of the 2013 FEIR, Section 3.11.1 of SEIR 1, and Section 4.14.3.3 of SEIR 2. Compliance would include preparation of a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan and deployment of stormwater BMPs such as those described in the 2013 FEIR and subsequent environmental actions. As such, the Project Modifications would not violate water quality standards or discharge
requirements, substantially alter the existing drainage pattern of the site, or contribute to runoff
water that would exceed existing or planned capacity,

Comment Response 5-81
As discussed in Section 1.2.3, the Project Modifications would reconstruct the existing transit parking facility to provide approximately. 114 additional parking spaces over the existing number (for a total of approximately 289 spaces), which is consistent with the approved Project. The Goid Line Foothill Extension Phase 2B Parking Analysis report completed for Metro used the Supportive Transit Parking Program (STPP) model to determine the number of parking spaces needed for the station. This model is used for Metro rail projects throughout the county and is consistent with regiona! growth demands. Parking management plans and parking enforcement are expected to occur around the station to prevent the effects of overflow parking in the surrounding areas. Based on experience with Phase 2A of the Gold Line and other project openings, the traveling public quickly adjusts to an understanding of available parking and will adjust their travel to/from stations accordingly. Therefore, substantial VMT associated with parking searches is not anticipated. Furthermore, the Project Modifications would provide infrastructure that supports alternative modes of access for bicycles and pedestrians, which would encourage alternative modes of transportation, reducing the number of vehicles in the
area.

As described in Section 4.2.3.4, the Project Modifications would result in changes to local traffic circulation in the surrounding area; however, the affected intersections would not experience a significant change in vehicle volumes or delay that would cause a significant localized air quality impact to the surrounding area. Since the modified San Dimas Station parking location would be
located on an existing San Dimas Park & Ride lot, vehicle activity associated with the modified
or San Dimas Station parking lot would not result in a substantial new source type of emissions to the surrounding residential neighborhood. The type of vehicle traffic to and from the station would be primarily light duty autos and trucks, which are not substantial sources of toxic air contaminant emissions, such as diesel PM. Further, as described In Section 3.1.2.4, the Project would continue to result in a net reduction of 40,074 vehicle miles traveled per day in the Study Area, and therefore, reduce the associated criteria air pollutant and GHG emissions in the Study Area, and offset any vehicle circulation activity that could occur.

Comment Response 5-82
As discussed in Section 4.11.3.4, the proposed location for the San Dimas parking facility is currently used as a & Foothill Transit Park & Ride facility, therefore no change in land use is planned. Additionally, the area planned for the new roadway access is currently a vegetated area that contains no park facilities or amenities. Landscaping and sitting wall or fence would be provided to Freedom Park as part of the Project Modifications, which would be consistent with exiting land uses. Furthermore, building a parking facility adjacent to the existing Project ROW is consistent with the San Dimas General Plan. The Project Modifications would be con- structed on the existing parking lot and the western portion of Freedom Park which is zoned as "Creative Growth", as compared to the previously approved site which consists of industrial land use. The Project Modifications would be consistent with existing and planned land uses and de- velopment of the reconfigured parking facility would not prevent future re-development that could include additional features permitted in the Creative Growth zoning designation.

The Draft SEIR did not identify any significant land use changes. The reconfiguration of parking will be in accordance with Metro parking policy guidance and this CEQA document evaluates
the impacts of the revised parking configuration and circulation (i.e., LOS analysis) in Section 3.2. The travel demand model, as described and presented in SEIR 2, was calibrated to incorporate Metro's updated parking policy. As described in Section 3,2, the Project Modifications would not result in changes to travel demand. Furthermore, as described in
Section 3.1.2.4, the Project Modifications would not change ridership levels at any of the proposed stations and would, therefore, not change VMT for the region or Study Area. As a result, updated ridership estimates are not necessary, Since the Project would continue to result in substantial VMT savings, the Project would continue to result in an air quality benefit to the region. Section 4.2.3.4 evaluates the impact of the changes to local traffic circulation in the
surrounding area; however, the affected intersections would not experience a significant change in vehicle volumes or delay that would cause a significant localized air quality impact to the surrounding area. Therefore, no new or more severe significant impacts to air quality would
occur.

Comment Response 5-83
Impacts related to greenhouse gas emissions associated with implementation of the Project are described and evaluated in Section 4.4, Climate Change, of the Draft SEIR. As in stated in Section 4.4.3.3, the modified parking configuration would require less construction equipment and a shorter construction duration than originally assumed in the 2013 FEIR. In addition, the Project Modifications would result in fewer relocations of facilities that would have been required under the location approved in the SEIR 2. Therefore, the short-term GHG emissions impacts of the Project Modifications would be no greater than those identified by the 2013 FEIR and subsequent environmental actions. As described in Section 4.4.3.4, long-term operation of the Project, with implementation of the proposed Project Modifications would continue to result in substantial VMT savings of 370,805 per day for the region and 40,074 per day for the Study Area. Therefore, the Project, with the Project Modifications, would continue to reduce GHG
emissions and result in a net reduction in GHG emissions. Long-term impacts of the Project Modifications would be no greater than those identified by the 2013 FEIR and subsequent
environmental actions, and no new or more severe significant impacts would occur. Therefore,
no new mitigation is required.

Comment Response 5-84

No new noise impacts were identified. Thus, no noise mitigation in the form of noise barriers or
structural retrofitting wore recommended.

The proposed site for the relocated parking lot is already used for Foothill Transit parking,
therefore, It is not anticipated that the Project Modifications would significantly exacerbate the
safety and security concerns as mentioned. As discussed in Section 1.2.3, Crime Prevention
Through Environmental Design (CPTED) features would be incorporated in the Project Modifications to provide a safe, a secure, and comfortable transit system. CPTED principles for

transit stations include open visible platforms, adequate lighting, signage, emergency telephones, a public address system, and security camera monitoring systems. Furthermore, as
discussed in Section 4.13.3.3, incidents of crime would not likely increase during construction for areas adjacent to the Project Modifications. However, incidents of property crime could occur
at construction sites (e.g., theft of construction machinery and materials), although they would be minimized through implementation of standard site security practices by contractors. Further,
implementation of mitigation measures identified in the 2013 FEIR and subsequent environmental actions would reduce potential short-term construction-related security impacts
associated with the Project Modifications to less than significant (SS-2).
Consistent with the 2013 FEIR and subsequent environmental actions, CPTED features would be incorporated in the Project Modifications to provide a safe, secure, and comfortable transit
system. With the incorporation of mitigation measures SS-3 through SS-10, long-term impacts of the Project Modifications would be no greater than those Identified by the 2013 FEIR and
subsequent environmental actions. No new or more severe significant impacts would occur.

As discussed in Section 1.2.3, the Project Modifications would require the removal of large trees within Freedom Park for implementation of the new access road, and trees located within landscaped planters in the existing parking lot. The potential removal of trees within Freedom Park and in landscaped planters within the existing parking lot, may be protected by the City's ordinance when the site is being cleared to construct the proposed surface parking lot. While the Construction Authority is not subject to local ordinances, it has opted to voluntarily comply with local tree protection ordinances to the extent feasible. Trees and landscaped areas that require removal would be relocated/replaced in
accordance with the Construction Authority Tree Removal Policy prepared for the Project. This
would be conducted via implementation of mitigation measures identified in the 2013 FEIR and
subsequent environmental actions that would reduce potential short-term, direct construction-
related impacts associated with the Project Modifications to less than significant (B-2).
In a binding letter of intent signed on June 17, 2021 between the City of San Dimas and
Construction Authority, the City desires that the Project's parking facility be located on the west
portions of parcels (902 and 903) within Freedom Park for the new access road. Acquisition of a
portion of Freedom Park is not anticipated to impact existing park facilities or result in a
significant community facility impact from reduced parkland facilities.
Additionally, Section 4.13.3.4 states security camera monitoring would also be placed near
Freedom Park for additional security,
Comment Response 5-87
As discussed in Section 4.11.3.4, the proposed location for the San Dimas parking facility is currently used as a Foothill Transit Park & Ride facility, therefore no change in land use is

planned. Additionally, the area planned for the new roadway access is currently a vegetated area that contains no park facilities or amenities. Landscaping and a sitting a wall or fence would be provided to Freedom Park as part of the Project Modifications, which would be consistent with
exiting land uses. Furthermore, building a parking facility adjacent to the existing Project ROW is consistent with the San Dimas General Plan. The Project Modifications would be constructed
on the existing parking lot and the western portion of Freedom Park which is zoned as "Creative
Growth", as compared to the previously approved site which consists of industrial land use. The Project Modifications would be consistent with existing and planned land uses and development of the reconfigured parking facility would not prevent future re-development that could include additional features permitted in the Creative Growth zoning designation.
As discussed in Section 4.15.5, the Project Modifications would not introduce the potential for
new induced growth beyond that already identified for the Project in the 2013 FEIR and
subsequent environmental actions. The parking facility relocation and reconfiguration represents
minor design refinements that would not modify the already identified transit service improvements. The reconfigurations are not expected to introduce any changes to the already analyzed and approved evaluation of growth-inducing impacts provided in the approved 2013
FEIR and subsequent environmental actions. The Project Modifications do not include the
development of employment-generating uses that might otherwise provide direct or indirect growth-inducing impacts. As described in the 2013 FEIR and subsequent environmental
actions, the Project Modifications are not anticipated to attract growth directly or indirectly beyond that already envisioned in SCAG's 2012-2035 RTP/SCS. The corridor cities' land use
plans recognize and account for the approved 2013 FEIR and subsequent environmental
actions, and any future new development would be consistent with each city's land use plans
and regulations. No new or increased significant impacts would occur.

in accordance with CEQA Guidelines and SB 743, CEQA does not qualify parking as an environmental impact. Furthermore, purchase of the current Foothill Transit Park & Ride was
completed via agreement with Metro in line with Prop A and Prop C local return guidelines, in
which the parking facility is intended primarily for use as a transit commuter park & ride. The &
guidelines stipulate that the lot could be open for general parking during non-transit use time,
e.g., evenings and weekends, provided that transit user demands are not adversely impacted.
All revenues, (for example, parking, advertising or related revenue) generated during the non- transit use time must be returned to the Jurisdictions' LR Account in the same proportion as the original LR investment in the facility. Thus, no right exists for use of the parking lot for anything that infringes on transit user demands, particularly during normal commute times.
The Construction Authority is responsible for developing a PMP to address the issues related to
spillover parking. Additionally, the City will be compensated for the Parking lot by the Authority and these funds are required to be used for a transportation use. Therefore, the City has the
potential opportunity to use the acquisition funds for establishing a new parking facllity for use by business patrons in downtown San Dimas.

As described in Section 1.2.3, the existing parking lot on the proposed site would be redeveloped to accommodate the same number of parking spaces as identified for the approved parking location in San Dimas. The total number of parking spaces would be approximately 289, which would remain consistent with the approved Project. As such, additional parking spaces would be provided for transit riders. Additionally, the analysis of potential economic impacts is not required per CEQA Guidelines. Sites proposed to be developed for parking facilities have been evaluated in accordance with all CEQA standard requirements and protocols and significant impacts are not anticipated as discussed throughout the Draft SEIR.

A binding letter of intent between the Construction Authority and City of San Dimas was approved on June 17, 2021 stating the City does not desire the Project's parking facility to displace the City Yard Parcel and desires instead that the Project's parking facility be located on
property owned by the City and identifled as Los Angeles County. The Authority is willing to
pursue relocating the Project's parking facility onto the New Parcels, subject to obtaining applicable environmental approvals and other satisfactory terms and conditions. Additionally,
the Construction Authority also commits to work with the City and Foothill Transit, the current
user of the largest portion of the New Parcels, to a implement a reasonable transition plan which
will further multimodal transportation in the region. According to Proposition A and C Local Return Guidellnes (2007 Edition), the Project Modifications would be eligible for Proposition C funding under Project Code 110 (Fixed Route Service): service enhancements related to bus/rail interface, and Project Code 290 (Park and Ride Lots): projects must be coordinated with
Metro and appropriate affected transit operator(s). Economic effects related to a reduction of
Proposition C funds for the City of San Dimas are beyond the scope of CEQA assessment.

Subject: Comments on Final Supplemental EIR 3 (FSEIR3) Metro Gold Line Foothill Extension Phase 2B - Evaluating Relocation of the San Dimas Parking Facility

Dear Ms. Buch:

The City of San Dimas ("City") is in receipt of Metro's Foothill Gold Line Supplemental EIR 3 - Response to City Comments dated July 13, 2022. The City appreciates the response; however, the City continues to have major concerns with the relocation of the parking facility from the City Yard to the proposed Park and Ride locations, as several of the potential impacts raised by the City were not adequately addressed. These concerns have been raised in previous letters submitted to Metro Gold Line Foothill Extension Construction Authority (the "Authority") on November 17, 2021 and on April 1, 2022. Please see below for outstanding concerns.
The City has been proceeding in good faith with the Authority on this proposed location which would result in savings and efficiencies for the Authority as well as alleviate significant concern with the Walnut Avenue site. While it may be the Authority's intent to consider the evaluation and mitigations requested by the City in any subsequent action or property negotiation, until this point, the City has not received affirmative agreement on its communications of November 17, 2021 and April 1, 2022. This concerns the City as it is not in keeping with the good faith entered into when this location was initially contemplated.
The Authority can address most of the items identified by the City, can consider and accommodate the impact of removing the existing 175 parking spaces in the existing Park and Ride, and ensuring that the interests in protecting the surrounding neighborhood and businesses has primacy in the Authority and City approach to facilitating a Metro Station in San Dimas. Such is
a mutual interest as this proposed location avoids costly and time-delaying action to acquire the multiple private and public properties at the Walnut site, removes the necessity and cost for

demolishing multiple structures, and most importantly, demonstrates the good faith intended when this location was initially considered.

The City requests the Authority Board delay the certification action, direct Authority staff to work with the City to address the appropriate mitigations for this project, and to continue the good faith efforts undertaken by the Authority and City. Absent working together on this mutually beneficial approach, the City would be left with only adversarial approaches to protect its rights and interests in this process.

General

Several of the responses to comments reference revised language in sections of the Draft SEIR
3 and additional analysis to address the comments. However, these additional documents were not made available to the City when the Responses to Comments to the Draft SEIR 3 were provided by the Authority on July 14, 2022. Further, when accessing the Foothill Gold Line official website, as late as July 21, 2022 at approximately 8:00 AM (see attached), the Final SEIR 3 and 3 associated documents were not available. The City was notified of the availability of the 2022 Final SEIR 3 by the Authority on July 21, 2022 at 2:53 PM, and that the Authority will be considering certification of the Final SEIR 3 and approval of the Project Modifications on July 27, 2022. The additional analyses and revisions to the Draft SEIR are a critical component of the responses to comments. To receive this information less than four business days before its consideration by the Authority is not adequate time for the City to thoroughly review. As evidenced in the City's comment letter regarding the Notice of Preparation of the Draft SEIR 3 dated November 17, 2021 and the City's comment letter regarding the Draft SEIR3 on April 1, 2022, the City has raised significant concerns about the relocation of the parking facilities from the City Yard to the proposed Park & Ride location on the City and its community which needed to be fully considered, analyzed, and addressed.

The Final SEIR 3 states that a letter of intent between the Authority and City was approved on June 17, 2021. Our understanding is that the intent of the letter was to explore the feasibility of relocating the project's parking facility to the City owned Park and Ride instead of the City Yard parcel as designated. While the Final SEIR3 tries to find a workable solution to mitigate the traffic impact to surrounding community, it fails to adequately address several areas including loss of existing parking.

Relative to the loss of parking, the City has significant concerns regarding the reduction in the number of parking spaces in the relocated parking facility. The Authority states that the existing parking would be redeveloped to accommodate the same number of parking spaces, i.e., a total a number of 289 parking spaces for LRT commuters. however the Final SEIR3 fails to adequately address the loss or replacement of the existing 175 parking spaces currently available to bus commuters, local businesses, community, and visitors. This permanent loss of existing parking is quite detrimental to the community, especially the downtown area.

The significance of the relocation and its perpetual impact to the adjoining residential neighborhood, to businesses and their patrons - as well as to the community at large - would be
very adverse and negatively impact the City's downtown and the surrounding area.

Response to Gold Line's Comment 5-3

New text provided in the Final SEIR 3 Project Description describes the new access road as including two-lanes, one in each direction, to allow vehicles to turn right into the parking facility from Commercial Street and left or right when exiting onto Commercial Street. Will vehicles
eastbound on Commercial Street be prohibited from making a left turn into the parking facility? If not, the Project Description seems to deliberately omit the fact that vehicles can turn left from Commercial Street into the parking facility (essentially driving through the residential neighborhood to access the parking lot).

The new text also states the Construction Authority "anticipates" prohibition of right turns from the parking lot westbound onto the alleyway via signage a and a bulb out on the curb. What would be the circumstances where this would not be prohibited? The alley provides access to the garages of residences fronting onto Commercial Street and parking lot patrons potentially accessing the alleyway would increase the number of vehicles in the alleyway and the potential for vehicle conflicts; this is a significant safety concern.

Response to Gold Line's Comment 5-5

First/last mile plan around the station IS quite essential for improving access to and from the station for a wider breadth of people which ultimately leads to better catchment for transit ridership. The availability of a pedestrian connection to the station from Walnut Avenue is
invaluable to the community residing in this part of the City. With a wider right-of-way (100 feet), the Authority should consider constructing a pathway within the northerly or southerly right-of-way as part of the project. This will provide a direct connection to the station for residents of all ages and abilities from this part of town.

Response to Gold Line's Comment 5-7

The City may have engaged with a developer to utilize Parcels 8390-021-915 and 8390-021-916
as part of possible development; however, access rights for any vehicle can be reserved for
access to the Authority's 50 feet wide surplus right-of-way between Monte Vista Avenue and Cataract Avenue. Reserving access rights thru these parcels still does not negate what iS indicated by the letter of intent between the Authority and the City to secure all CEQA approval necessary for use of the parcels. Further, the Authority's response fails to recognize that in the City's June 8, 2021 action taken to approve the Letter of Intent included the two parcels specified and for which were intended to be considered in mitigating the impacts of this proposed project. The City's developer had agreed to the City negotiating with the Authority for use of these parcels, and the City retains full control to remove these properties when determined beneficial to alleviate impacts of the proposed project on the surrounding neighborhoods. To remove these two parcels from consideration and environmental analysis when included in the Letter of Intent would be a material deficiency in the analysis, implementation of the Letter of Intent, and most importantly, removes a potential option to mitigate impacts to the neighborhood which were fundamental to the City's intent with this proposed location.

Response to Gold Line's Comment 5-9 and 5-10

The City has expressed significant concerns regarding the reduction in the number of parking spaces in the relocated parking facility. Comment 5-10 states that the existing parking would be
redeveloped to accommodate the same number of parking spaces; i.e., a total number of 289
parking spaces for LRT commuters. How does the Authority plan to replace the loss of the existing 175 parking spaces currently available to bus commuters, local businesses, community and visitors? The loss of existing parking is quite detrimental to the community.
With good faith and in a spirit of cooperation, the Authority, must recognize this loss and work with the City to construct a new parking lot potentially within its surplus 50-foot right-of-way to mitigate and reduce the parking impact. Availability of access rights (from city parcels 8390 -021- 915 and 8390-021-916) and connectivity and conversion of the surplus right-of-way to parking and would replace loss of some parking and provide merchants and visitors connectivity to and from downtown.

Response to Gold Line's Comment 5-12

The Gold Line is operational 7 days a week from approximately 4:00 am to just past midnight. Based on the LRT's stated schedule, and relocation of the Gold Line Station's proposed parking with its dedicated 289 parking spaces for LRT commuters, when is the shared parking available for the general public?

It's paramount and vital that provision be made to construct/provide parking as part of project modification now where possible rather than responding with comments like "City will be compensated for the parking lot by the Authority." Where is the spirit of cooperation and mutually
working together to solve problems and permanent impacts caused by the displacement of 175 parking in the residential neighborhood, businesses, and community at large?

Response to Gold Line's Comment 5-13

It's inconceivable to keep stating that in accordance with SB 743, CEQA does not qualify parking
in an environmental impact study. The City does understand and asserts that during
reconstruction of the Park and Ride, circulation and parking will be temporarily impacted. However, this does not address the long-term impact from the loss of 175 parking spaces dedicated to the bus commuters, merchants, residents, and visitors. This loss of parking is not
acceptable to the community and the City.

July 26, 2022

Response to Gold Line's Comment 5-14

The Authority states that "the traffic analysis results indicate that LOS on San Dimas Avenue will
be acceptable which indicates that drivers will reasonably be expected to use San Dimas Avenue (and major crossing streets like Bonita Avenue and Arrow Highway) without cutting through neighborhood streets. Therefore, additional analysis on side streets is not deemed necessary."
The City strongly disagrees with this assessment and findings. The City has asserted in both their response to the NOP of the draft SEIR dated November 17, 2021, and their comments to the Draft SEIR (3) dated April 1st 2022, that they are committed to retaining to restrict any commuter traffic from entering or exiting at Railway Street/Monte Vista Avenue/Park and Ride but allowing access only for emergency vehicles or for use in the event of emergency.
Based on the statement "without cutting through neighborhood streets", then Monte Vista Avenue access should be closed since the only way to the access is to go through the neighborhood.

For example, in order to mitigate traffic impacts prior to the closure of Monte Vista Avenue at the
railroad crossing, traffic exiting the Park and Ride at Monte Vista Avenue was channelized by means of a concrete median island to head north (turn right) toward Bonita Avenue. The channelization permanently prevented traffic from either entering or exiting at Railway Street. It's critical to understand that this permanent closure will substantially impact the traffic on Railway Street. In reality, all traffic coming from the west and south sides of the City, and from the SR-57 Freeway exiting at Covina Boulevard and continuing north on Cataract Avenue, will turn right onto Railway Street to enter the parking lot.

For the intersection of San Dimas Avenue/Commercial Street, the LOS analysis shows a
favorable LOS A with ample capacity. Therefore, the traffic flows and impacts should be reassessed to have all traffic enter the relocated Park and Ride facility only via the new San Dimas Avenue/Commercial Street driveway through Freedom Park.

Response to Gold Line's Comment 5-15

The queuing analysis that we have reviewed only shows queuing for the unsignalized intersections. Please provide the analysis showing the queuing for all locations.
The Authority states that 95% of the queues for all approaches to the intersection are expected
to be accommodated within the existing available storage; therefore, the vehicle queue at the San Dimas Avenue/Commercial Street intersection is not anticipated to cause potential design
hazards. The City strongly disagrees with this assessment, especially when considering that all traffic entering and exiting the Park and Ride will be via the San Dimas Avenue/Commercial Street
driveway through Freedom Park rather than from Monte Vista Avenue. The City also has concerns
that the eastbound queue will block the ingress/egress of the residential site on the southwest corner of the intersection. The City recommends two lanes eastbound (one shared thru/left turn lane and one right turn lane) on Commercial Street along with a KEEP CLEAR pavement legend and signage to prevent any queue from blocking access to the residential site.

The City requests that the Authority reevaluate and re-model the traffic analysis for the delay,
queuing and available storage on San Dimas Avenue and Commercial Street.

Response to Gold Line's Comment 5-16

Please clarify the statement that the Authority will work with the City to identify and fund traffic controls on Commercial Street and Monte Vista Avenue. Is it warranted in order to reduce
potential vehicle, pedestrian, and bicycle conflicts? How would you justify a possible unwarranted
traffic signal within this short block of the residential neighborhood?

Response to Gold Line's Comment 5-17

The comment states that this land could be developed to include a shared subterranean parking facility incorporated into a TOD. a Why can't this project accommodate a dedicated subterranean
parking for the City to address the loss of 175 parking spaces as a result of relocated parking for Metro Gold Line LRT station? The construction of dedicated subterranean parking would resolve
all long-term environmental issues related to parking, circulation, and neighborhood parking
overflows.

Response to Gold Line's Comments 5-13, 5-18, 5-20, 5-21

Although CEQA does not consider the adequacy of parking or potential impacts on parking, CEQA does require a review of potential secondary effects on the physical environment. As noted. construction activities, including the removal of parking spaces, will reduce the number of available Park & Ride spaces. This will result in potential impacts on the circulation system as vehicles would be forced to drive through the residential neighborhoods to find parking on adjacent residential streets, in proximity to downtown. The responses state "Additional
consolidated information related to the analysis of secondary effects is provided in Appendix A Attachment C of the Final SEIR 3". However, this additional information does not address this issue. This response does not address the potential secondary effects on the physical environment, namely the impacts on adjacent residential neighborhoods associated with the loss of parking spaces during construction activities. Vehicles who would have previously used the Park & Ride lot will now be rerouted to the adjacent residential neighborhoods to find parking, increasing traffic within these neighborhoods and potential conflicts with pedestrians. The
response references the Parking Management Plans (PMPs), which would focus on parking once operational, but it does not address the immediate impacts.

Response to Gold Line's Comment 5-22 to 5-24

Current Gold Line parking demand at existing stations is often at capacity during the weekday early morning hours. It is expected that spillover parking will occur and impact the adjacent residential community. The Parking Management Plan (PMP) should be addressed within the traffic analysis.

Response to Gold Line's Comment 5-26

The assessment that the effect of traffic on residential roadways surrounding the parking facility was based on the location of the Park and Ride facility on San Dimas Avenue with access points on Monte Vista Avenue and Commercial Street near San Dimas Avenue. To state that it is a standard traffic engineering premise that drivers will use a higher classification street like San Dimas Avenue is nonsensical, especially when considering that a free parking lot is the destination point for commuters coming from all directions.
It's also vital to understand that the permanent closure to traffic turning north from the parking lot will substantially impact traffic on Railway Street. In fact, all traffic coming from the west and south sides of City, and the SR-57 Freeway exiting at Covina Boulevard and continuing north on Cataract Avenue, will likely turn right onto Railway Street to enter the parking lot. To mitigate this traffic impact in the neighborhood prior to closure, traffic exiting the Park and Ride at Monte Vista Avenue was channelized by means of a concrete median island to go north (turn right) toward Bonita Avenue. The channelization permanently prevented traffic from entering or exiting on Railway Street.

As mentioned in both the response to NOP of draft SEIR dated November 17, 2021, and the comments to Draft SEIR3 dated April 1, 2022, the City is committed to retaining and restricting
any commuter traffic from entering or exiting at Railway Street/Monte Vista Avenue/Park and
Ride. The traffic flows and impact should be reassessed to prevent traffic from entering or exiting
through Railway by installing traffic mitigation such as a cul-de-sac.

Response to Gold Line's Comment 5-29

The response states the Construction Authority is proposing enhancements to bus stop facilities, including expanding and rebuilding the bus shelters at the two bus stops on Bonita Avenue, just east of San Dimas Avenue. It then contradicts this statement, saying "improvements to bus stops
are not included as part of the Project Modifications and therefore not discussed in the SEIR".
Where are these improvements discussed? CEQA Guidelines define a project under CEQA as "the whole of the action" that may result either directly or indirectly in physical changes to the environment. The Project Modifications assessed in the Draft SEIR 3 eliminates buses in the
parking lot, thereby resulting in the need to provide alternative locations for buses. To account for this change associated with the Project Modifications, the Authority seems to be proposing enhancements to bus stop facilities. These improvements need to be considered as part of the Draft SEIR 3, as they are directly related to the Project Modifications and elimination of buses in the station parking lot, as had been previously considered and analyzed in approved SEIR 2. Any impact on circulation or creation of delays in the intersection at Bonita/San Dimas Ave needs to
be analyzed to determine the nature and extent of the enhancements.

The City recognizes that the bus drop off cannot be accommodated on site due to the limitation of the Park and Ride lot size which was redesigned to accommodate 289 parking spaces. Instead

of enhancing the existing bus stop to accommodate the future transit service, the Authority should
provide an alternate off street location for a bus stop and associated parking. A bus stop and parking lot provides for the cross connection with other lines at LRT and allows for possible staging/waiting for buses.
Secondly, the addition of enhanced bus stops/parking on Bonita Avenue east of San Dimas Avenue will likely compound and increase the potential backup on Bonita Avenue resulting in additional delays. This is in addition to any backup and delays caused by the freight train crossing Cataract Avenue. In fact, to mitigate and possibly overcome delays caused by the freight train, the existing striping for east Bonita Avenue at San Dimas Avenue was changed from left/thru/right turn to left/thru/thru lanes. Therefore. additional bus stop/parking will result in increased delays.
In addition, northbound right-turn traffic will be delayed/restricted when buses are parked or staging at the southeast corner of the intersection. Similarly, buses staged on the northwest corner of Bonita Avenue/San Dimas Avenue will also cause delays and impact traffic flows. Further, any traffic flow delays on northbound San Dimas Avenue will impact the crossing gate and further exacerbate the traffic flow and congestion at the most critical area of the crossing.
To minimize the impact of additional traffic delays and congestion at the intersection of San Dimas and Bonita Avenue, the City is not supportive or in agreement with the Authority's proposal that would result in an increase in bus frequency at the Bonita/San Dimas Ave bus stops. Additionally, 3 while SEIR 3 mentions modifications to these bus stops, no details were provided.

Response to Gold Line's Comment 5-30

Again, this response states the Construction Authority is proposing enhancements to bus stop facilities; however, proposed improvements, specifically to bus stops on Bonita Avenue, are not analyzed as part of the Draft SEIR 3.

Response to Gold Line's Comment 5-32

With the Authority affirming its commitment to contribute funding if a signal is warranted at the San Dimas Avenue/Second Street intersection, how will the Authority fund or have a mechanism to fund the costs when it's disbanded after completion of Phase 2B to Pomona?
Secondly, with City's concern about additional delay being experienced, particularly from southbound San Dimas Avenue north of Bonita Avenue, will that likely initiate driver behavior to take shortcuts through the residential streets which are not designed for cut-through traffic in order to avoid delays at Bonita Avenue? It would It be prudent to a create a baseline by assessing traffic flows through the neighborhoods upon completing improvements at Bonita Avenue. This baseline in traffic counts and traffic flows will aid in addressing possible cut-through traffic issues in the
future. as well as aiding with the determination and assessment of a future signal at San Dimas Avenue and Second Street.

As mentioned previously, in order to reduce and mitigate any traffic exiting on Monte Vista Avenue, traffic was channelized to go north only, thereby restricting any traffic entering or exiting
on Railway Street or Monte Vista Avenue. Since the station will become a destination for a wide
range of commuters using LRT, it's highly likely that traffic from the west and south sides of the City will use Cataract Avenue and then Railway Street to enter and exit the Park and Ride. Therefore, traffic flows and impact should be reassessed and mitigation measures must be developed to prevent traffic from using Railway to enter the station parking lot.

Response to Gold Line's Comment 5-34

See response to Comment 5-16.

Response to Gold Line's Comment 5-35

See response to Comments 5-26 and 5-33.

For the record, Monte Vista Avenue was to be an access point for the existing Park and Ride facility; however, as previously stated, current traffic exiting the Park and Ride is channeled to go north or turn right on Monte Vista Avenue to Bonita Avenue and the City wants to retain this restriction. With an entrance through Monte Vista Avenue at Railway traffic will now enter and exit the new LRT parking lot on Railway Street, Cataract Avenue, and Monte Vista Avenue. This will
severely impact the quiet neighborhood on a permanent and long-term basis. The City requests
that the Authority reassess the traffic as requested and mitigate impacts as necessary.

The City is pleased that the Authority will work to provide signs, design, and construct features

measures in order to improve parking access for transit patrons which will reduce overflow
impacts and improve the local resident's daily quality of life.

Response to Gold Line's Comment 5-46

With the proposed changes to the Park and Ride, more traffic will enter Cataract Avenue from the south and west sides of the City; however, Cataract Avenue is not a major street and it runs through a quiet, tree-lined, and older established neighborhood. Hence the need to restrict access to the LRT parking from Monte Vista Avenue. See response to comment 5-26.

Response to Gold Line's Comments 5-50, 5-51, 5-52, 5-53, 5-56, 5-87

This response does not fully address the comment. The responses discuss aesthetic impacts associated with construction activities. However, the Draft SEIR 3 analysis does not take into consideration the long-term impacts associated with removal of a portion of Freedom Park and introduction of the new access road. Although the area planned for the new roadway area does not contain park amenities, it does provide open green space with landscaping and mature trees that serve as passive park space for the community and provides visual relief from the surrounding urban environment. Residential properties south of Commercial Street directly face Freedom Park
and experience the landscaping, greenspace and large mature trees. Views of this open green space would be substantially altered with the Project Modifications. Replacement of a portion a of the park with an improved access roadway is not consistent with the existing use - a park and
greenspace. The response mischaracterizes the park and its benefits to the surrounding community and does not adequately account for and analyze the loss of passive park space within the community.

Similarly, the response does not address the direct impact associated with vehicle headlights
exiting the driveway and illuminating the windows of the residences directly to the south of the driveway, that front onto Commercial Street. The response states the lighting will be buffered by proposed wall/fence and landscaping and existing trees and vegetation that border Freedom Park. However, none of these will occur at the driveway access and Commercial Street. The multi- family residential uses fronting Commercial Street a are located within a residential portion of the Downtown area and are not located along a roadway with extensive businesses or traffic. Again, this response mischaracterizes the existing environmental setting specific to this area and in
relation to the proposed access road. Headlights from vehicles accessing the current Park & Ride
lot and businesses in the Downtown do not, under existing conditions, shine directly into the residential properties directly south of Commercial Street across from Freedom Park. This would be a condition directly resulting from the proposed Project Modifications. Lights will continually shine into the windows of the residences directly across Commercial Street in the evening hours from parking patrons exiting the site at this location. This impact has not been adequately addressed in the Draft SEIR 3 or the responses to comments.

Response to Gold Line's Comment 5-55

The current Park and Ride is surrounded by mature trees and dense landscaping around the perimeter which reduces the impact of headlights shining into residents' homes during the evenings. Currently, the operation of the existing bus lines generally ends about 6:00 pm;

thereafter, the parking lot iS quiet and virtually empty. Because the LRT will be operational from 4:00 am to past midnight 7 days a week, the impact of headlights to the residents will be more severe and prolonged. Additional mitigations are be needed to block the impact of the lights.

Response to Gold Line's Comment 5-64

It's assuring to know that the Park and Ride facility will be designed to Metro Rail Design criteria and that the Authority will comply with local landscape codes to the extent practicable. Similarly, on good faith and as a collaborative City partner, why doesn't the Authority work with the City's parking standards and codes for parking within the town core to the extent practicable?

Response to Gold Line's Comment 5-70

This Comment states that the Authority will prepare a Parking Management Plan (PMP). What is the status of it? How does the plan address or mitigate parking issues? The City needs to see this plan before it can comment on this matter!

Response to Gold Line's Comment 5-71

The statement that replacement of bus service with LRT service is considered a transit
enhancement is self-serving. On the contrary, bus service is an alternate mode of transportation which is available to both the community and commuters.

Response to Gold Line's Comment 5-73

See response comment 5-16

Response to Gold Line's Comment 5-77

The Authority adamantly states that it is not subject to local ordinances, yet it has opted to voluntarily comply with local tree protection to the extent possible. Similarly, in good faith, working in partnership with the City during the construction of the much-needed LRT and subsequent infrastructure improvements is critical.

The Authority should also consider complying with City's code for parking design standards as
trees are essential for the parking lots. Trees provide shade and transpiration for lower
temperatures, better air quality, improved water quality, slows deterioration of parking lot
pavement and mitigate urban heat islands. The City standards for median islands and perimeter
landscaping buffers would make the new parking lot more attractive and an asset to all parties. The Authority is encouraged to be more progressive and adopt the City requirements in the design
of the new Park and Ride.

The Final SEIR3 has failed to address the potential impacts related to the relocation of the parking
facility from the City Yard to the proposed Park and Ride parking, as previously raised in the City's comment letters dated April 1, 2022, and November 17, 2021. The City understands that while CEQA does not consider parking or potential impacts on parking, CEQA does require a thorough review of potential secondary effects that result from the project, which the Final SEIR3 has

Subject: Comments on Draft Supplemental EIR (DSEIR) Metro Gold Line Extension Phase 2B - Evaluating Relocation of the San Dimas Parking Facility

Dear Ms. Buch:

Please allow this letter to serve as the City of San Dimas' comments on the above-referenced Draft Supplemental Environmental Impact Report 3 ("Draft SEIR 3") for the relocation of the San Dimas parking facility. This letter follows a letter previously submitted to Metro Gold Line Foothill Extension Construction Authority (the "Authority") on November 17, 2021 regarding the Notice of Preparation of the Draft SEIR 3, which raised significant concerns about the relocation of the parking facility from the City Yard to the proposed Park and Ride location on the City and its
community.

Despite our efforts to work with Metro Gold Line to address the impacts on the City and the surrounding community, the Draft SEIR 3 does not adequately address our concerns, as detailed below.

Project Description
1. The Draft SEIR 3 does not accurately describe the proposed Project Modifications. The Project Description states the "Project Modifications also include roadway improvements to accommodate vehicles accessing the parking facility along Commercial street". However, no specific information regarding these improvements is provided. Further, there is no mention of the modifications to Freedom Park that are proposed. The Project Modifications would result in portion of the existing Freedom Park site to be improved with an access road. Additionally, the Kiss and Ride Drop Area appears to further encroach into Freedom Park, which is not disclosed in the Project Description. Additionally, throughout the Draft SEIR 3, reference is made only to the existing Park & Ride lot when discussing the Project Modifications. As a result, it is unclear if the Draft 3 SEIR 3 adequately assesses impacts as they relate to the proposed improvements and

the conversion of a portion of Freedom Park to an access road.
2. Draft SEIR 3, Page 3-20, Traffic Circulation, incorrectly states the primary entrance for Park & Ride and Kiss & Ride access will shift from Walnut Avenue to San Dimas Avenue.
Entrances to the parking lot relocation are located on Commercial Street and Monte Vista Avenue which are residential streets.

3. Draft SEIR 3, Page 4, Project Modifications, incorrectly states that "Access will occur only from the western side (San Dimas Avenue) of the station platform. No access to the San Dimas station will be provided from the eastern (Walnut Avenue) side of the platform as a result of the station parking facility". Pedestrian access from Walnut Avenue was not directly connected to the Park and Ride located at the Maintenance Yard. In fact, the only direct access to the station for Park and Ride patrons under that proposal design layout was via a subterranean pedestrian tunnel (under the Metro Line track) that connected directly to the center platform at the station.
While the project modification does not incorporate First/Last Mile Plan around the relocated station parking, the City feels strongly that the Authority should reinstate the pedestrian connection to the station from Walnut Avenue as originally planned because the previous layout was independent of the station parking. In addition, this connectivity to Walnut Avenue is within the Authority's construction work areas and should be constructed as part of the project because it provides access for residents living on the east side of the station.

4. Figure 1-3 fails to identify the correct parking lot footprint as it does not depict the location of the proposed access road or exit for the Kiss and Ride Area. In reviewing an EIR, a paramount consideration is the right of the public to be informed in a manner that enables it to intelligently weigh the environmental consequences of any contemplated action and have an appropriate voice in the formulation of any decision. An accurate, stable and finite
project description is required for an informative and legally sufficient EIR. Because of the importance of the project description, when the project changes significantly, the failure to prepare a subsequent or supplemental EIR deprives the public, who relied on the EIR, of
information and meaningful participation. (City of San Jose v. Great Oaks Water Co. (1987) 192 Cal.App.3d 1005, 1017.) The Draft SEIR 3 fails to 3 meet these requirements.
In addition, the Draft SEIR 3 fails to include in its review the two parcels located at the intersection of Bonita and Cataract, Assessor Parcel Numbers 8390-021-915 and 916. As
indicated by the Letter of Intent between the Authority and the City, these parcels are included in the new parcels to be acquired and likewise subject to the requirement that the Authority secure all CEQA approvals necessary for the use of the parcels. The requirements of CEQA cannot be avoided by piecemeal review, which results from a chopping a large project into many little ones, which cumulatively may have substantial impact and perhaps disastrous consequences. (Rio Vista Farm Bureau Center v. County of Solano (1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 351, 370; Environmental Prot. Info. Ctr. v. Cal. Dept. of Forestry and Fire Prot. (2008) 44 Cal. 4th 459, 503.)

Moreover, failure to purchase and utilize those two parcels for station parking/access is a violation of the Letter of Intent, as the Letter of Intent requires the parties to "work together in good faith toward execution of a mutually agreeable purchase and sale agreement" for those two parcels.

By failing to include the two parcels on Bonita and Cataract, the Authority is piecemealing its environmental review of the proposed modification without the legally required environmental review of the project's impacts. An inaccurate or incomplete project description undermines CEQA's purposes because it thwarts a full analysis of project impacts, thus minimizing the project's effects. (City of Santee V. County of San Diego (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 1438, 1454; San Joaquin Raptor Rescue Center V. County of Merced (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 645, 656.) Thus, when an EIR gives "conflicting signals to decision-makers and the public about the nature and scope of the activity being proposed," the courts have found it "fundamentally inadequate and misleading." (San Joaquin Raptor Rescue Center, 149 Cal.App.4th at 655-56.) The Draft SEIR 3 has the type of truncated project review that CEQA prohibits and creates uncertainty about the project's impacts.

Transportation and Parking
In our prior letter, we expressed our significant concern regarding the reduction in the number of parking spaces in the proposed relocated parking facility, as well as concerns regarding pedestrian routes and the impact on traffic in the residential neighborhoods in the vicinity of the proposed parking facility. The Draft SEIR 3 fails to adequately analyze and mitigate these concerns.

Meaningful analysis of impacts effectuates one of CEQA's fundamental purposes: To "inform the public and responsible officials of the environmental consequences of their decisions before they are made." (Laurel Heights Improvement Ass'n v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal. (1993) 6 Cal.4th 1112, 1123.) To accomplish this purpose, an EIR must contain facts and analysis, not just an agency's bare conclusions. (Citizens of Goleta Valley V. Bd. of Supers. (1990) 52 Cal. 3d 553, 568.) An EIR's conclusions must be supported by substantial evidence. (Laurel Heights Improvement Ass'n, 47 Cal.3d at 409.) The Draft SEIR 3 is vague and lacks supporting documentation to adequately assess Transportation impacts. The items detailed in the City's response below address concerns, but the City cannot fully evaluate the Draft SEIR 3 without additional studies and information that was not provided.

5 The Draft SEIR 3, under Section 3.2.7, Long Term Parking Impact, indicates that no parking impact will result from the station parking relocation. On the contrary, relocating the Gold Line Station's proposed 289 parking spaces to the existing Park and Ride location would result in the loss of an additional 175 valuable parking spaces (existing spaces not being accommodated or accounted for with the Gold Line Parking relocation to the City's Park and Ride) in the heart of San Dimas' historic downtown.
This loss of crucial and irreplaceable parking spaces in the downtown area would not only adversely and negatively affect the downtown businesses, but also impact the community at large. The City hosts various annual parades, car shows, bike races, as well as the
Memorial Day and Veterans Day observance days at Freedom Park. With the immediate loss of this daily available critical parking to the community any time of year, where do these patrons, visitors and attendees park?
The Draft SEIR 3 fails to address the adverse and negative impact on the loss of this critical and daily available parking and its subsequent affect to the immediate neighborhood, businesses, community, and community at large.

As previously mentioned, the Draft SEIR 3 acknowledges that the existing Park & Ride facility with 175 parking spaces serves as the patron parking for the bus lines, but does not discuss the removal of the parking spaces during construction. Thus, the short-term impacts on the circulation system have not been considered. In addition, the Draft SEIR 3 fails to consider the current use of the parking facility by patrons of the Downtown businesses and the businesses themselves. The Draft SEIR 3 does not adequately analyze the impacts resulting from the loss of these parking spaces, narrowly relying on its use by patrons of Foothill Transit only.
In addition, the Draft SEIR 3 does not adequately address the increased traffic on surrounding residential roadways to access the parking facility, and the Authority's conclusion that drivers will typically use major streets is not substantiated. "To facilitate CEQA's informational role, an EIR must contain facts and analysis, not just the agency's bare conclusions or opinions." (Habitat & Watershed Caretakers v. City of Santa Cruz
(2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 1277, 1303.) An EIR's conclusions must be supported by substantial evidence. (Laurel Heights Improvement Ass'n V. Regents of the Univ. of Cal. (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 409.)
Moreover, there is a potential design hazard related to vehicles queueing at the San Dimas Avenue/Commercial Street traffic signal, which needs to be fully analyzed and addressed. The preparation and function of an EIR is to ensure that government officials who decide to build or approve a project do so with a full understanding of the environmental consequences. Equally important, the public is assured those consequences have been taken into account. (Vineyard Area Citizens for Responsible Growth, Inc. v. City of Rancho Cordova (2007) 40 Cal.4th 412, 449; Citizens Against Airport Pollution v. City of San Jose, supra, 227 Cal.App.4th at 796.)

Additionally, traffic delays with the proposed relocation of the parking facility, as well as deficiencies and inaccuracies related to pedestrian access need to be analyzed and mitigated. CEQA requires the Authority to evaluate the project's traffic safety impacts on pedestrians, cyclists, and transit riders. (See City of Maywood v. Los Angeles Unified Sch. Dist. (2012) 208 Cal. App. 4th 362, 392-95 (holding EIR was inadequate because it failed to analyze and mitigate project impacts on pedestrians).)
6. The loss of an approximately 2.25-acre Park and Ride property in the City's downtown would also result in the City losing its potential to develop this land for housing needs or TOD. A development that provides a balance of both community parking and housing provides more vibrancy to the downtown. Quite likely, based on current development proposals, this property may be developed with up to 52 residential units with ample parking available for the community.

7. The Authority states that, based on coordinated internal discussions between them and
Foothill Transit, commuter bus lines 492 and 499 would not operate to downtown Los Angeles once Phase 2B is completed and operational to Pomona.

a. The planned projected completion of Phase 2B is estimated to be mid-2025, plus another 6 months or more for Metro to render the service fully operational (which
is approximately 4 years away). In the meantime, where do patrons of the
community park or get picked up during the construction of the station parking?

Has the Authority made any parking provisions for these commuters during this interim period as part of so-called coordinated arrangement with Foothill Transit? What are the short-term impacts on the circulation system associated with vehicles that currently utilize the San Dimas Park & Ride facility being diverted to a different location within the City?

b. With the Authority stating that Foothill will cease bus lines 492 and 499, does this imply that commuters will now have only one mode of public transportation to Downtown Los Angeles to choose from? With the opening of the I1-10 Freeway express lane projected by end of 2023, the estimated commute time to Los Angeles will be much shorter than Metro's projected time to Downtown Los Angeles. Why will this alternative bus mode of transportation cease and, if so, where do these commuters park during the two-year gap of Phase 2B opening?
In addition, this parking facility is not limited or restricted to patrons of Foothill Transit and is available to rideshare, vanpool, etc., as well as serving as additional parking for the Downtown businesses and patrons. Without replacement of the existing 175 spaces, parking will be constrained, impacting Downtown businesses and adjacent residential neighborhoods. The reduced parking provided for the station is already likely to result in overflow parking onto adjacent residential neighborhoods, as acknowledged by the need for Parking Management Plans (PMPs). The removal of existing parking spaces that would occur with the Project Modifications would exacerbate this impact. The Draft SEIR 3 does not adequately analyze the impacts resulting from the loss of these parking spaces, narrowly relying on its use by patrons of Foothill Transit only.

C. The Authority has stated that an internal coordination or agreement has been concluded with Foothill Transit to cease operation of lines 492 and 499. Has this been discussed with the Foothill Transit Board? Are there any formal approvals in place? Why was the City not involved as part of this discussion? In fact, according to a June 25, 2021 Foothill Transit Board Executive Board Meeting staff report, the report states that the use of the City's Park and Ride for station parking will necessitate Line 499 being realigned to an alternate location for customers who currently utilize Line 499 at the park and ride. No action has or is being considered to cease operations of the lines, but rather, the consideration of the City's Park and Ride for Project parking will impact the location, traffic, and parking impacts for Foothill Transit passengers and as such has not been considered in the Draft SEIR 3. Further, according to the Foothill Transit leadership, Foothill Transit is waiting to see what occurs at the Park and Ride to initiate coordination. Thus, the Draft SEIR 3 does not properly analyze the impacts resulting from changes to lines or worse is premised on faulty assumptions of changes to the lines.
d. The need for parking specifically at the City's Park and Ride is not just driven by the needs of Foothill Transit commuters. As noted, during the lockdown due to the pandemic, Foothill was operating with minimal bus service - possibly due to when a lot of commuters opted to stay and work from home. However, even during those times, the City's Park and Ride was heavily used on a daily basis. The daily patrons parking there are part of car pools, local business customers, employees, as well as transit riders, too. Currently, the Feed and Grain Store uses the Park and Ride
for offloading supplies. This use will be eliminated in the proposed modifications,

with no mention of any mitigation measures.
The heavy daily use of the Park and Ride shows the latent need of parking in the heart of downtown. How does the Authority plan to replace this critically needed parking in the downtown?

Again, the Draft SEIR 3 fails to address the adverse and negative impact from the loss of this critical and daily available parking and its subsequent affect to immediate neighborhood, businesses, community, and the community at large.

In addition to the Park and Ride serving Foothill Transit riders, rideshare, vanpool, as well as serving as additional parking for the Downtown businesses and patrons, it provides parking for employees of the Curative Lab located at 430 S. Cataract Avenue. Employees are then shuttled to their location of employment. The loss of the availability to park at the Park and Ride will create impacts to the surrounding residential neighborhoods. Eliminating the parking for Curative Lab would result in traffic and parking impacts not reasonably contemplated when looking at just the Park & Ride. The Draft SEIR 3 does not address this or analyze the impacts. In addition, the Authority's analysis of parking during construction is deficient, and the loss of daily parking for commuters and patrons has not been adequately analyzed or mitigated. The Authority must also identify and adopt feasible mitigation measures to reduce those impacts, if feasible. (Pub. Res. Code Â§ 21083(b)(2); CEQA Guidelines Â§ 15064(h)(1)).)
As a further example, the negative impact to the housing development located at San Dimas Avenue and Commercial Street has not been analyzed or mitigated. Not only will parking be reduced, but vehicle queueing will become an issue, which was an issue raised with the
Authority in our prior response letter. Consequently, the Authority must consider feasible mitigation measures in a revised and recirculated Draft SEIR 3.

8. The Draft SEIR 3 does not adequately address the increased traffic on surrounding residential roadways in order to access the parking facility. The statement that "typically, drivers would use major streets such as San Dimas Avenue and would choose a more direct route to the station parking facility" is not substantiated. Access to the station parking would occur from residential streets. With the permanent street closure to vehicular traffic on Monte Vista Avenue, vehicles accessing the parking facility from Monte Vista Avenue
have no other option but to travel through residential neighborhoods.

9 The Project Modifications propose a new access road from Commercial Street. This
access road would be located just west of an existing driveway providing access to the residential and live/work development located at the southwest corner of Commercial
Street and San Dimas Avenue. The interaction of vehicles exiting the parking lot and queuing on Commercial Street at the San Dimas Avenue/Commercial Street traffic signal could potentially impede vehicles attempting to turn left from Commercial Street into the existing driveway causing vehicles to queue into the intersection; however, no mitigations are proposed. How will this impact emergency vehicle responses? Currently the businesses and residents park within the Park and Ride or on Commercial Street.
Reference is made to Parking Management Plan; however, it is unclear how the Gold Line Authority will develop the plan, and as it iS a limited life organization, how will the parking plan be managed after the Gold Line Authority is dissolved? This potential design hazard needs to be addressed in the Draft SEIR 3.

10. Draft SEIR 3 Page 3-19 references "controlled parking entrances and exits". What kind of controls will be utilized? Depending upon the types of controls and location, there could be a potential for vehicles to queue onto neighboring residential streets. This potential
needs to be addressed.

11. The approved SEIR 2 incorporates bus drop off and onboarding within the station parking lot. The proposed configuration in the Draft SEIR 3 eliminates buses in the parking lot. This has significant impacts on:

a. The ability to provide cross connection with other bus lines.
b. The potential increase in bus stops on Bonita Avenue creates a potential backup a on Bonita Avenue that may impact the freight crossing at Cataract Ave.
C. Eliminates bus staging which currently occurs in the Park and Ride Lot.

12. No mitigations or improvements were proposed for the Bonita/San Dimas Ave bus stops to accommodate additional ridership.
13. The intersection of San Dimas Avenue and Commercial Street will be severely impacted, including creating traffic back-ups at the northbound left turn lane to access the Park and Ride. This should be further studied and require mitigation measures to prevent northbound vehicles from turning into the Grove Station development to turn around and bypass the back-up created at the northbound left turn lane.

14. 3.1.4 Mitigation Measures and Recommendations - LTR-1 states that the Authority shall cooperate with the City and contribute funding for a new traffic signal at the intersection of San Dimas Avenue at Second Street when warranted.

a. The relocation of the station parking to the City Park and Ride will result in an exponential increase in traffic delays because all the commuters parked at the Park and Ride will cross San Dimas Avenue at the railroad crossing - both during peak AM and PM hours and intermittently during the off-peak hours. On page 3-8 it states that "a traffic evaluation was completed in May 2021 for the proposed east-
west crosswalk just south of the Project ROW... The results of the operation and queueing analysis for the northbound and southbound approaches at San Dimas Avenue indicated that the Project with Project Modifications would not result in a substantial increase in traffic delay, and signal operations for the crosswalk at San Dimas Avenue would result in minimal delays compared to the delays experienced
at the nearby intersections.'

Almost 90% of the commuters will opt to cross at this crosswalk - it's only ingrained human nature to cross at the shortest and closest point. The increase in pedestrian crossing frequency and activities will further compound and add to delays already experienced by drivers when the train is stopping or leaving the station. This additional delay, in particular for southbound San Dimas Avenue north of Bonita Avenue. will initiate driver behavior to take "short cuts" through the residential streets. Neighborhoods were not designed for cut through traffic in order to avoid delays as traffic backs up at Bonita Avenue. Why was the traffic evaluation which
was completed in May 2021 not provided for review?
With the relocation of the station parking lot to the Park and Ride, the Authority

must consider installing a traffic signal as part of the current project now, rather than when fully warranted. Secondly, when it's fully warranted, how does the City collect its contribution? Upon completion of Phase 2B, the Authority is dissolved
and non-existent. Again, how does the City collect the contributions?

b. The Draft SEIR 3 states that additional traffic would be expected on Monte Vista Avenue and Commercial Street to enter and exit the parking lot. Any subsequent
impacts will be addressed by a Parking Management Plan (PMP) - a PMP that states it would prohibit on-street parking for transit patrons and any of the neighborhoods that are impacted by traffic would be addressed by means of the Authority working with City to install traffic calming elements around the parking lot such as speed humps/bumps and signage. This statement completely disregards and ignores the City's initial comments in the NOP to consider various traffic
calming mitigation measures that would mitigate transit patrons traffic flow from the residential neighborhood.
Again, we reemphasize the City's NOP comments recommending various traffic calming measures, which would mitigate the traffic flow of transit patrons in and out of the residential neighborhood as a result of the Gold Line's proposal to relocate station parking to the Park and Ride, which will result in a substantial increase in traffic volume within the existing quiet neighborhood along Cataract Avenue, Railway Street, and Commercial Street. Therefore, to deter and restrict
traffic entering Commercial Street from Cataract Avenue or Railroad Street, and/or turning right onto Commercial Street when exiting from the station parking primary driveway/aisle, it is recommended that the following specific mitigation measures be considered and reviewed for implementation by the Authority:

I. Restrict commuter traffic from entering and exiting at Railway Street/Monte Vista Avenue/Park and Ride and allow access for
emergency vehicles only.

Il. The acquisition of Successor Agency properties on Cataract Avenue and utilization of Metro Gold Line's right-of-way south of the rail lines to create a vehicular bypass to Railway Street and Commercial Street,
thereby potentially reducing traffic impacts on surrounding residential
streets.

IlI. Extend Park and Ride driveway/aisle approximately 4 to 6 feet south 6 of the center line of Commercial Street leaving approximately 12 to 13- foot-wide lane open for eastbound traffic only.

IV. Extend this restricted eastbound lane up to Shirlmar Street by means of landscaped curb extensions with entry and exit allowing for street parking for the two residents on the north side of Commercial, adjacent to the Park and Ride.

V. The eastbound approach of Commercial Street at San Dimas Avenue should be modified to provide two eastbound lanes.

VI. The segment of Commercial Street between Shirlmar Street and the

ATTACHMENT 1

Park and Ride's primary entrance will be restricted to allow eastbound traffic only, thereby also providing emergency and vehicular
connectivity for residents of this neighborhood to downtown and San Dimas Avenue.

VlI. Extension of the primary Park and Ride driveway/aisle allows for smooth flow of traffic in and out of the station parking lot without much
delay.

VIII. Traffic signal timing and intersection improvements at San Dimas Ave/Commercial Street to mitigate impacts to the entrance of the HOA south of Commercial Street/west of San Dimas Ave resulting from queuing associated with the relocated station parking access.

The combination of the extended entrance and curb extension will minimize traffic
from the station's Park and Ride entering into the neighborhood because patrons using the facility will be forced to use the main entrance which will keep the separation of traffic flow to the major arterials and off residential streets as intended.

15. In Section 4.13.3.4 Long - Term Safety Impacts, the Draft SEIR 3 details that the relocation of the station parking has the potential to result in increased safety impacts for motorists, bicyclists, and pedestrians as a result of the additional parking spaces provided, and potential additional vehicular activity associated with station access from the relocated parking facility. It further expounds that the Construction Authority will work with the City of San Dimas to identify and fund traffic and speed control devices, including traffic calming devices such as additional signage, active speed identification signs, speed humps/bumps and other devices to recue potential automobile and pedestrian/bicycle conflicts. However, none of these have been studied or proposed as mitigations. The Draft SEIR 3, in fact, ignores the conclusion of this section and indicates no mitigations are required. As referenced above, CEQA requires the Authority to evaluate a project's traffic safety impacts on pedestrians, cyclists, and transit riders. (See City of Maywood v. Los Angeles Unified Sch. Dist. (2012) 208 Cal. App. 4th 362, 392-95 (holding EIR was inadequate because it failed to analyze and mitigate project impacts on pedestrians).)

16. The realignment of the public alley north of Commercial Street to meet the Park and Ride's
primary drive aisle restricts the eastbound right turn for residents, trash service, other utility
vehicles and fire safety equipment. This layout needs to be redesigned in order to allow access for the residents. Also, these residents would need access rights to use the new
access road.

17. Tables 3-6 and 3-7 show the level of service for the AM and PM peak hours for the following intersections:

San Dimas Avenue/Arrow Highway
Walnut Avenue/Arrow Highway
San Dimas Avenue/Railway Street

With the relocation of the parking to the Park and Ride, motorists coming from the west ends of the City and adjacent cities to the west will travel through and add delays to the intersections of Cataract Avenue/Arrow Highway and Cataract Avenue/Bonita Avenue. The level of service analysis should include these additional two intersections.
18. On page ES-3, the Draft SEIR 3 states that the proposed San Dimas parking facility would also include a Kiss and Ride area to allow for pick-ups and drop-offs. Buses would no longer enter the parking lot. Instead, the bus drop-off for Foothill Transit would now be located at the intersection of Bonita Avenue and San Dimas Avenue. An intersection that
would now be more congested since there are two existing Foothill Transit stops, located at the northeast and southeast of the intersection of Bonita Avenue at San Dimas Avenue
for bus line 492. Where would the bus stop for commuter bus line 499 be located? The existing intersection was modified due to the Gold Line and is already congested, thus the addition of two new bus stops would compound further delays at an intersection that is already experiencing substantial delays. In addition, increased pedestrian crossing on San Dimas Ave south of the tracks will add to the delays at Bonita/San Dimas Ave, potentially backing up eastbound traffic across the freight tracks at Bonita/Cataract Ave.
19. The impacts to Cataract Avenue/Bonita Ave and Cataract Ave/Arrow Highway were not studied. These intersections are closest to the freeways and the entire west side of City. Much of the parking commuters will be approaching from this direction. These intersections will be severely impacted and need to be studied.
20. Where is the traffic study from May 2021 that was referenced in the Draft SEIR 3? Why was this not available for review?

Aesthetics

21. The Draft SEIR 3 Aesthetics discussion identifies eight residences located along the border of Commercial Street and states the fronts of these residences face away from the Project site and views of the Project site from the back are buffered. However, the analysis does not take into consideration the residential property located south of Commercial Street that directly faces Freedom Park and the proposed location of the new access road. Therefore, the aesthetics discussion is deficient, as the analysis only considers some of the residential properties in the area. An EIR's description of the environmental setting must be contain sufficient information to "permit the significant effects of the project to be considered in the full environmental context." CEQA Guidelines, Â§ 15125(c). "If the description of the environmental setting 'is inaccurate, incomplete or misleading, the EIR does not comply with CEQA.' (Cleveland Nat'l Forest Found. V. San Diego Assn. of Governments (2017) 17 Cal.App.5th 413, 439.) An accurate description of the environmental setting is critical, because the significance of an activity may vary with the setting. CEQA Guidelines, Â§ 15064(b). A "project that is ordinarily insignificant in its impact on the environment may in a particularly sensitive environment be significant." (Kings County Farm Bureau v. City of Hanford (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 692, 718, 721; CEQA Guidelines, Â§ 15300.2(a)).)
22. In addition, the Draft SEIR 3 fails to consider views of the Project site from pedestrians utilizing Commercial Street, fails adequately address the impacts of the portion of Freedom Park that iS proposed to be removed in order to construct an access road, and fails to address the introduction of lighting from vehicle headlights which will impact certain

residences. Because the Draft SEIR 3 fails to properly study these significant impacts on aesthetics, the Draft SEIR fails to live up to its role as an informational document. The Authority's failure here "precludes informed decision making and informed public participation, thereby thwarting the statutory goals of the EIR process." (Ass'n of Irritated Residents v. County of Madera (2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 1383, 1391.)
23. The Draft SEIR 3 focuses the discussion and associated impact conclusions on the portion of the Project site that is comprised of the current San Dimas Park & Ride facility, relying on the fact that it is currently a parking facility and would continue to be a parking a facility: "As discussed, the vividness, intactness, and unity of the Project Site would remain similar to existing conditions with the implementation of the Project Modifications as the parcel
would continue to be used as a paved parking facility". However, the Project Site extends beyond the existing San Dimas Park & Ride facility. The Draft SEIR 3 does not adequately address the portion of Freedom Park that is proposed to be removed in order to construct an access road or the Kiss and Ride Area. Views of Freedom Park in this area are intact
with large mature trees and landscaping that provide visual relief from the surrounding development. The 2013 FEIR did not contemplate the removal of a similar resource, as a similar resource is not located within the previously considered parking location.
24. The Draft SEIR 3 does not discuss the Project's introduction of lighting associated with the headlights of vehicles exiting the parking lot from the proposed access road that would directly impact the residence located south of Commercial Street that fronts Commercial Street and Freedom Park; this condition does not currently exist and would not have occurred at the previously considered parking location.

Air Quality/Greenhouse Gas Emissions

25. The Draft SEIR 3 does not fully analyze the air quality impacts to surrounding residents and does not propose proper mitigation (i.e. upgrading residential air filtration systems and enhancing First/Last Mile improvements) to reduce the potential air quality impacts. The proximity of the relocated Gold Line station parking lot to the existing Park and Ride
will result in an increase of traffic to the surrounding residential neighborhoods and if proper parking is not provided, these future riders will circulate and park within surrounding private and public parking lots or along residential or commercial streets. The result of these vehicles circulating around the surrounding residential neighborhoods looking for parking will increase emissions/air pollutions and therefore increase Green House Gas (GHG) Emissions and air quality impacts.
26. In this regard the Gold Line Authority (GLA) should also evaluate, quantify and mitigate the effects of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as part of the overall air quality assessment. This topic was not clearly addressed in the 2013 FEIR.

Community Parks and Open Space
27. The Draft SEIR 3 is deficient as it discounts the importance of the portion of Freedom Park proposed for acquisition because it does not contain park facilities or features. However, this area is vegetated, including mature trees and serves as an open space resource for the surrounding community. The removal of a portion of Freedom Park is a long-term
impact which was not contemplated in the 2013 FEIR, and the Draft SEIR 3 fails to
describe the magnitude and severity of this impact, including in communities and

neighborhoods located in this area. The Draft SEIR 3 fails to identify feasible mitigation measures that would effectively reduce the Project's impacts on the visual character and
quality.

Cultural Resources
28. The Draft SEIR 3 indicates the AB 52 consultation process is ongoing and will be further documented as part of future CEQA documentation, but fails to identify what future CEQA documentation is being referenced. Under AB 52, if consultation has begun, an EIR cannot be certified unless the consultation process between the tribe and the lead agency has concluded. 3 Thus, the Draft SEIR 3 inadequately describes the AB 52 consultation
process.

Noise and Vibration
29. The Draft SEIR 3 inaccurately states that, when compared to the SEIR 2 location, residential structures abutting the relocated San Dimas parking facility are farther away from potential noise and vibration-intensive construction activities and concludes a reduction in both construction noise and construction vibration levels at adjacent receptors. SEIR 2 Table 4.11-4 shows a distance of 45 feet from the closest sensitive
receptor to the reconfigured parking facility. Construction activities associated with the Project Modifications (new access road) would occur immediately adjacent to the residential property that abuts Freedom Park; the residence is located at a distance of less than 45 feet and should be analyzed accordingly.
Similar to the construction impacts discussion, the long-term impacts discussion identifies the closest noise-sensitive receptor as 60 feet. This measurement is to the parking area. The Draft SEIR 3 should also address the noise associated with the proposed access road which would be located immediately adjacent to a sensitive receptor. a
30. No mitigations were proposed for the house adjacent to the new entrance onto Commercial Street. There will be significant queuing of vehicles exiting the station parking onto Commercial Street. This will create noise concerns for this residence.

31. The 2013 FEIR (page 3.11-17) states noise control measures when working near residences would be required, which includes conformance with the noise requirements of each City. "Limiting construction activities to weekday daytime hours (typically 7 a.m. to 6 p.m.) and employing typical measures for minimizing noise during construction requirement, combined with the mitigation described in Section 3.11.5, would mitigate construction impacts to a less than significant level." This is contradictory to the Draft SEIR
3 (Section 3.1.2.3), which states short-term construction impacts from temporary lane closures and detours "..would be limited by scheduling certain construction activities during night hours, outside of the AM and PM peak commuting periods, and through the use of clearly signed detour routes where necessary." The Draft SEIR 3 Noise analysis does not analyze nighttime construction activities. This inconsistency needs to be addressed and remedied. If nighttime construction activities will occur, the noise analysis needs to identify any resulting noise impacts to sensitive receptors. To "inform the public
and responsible officials of the environmental consequences of their decisions before they are made." (Laurel Heights Improvement Ass'n v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal. (1993) 6 Cal.4th 1112, 1123.) Again, the Authority must analyze noise impacts and potentially feasible mitigation measures for the significant nighttime construction noise impacts

caused by the Project.

Safety and Security
32. As acknowledged in the Draft SEIR 3 "[t]he relocated and reconfigured parking facility would be located in a more residential area than previously approved, with adjacent residential land to the west and south. Therefore, the facility would be located in an area with a different safety and security setting than what was previously analyzed." As we had previously noted, there are safety and security concerns with relocating the parking facility to the Park & Ride. Specific attention should be provided to the interface between the Project site, the alley, and the residential uses located south of the alley and that currently there is a clear line of site across the alley between Monte Vista Avenue and San Dimas
Avenue, as well as visibility from the existing Park & Ride facility. This visibility could be limited with the introduction of the access road and other improvements, resulting in security and safety concerns within the alley. The Draft SEIR 3 does not adequately address safety and security concerns. The Authority is legally required to mitigate or avoid the significant impacts of the projects it approves whenever it is feasible to do so. (Pub. Res. Code Â§ 21002.1(b).) "In the case of the adoption of a plan, policy, regulation, or other public project, mitigation measures can be incorporated into the plan, policy, regulation, or project design." (CEQA Guidelines Â§ 15126.4(a)(2).). Â§
33. With the Station Parking being so close to residential properties, the frequency of calls to law enforcement will increase and the expected response time will be immediate. Draft 3 SEIR 3 provides no details of how the Gold Line Authority will mitigate these requirements. This will impact local law enforcement and impact their ability to respond to other calls through the City. The Draft SEIR 3 must provide a detailed plan for Metro and LASD Transit Services Bureau response to mitigate impacts to local safety and law enforcement. SS-4 security mitigations indicates a security plan for LRT operations shall be implemented but the mitigation measure references surveillance by law enforcement including local jurisdiction security personnel. Gold Line Authority is proposing the use of local enforcement without cost mitigations.

Water Quality and Resources
34. The Draft SEIR 3 long-term Impacts discussion states "t]here would be a decreased amount of impervious surface compared to the Approved Project since the proposed San Dimas parking location is a smaller site than the approved location." This is not an accurate characterization. The approved location is already impervious and although the acreage of the parking facility may be reduced with the Project Modifications, the amount of impervious surface a as a result of the Project Modifications would not be decreased. The Project Modifications would acquire a portion of Freedom Park for an access road, converting an existing pervious surface to impervious conditions. When an EIR gives "conflicting signals to decision-makers and the public about the nature and scope of the activity being proposed," the courts have found it "fundamentally inadequate and misleading." (San Joaquin Raptor Rescue Center v. County of Merced, 149 Cal.App.4th 645, 655-56.).

General Comments

35. The station parking design standards require the parking lot to meet local landscape design standards. The configuration of the parking lot as proposed does not comply with

245 East Bonita Avenue â¢ San Dimas â¢ California 91773-3002 â¢ (909) 394-6200 - Fax (909) 394-6209 â¢ sandimasca.gov

City Code requirements. The increased landscaping requirements will result in the elimination of several parking stalls. This combined with the ADA requirements which were also not addressed will likely reduce the number of stalls available to less than 289.
36. The project calls for trees to be relocated. What trees will be relocated and to what
location?

37. Construction emissions will now be closer to residential homes than previous. Construction parking will impact the neighborhood and mitigation was not addressed.

The Draft SEIR 3's lackluster approach to impact analysis and mitigation violates CEQA. A lead
agency cannot simply conclude that an impact is significant and unavoidable and move on. A conclusion of residual significance does not excuse the agency from (1) performing a thorough evaluation and description of the impact and its severity before and after mitigation, and (2) proposing all feasible mitigation to "substantially lessen the significant environmental effect." (CEQA Guidelines Â§ 15091(a)(1); see also id. Â§ 15126.2(b) (requiring an EIR to discuss "any significant impacts, including those which can be mitigated but not reduced to a level of insignificance" (emphasis added).) Consequently, the Authority cannot legally certify the Draft SEIR 3 until it satisfies all the above CEQA requirements and, instead, it must consider further
feasible mitigation measures in a revised a and recirculated Draft SEIR 3.

Metro Gold Line Foothill Extension Construction Authority
406 E. Huntington Drive, Suite 202
Monrovia, CA 91016-3633

Subject: Comments on Notice of Preparation of Draft Supplemental EIR (DSEIR) Metro Gold Line
Extension Phase 2B - San Dimas Parking Lot Relocation

Dear Ms. Buch:

The City of San Dimas appreciates the opportunity to provide comments on the referenced DSEIR. The City of San Dimas continues to support the completion of the Gold Line Foothill Extension to Montclair, as long as the City's and our community's concerns are fully mitigated to our satisfaction. The following
comments are based on the Notice of Preparation of a Draft Supplemental Environmental Impact Report received on October 15, 2021. The DSEIR needs to address and fully mitigate the following potential
impacts regarding the proposed relocation of the San Dimas Gold Line Station parking lot to the existing
Park and Ride lot.

Transportation and Parking
1. The City is extremely concerned about the impact to the surrounding residents and downtown
businesses caused by the reduction in number of parking spaces provided in the proposed relocated station parking design. The original 2013 FEIR requirement of 450 parking spaces was reduced to 289
parking spaces (Supplemental EIR, 2021) due to implementing Metro's Supportive Transit Parking Program Management Plan constrained parking model. Relocating the Gold Line Station parking into the existing Park and Ride location would result in the loss of an additional 175 valuable parking spaces (existing 175 Park and Ride parking spaces not being reconstructed or accounted for with the Gold Line parking relocation to the Park and Ride) in the heart of our downtown. Such a reduction in the
number of parking spaces in downtown would negatively impact our downtown business community. Under parking the station and reducing valuable downtown parking capacity will result in impacts to private property, as well as, Municipal parking lots and public streets in the vicinity of the Gold Line
station parking lot. These impacts and mitigation measures must be evaluated and assessed as a part
of the Draft SEIR and clearly indicate how the project will not have an impact on the City's streets,
residential neighborhoods, and nearby businesses.

2. A Parking Management Study is needed to fully address overflow parking onto adjacent commercial and residential neighborhoods. The study must include a discussion related to the anticipated impacts and mitigation measures (i.e. required parking enforcement, fully funding additional City staffing and
costs related to mitigating parking related impacts associated with the Gold Line, etc.) to offset the
impacts of the overflow parking and traffic created by the Gold Line Station.

3. Currently, the existing Park and Ride is developed with 175 parking spaces, in addition to a dedicated bus stop and bus shelter for Foothill Transit which supports regional transportation. The City is concerned about the potential impact to the Foothill Transit bus services and the need to provide additional bus patron parking, in addition to the approximately proposed 289 parking spaces to only accommodate the future Gold Line Station patrons. The bus service provides a critical mode of public
transportation and the proposed alternative would potentially eliminate this mass transit alternative.
In the 2013 FEIR, the Gold Line Authority (GLA) committed to conduct a Bus Interface Study by completion of the Design Phase. To date, no study has been completed. This is an area of concern for
the City given the change to the project scope and the elimination of Foothill Transit within the
existing City Park and Ride Facility. This study will require Foothill Transit to reroute or eliminate
valuable mass transit services. The GLA should complete this study without further delay.

4. The pedestrian routes from the relocated Gold Line parking within the proposed Park and Ride lot
location need to be fully analyzed. The previous Gold Line parking location (City Yard) provided a
direct and safe pedestrian pathway that went underneath the light rail tracks to the station. The
relocated parking lot within the Park and Ride will result in a pedestrian conflict at San Dimas Avenue
and will result in significant vehicular traffic impacts on north and south bound San Dimas Avenue, in addition to east and west bound traffic on Bonita Avenue and Arrow Highway. This will be the result of the number of peak hour pedestrian traffic crossing at San Dimas Avenue, in addition to the number of train crossing signals that are activated approximately twice (trains travelling east and west bound) every 6 minutes. Mitigation needs to be provided to prevent pedestrians from jaywalking across San Dimas Avenue and the longer traffic delays from the number of pedestrian crosswalk signals and the number of train signals disrupting the vehicular traffic movement along San Dimas Avenue.

Studies need to be conducted to fully analyze the impact to this crossing that simulate and evaluate
the traffic impacts on San Dimas Avenue, in addition to the pedestrian safety and liability due to the
increase in pedestrian crossing along this crossing intersection.

5. The proposed Gold Line parking relocation to the Park and Ride will result in an increase of traffic
volumes within existing quiet single-family residential neighborhoods along Railway Street and
Commercial Street. Therefore, traffic calming mitigation measures need to be fully analyzed that will fully mitigate and divert this traffic away from these residential neighborhood streets. These
mitigation measures could include, but are not limited to:

a. Closure of the Monte Vista ingress/egress of Park and Ride;
b. Traffic calming mitigation measures on Railway and Commercial Streets, such as installation of cul-de-sac(s), speed humps, or other potential traffic calming mitigation measures;
C. Consider an additional vehicular ingress/egress along San Dimas Avenue to reduce traffic
related impacts to the surrounding residential neighborhoods.

d. The acquisition of Successor Agency properties on Cataract and utilization of Metro Gold
Line's right-of-way south of the rail lines as bypass to Railway and Commercial reducing
traffic loads on those residential streets.

6. Mitigation measures shall be implemented to reduce the vehicular queuing exiting the proposed relocated Gold Line parking lot.

7. All ADA pedestrian pathway concerns within the proposed relocated parking lot and the surrounding rights-of-way shall be fully analyzed and mitigated.

Tree Preservation, Landscaping and Water Quality
8. The City of San Dimas is a Tree USA City and preservation of the mature trees is a priority. Any City- owned trees proposed for removal shall be evaluated per City's Tree Preservation Ordinance per Chapter 13.36. A Tree Removal Permit Application will be required to be submitted to the Parks and
Recreation Department for review.

9. The proposed station and parking lot landscape and irrigation shall comply with the City's Water Efficient Landscapes Chapter 18.14.

10. The City is concerned with the thermal effects of the parking lot as proposed and its contribution to an urban heat island. The project must incorporate large shade trees, vegetation/landscape and lighter colored pavement to mitigate these impacts.

11. The proposed station and parking lot shall provide Low Impact Development (LID) proposal to comply
with City, County and State water quality requirements.

Air Quality/Greenhouse Gas Emissions
12. The air quality impacts to surrounding residents shall be fully analyzed and mitigated (i.e. upgrading residential air filtration systems and enhancing First/Last Mile improvements). The proximity of the relocated Gold Line station parking lot to the existing Park and Ride will result in an increase of traffic
to the surrounding residential neighborhoods and if proper parking is not provided, these future riders will circulate and park within surrounding private and public parking lots or along residential or commercial streets. The result of these vehicles driving around looking for parking will increase
emissions/air pollutions and therefore increase Green House Gas (GHG) Emissions.

13. Revised and updated estimates to circulation, land use, ridership and traffic/parking are necessary to prepare an appropriate analysis of the environmental effects on air quality with the revised project.
Utilizing the FEIR 2013 data will result in an inadequate analysis especially in light of the availability of
new ridership data and changes in Metro policies regarding parking, parking fees and First/Last Mile improvements.

14. In this regard the Gold Line Authority (GLA) should also evaluate, quantify and mitigate the effects of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as part of the overall air quality assessment. This topic was not
clearly addressed in the 2013 FEIR.

Noise and Vibration
15. The impact to the surrounding residences from the additional traffic related noise shall be fully
mitigated including but not limited to:

November 17, 2021

a. Construction of new sound walls; and
b. Retrofitting all surrounding affected residence windows with dual pane glass and other
treatments to reduce the noise impact with special emphasis to residences experiencing the
highest traffic and noise flows.

Public Service/Safety Concerns
16. There are safety and security concerns by relocating the Gold Line parking to the existing Park and Ride due to it being surrounded by and in close proximity to single-family residences. There is some is evidence that terminus or near-terminus stations are affected negatively by increased criminal activity. Such impacts have been evident with the opening of the Gold Line Phase 2B project. Mitigation measures need to be incorporated to address these concerns including but not limited to:

a. Funding and providing law enforcement presence, preferably a new satellite law enforcement
office located within the new parking lot;

b. Installation of camera systems in all parking facilities and use of security software which is
compatible with local law enforcement needs and enhanced ability for cameras to pan, tilt, zoom and record, providing clear, high quality observation during night and day, as well as providing needed hardware and viewing capability at the local law enforcement offices; and

Installation of city approved parking lot and alley lighting that is shielded and does not spill
over or impact surrounding residences.

Community Parks and Open Space
17. The impact to the existing Freedom Park by reducing the parkland area and removing existing
mature trees and landscaping in order to facilitate the construction of new vehicular ingress/egress
shall be fully mitigated.
a. Installing and maintaining adequate camera systems as specified in 16b to provide for
observation and response to Freedom Park as this location will be unduly impacted by
activity coming from the Park and Ride.

Land Use
18. The proposed project relocation will affect surrounding land uses especially as they relate to both
traffic, parking, air quality, noise and safety impacts. There is clear evidence that surrounding land uses are severely impacted when station parking and access are inadequate or poorly designed. These
impacts can severely affect nearby parking facilities, businesses and residences.

Furthermore, the State legislature is mandating major land use changes around transit stations in both
adopted and anticipated legislation. These changes in growth are induced by and directly related to the station location. These changes are intended to supersede existing zoning resulting in a growth inducing impact not considered at all by any of the EIRs for the project. These changes likely render
much of the traffic and related analysis invalid.

Economic
19. Relocating the Gold Line parking to the Park and Ride will negatively impact the heart of our
downtown businesses by losing 175 valuable parking spaces. Due to this loss of parking, this not only effects the current businesses and their economic vitality but will affect the economics and viability of the future expansion and development of the new San Dimas Downtown that the City is

currently in the process of generating a new Specific Plan for.

20. The proposed Park and Ride parking lot site plan eliminates and negatively impacts the existing Feed
and Grain business (located within the barn at 150 S. Monte Vista) by eliminating their ability to use
the existing Park and Ride lot to offload merchandise. The impact to this business shall be fully
mitigated.

21. Analyze the property value impacts to the surrounding residential and commercial uses with the
relocation of the Gold Line parking to the Park and Ride lot.
22. The elimination of the Park and Ride lot used for bus parking, would negatively impact the City's
Proposition C funds by reducing the amount of funds the City receives and which can be utilized to
support regional transportation improvements. This impact shall be fully mitigated.

The City of San Dimas looks forward to working cooperatively to address these major issues as part of the revised project in order to maximize the benefits for Metro, the GLA, the surrounding residents, businesses and property owners. You are welcome to contact the City for assistance or further explanation
of any of these comments.

24 AUTHORITY:

25 PLEASE TAKE NOTICE that Petitioner City of San Dimas (the "City" or "Petitioner")
26 intends to file a petition under the provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act
27 (CEQA"), Public Resources Code section 21000 et seq., against Metro Gold Line Foothill
28 Extension Construction Authority (the "Authority" or "Respondent"), challenging the Authority's

July 27, 2022 certification of the final Supplemental Environmental Impact Report 3 ("Final SEIR
2 3") and adoption of Resolution No. 2022-R-14.
Specifically, the City will challenge the Authority's certification of the Final SEIR 3 and
4 adoption of Resolution No. 2022-R-14, on the following grounds:

a. The Final SEIR 3 violates CEQA because it does not consider an adequate range of
6 alternatives capable of reducing the project's significant impacts;
b. The Final SEIR 3 does not adequately address the increased traffic and traffic
8 queuing on surrounding roadways, including small residential roads, to access the parking facility,

9 and the Authority's conclusion that drivers will typically use major streets is not substantiated by
10 any evidence;

11 c. The Final SEIR 3 does not adequately address pedestrian or cyclist safety and relies MHIINAA DaNIHSaTV 12 solely on the 2013 Final EIR for the unmodified project;

13 d. The aesthetics discussion in Final SEIR 3 is deficient, as the analysis only considers
14 the view impacts from some, but not all, of the residential properties in the area. Furthermore, the
15 analysis is limited to only a portion of the Project area and concludes that there is no significant
16 change in use; and

17 e. The greenhouse gas mitigation measures are illusory and do not pass muster under
18 CEQA.

19 The Petition will be timely, in that it will be filed within thirty (30) days of the Authority's
20 filing of the Notice of Determination. The City will seek a writ of mandate (1) vacating and setting
21 aside the 3 Authority's certification of the Final SEIR 3 and adoption of Resolution No. 2022-R-14,

22 and (2) directing the Authority to a conduct a new environmental review process that complies with
23 CEQA's requirements, and prepare, circulate, and consider a new and legally adequate supplemental

24 EIR and otherwise comply with CEQA in any subsequent action taken. The Petition will also seek
