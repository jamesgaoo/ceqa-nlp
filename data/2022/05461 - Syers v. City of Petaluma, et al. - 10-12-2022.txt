• 1 INTRODUCTION

2 1. Petitioner and Plaintiff CHARLES S. SYERS (*Petitioner") respectfully submits this
3 amended and supplemental Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint, and brings this action on

4 his own behalf and on behalf of the general public and in the public interest, for judicial review and
5 invalidation of the unlawful actions, determinations, decisions, and approvals made by the
6 Respondents and Defendants, the CITY OF PETALUMA ("City") and the MAYOR and CITY
7 COUNCIL OF CITY OF PETALUMA ("City Council," and collectively with City,
8 "Respondents"), including the Respondents' actions on or about July 18, 2022 and August 1, 2022

9 to introduce and adopt Ordinance No. 2820 (the "Contested Ordinance"). The Respondents' actions
10 and the Contested Ordinance modify Table 4.3 (Allowed Land Uses and Permit Requirements for
11 Mixed Use Zones) and Table 4.4 (Allowed Land Use and Permit Requirements for Commercial
12 Business Park, and Industrial Zone) of the City's Implementing Zoning Ordinance ("IZO") to
13 provide for discretionary review for proposed "General Retail, Grocery, and Building and
14 Landscape Materials Sales Indoor" land uses over 25,000 square feet and associated modifications
15 to implement these changes (the "Project" or the "Zoning Change").

16 2. The Zoning Change will effectuate major changes in the City's land use planning
17 and permitting process. Most commercial land uses that were previously allowed ministerially as
18 of right will now require a conditional use permit ("CUP") if they are located in a building that is
19 more than 25,000 square feet in size. The Contested Ordinance makes no exception for pre-existing
20 uses, such as the Plaza North Shopping Center (the "Shopping Center"), owned by Petitioner.

21 3.

22 More than 40 years ago, the City granted a use permit and design review approvals
to Petitioner's predecessor, expressly allowing for unrestricted commercial uses in the Shopping
23 Center, including a now-vacant nearly 90,000 square foot commercial building formerly occupied

24

25 by Kmart. Despite years of good faith reliance on those City approvals, however, the City hastened

to enact the new constraints of the Contested Ordinance in reaction to a recent application a by a
26 prospective new tenant, The Home Depot ("THD"), to locate in the Shopping Center. Through the
27 Contested Ordinance, the City seeks to change the proverbial rules in the middle of the game in
28 order to improperly protect an existing business from potential economic competition that might be

-. 1

2 posed by new occupants of the Shopping Center, all in violation of state and federal law.

4. Respondents consciously failed to conduct any environmental review prior to hastily
3 adopting the Zoning Change. The Project may result in physical environmental impacts and thus

4 the City must conduct environmental review pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act
5 ("CEQA*) before it can lawfully act on it. (Public Resources Code §§ 21080, 21000, 21065.) It is

6

7 reasonably foreseeable that the Zoning Change could chill or freeze existing commercial business
in their current locations, precluding updates or improvements, or displace existing and potential
g new commercial businesses, or deter existing businesses from renovating existing facilities or
expanding existing operations, or cause certain commercial businesses to locate in other areas
10 outside the City. Reasonably foreseeable and probable impacts of the Project would result in
11 associated traffic, air quality, and noise pollution, including an increase in greenhouse gas emissions,
12 vehicle miles traveled, and other related emissions. Another reasonably foreseeable consequence
13 of the Project is that it leads to larger buildings and centers remaining vacant, thereby contributing

14 to urban decay impacts. Accordingly, pursuant to CEQA, Respondents were required to prepare an
15 initial study/negative declaration or environmental impact report prior to approving the Project.
16 Respondents did not undertake either of these actions, wrongly claiming that their actions were
17 exempt from CEQA, and thereby leaving the decision-makers and the public completely "in the
18 dark" about the environmental consequences associated with the proposed Project.

19 5. In approving the Project, Respondents improperly and unlawfully relied on
20 inapplicable exemptions from CEQA in finding that the Project would not result in any significant
21 impacts. Respondents' conclusions are not supported by substantial evidence in the record, or
22 actually any evidence or analysis, but rather are contrary to evidence in the record raising at least
23 fair argument that the Zoning Change would result in significant adverse environmental impacts,
24 precluding reliance upon said exemptions and requiring further public environmental review and
25 analysis. As a result, the Respondents failed to consider significant adverse impacts of the Project,
26 including impacts to the environment, public health and regional welfare, and to communities that
27 are located outside of the City's limits, and improperly failed to consider possible mitigation
28 measures or feasible alternatives to the proposed Project as required by CEQA.

. 1 6. The Zoning Change is inconsistent with the City's General Plan and thus void
2 ab initio. The Zoning Change adds new unstudied barriers to economic development and changes

3

4 in the commercial vitality of the City, to the harm of the community and the public at large.

7.

5 The Zoning Change makes no provision for those who have previously acquired

6 vested rights such as Petitioner, as a result of their substantial expenditures and investments made
in good faith reliance on the City's existing zoning rules and on permits issued pursuant to such
7 rules. The Zoning Change implements an improper use of police powers to restrict economic
8 competition, to the harm of the public at large and Petitioner. The Zoning Change was adopted in
9 violation of the Ralph M. Brown Act ("Brown Act"), the State's Open Meetings Law. It violates
10 Petitioner's due process and equal protection rights and amounts to an unlawful regulatory taking
11 of Petitioner's property. The Zoning Change unlawfully impairs contractual relations and interferes
12 with economic relations.

13 8. Respondents' arbitrary and unauthorized actions, and deliberate disregard of the
14 applicable requirements of CEQA, the Planning & Zoning Law, the Brown Act, and other applicable
15 federal, state, and local laws and policies, result in significant changes to land use and planning
16 processes, vehicle miles traveled, regional air quality, public health, safety, and welfare of the City
17 and the surrounding communities, as well as significant harm to Petitioner and others and adverse
18 environmental impacts and other harm to the environment and regional welfare.

19 9. Petitioner seeks relief from Respondents' hasty, ill-considered, and unlawful actions,
20 including the Respondents' failure to comply with CEQA, the Planning & Zoning Law, the Brown
21 Act, the state and federal constitutions, and request that the Zoning Change be declared void and
22 invalid, and that Respondents be mandated to set aside the Zoning Change and be permanently
23 enjoined from taking any further action in furtherance of, or in implementation of, the Zoning
24 Change.

25 10. Petitioner also seeks immediate issuance of temporary and preliminary injunctive
26 relief and an alternative writ of mandate enjoining Respondents from taking any further action in
27 furtherance of, or in implementation of, the Zoning Change unless and until the Respondents first
28 rescind their unlawful actions and approvals, and fully comply with the applicable requirements of

•
1 state and local law, including but not limited to, CEQA, the Planning & Zoning Law, and the Brown
2 Act, and comply with the writs or orders of this Court.

3 11. Petitioner, and other interested parties, duly raised these issues and objections,
4 verbally and in writing, at appropriate times during the administrative process leading up to
5 Respondents' approval of the Project. Petitioner has exhausted all available administrative
6 remedies, but Respondents have persisted in acting in derogation of their obligations under the
7 CEQA, the Planning & Zoning Law, the Brown Act, and other state and federal laws, as well as the
8 public's rights and interests in compliance with those laws.

9 12. Petitioner now brings this action in the public interest, for enforcement of the
10 important public rights and environmental interests intended to be protected by CEQA and for the

11 enforcement of the State Planning & Zoning Law, the Brown Act, and the City's own General Plan
12 and policies, as well as statutory and constitutional rights to, among others, due process and equal
13 protection of the laws.

14 PARTIES

15 13. Petitioner and Plaintiff CHARLES S. SYERS is the owner of the Plaza North
16 Shopping Center located at 261 McDowell Boulevard, Petaluma, who has and will be significantly

17

18 and adversely impacted and harmed by the Zoning Change.

14. Respondent City of Petaluma is a municipal corporation, organized and existing
19 under the laws of the State of California, located in the County of Sonoma. Respondents Mayor and
20 City Council are the elected governing body of the respondent City, which erroneously adopted the
21 invalid and unlawful Zoning Change challenged in this action. Respondent City together with the
22 Mayor and City Council collectively are referred to herein as "the City" or "Respondents."

23 15. Respondents have and had mandatory duties to comply with federal, local, and state
24 laws, including, without limitation, the U.S. and California Constitutions, CEQA, the CEQA
25 Guidelines, the Planning & Zoning Law, the Brown Act, and the City's own adopted General Plan
26 and local ordinances and policies when considering discretionary activities, and land use decisions
27 and development projects and actions such as the Zoning Change.

1 through 50, inclusive, and therefore sues those respondents/defendants by such fictitious names.
2 Petitioner will amend this Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory
3 Relief and Damages (the "Petition") to allege the true names and capacities of these fictitiously

4 named respondents/defendants when they have been ascertained. Petitioner designates all other
5 unknown persons or entities claiming any interests in the subject of this litigation as DOE
6 respondents/defendants.

7 17. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that each of the
8 respondents/defendants designated herein as "DOE" is responsible in contract or tort, or in equity
9 or by statute, for the events and happenings referred to herein, and proximately caused, contributed
10 to, or are otherwise liable for the arbitrary, unauthorized, or invalid actions, demands, fees, or
11 exactions which are the subject of this Petition, as hereinafter set forth.

12 18. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that at all times herein
13 mentioned, Respondents and Defendants, and each of them, were and are the agents and employees
14 of their co-Respondents and co-Defendants, and in doing the things herein alleged, were acting
15 within the purpose and scope of their agency and employment.

16 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

17 19. This Court has jurisdiction over this proceeding pursuant to California Code of Civil
18 Procedure ("CCP") sections 1085, 1094.5, and 1060; Public Resources Code ("PRC") sections
19 21168 and 21168.5; 42 U.S.C. section 1981 et seq; and the various provisions of the federal and
20 state constitutions cited herein.

21 20. Petitioner has beneficial and direct financial and business interest in the outcome of
22 this action because Petitioner's use and enjoyment of the Shopping Center is directly impacted by
23 Respondents' unlawful actions.

24 21. Petitioner has exhausted all non-judicial remedies available to them and required to
25 be exhausted as a prerequisite to the filing of this Petition and action. Other than through this action,
26 Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law.

27 22. Venue for this action is proper in this Court pursuant to CCP section 394 because the
28 Respondents and the subject Shopping Center are located in the City of Petaluma, Sonoma County,

1 California, which is within the jurisdiction of the Superior Court for the County of Sonoma.

2 FACTUAL BACKGROUND

3 23. The Shopping Center is approximately 20 acres in size and is located along one of
4 the City's main commercial arterials---McDowell Boulevard. The City's General Plan designates
5 the Shopping Center site as Community Commercial. "This category includes shopping centers and
6 commercial districts, including regionally-oriented centers." (General Plan, p. 1-7.) The Shopping

7 Center is zoned Commercial 2 ("C2") under the IZO. The C2 zone is applied to existing community
8 and regional shopping center sites. (IZO § 4.020.)

24. The City Planning Commission granted a use permit and design review approvals
10 for the Shopping Center on February 6, 1979 (the "Shopping Center Approvals"). The Shopping

11 Center approvals allowed approximately 200,000 square feet of commercial development with two
12 main anchor buildings as well as several in-line stores.

13 25. In connection with granting the Shopping Center Approvals, the City's Planning
14 Commission found that the Shopping Center conformed to the City's General Plan and Zoning Code
15 and "will not constitute a nuisance or be detrimental to the public welfare of the community."
16 (Report to Planning Commission, February 6, 1979, p. 3; Minutes of February 6, 1979 Planning
17 Commission Meeting, p. 3.) Among others, the conditions imposed on the Shopping Center
18 Approvals provided that exterior modifications to individual store fronts would be subject to review
19 and approval by the Planning Director. In actual and good faith reliance on the City's approvals
20 and permits, the Shopping Center was thereafter constructed in accordance with the Shopping
21 Center Approvals and has been in continuous operation since that time.

22 26. One of the Shopping Center's main anchor buildings, totaling approximately 90,000
23 square feet, was leased for many years to Kmart. In or around 2020, Kmart ceased operations.
24| Thereafter, Petitioner sought a long-term tenant for the empty Kmart building space. For a

25 commercial retail center, an anchor building like the now-empty Kmart building, is vital to the
26 overall leasing and thus economic viability of the center as a whole.

27 27. Sometime in 2021, THD expressed interest in becoming a tenant in the Shopping
28 Center and redeveloping the site of the former Kmart building with a new home improvement store.

Rutan & Tucker, LLP -7-
attorneys at law 2783/037655-0001 FIRST AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTAL VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF
18324603.2 a09/30/22 MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF AND DAMAGES

1 Petitioner discussed THD's expression of interest with responsible City officials to determine the
2 feasibility of pursuing a new tenancy agreement with THD, and Petitioner was assured by those
3 responsible City officials that the City would welcome the opportunity to have THD become a tenant

4 in the Shopping Center.

5 28. In justifiable reliance on those City assurances and representations, and in reliance
6 on the existing permits, approvals and zoning applicable to the use of the Shopping Center, the
7 Petitioner exercised contractual option rights to reclaim the vacant Kmart space and pursue new

8 lease negotiations with THD. Had Petitioner not been induced to exercise the lease termination

9 option with Kmart, Kmart's obligations to pay rent would have continued through April 30, 2025.

10 29. Under the City's Zoning Code in effect when THD submitted its application, a home
11 improvement store was a use permitted as of right, subject only to design review approval for new
12 construction or exterior modifications. In Petaluma, design review approval is referred to as Site
13 Plan & Architectural Review or "SPAR."

14 30. THD and Petitioner entered into a new written Lease Agreement for the former
15 Kmart space on February 5, 2021, and THD submitted a formal application to the City for SPAR
16 approval to demolish the existing Kmart store building and build a new store in that general location,

17 on November 3, 2021. On December 9, 2021, City staff deemed the SPAR application
18 "incomplete," citing the ostensible need to complete studies of various potential impacts, including
19 among others, traffic, air, and noise studies. Although the requested studies were outside the scope
20 of matters publicly identified by the City as necessary for a complete SPAR application, THD
21 nonetheless prepared and provided the requested information to City staff. Shortly thereafter, the
22 City undertook action to amend its SPAR ordinance, so as to make review thereunder
23 "discretionary" for purposes of CEQA. (Ordinance No. 2811 introduced April 18, 2022 and
24 approved May 2, 2022.)

25 31. THD made several attempts to respond to City demands for "more information" by
26 repeated submittals, but the City persisted in requesting additional information, that had nothing to

27

28 The formal application submittal was preceded by months of trying to obtain input from City staff through a pre-application process that City staff had recommended.

1 do with the application. THD eventually decided to simply attempt to remodel and reoccupy the
2 existing Kmart building with no substantial exterior changes. As acknowledged in a June 28, 2022
3 Staff Report to the Planning Commission, the amount of City discretion over such a tenant
4 improvement/remodeling project is limited, since the relevant SPAR ordinance, even as amended,

5 focuses on exterior design changes to the building. Under the controlling Shopping Center
6 approvals, the Planning Director is authorized to review and approve such changes.

7 32. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that shortly after THD

8 expressed interest in locating at the Shopping Center and re-tenanting the empty Kmart building,
9 the City-without any formal notice to Petitioner or THDintroduced the Zoning Change to require
10 a conditional use permit ("CUP") for any otherwise permitted commercial retail project occupying
11 more than 25,000 square feet. The City Council held a noticed public hearing on the Contested
12 Ordinance on July 18, 2022. Nothing in the posted agenda for that hearing indicated that the City
13 Council was intending to rely on exemptions from CEQA in connection with its approval of the
14 Project.

15 33. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that former Kmart building
16 at the Shopping Center (which was then under consideration for occupancy by THD) was the only
17 vacant retail space larger than 25,000 square feet in Petaluma at the time of Respondents' actions
18 on the Zoning Change that would be subject to the Zoning Change.

19 34. In connection with Respondents' adoption of the Zoning Change, Petitioner is
20 informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that at least one councilmember purported to justify the
21 Zoning Change based on a perceived need to "protect Friedman's." Friedman's owns and operates
22 an existing 83,000 square foot home improvement store located nearby and has its corporate
23 headquarters in Petaluma.

24 35. In its recitals purporting to justify the Zoning Change, the City Council make various
25 speculative, unfounded, and unsubstantiated claims about the impacts posed by "large" stores.
26 Some of these claims about increasing air quality emissions and vehicle miles traveled were
27 specifically refuted by expert studies submitted by THD in connection with its application. The
28 record evidence demonstrated, for example, that the requested THD project would reduce vehicle

Rutan & Tucker, LLP -9-
attorneys at law 2783/037655-0001 FIRST AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTAL VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF
18324603.2 a09/30/22 MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF AND DAMAGES

1 miles traveled by 8,223 miles per day. Put differently, actual data shows Respondents' enactment

2 of the Zoning Change will add over 8,000 daily vehicle miles traveled, with increased emissions,
3 compared to the pre-existing conditions under which THD occupancy is permitted by right.

36. Further, even though the City's General Plan and IZO specifically provide for
5 regional commercial uses at the Shopping Center and elsewhere, the City's recitals in the Contested
6 Ordinance speculate inconsistently about the alleged risks "large stores" pose to the "economic
7 viability of local and regional businesses," and the negative impact such stores could have on the
8 "aesthetic and historical culture of neighborhoods." The recitals also refer to the difficulties posed
9 by re-tenanting large single occupant store which can lead to blight and urban decay. Yet, an
10 immediate and direct effect of the Zoning Change is that a large single-occupant store will remain

11 vacant indefinitely, and will be much more difficult to re-tenant under the Contested Ordinance, and
12 thus the Contested Ordinance itself potentially contributes to blight and urban decay.

13 37. In terms of CEQA, the City Council purported to find that the Zoning Change was
14 not a "project" as defined by CEQA, and/or exempt from CEQA. However, because of its potential

15 to result in significant environmental impacts, the Zoning Change is not exempt from CEQA. The
16 City cannot credibly claim it is enacting the Zoning Change to ensure more CEQA review while at
17 the same time inconsistently purporting to exempt its actions approving the Zoning Change from

18 CEQA review.

19 38. Although the City did not approve the Project until August 1, 2022, it prematurely
20 filed a Notice of Exemption for the Project on July 22, 2022. While such a prematurely-filed notice
21 is not legally effective,? the initial Petition was nonetheless filed within 35 days from the filing and
22 posting of such notice of exemption. (PRC § 21167(d).)

23 39. On August 17, 2022, Petitioner's counsel wrote to the City requesting that it cure or
24 correct its violation of the Brown Act by failing to properly notify the public in the agenda for the
25 July 18, 2022 City Council meeting that it would take action to rely on exemptions from CEQA in
26 approving the Project. The City did not respond to the demand from Petitioner's counsel within the

6 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

7

8 (Petition for Writ of Mandate for Violation of CEQA)

41. Petitioner hereby incorporates the allegations of the foregoing paragraphs as though
9 set forth in full herein by this reference.

10 42.

11 Pursuant to CEQA, before a public agency undertakes or approves any action,
including amendments to a zoning ordinance, which may cause a direct, or reasonably foreseeable
12 indirect, physical change in the environment, the agency must first identify, assess and publicly
13 disclose the project's potential environmental effects. An agency may not approve a project that
14 has the potential to have significant environmental impacts if there are feasible alternatives or
15 mitigation measures that would avoid or substantially lessen the adverse environmental impacts.

16 43. Rather than comply with CEQA, the Respondents erroneously purported to rely on
17 various inconsistent and unsupported "theories" as to why they should not be required to comply
18 with CEQA before taking action on the proposed Zoning Change.

19 44. The Respondents erroneously claimed that the Zoning Change is not a "project" as
20 defined by CEQA. To the contrary, it is well settled that the adoption or amendment of a zoning
21 ordinance is a § "project" subject to CEQA. (PRC § 21080(a) [CEQA applies to "discretionary
22 projects proposed to be carried out or approved by public agencies, including . . . the enactment and
23 amendment of zoning ordinances . . .."]; CEQA Guidelines § 15378(a) [noting that for CEQA
24 purposes, a "project" includes "[a]n activity directly undertaken by any public agency including ..
25  . enactment and amendment of zoning ordinances . . ..*])

26 45. It is reasonably foreseeable that the Project would cause displacement of
27 development and force (and has, in fact, forced) certain commercial businesses, to locate in other
28 areas outside the City. As such, the Project may likely result in increased air quality, noise,

MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF AND DAMAGES

1 transportation, and urban decay impacts, including an increase in greenhouse gas emissions, vehicle
2 miles traveled, and other related emissions. (See, e.g., Muzzy Ranch Co. V. Solano Airport Land

3 Use Commission (2007) 41 Cal.4th 372, 383 [land use plan found to be a project due to potential to

4 result in displaced development impacts]; accord, Napa Citizens for Honest Government v. Napa
5 County Board of Supervisors (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 342, 369 [court observes that "the purpose of
6 CEQA would be undermined if the appropriate governmental agencies went forward without an
7 awareness of the effects : project will have on areas outside of the boundaries of the project area."].)
8 Thus, the City had no legal or factual basis on which to erroneously claim that the Zoning Change
9 was not a project subject to CEQA.

10 46. Respondents also erroneously purported to rely on the Class 8 categorical exemption
11 from CEQA applicable to actions by regulatory agencies for protection of the environment (the
12 "Environmental Protection Exemption"). However, the Environmental Protection Exemption only
13 applies to "actions, as authorized, by state or local ordinance, to assure the maintenance, restoration,
14 enhancement, or protection of the environment where the regulatory process involves procedures
15 for protection of the environment.?" (CEQA Guidelines con 15308.) This narrow exemption is
16 reserved for situations in which an agency has been authorized by law to undertake environmental
17 protection activities. Nothing in the exemption nor case law supports its broader application to an
18 amendment to a zoning ordinance, such as at issue here, and as a matter of law, the exemption does
19 not apply to the Zoning Change Project. Exemptions from CEQA are to be narrowly construed and
20 not unreasonably expanded. (Wildlife Alive v. Chickering (1976) 18 Cal.3d 190, 205; McQueen v.
21 Board of Directors (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 1136, 1148.)

22 47. CEQA expressly provides that a categorical exemption "shall not be used for an
23 activity where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the
24 environment due to unusual circumstances." (CEQA Guidelines 15300.2(c).) By requiring
25 additional discretionary approvals for commercial uses that were previously allowed as a matter of
26 right, the Project has the unusual consequence of displacing such development to other jurisdictions.
27 Moreover, the evidence submitted to Respondents showed that the Zoning Change may result in
28 significant environmental impacts to, among others, air quality, greenhouse gas emissions, noise,

Rutan & Tucker, LLP -12-
attorneys at law 2783/037655-0001 FIRST AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTAL VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF

1 transportation/vehicle miles traveled, and urban decay. The City's reliance on a categorical

2 exemption thus was unlawful.

3 48. Respondents also erroneously claimed that the Project is exempt from CEQA
4 pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15183 because the proposed zoning amendments are
5 consistent with the General Plan. CEQA Guidelines section 15183 is irrelevant however because it

6 merely provides for the potential of streamlined review for development projects that are consistent

7 with the development densities set forth in a general plan. The Zoning Change is not a development
8 project nor does it implicate issues of consistency with development densities.3
49. Even assuming that the Project somehow qualified for CEQA Guidelines
10 section 15813, that section still requires an analysis of project-specific significant impacts which are
11  peculiar to the project or its site. Examples of such impacts include off-site impacts and other
12 impacts that were not disclosed in the prior EIR for the general plan. As noted above, the Project
13 may result in significant impacts to, among others, air quality, greenhouse gas emissions, noise,
14 transportation/vehicle miles traveled, and urban decay. None of these impacts were disclosed in the
15 prior EIR for the General Plan. The City undertook no initial study or other analysis to determine
16 whether the Project would or would not result in any such impacts as required by CEQA Guidelines
17 section 15183. Moreover, the City made no finding that applicable mitigation measures in the
18 general plan EIR would be imposed and undertaken. As such, related significant environmental
19 effects are not exempt from further review. (PRC § 21083.3(c); CEQA Guidelines § 15183(c).)
20 Respondents cannot blithely say that the Project is "exempt" pursuant to section 15183 without
21 actually doing the analysis and following the procedure set forth in that section.

22 50. Respondents further claim that the Project is exempt under the "common sense
23 exemption." That exemption, however, is reserved for very limited situations in which "it can be
24 seen with certainty that there is no possibility that the activity in question may have a significant
25  effect on the environment . . (CEQA § Guidelines § 15061(b)(3).) An agency relying on the
26 exemption must be able to show, based on record evidence, that it is certain that that the activity

27
Even if viewing consistency in a manner broader than that specified in section 15183, the Project 28 is not consistent with the City's General Plan. See Second Cause of Action alleging Violation of the Planning & Zoning Law, infra.

1 cannot have a significant effect on the environment. The City did not undertake this mandatory
2 inquiry here. Even if it had, it could not show with certainty that the Project will not have a

3 significant effect on the environment. As previously mentioned, Project may result in significant
4 environmental impacts to, among others, air quality, greenhouse gas emissions, noise,
5 transportation/vehicle miles traveled, and urban decay

6 51. In doing the things herein alleged, Respondents failed to comply with their
7 mandatory duties under CEQA in several substantial and prejudicial respects, including without
8 limitation, the following:

52. Respondents erroneously relied on inapplicable CEQA exemptions, and as a result
10 failed to consider, disclose, or mitigate the Project's significant environmental impacts, as required
11 by CEQA. Had appropriate review been conducted, it would have revealed that the Project will
12 have significant adverse impacts that Respondents failed to disclose or mitigate prior to approving
13 the Project. Such significant adverse impacts include, but are not limited to, impacts to air quality,
14 greenhouse gas emissions, noise, transportation/vehicle miles traveled, and urban decay.

15 53. Respondents failed to provide substantial evidence in the public record prior to its
16 decision to exempt the Project from CEQA review sufficient to support such decision.

17 54. Respondents erroneously failed to publicly consider or provide evidence in the public
18 record addressing the CEQA Guidelines section 15300.2 exception or other exceptions to
19 Respondents' proposed reliance upon categorical exemptions. Thus, Respondents would have been
20 precluded from relying on a categorical exemption, even if the Project otherwise qualified for one.

21 55. Respondents failed to make required findings when approving the Project and/or any

22 findings made by Respondents were not supported by substantial evidence in light of the whole

23 record.

24 56. Respondents failed to consider feasible alternatives to the Project, or to consider
25 feasible mitigation measures for the Project's significant environmental impacts.

26 57. Respondents' actions in approving the Project were not in compliance with
27 procedures required by law, were not supported by substantial evidence in the public record, were
28 not reflected in legally adequate findings, and were arbitrary, capricious, and reflected a prejudicial

1 abuse of discretion.

2 58. Petitioner has no plain, adequate, and speedy remedy at law to redress the wrongs
3 described in this Petition.

59. Petitioner has performed any and all conditions precedent to filing this action and

5 has exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent required by law by,

6 inter alia, submitting written and oral comments objecting to the Project and Respondents' failure
7 to comply with CEQA.

8 60. Pursuant to PRC section 21167.5, Petitioner has provided written notice of the
9 commencement of this action to Respondents.

10 61. Pursuant to PRC section 21167.7, and CCP section 388, Petitioner has or will
11 provide written notice of this action, including a copy of this Petition, to the State Attorney General.

12 62. Petitioner brings this action pursuant to PRC section 21168.5 and CCP section 1085
13 (or, alternatively, under PRC section 21168 and CCP section 1094.5), which require that an
14 agency's approval of a project be set aside if the agency has prejudicially abused its discretion.
15 Prejudicial abuse of discretion occurs where Respondents have failed to proceed in the manner
16 required by law, the decision is not supported by the findings, or the findings are not supported by
17 the evidence.

18 63. Pursuant to CCP section 1085 (or 1094.5), a writ of mandate should accordingly
19 issue: directing Respondents to rescind their approvals of the Project, and Respondents'
20 determination that the Project is exempt from CEQA review; invalidating any and all purported
21 approvals or permits based on such inadequate CEQA review; and prohibiting Respondents from
22 taking any subsequent action to implement, enforce, or rely upon the Contested Ordinance or the
23 Zoning Change, unless and until Respondents have complied with CEQA.

24 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

25 (Petition for Writ of Mandate for Violation of Planning & Zoning Law)

26 64. Petitioner hereby incorporates the allegations of the foregoing paragraphs as though
27 set forth in full herein by this reference.

28 65. All local land use decisions, including consideration of the Zoning Change, must be

1 shown to be "consistent with" the applicable general plan. (Orange Citizens for Parks & Recreation
2 v. Superior Court (2016) 2 Cal.5th 141, 152 [invalidating project approval where not shown to be
3 consistent with general plan]; Families Unafraid to Uphold Rural Etc. of Placer County v. Board of

4 Supervisors of Placer County (1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 1332, 1336 [county abused its discretion by
5 approving a development project inconsistent with general plan policies].)

6 66. A city's general plan is effectively the "constitution for future development" in the
7 community, and any zoning ordinance or other subordinate land use action that is not shown to be
8_ consistent with the general plan is "void ab initio." (Lesher Communications, Inc. v City of Walnut v
9 Creek (1990) 52 Cal.3d 531, 540; Elysian Heights Residents Assn. v. City of Los Angeles (1986)
10 182 Cal.App.3d 21, 38.) "The propriety of virtually any local decision affecting land use and
11 development depends upon consistency with the applicable general plan and its elements." (Citizens
12 of Goleta Valley v. Board of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 570.) In particular, a subsidiary
13 zoning ordinance must be consistent with the general plan, and in the case of any inconsistencies
14 between the two, the general plan governs.

15 67. In order to be deemed "consistent," the Zoning Change must actually be "*compatible
16 with the objectives, policies, general land uses, and programs specified in the general plan." (Napa
17 Citizens for Honest Government V. Napa County Board of Supervisors (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 342,
18 378-79 [county abused its discretion in adopting a specific plan that permitted development without
19 "definite affirmative commitments to mitigate" impacts to traffic and housing contrary to policies
20 and objectives set forth in its general plan].) "Consistency requires more than incantation, and [an
21 agency] cannot articulate a policy in its general a plan and then approve a conflicting project."
22 (Endangered Habitats League, Inc. v. County of Orange (2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 777, 789.)

23 68. Failure to comply with even one general plan policy is enough to render a project a
24 "inconsistent" with the general plan, and any project approvals would be invalid. (See, e.g., (Spring
25 Valley Lake Assn. v. City of Victorville (2016) 248 Cal.App.4th 91 [invalidating city's approval of
26 permit for commercial development because of failure to show consistency with one general plan
27 policy]; California Native Plant Society v. City of Rancho Cordova (2009) 172 Cal.App.4th 603,
28 640-642 [finding a project to be inconsistent with an agency's general plan based on its failure to

1 comply with a single policy requiring the agency to "coordinate" with specified resource agencies

2 on mitigation for impacts to special-status species]; accord, Endangered Habitats League, supra,
3 131 Cal.App.4th at 789 [project's failure to comply with a single general plan provision calling for
4 use of a prescribed traffic study methodology].)

5 69. The proposed Zoning Change is manifestly inconsistent with several of the City's
6 fundamental policies embodied in the City's own General Plan, and there is no substantial evidence
7 in the record to support any finding or implied finding of general plan consistency by the
8 Respondents.

70. First, commercial retail uses are listed as principally permitted uses in the General
10 Plan. Specifically, the Community Commercial designation "includes shopping centers and
11 commercial districts, including regionally-oriented centers.»4 (General Plan, Land Use Element,
12 p. 1-7.) And the Mixed Use designation "requires a robust combination of uses, a including retail,
13 residential, service commercial, and/or offices." (Id.) Contrary to the General Plan, the Zoning
14 Change only allows retail uses larger than 25,000 square with approval of a use permit. In this
15 regard, the Zoning is fundamentally and irreconcilably inconsistent with the General Plan.

16 71. Second, the arbitrary size limits imposed on retail uses by the Zoning Change conflict
17 with the controlling floor area ratios ("FAR") set forth in the General Plan. Sites with a
18 Neighborhood Commercial land use designation are subject to a 0.8 FAR. (General Plan, Land Use
19 Element, p. 1-7.) Sites with a Community Commercial land use designation are subject to a
20 1.2 FAR. (Id.) And sites designated Mixed Use are subject to a 2.5 FAR. (See also General Plan,
21 Table 1.3-3 [provides for approximately 2.8 million square feet of additional commercial/retail
22 development by general plan buildout].) Even the designation with the lowest FAR--Neighborhood
23 Commercial-envisions a commercial development site of up to 10 acres. At this size, the General
24 Plan would allow for approximately 350,000 square feet of commercial development. In stark
25 contrast, the Zoning Change allows only for 25,000 square feet of commercial development, at least
26 without securing and obtaining approval of a discretionary CUP. The arbitrary size limits imposed
27 by the Zoning Change would likely make it impossible to achieve the allowed FAR for commercial

A
1 development sites specified, and "required," by the General Plan.

2 72. Third, the General Plan contains several goals and policies supporting the retention
3 and expansion of commercial and retail uses. Certain of the General Plan's Guiding Principles call

4 for fostering and promoting economic diversity and opportunities as well as expanding retail
5 opportunities to meet residents' needs and promoting the city's fiscal health. (General Plan, p. i-8.)
6 Per Goal 1-G-1, the City is to maintain a balanced land use program that meets the long-term
7 residential, employment, retail, institutional, education, recreation, and open space needs of the
8 community. Policy 1-P-2 calls for using land efficiently by "promoting infill development, at equal
9 or higher density and intensity than surrounding uses." Policy 1-P-7 encourages "flexibility in
10 building form and in the nature of activities to allow for innovation and the ability to change over
11 time." Policy 1-P-11 allows for "land use intensification at strategic locations along the arterial
12 corridors leading to Downtown and Central Petaluma, including aging commercial and industrial
13 sites."

14 73. General Plan Policy 9-P-1 calls for attracting economic activity that brings dollars
15 into the local economy by exporting products and services," including "serving unmet local
16 demands for goods [and] services," "generating revenue for the City," and "providing jobs for un-
17 and under-employed segments of the work force." Policy 9-P-3 provides for "an array of
18 employment opportunities to existing and future residents by assuring diversity in Petaluma's
19 industry and enterprise mix." Policy 9-P-13 calls for expanding and diversifying Petaluma's retail
20 base and encourages expansion of "local choice in types of retail enterprises." Policy 9-P-16
21 promotes strengthening existing retail concentrations, particularly those that serve Petaluma's
22 residential neighborhoods.

23 74. The Zoning Change conflicts with all of the above goals and policies. It will make
24 many existing commercial/retail uses nonconforming and would allow new commercial/retail uses
25 only with approval of a discretionary CUP. The Zoning Change will cause a significant decline in
26 business activity, employment opportunities, and tax revenues otherwise benefitting the City and
27 the community at large.

3 76. Pursuant to CCP sections 1085 and/or 1094.5, a writ of mandate should issue setting

6 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

7 (Petition for Writ of Mandate for Violation of Petitioner's Vested Rights)

8 77. Petitioner hereby incorporates the allegations of the foregoing paragraphs as though
9 set forth in full herein by this reference.

10 78. Petitioner has a vested right to use the Shopping Center for commercial uses through
11 substantial reliance on the Shopping Center Approvals and building permits issued by the City for
12 buildings designed and long used for commercial/retail purposes. Specifically, Petitioner has spent
13 millions of dollars in reliance on the approved permits and planned infrastructure for the Shopping
14 Center and its environs. These funds were used to acquire the Shopping Center, negotiate and draft
15 leases, and pay other direct and indirect expenses related to the ownership, maintenance, and
16 operation of the Shopping Center. As a result of Petitioner's reasonable and detrimental reliance
17 on permits and approvals issued by the City, Respondents are estopped from precluding general
18 retail use, including building materials and landscape materials sales, of the Shopping Center or
19 from imposing new regulations on the use inconsistent with the City's prior actions, representations,
20 and approvals.

21 79. A use of property, and the right to use property, is lawfully established once rights
22 have vested through substantial expenditures in reliance on permits issued by a governmental
23 agency. (Cf. Avco Community Developers, Inc. v. South Coast Regional Commission (1976)
24 17 Cal.3d 785, 791.) The vested rights doctrine is predicated upon estoppel of the governing body.
25 "An equitable estoppel requiring the government to exempt a land use from a subsequently imposed
26 regulation must include (1) a promise such as that implied by a building permit that the proposed
27 use will not be prohibited by a class of restrictions that includes the regulation in question; and
28 (2) reasonable reliance on the promise by the promisee to the promisee's detriment." (Santa Monica

1 Pines, Ltd. v. Rent Control Board (1984) 35 Cal.3d 858, 867.)5

2 80. Respondents are estopped by their prior actions and representations, and cannot
3 equitably or lawfully revoke or nodify the Shopping Center Approvals without cause and without
4 providing due process (e.g., notice and a hearing) to Petitioner. (Goat Hill Tavern v. City of Costa

5 Mesa (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1519, 1530 ["Once a use permit has been properly issued, the power of
6 a municipality to revoke it is limited."]; accord, Malibu Mountain Recreation, Inc. V. County of Los
7 Angeles (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 359, 367 [*" A CUP creates a property right which may not be revoked
8 without constitutional rights of due process."].) Nor can the government infringe on a vested right
9 by changing the requirements of the original entitlements, e.g., by requiring additional mitigation.
10 (See, e.g., Kaufman & Broad Central Valley, Inc. V. City of Modesto (1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 1577,
11 1591 [city could not impose new fees on developer who had already obtained vested right to
12 complete a project].)

13 81. Action by Respondents to modify or revoke Petitioner's Shopping Center Approvals
14 impacts fundamental vested rights, and is subject to non-deferential judicial review.
15 (CCP § 1094.5(c) [as to cases involving fundamental vested rights, a reviewing court exercises its
16 "independent judgment on the evidence," to determine if an abuse of discretion is established
17 because "the findings are not supported by the weight of the evidence."]; see also Goat Hill Tavern,
18 supra, 6 Cal.App.4th at 1526, 1530 and Malibu Mountains, supra, 67 Cal.App.4th at 366-370.)

19 82. By approving the Zoning Change that impermissibly infringes on and abridges
20 Petitioner's judicially-protected vested rights, Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required
21 by law and committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion.

22 83. Respondents' enactment of the Zoning Change will cause a significant decline in
23 business activity, employment opportunities, and a significant loss of tax revenues otherwise
24 benefitting the City and the community at large. Respondents' actions will have an enormous
25 detrimental economic effect and devaluation of the Shopping Center, and the other businesses

City & County of San Francisco (1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 438, 449 [noting that the issuance of permit "constitutes a promise by the approving agency that a 28 subsequently adopted ordinance will not prohibit the proposed use. When the applicant reasonably relies upon that promise to its detriment, an estoppel is created."].)

FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

6 (Petition for Writ of Mandate for Abuse of Police Powers to Restrict Economic Competition)

7 85. Petitioner hereby incorporates the allegations of the foregoing paragraphs as though
8 set forth in full herein by this reference.

86. It is well settled that a city cannot use its land use powers to grant existing businesses
10 a monopoly or shield them from economic competition. (Hernandez v. City of Hanford (2007)
11 41 Cal.4th 279, 297 [California Supreme Court observes that it is impermissible for a zoning action

12 to have a "private anticompetitive goal of protecting or disadvantaging a particular favored or
13 disfavored business or individual."].) In Friends of Davis v. City of Davis (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th

14 1004, the Court of Appeal held a that a city could not use its design review ordinance to exclude a
15 prospective tenant from a proposed retail development project on the basis that it was a nationwide

16 chain store..

17 87. Despite these clear legal mandates, Respondents have inappropriately used their land

18 use powers to grant an existing business a monopoly or shield it from economic competition. One
19 of the councilmembers admitted as much in citing the need to "protect Friedman's" as a basis for
20 approving the Zoning Change. And the chronology of zoning changes here-amending the IZO to
21 make SPAR discretionary and then requiring a CUP for retail and home improvement stores-were
22 done in direct response to THD's application.

23 88. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that the City has exhibited
24 a pattern and practice of misusing or exceeding its police power/land use authority for improper
25 purposes or without legal or evidentiary support. The Respondents' arbitrary and capricious land
26 use planning and zoning actions described in this Petition are similar to that pattern and practice of
27 abuse of police power authority.

28 89. By approving the Zoning Change aimed at restricting and shielding existing

1 businesses from competition, which is not a legitimate or valid exercise a of Respondents' police
2 powers, Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law and committed a prejudicial
3 abuse of discretion.

4 90. Pursuant to CCP sections 1085 and/or 1094.5, a writ of mandate should issue setting
5 aside Respondents' approval of the Zoning Change as violating applicable law and being arbitrary,
6 capricious, and without evidentiary support.

7 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

8 (Petition for Writ of Mandate-Violation of Brown Act)

91. Petitioner hereby incorporates the allegations of the foregoing paragraphs as though
10 set forth in full herein by this reference.

11 92. Respondents violated the Brown Act, Gov. Code § 54950 et seq., by taking action
12 on an item that was not on the agenda. Specifically, the City Council violated the Brown Act by
13 failing to include the City Council's CEQA determination on the agenda for the July 18, 2022 City
14 Council meeting.

15 93. The Brown Act requires a posted agenda to a include a description of each item of
16 business to be considered at a legislative body's meeting at least 72 hours prior to the meeting.
17 (Gov. Code § 54954.2(a)(1).) This requirement applies unless the legislative body makes certain
18 determinations, none of which were made by the City Council in this case. (Gov. Code
19 § 54954.2(b).) The Brown Act states that "[n]o action or discussion shall be undertaken on any item
20 not appearing on the posted agenda." (Gov. Code $54954.2(a)(3).)

21 94. In San Joaquin Raptor Rescue Center v. County of Merced (2013) 216 Cal.App.4th
22 1167, the Court of Appeal ruled that a county violated the Brown Act by considering and adopting

23 a mitigated negative declaration (*MND") for a project subject to CEQA without first expressly
24| including the item in the posted agenda for the agency's meeting. The Court stated that

25 consideration of the MND, a distinct item of business, had to be expressly disclosed on the agenda
it 26 and it was not sufficient for the agenda to merely reference the project in general. (216 Cal.App.4th
27 at 1176-1177.) The Court reasoned that an agency's CEQA determination is "always a matter of at
28 least potential public interest" since it concerns the "environmental effects of a proposed project."

18324603.2 a09/30/22 MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF AND DAMAGES

1 (216 Cal.App.4th at 1177.) The Court went on to observe that such issues "often motivate members
2 of the public to participate in the process and have their voices heard," which is "exactly what the
3 Brown Act seeks to facilitate." (Id.)

95. The agenda for the City Council's July 18, 2022 public hearing on the Contested

5 Ordinance omitted any reference to CEQA compliance, including the proposed reliance on

6 exemptions from CEQA. The City's failure to notify the public of the proposed CEQA treatment
7 of the Contested Ordinance violated the Brown Act.

8 96. In accordance with Government Code section 54960.1, Petitioner's counsel
9 submitted a letter to the City on August 17, 2018 demanding that the City Council cure and correct
10 the illegally taken action by setting aside the adoption of the Contested Ordinance until the agenda
11 for the action was properly prepared and posted to inform the public of the subjects for discussion

12 at the new hearing.

13 97. Per Government Code section 54960.1(c)(2), the City had until September 16, 2022

14 to respond to this cure and correct demand letter. The City did not respond to the cure and correct
15 demand letter within this timeframe. Under the Brown Act, such inaction is deemed a decision not

16 to cure or correct the challenged action, and an action for violation of the Brown Act may be
17 thereafter be filed. (Gov. Code § 54960.1(a), (c)(3)-(4).)

18 98. By approving the Contested Ordinance in a manner that violates the Brown Act,
19 Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law and committed a prejudicial abuse of
20 discretion.

21 99. Pursuant to CCP sections 1085 and/or 1094.5, a writ of mandate should issue setting
22 aside Respondents' approval of the Contested Ordinance as violating the Brown Act and being
23 arbitrary, capricious, and without evidentiary support.

24 SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION

25 (Complaint for Damages for Violation of Constitutional and Civil Rights-

26 42 U.S.C. § 1981 et seq.)

27 100. Petitioner hereby incorporates the allegations of the foregoing paragraphs as though
28 set forth in full herein by this reference.

Rutan & Tucker, LLP -23-
attorneys at law 2783/037655-0001 FIRST AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTAL VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF
18324603.2 a09/30/22 MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF AND DAMAGES

1 101. In doing the things herein alleged, the Respondents and each of them were acting or
2 purporting to act within the course and scope of their official positions and under the color of state
3 law, and violated Petitioner's rights protected by the Constitution or laws of the United States and/or

4 California, including (without limitation):

5 a. constitutional rights to Equal Protection of the laws;

6 b. constitutional rights to Due Process of law; and

7 C. constitutional protections against the uncompensated taking of property or
8 property rights.

102. The Respondents are subject to the Constitution of the United States and the
10 California Constitution, which guarantee certain rights, including rights to due process and equal
11 protection of the law, and prohibit governmental action which impairs such rights, or which take or
12 damage property without payment of just compensation.

13 103. Respondents, and each of them, have nevertheless acted arbitrarily and unreasonably,
14 in violation of Petitioner's rights under the federal and state constitutions to substantive and
15 procedural due process, and rights to equal protection of the laws, and rights against uncompensated
16 taking or damaging of property, by arbitrarily subjecting them to unreasonable and discriminatory
17 treatment, including the Zoning Change.

18 104. Respondents' actions are in conflict with and preempted by Petitioner's rights to be
19 free from arbitrary and irrational governmental action, to be treated fairly and equally with other
20 similarly situated property owners, and to be free from an uncompensated taking of property.

21 105. In doing the things herein alleged, the Respondents have harmed and impaired
22 Petitioner's rights and interests and the Petitioner's constitutional rights. (U.S. Constitution, 5th and
23 14th Amendment; California Constitution, Article I, § 17.) Respondents have, in effect, impaired
24 and taken Petitioner's rights to the lawful use and occupancy of the Shopping Center property,
25 without offering or providing just compensation.

26 106. The Federal Civil Rights Act (42 USC § 1981 et seq.) provides remedies for
27 violations of rights protected under the Constitution or laws of the United States.

28 107. As a proximate result of Respondents' actions as alleged herein, Petitioner has

18324603.2 a09/30/22 MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF AND DAMAGES

1 suffered, and continues to suffer, irreparable harm as set forth above and are thereby entitled to
2 injunctive relief under 42 USC § 1981 et seq., and have been damaged in an amount according to
3 proof at trial. Petitioner is entitled to recover just compensation for the taking of the Shopping
4 Center property.

5 108. As a result of Respondents' actions, Petitioner has also been required to incur
6 attorneys' fees, expenses, and court costs, and are entitled to seek recovery of such damages and
7 reasonable attorneys' fees and costs under 42 U.S.C. § 1988.

8 109. WHEREFORE, Petitioners seek relief and judgment as set forth herein.
9 SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION

10 (Complaint For Damages for Unlawful Interference With Contractual Relations)

11 110. Petitioner hereby incorporates the allegations of the foregoing paragraphs as though
12 set forth in full herein by this reference.

13 111. Article I, section 10 of the U.S. Constitution provides that, "No State shall ... pass
14  any Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts."

15 112. Petitioner and THD entered into a written Lease Agreement of the Property for the
16 Shopping Center on February 5, 2021. THD was not able to proceed with its proposed development
17 and enjoyment of the leased premises at the Shopping Center because of Respondents' arbitrary and
18 pretextual delays in processing THD's applications and Respondents' dilatory and unreceptive
19 actions leading to the enactment of the Contested Ordinance, which once enacted interposed new
20 obstacles, delays, and burdens including redundant CEQA review and new discretionary approvals
21 (adding at least one to two years of additional delay to a project that had already been under review
22 by the City for more than one year).

23 113. The enactment of the City's new Contested Ordinance, and the Respondents' actions
24 leading to that enactment, substantially impaired and interfered with the contractual lease
25 relationship between THD and Petitioner, by precluding the use of the Shopping Center for which

26 it was proposed to be leased, and Respondents' actions as alleged caused the ensuing termination of
27 that Lease Agreement by THD, resulting is substantial economic harm to Petitioner, and to other
28 occupants and users of the Shopping Center.

18324603.2 a09/30/22 MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF AND DAMAGES

- 1 114. Respondents have intentionally and/or negligently interfered with prospective
2 economic relations between Petitioner and THD. The Lease demonstrates an economic relationship
3 between Petitioner and THD. Respondents were aware of the relationship and intentionally acted
4 to disrupt that relationship. Respondents did disrupt that relationship causing THD to withdraw its
5 application. And significant economic harm to Petitioner was proximately caused by the acts of
6 Respondents.

7 115. The actions of Respondents as set forth in this Petition were unprivileged, wrongful,

8 and unexcused.

9 116. City staff and representatives, acting in their official capacities for Respondents are,
10 and were at all times relevant to this action, persons acting under color of state law, pursuant to an
11 official policy, custom or practice of the City.

12 117. By reason of the acts, omissions and conduct of City staff and representatives, acting
13 in their official capacities for Respondents, as alleged above, Petitioner has been damaged in an
14 amount according to proof at the time of trial. Petitioner will continue to suffer such damages until
15 Respondents afford Petitioner their constitutional right to freedom from interference with
16 contractual relations and common law right to be free from interference with prospective economic
17 advantage.

18 118. Petitioner is entitled to recover just compensation for the taking of the Shopping
19 Center property. Additionally, Petitioners are entitled to recover their attorneys' fees and litigation
20 expenses pursuant to 42 U.S.C. section 1988.

21

22 119. WHEREFORE, Petitioner seeks relief and judgment as set forth herein.
EIGHTH CAUSE OF ACTION

23

24 (Complaint For Declaratory and Injunctive Relief)

120. Petitioner hereby incorporates the allegations of the foregoing paragraphs as though
25 set forth in full herein by this reference.

26 121. An actual controversy exists between Petitioner and Respondents regarding
27 Respondents' approval of the Zoning Change. Petitioners maintain that Respondents' approval of
28 the Project violates state law, including CEQA and the State Planning & Zoning Law, as well as the

Rutan & Tucker, LLP
attorneys at law -26-

2783/037655-0001
18324603.2 a09 FIRST AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTAL VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF
MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF AND DAMAGES

1 City's own General Plan, and state and federal constitutional provisions, as described above.
2 Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that Respondents maintain the contrary.
3 Accordingly, declaratory relief is appropriate and necessary to determine Respondents' authority to
4 approve the Zoning Change.

5 122. To remedy Respondents' violations of law, as described above, Petitioner seeks
6 declaration that Respondents' approval of the Zoning Change was invalid and contrary to law,
7 including but not limited to CEQA, the State Planning & Zoning Law, the City's General Plan, and
8 state and federal constitutional provisions. Such a declaration is a necessary and proper exercise of
9 the Court's power to prevent future actions by Respondents' in violation of the law.

10 123. Respondents' actions, including the wrongful enactment of the Contested Ordinance,
11 has caused and continues to cause irreparable harm to the Petitioner, and to other members of the
12 public. Petitioner has no speedy or effective remedy at law for relief from such harm.

13 124. Immediate issuance of temporary and preliminary injunctive relief enjoining
14 Respondents from taking any further action in furtherance of, or in implementation of, the Zoning
15 Change pending the resolution of this action is therefore necessary and appropriate.

16 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

17 WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully prays for judgment as follows:

18 1. For a Writ of Mandate:

19 a. Directing Respondents, and each of them, to rescind and set aside the
20- determination that the proposed Project is exempt from CEQA review, and to rescind and set aside
21 the Zoning Change;

22 b. Commanding Respondents to refrain from taking any further actions in
23 furtherance or implementation of the Contested Ordinance and Zoning Change;

24 C. Commanding Respondents to prepare an environmental impact report and
25 circulate it for public review and comment, consistent with the requirements of CEQA, and to
26 comply with all other requirements of CEQA, prior to taking any subsequent action to approve the
27 Project;

28 d. Commanding Respondents to rescind and set aside the Contested Ordinance;

18324603.2 a09/30/22 MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF AND DAMAGES

1 and

2 e. Commanding Respondents to conform their actions to controlling law,
3 including state and local planning and zoning requirements and the Brown Act;

4 2. For compensatory damages, according to proof at trial;

5 3. For the declaratory relief requested above;

6 4. For preliminary injunctive relief ordering the Respondents to refrain from
7 implementing or enforcing the Zoning Change, while this action is pending;

5. For a permanent injunction ordering the Respondents to refrain from implementing
9 or enforcing the Zoning Change pending Respondents' full compliance with CEQA and otherwise
10 conforming their actions with the procedural mandates of the law;

11 6. For an award of attorneys' fees, litigation expenses, and costs as permitted or
12 required by law, including but not limited to, CCP §§ 1021.5, 1036; Government Code §§ 800,
13 6259, 54960.5; 42 U.S.C. § 1988; and other statutory and common law; and

14 7. For such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.
