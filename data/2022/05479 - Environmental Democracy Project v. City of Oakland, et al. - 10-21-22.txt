NOTICE TO ATTORNEY GENERAL

F To the Attorney General of the State of California:

2 PLEASE TAKE NOTICE, under Public Resources Code § 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure

3 cop 388, that on October 21, 2022, the Environmental Democracy Project filed petition for writ of
4 mandate against the City of Oakland, City of Oakland Planning and Building Department, and City of
5 Oakland Office of the City Administrator in Alameda County Superior Court (Respondents). The
6 petition alleges that the Respondents violated the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) by
7 unlawfully approving major indoor cannabis cultivation projects in East Oakland-an overburdened
8 community of color-without any analysis of their environmental impacts. The petition further alleges

9 that Respondents engage in the pattern and practice of exempting all cannabis cultivation projects from
10 CEQA-projects that have significant environmental impacts including toxic emissions from diesel

11 generators and diesel trucks, significant energy and water use, traffic, odors, and hazardous waste -
12 without conducting any analysis of their environmental impacts on the neighborhoods and residents of
13 East Oakland under CEQA.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE & COMPLAINT FOR DELCARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

INTRODUCTION F

2 1. This action challenges Respondents City of Oakland, City of Oakland Planning and
3 Building Department, and City of Oakland Office of the City Administrator's (each a Respondent and
4 collectively Respondents) unlawful approval of major indoor cannabis cultivation projects in East

5 Oaklandan overburdened community of color-without any analysis of their environmental impacts
6 under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), Pub. Res. Code, §§ 21000 et seq. The first of
7 these projects, proposed by I Metal Inc. (I Metal), is a 2,400 square a foot indoor cannabis cultivation
8 facility located at 60 Hegenberger Place, Oakland, CA 94621. The second project, proposed by DSF
9 Management Inc. (DSF Management), is a 7,280 square foot indoor cannabis cultivation facility located

10 at 740 Kevin Court, Oakland, CA 94621. A true and correct copy of each project's "Preliminary
11 Checklist for Cannabis Operators Pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA)"
12 (CEQA Checklist) and each project's corresponding Notice of Exemption is attached as Exhibit A.

13 2. In addition, Petitioner Environmental Democracy Project (EDP or Petitioner) brings this
14 action for declaratory and injunctive relief to put an end to Respondents' pattern and practice of
15 exempting all cannabis cultivation projects from CEQA-projects that have significant environmental
16 impacts including toxic emissions from diesel generators and diesel trucks, significant energy and water
17 use, traffic, odors, and hazardous waste. Respondents routinely grant permits for cannabis cultivation
18 projects in East Oakland without conducting any analysis of their environmental impacts on the
19 neighborhoods and residents of East Oakland under CEQA. For example, Respondents have, on
20 hundreds of occasions, failed to ensure that proposed indoor cannabis cultivation facilities have access

21 to the power grid, that the grid has sufficient power to fuel the facilities' energy intensive operations,

22 and that the facilities will not resort to using massive diesel-generators in lieu of grid power.

23 3. Residents of East Oakland living near the proposed project sites are concerned about,
24 among other things, indoor cannabis cultivation operations' potential to cause significant environmental
25 impacts, and the unfairness of siting more cannabis cultivation a projects in a community that already
26 hosts numerous cultivation projects. Nevertheless, Respondents regularly approve cannabis cultivation
27 projects without conducting any environmental review under CEQA.

28
2
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE & COMPLAINT FOR DELCARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

F 4. East Oakland is a community of color adversely impacted by a long history of
2 government-sponsored racially discriminatory practices such as redlining. Today, as a result of these
3 practices, East Oakland is overburdened by pollution, poverty, and a lack of resources such as access to
4 greenspace and grocery stores. Approving hundreds of cannabis cultivation facilities without any
5 environmental review is yet another example of the City's practice of targeting East Oakland for
6 projects that wealthier Oakland neighborhoods do not want.

7 5. In sum, Respondents' project approvals are unlawful because: (1) Respondents did not
8 conduct environmental review under CEQA for cannabis cultivation projects; and (2) Respondents'
9 pattern and practice of approving cannabis cultivation projects without conducting environmental review
10 under CEQA violates the statute. Petitioner seeks declaratory judgment that Respondents' pattern and
11 practice of circumventing CEQA is unlawful. Petitioner seeks an injunction restraining Respondents'
12 approval of indoor cannabis cultivation facilities without conducting CEQA review.

PARTIES 13

14 6. Petitioner and Plaintiff Environmental Democracy Project is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit
15 corporation dedicated to representing communities of color exposed to disproportionate amounts of
16 pollution. EDP is based in East Oakland where several of its officers live.

17 7. EDP members live in and around areas directly affected by the hundreds of indoor
18 cannabis cultivation projects permitted in East Oakland without CEQA compliance. They are exposed,

19 on a daily basis, to the pollution, odor, noise, and traffic caused by these sites.

20 8. EDP and its members are directly, adversely, and irreparably affected, and will continue

21 to be prejudiced by these indoor cannabis cultivation sites, unless and until this Court provides the relief
22 prayed for in this Petition and Complaint. Respondents' pattern and practice of approving cannabis
23 cultivation projects without CEQA review results in significant adverse environmental impacts to
24 members of EDP.

25 9. The maintenance and prosecution of this action will confer a substantial benefit on the
26 public by protecting the public from harms to the environment and other harms alleged herein. This
27 action will also ensure that Respondents abide by procedures required by law.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE & COMPLAINT FOR DELCARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

F 10. Respondent City of Oakland (the City) is a municipal corporation and a chartered city, a

2 organized and existing under the laws of the State of California. The City and its officials, boards,
3 commissions, departments, bureaus, and offices constitute a single "local agency,' "public agency" or

4 "lead agency" as those terms are used under the California Environmental Quality Act. See Pub. Res.

5 Code §§ 21062, 21063, 21067; Oak. Muni. Code § 17.158.090. Thus, the City has the principal
6 responsibility for conducting environmental review of its actions. The City has a duty to comply with
7 state law, including CEQA.

8 11. Respondent City of Oakland Planning and Building Department (Planning and Building)

9 IS a subdivision of the City of Oakland that is responsible for CEQA compliance in Oakland. Planning
10 and a Building is a responsible agency under CEQA. See Pub. Res. Code § 21069.

11 12. Respondent City of Oakland Office of the City Administrator (City Administrator) is
12 "responsible for implementing a process for selection of qualified cannabis operators and may set forth
13 criteria to determine an operator's qualifications to meet the requirements of the applicable City's
14 ordinances, regulations and state law." 2021-2022 Administrative Regulations and Performance
15 Standards for City of Oakland Cannabis Operators § III.A. The City Administrator's Office has
16 authorized hundreds of exemptions from CEQA for cannabis cultivation facilities. The City
17 Administrator's Office is a responsible agency under CEQA. See Pub. Res. Code, § 21069.

18 13. I Metal, Inc. is named as Real Party in Interest because it is a "person" under Public
19 Resources Code section 21065, subdivisions (b) and (c). See Pub. Res. Code § 21167.6.5.

20 14. DSF Management, Inc. is named as Real Party in Interest because it is a "person" under
21 Public Resources Code section 21065, subdivisions (b) and (c). See Pub. Res. Code, § 21167.6.5.

22 15. EDP is unaware of the true names and capacities of Respondents or Real Parties in
23 Interest fictitiously named Does 1 through 20 and sues such Respondents or Real Parties in Interest by
24 fictitious names. EDP is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that the fictitiously named
25 Respondents or Real Parties in Interest are also responsible for the actions described in this Petition.
26 When the true identities and capacities of these Respondents or Real Parties in interest have been
27 determined, Petitioner will amend this petition, with leave of the Court if necessary, to insert such
28 identities and capacities.

F JURISDICTION AND VENUE

2 16. EDP realleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in their entirety.

3 17. This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged herein pursuant to Code of Civil
4 Procedure sections 526, 527, 1060, 1085, 1087, and 1094.5, and Public Resources Code sections 21168,

5 21168.5, and 21168.9.

6 18. Venue for this action properly lies in the Superior Court for the State of California in and
7 for the County of Alameda pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 394. The activities authorized
8 by Respondents have occurred, will occur, and are occurring in and around the City of Oakland, located

9 in Alameda County.

10 19. Respondents have taken final agency actions with respect to approving the projects at

11 issue without complying with CEQA.

12 20. Respondents have a duty to comply with CEQA. EDP possesses no effective remedy to
13 challenge the approvals at issue in this action other than by means of this lawsuit.
14 21. On October 21, 2022, EDP complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.5 by
15 serving a written notice on Respondents regarding EDP's commencement of this action. Attached
16 hereto as Exhibit B is the true and correct copy of this written notice.
17 22. EDP is filing and serving its Notice to Attorney General concurrently with this filing,
18 thereby complying with the requirements of Public Resources Code section 21167.7 and Code of Civil
19 Procedure section 388.

20 23. EDP performed all conditions precedent to filing the instant action and exhausted any and
21 all available administrative remedies to the extent possible and required by law. EDP and its members
22 made numerous objections highlighting Respondents' failure to comply with CEQA. In response, the

23 City Attorney's office told EDP's counsel that the City's CEQA exemption determinations were "made
24| pursuant to, and consistent with, City Code and State law requirements. Further, the determination does
25 not contain an appeal process. Thus, the City's decision is final."
26 24. Accordingly, EDP has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law
27 unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to set aside their project
28 approvals. In the absence of such remedies, Respondents' approvals will remain in effect in violation of
5
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE & COMPLAINT FOR DELCARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

F of CEQA. EDP's members and residents in East Oakland and nearby communities will be irreparably

2 harmed. No money damages or legal remedy could adequately compensate for that harm.

3 CEQA'S REQUIREMENTS

4 25. CEQA requires an agency to analyze the potential environmental impacts of its proposed
5 actions in an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) except in certain limited circumstances. See, e.g.,
6 Pub. Res. Code § 21100. The EIR is the very heart of CEQA. Dunn-Edwards v. BAAQMD (1992) 9
7 Cal.App.4th 644, 652. "The foremost principle in interpreting CEQA is that the Legislature intended the
8 act to be read so as to afford the fullest possible protection to the environment within the reasonable

9 scope of the statutory language." Communities. for a Better Env. V. Cal. Res. Agency (2002) 103 Cal.
10 App.4th 98, 109.

11 26. CEQA's primary purposes are as follows. CEQA informs decision makers and the public
12 about the potential, significant environmental effects of a project. 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15002(a)(1). "Its
13 purpose is to inform the public and its responsible officials of the environmental consequences of their
14 decisions before they are made. Thus, the EIR "protects not only the environment but also informed
15 self-government.' Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Board of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal. 3d 553, 564. The
16 EIR has been described as "an environmental 'alarm bell' whose purpose it is to alert the public and its
17 responsible officials to environmental changes before they have reached ecological points of no return."
18 Berkeley Keep Jets Over the Bay v. Bd. of Port Comm'rs. (2001) 91 Cal. App. 4th 1344, 1354; County of
19 Inyo v. Yorty (1973) 32 Cal.App.3d 795, 810.

20 27. CEQA requires public agencies to avoid or reduce environmental damage when
21  "feasible" by requiring "environmentally superior" alternatives and all feasible mitigation measures. 14
22 § Cal. Code Regs. § 15002(a)(2) and (3); see also Berkeley Jets, 91 Cal.App.4th at 1354; Citizens of
23 Goleta Valley, 52 Cal.3d at p. 564. The EIR serves to provide agencies and the public with information
24 about the environmental impacts of a proposed project and to "identify ways that environmental damage

25 can be avoided or significantly reduced." 14 Cal. Code. Regs. §15002(a)(2). If the project will have a
26 significant effect on the environment, the agency may approve the project only if it finds that it has
27 "eliminated or substantially lessened all significant effects on the environment where feasible" and that

28

6
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE & COMPLAINT FOR DELCARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

F any unavoidable significant effects on the environment are "acceptable due to overriding concerns."
2 Pub. Res. Code § 21081; 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15092(b)(2)(A) & (B).

3 28. A lead agency must make a good-faith effort, based to the extent possible on scientific
emissions resulting 4 and factual data, to describe, calculate or estimate the amount of greenhouse gas

5 from a project. A lead agency shall have discretion to determine, in the context of a particular project,

6 whether to: (1) Quantify greenhouse gas emissions resulting from project; and/or (2) Rely on a
7 qualitative analysis or performance based standards. 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15064.4.

8 29. CEQA requires evaluation, disclosure, mitigation, and consideration of alternatives for
9 significant impacts caused by air pollution, water use, traffic, hazardous waste, noise, and other impacts.
10 Azusa Land Reclamation Co. v. Main San Gabriel Basin Watermaster (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 1165,
11 1206 (hazardous waste impacts required environmental review under CEQA); King & Gardiner Farms,
12 LLC v. County of Kern (2020) 45 Cal.App.5th 814, 895 (air pollution, noise impacts, and water supply
13 impacts required adequate environmental review under CEQA).

14 STATEMENT OF FACTS

15 The Significant Environmental Impacts from Indoor Cannabis Cultivation Facilities

16 30. The electricity consumption of indoor cannabis cultivation facilities is staggering. Indoor
17 cannabis cultivation is one of the most energy-intensive industries in the nation. "Indoor marijuana
18 cultivation has an energy demand that rivals data centers. With energy intensities around 2,000 watts
19 per minute, it consumes between 50 and 200 times more than an average office building and 66 times
20 more than an average home." Gina S. Warren, Hotboxing the Polar Bear: The Energy and Climate
21 Impacts of Indoor Marijuana Cultivation BOSTON UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW (2015). Attached hereto as
22 Exhibit C is a true and correct copy of this scientific study.

23 31. Indoor cannabis cultivation results in approximately $6 billion in energy costs annually,
24 accounting for at least 1% of the nation's electricity. Evan Mills, The carbon footprint of indoor
25 Cannabis production, ENERGY POLICY (Volume 46, 2012). Attached hereto as Exhibit D is a true and a

26 correct copy of this scientific study.

27 32. In California, the nation's largest marijuana producer, indoor cannabis production
28 consumes three percent of state's total electricity, and eight percent of household electricity. Warren

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE & COMPLAINT FOR DELCARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

F 2015 [Exhibit C]. In 2010, these figures corresponded to 17 million metric tons of greenhouse gas
2 (CO2) emissions for the United States, and 4 million metric tons of CO2 emissions for California; these

3 emissions were estimated to have been released from electricity generated from fossil fuel sources being
4 used to grow cannabis. Mills 2012 [Exhibit D].

5 33. One average kilogram of final cannabis product is associated with 4,600 kilograms of
6 carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere, or that of 3 million average U.S. cars when aggregated
7 across all national production. Mills 2012 [Exhibit D].

8 34. Typical indoor cannabis cultivation facilities cost millions of dollars and are state-of-the-

9 art "grow rooms" constructed as isolated ecosystems in locations such as warehouses. Electricity is used
10 to power high-intensity discharge lights that take the place of the sun in driving photosynthesis and
11 secondary plant metabolite production. A primary goal of indoor growers is to create an environment
12 that maximizes the quantity and quality of marijuana flower buds produced. Indoor growing operations
13 rely on tightly regulated light, temperature, humidity, and air quality, which come at a large cost in the
14 form of electricity. Mills, Energy Use by the Indoor Cannabis Industry: Inconvenient Truths for
15 Producers, Consumers, and Policymakers THE ROUTLEDGE HANDBOOK OF POST-PROHIBITION
16 CANNABIS RESEARCH (2021). Attached hereto as Exhibit E is a true and correct copy of this scientific

17 study.

18 35. Cannabis cultivation and processing operations emit a variety of air contaminants
19 including volatile organic compounds and combustion by-products. Vera Samburova, Dominant
20 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) measured at four Cannabis growing facilities: Pilot study results J

21 AIR WASTE MANAG AssOc. (2019; 69:11) 1267-1276. Attached hereto as Exhibit F is a true and
22 correct copy of this scientific study. Volatile organic compounds are air contaminants regulated under
23 the federal Clean Air Act and California's State Implementation Plan.

24 36. Cannabis operations also generate hazardous waste. Examples of hazardous waste

25 generated by cannabis operations include pesticides or other chemicals used in the cultivation process,
26 solvents or other chemicals used in the production of cannabis concentrate, and cannabis soaked in a
27 flammable solvent for purposes of producing a cannabis concentrate. Indoor practices involving
28 hydroponics yield contaminated wastewater that may be introduced into or circumvent wastewater

F streams. Mills 2021 [Exhibit E]. Moreover, cultivators commonly use non-degrading growing media,
2 such as mineral wool that is saturated with nutrient-laden water, that is typically sent to landfill after

3 each harvest. Id. An operation with 100,000 square feet of canopy requires 14,000 to 34,000 cubic feet
4 of mineral wool per cycle, which results in the generation of approximately to 85,000 to 200,000 cubic
5 feet of solid waste to landfill over a year with six growing cycles. Id.

6 37. The City requires indoor cannabis cultivation facilities to complete a cursory "CEQA
7 Checklist" prior to approval. The CEQA Checklist requires, among other things, project proponents to

8 enroll in the City's "renewable 100 option" program. This "program" is nothing more than meaningless
9 greenwashing. Indoor cannabis cultivation requires far more energy than the state's current renewable
10 energy sources could ever supply. Evan Mills, California: a cannabis-climate train wreck in progress
11 (2021). A true and correct copy of this study is attached hereto as Exhibit G. The energy for indoor
12 cannabis cultivation operations comes almost entirely from climate-killing fossil-fuel sources- which is
13 anathema to Oakland's clean energy goals. Id. For example, Oakland's Equitable Climate Action Plan
14 enacted in 2020 requires significant greenhouse gas reductions through, among other things, "aligning
15 permit and project approvals" with the City's greenhouse gas reduction priorities. Inexplicably, the City
16 has not applied this policy to indoor cannabis cultivation facilities.

17 38. Yet, despite the significant environmental impacts from indoor cannabis cultivation
18 facilities, the City has exempted hundreds of cannabis cultivation facilities from CEQA-facilities that

19 are concentrated in overburdened communities of color such as East Oakland.

20 Respondents Improper Approval of the I Metal, Inc. and DSF Management, Inc. Projects

21 39. Respondents recently approved two large indoor cannabis cultivation operations in East
22 Oakland a community of color that is overburdened by industrial pollution. The City exempted each

23 of these energy-intensive projects from CEQA review based on a one-page boilerplate Notice of
24 Exemption.

25 40. The I Metal facility is in East Oakland. I Metal proposes to construct an indoor cannabis
26 cultivation facility that will occupy approximately 2,400 square feet of a 8,712 square foot facility.
27 Metal completed the City's CEQA Checklist on or around April 20, 2022, indicating that the project will

28
9
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE & COMPLAINT FOR DELCARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

F require "New Construction." The City Clerk issued I Metal a Notice of Exemption from CEQA on

2 September 16, 2020. See CEQA Checklist and Notice of Exemption [Exhibit A].

3 41. The DSF Management facility is also located in East Oakland. DSF Management
4 proposes to construct an indoor cannabis cultivation facility that will occupy approximately 7,280 square
5 feet of a facility of unknown size (though the Notice of Exemption lists the facility size at 18,000 square
6 feet.) DSF Management completed the City's CEQA Checklist on or around July 11, 2022. The City
7 issued DSF Management an undated and unsigned Notice of Exemption from CEQA. See CEQA
8 Checklist and Notice of Exemption [Exhibit A].

9 42. The City's I Metal and DSF Management Notices of Exemption from CEQA are
10 identical. Both Notices of Exemption state that the project is categorically exempt from CEQA under

11 the "Existing Facilities" exemption, 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15301 (despite Metal indicating "New
12 Construction"). Both Notices of Exemption further state that the project is exempt under the "Other"
13 exemption for "projects consistent with a community plan, general plan, or zoning," citing 14 Cal. Code
14 Regs. § 15183(f). Both Notices of Exemption state as the "[r]eason why project is exempt" that "[t]he
15 Applicant is proposing to operate as a[n] indoor cannabis cultivator in an existing commercial facility
16 and will use non-fossil fuel services to power the operation. Further, the use of indoor cannabis
17 cultivation is permitted at the discretion of the City Administrator under Chapter 5.81 of the Oakland
18 Municipal Code. Thus, the proposed use will not a have a significant effect on the environment." See

19 Exhibit A.

20 43. The City's determination as to the projects' exemption from CEQA precluded any public

21 CEQA process, restricting opportunities for meaningful public participation and public comments
22 concerning the location and potential impacts of the proposed projects.

23 The City's Pattern and Practice of Exempting All Indoor
Cannabis Cultivation Operations from CEQA 24

25 44. The City has approved hundreds of indoor cannabis facilities without ensuring that there

26 is sufficient electricity from the grid for the facilities to operate. As a result of the City's failure to

27 conduct CEQA review, numerous facilities have been using massive diesel generators to supply power

28 to their energy-intensive facilities. One such facility, Green Sage Management, LLC, operated nine

F semi-truck size diesel generators twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, for over two years. The

2 City did nothing to stop them. It was not until EDP obtained a federal injunction that the generators at

3 the Green Sage facility were shut down. See Environmental Democracy Project v. Green Sage

5 45. The City has also exempted hundreds of indoor cannabis cultivation facilities from
6 CEQA review without considering their impacts on water during a time of severe drought in California.
7 Cannabis is a water- and nutrient-intensive crop. Indoor cannabis cultivation consumes approximately
8 2.5 and 2.8 gallons of water per day per plant in August and September. Zhonghua Zheng, A narrative

9 environmental impacts of cannabis cultivation Journal of Cannabis Research (2021). A true review on

10 and correct copy of this scientific study is attached hereto as Exhibit H. The water demand for cannabis
growing far exceeds the water needs of many commodity crops. Id. For example, in a growing season 11

12 cannabis plants need twice as much water as that required by maize, soybean, and wheat plants. Id.
13 46. The City has never conducted CEQA review for any of the hundreds of indoor cannabis
14 cultivation facilities it has approved. The only effort the City makes regarding CEQA is to require the
15 project proponent to fill out a "Preliminary Checklist for Cannabis Operators Pursuant to California
16 Environmental Quality Act." The CEQA Checklist does not require the applicant to identify any
17 potentially significant environmental impacts from the proposed project such as energy consumption,
18 access to the grid, air pollution, water use, traffic, noise, odors, or hazardous waste. Once the checklist
19 is complete, the City automatically grants a Notice of Exemption or otherwise exempts the facility from

20 CEQA review.

21 47. Indeed, the City candidly represents that Notices of Exemption are automatically granted
22 for all indoor cannabis cultivation facilities: "Completed CEQA questionnaires will be reviewed by the
23 Planning Department and a Notice of Exemption (NOE) will be issued. Applicants will be notified to
24 pick up the NOE and an Inspection Card will then be issued. Applicants will then file the NOE
25 document with the County Recorder's Office and supply our office with the stamped copy" (emphasis
26 added.) A true and correct copy of the City's webpage entitled "Apply for a Cannabis Permit" if

F 48. EDP requested public documents regarding all cannabis facilities approved by the City.

2 To date, the City has produced 2,298 "CEQA Checklists" along with a smaller number of Notices of
3 Exemption for cannabis projects the City has approved. All of the 2,298 applications for cannabis
4 facilities were exempted from CEQA by the City.

5 49. For example, one project proponent identified the following major additions necessary to
6 turn its facility into a state-of-the-art indoor cannabis cultivation operation:

7 "Renovation of partial existing warehouse (6500SF out of 7600SF) for the use of

8 cannabis cultivation, distribution, and delivery to include approximately:
9 3 Cultivation Rooms

10 130 LED Cultivation Lights, Tables, and Irrigation System

11 60 Tons of AC

12 CO2 (Delivered Liquid) Supply System

13 Supply and Exhaust Fans for Each Room
14 Dry/Storage Rooms, Office

15 Add Fire Sprinkler System and Fire/CO2 Alarm"
16 A true and correct copy of the "CEQA Checklist" and Notice of Exemption for Emerald Wizards, Inc. is
17 attached hereto as Exhibit J. Despite these significant additions to transform the facility into a major
18 cannabis cultivation operation, the City exempted the project from CEQA as an "Existing Facility."
19 50. In another instance, the City exempted a cannabis cultivation facility from CEQA review
20 based on its representation that the project would use "high energy efficiency bulbs, low flow toilets and

21 water systems, and a strict recycling program .. . to mitigate our environmental impacts." A true and
22 correct copy of the CEQA Checklist for DC Capital Holdings LLC is attached hereto as Exhibit K.
23 However, following approval, this facility operated massive diesel-fired generators twenty-four hours a
24 day for two years because the facility lacked power supply from the grid- -yet another example of the
25 City's pattern and practice of violating CEQA at the expense of the overburdened communities of color
26 in which these facilities are located.

27 The City's Improper Use of Categorical Exemptions to Evade CEQA Review

28
12
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE & COMPLAINT FOR DELCARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

F 51. In issuing boilerplate Notices of Exemption to cannabis cultivation applicants, the City
2 overwhelmingly relies on (1) the categorical exemption for "existing facilities" under 14 Cal. Code
3 Regs. § 15301; (2) an exemption for "[p]rojects consistent with a community plan, general plan or
4 zoning" citing 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15183(f); (3) an assertion that the facilities "will use non-fossil fuel
5 services to power the operation," and (4) the City Administrator's discretion to permit indoor cannabis
6 cultivation under Oakland Municipal Code § 5.81. Each of these reasons for exempting cannabis
7 cultivation operations from CEQA fails.

8 A. The Existing Facilities Exemption.

9 52. The City incorrectly, and uniformly, relies on the categorical exemption for "existing
10 facilities" under 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15301 (the Existing Facilities Exemption) to exempt indoor

11 cannabis cultivation projects. The Existing Facilities Exemption only applies to activities involving
12 "negligible" or "no expansion of [an] existing or former use." 14 Cal. Code § Regs. § 15301. This class

13 of exemption "consists of the operation, repair, maintenance, permitting, leasing, licensing, or minor
14 alteration of existing . facilities." Id. In determining whether a project falls into this exempt class, the
15 "key consideration is whether the project involves negligible or no expansion of use." Id. Accordingly,
16 "[t]he relevant issue in determining whether the existing facilities exemption applies is whether the
17 project involves 'expansion of a use beyond that existing or former use.' San Diegans for Open
18 Government v. City of San Diego (2018) 31 Cal.App.5th 349, 371 (emphasis in original).

19 53. The conversion of storage warehouses, factories, auto shops, and other existing structures
20 into state-of-the-art "grow rooms" constructed as isolated ecosystems for the cultivation of cannabis are

21 not "negligible" modifications or "no expansion of [an] existing or former use." These indoor cannabis
22 cultivation projects are in fact wholly new usesnot minor modifications to an existing use. The

23 projects require the addition of equipment capable of providing high-intensity lighting, CO2 generation,
24 ventilation, irrigation, climate control, diesel-truck trips, generators, and security, requiring massive

25 amounts of electricity, water, and alterations to the site. In fact, cannabis cultivation was not a legally
26 permitted use of any facility in Oakland prior to 2016, well after the erection of the vast majority of the
27 structures now being converted to this purpose. These major transformations to indoor cannabis

28
13
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE & COMPLAINT FOR DELCARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

F cultivation facilities are not minor alterations to an existing use. Thus, the Existing Facilities exemption
2 does not apply.

3 B. Exemption for Projects Consistent with a Community Plan, General Plan, or
Zoning. 4 54. The exemption for "Projects Consistent with a Community Plan, General Plan, or
5 Zoning" does not justify the City's uniform exemption of all indoor cannabis cultivation operations from
6 CEQA. See 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15183. That exemption provides that: "CEQA mandates that projects
7 which are consistent with the development density established by existing zoning, community plan, or
8 general plan policies for which an EIR was certified shall not require additional environmental review,

9 except as might be necessary to examine whether there are project-specific significant effects which are
10 peculiar to the project or its site." Here, the City does not identify any EIR that was certified that
11 governs indoor cannabis cultivation facilities. Even if there were such an EIR, indoor cannabis
12 cultivation facilities have "project-specific significant effects which are peculiar to the project"
13 including stunning energy-use requirements, diesel particulate matter pollution, odors, noise, traffic, and
14 hazardous waste.

15 C. The Projects Require an Enormous Amounts of Fossil Fuels.
16 55. It is patently false that the projects will "use non-fossil fuel services to power the
17 operation." See Notice of Exemption [Exhibit A]. Because of the staggering amount of power needed
18 for indoor cultivation facilities, massive amounts of fossil-fuel sources are required. Indoor cannabis
19 cultivation operations require twenty-four hour continuous energy to ensure their product meets control
20 standards. Warren 2015 [Exhibit C]. There is not enough renewable energy resources in the entire state
21 to supply the energy demand of indoor cultivation. Mills 2021 [Exhibit E].
22 D. The City's Discretion to Permit Indoor Cannabis Operations.
23 56. The City mistakenly supports issuing boilerplate Notices of Exemption to proposed
24 indoor cannabis cultivation projects with the statement: "the use of indoor cannabis cultivation is
25 permitted at the discretion of the City Administrator under Chapter 5.81 of the Oakland Municipal Code.
26 Thus, the proposed use will not have a significant effect on the environment." See Notice of Exemption
27 [Exhibit A]. CEQA, however, expressly applies to discretionary projects. Moreover, the City has
28
14
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE & COMPLAINT FOR DELCARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

F utterly failed to exercise its discretion to ensure that cannabis operations will have a negligible
2 environmental impact as the City contends.

3 57. Discretionary projects (as opposed to ministerial projects) are subject to CEQA review.
4 Pub. Res. Code § 21080(a); see also Protecting Our Water & Envt'l Resources v. County of Stanislaus
5 (2020) 10 Cal.5th 479, 488. "CEQA applies in situations where a governmental agency can use its
6 judgment in deciding whether and how to carry out or approve a project. A project subject to such
7 judgmental controls is called a *discretionary project.™" 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15002(i); see also id. con
8 15357. The City's Notices of Exemption correctly state that these projects are approved at the City's
9 discretion. Thus, CEQA applies.

10 58. Oakland Municipal Code section 5.81 provides in pertinent part that "[t]he City
11 Administrator shall establish criteria for minimizing the carbon footprint, environmental impact and
12 resource needs of permitted facilities. Applicants that demonstrate they can satisfy these environmental
13 criteria, such as cultivators seeking to operate greenhouse facilities, will be given preference in the
14 processing of their application." Oak. Muni. Code § 5.81.050(C) (emphasis added). The City's
15 Administrative Regulations for Cannabis Operators further clarify "[t]he City, in its discretion ... may
16 determine that either: (1) a CEQA exemption applies and a Notice of Exemption is appropriate, or (2)
17 further environmental study may be needed." 2021-2022 Administrative Regulations and
18 Performance Standards for City of Oakland Cannabis Operators 142.

19 59. The Municipal Code and Administrative Regulations do not support the City's
20 conclusory assertion that its discretion in permitting cannabis operations exempts them from CEQA

21 while ensuring that they "will not have significant effect on the environment." See Notice of
22 Exemption [Exhibit A]. Rather, the City's discretion triggers CEQA, and most certainly does not ensure
23 that these facilities will have a negligible environmental impact.

24 E. The Exceptions to Any Categorical Exemptions Apply Here.

25 60. Even where categorical exemptions apply, they are not absolute. CEQA provides several
26 exceptions when exemptions must be denied. See 14 Cal. Code. Regs. § 15300.2. Relevant here are the
27 "cumulative impact" and "unusual circumstances" exceptions under section 15300.2 (b) and (c). Each
28 exception is applicable to the City's permitting of cannabis cultivation operations.
15
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE & COMPLAINT FOR DELCARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

61. The "cumulative impact" exception applies where the cumulative impact of successive
2 projects of the same type in the same place is significant. 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15300.2(b). CEQA §

3 provides that the "cumulative impacts from several projects is the change in the environment which
4 results from the incremental impact of the project when added to other closely related past, present, and
5 reasonably foreseeable probable future projects. Cumulative impacts can result from individually minor
6 but collectively significant projects taking place over a period of time." Id. Op 15355(b); See Pub. Res.
7 Code § 21083(b)(2).

8 62. Here, the City has approved hundreds of indoor cannabis cultivation operations. A great

9 many of them are in East Oakland. Applications for and approvals of these projects have steadily and
10 exponentially increased in the years since the City began permitting indoor cannabis cultivation. See
11 City of Oakland Cannabis Regulatory Commission 2019-2020 Annual Reports, Attachment D: 2017-
12 2020 City of Oakland Cannabis Application and Permit Trends. A true and correct copy of this
13 Attachment D is Attached hereto as Exhibit L. East Oakland has a significant amount of closely related

14 past and present cannabis cultivation projects. And future projects of the same type and in the same
15 place are reasonably foreseeable. The cumulative impact of these operations on East Oakland- each
16 demanding unavailable quantities of electricity, each emitting carbon dioxide, increasing traffic, and
17 producing hazardous waste-are significant. Therefore, the "cumulative impact" exception applies.

18 63. CEQA's "unusual circumstances" exception negates the finding of an exemption "where
19 there is a reasonable possibility that the project will have a significant effect on the environment due to
20 unusual circumstances." 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15300.2(c). "Unusual circumstances" are those that
21 "differ from the general circumstances of the projects covered by the particular categorical exemption"
22 and which "create an environmental risk that does not exist for the general class of exempt projects."
23 Azusa, 52 Cal.App.4th at 1207.

24 64. Despite the City's formulaic reliance on the Existing Facility Exemption for indoor
25 cannabis cultivation projects, the conversion of storage warehouses, factories, auto shops, and other
26 existing structures into state-of-the-art "grow rooms" constructed as isolated ecosystems, differs greatly
27 from the general circumstances (i.e. "negligible" modifications or "no expansion of [an] existing or
28 former use.") that fall within that exemption. Adding equipment capable of providing high-intensity
16
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE & COMPLAINT FOR DELCARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

F lighting, CO2 generation, ventilation, irrigation, climate control, and security, requiring massive
2 amounts of electricity, water, and alterations to the site, are indeed unusual circumstances
3 circumstances that have only legally existed in Oakland since 2016. Thus, CEQA's "unusual
4 circumstances" exception applies to indoor cannabis cultivation projects in East Oakland.

5 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

6 Violations of the California Environmental Quality Act
Injunctive and Declaratory Relief
7 (Against City of Oakland, Planning Department, City Administrator, and Real Parties in Interest)
8 65. EDP realleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in their entirety.
9 66. CEQA is designed to ensure that government agencies incorporate the goal of long-term
10 protection of the environment into their decisions that may affect the environment. CEQA applies to
11 any discretionary action taken by an agency that may cause a reasonably foreseeable change in the
12 Il environment.
13 67. In furtherance of its goal of environmental protection, CEQA requires that the lead
14 agency prepare an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for a project whenever substantial evidence in
15 the record supports a fair argument that the project may have a significant impact on the environment.
16 As the cornerstone of the CEQA process, the EIR must disclose and analyze a project's potentially
17 significant environmental impacts. In addition, the EIR also must inform decision-makers and the
18 public of feasible mitigation measures and alternative project designs or elements that would lessen or
19 avoid the project's significant adverse environmental impacts.
20 68. CEQA also mandates that the lead agency adopt all feasible mitigation measures that
21 would reduce or avoid any of the project's significant environmental impacts. If any of the project's
22 significant impacts cannot be mitigated to a less-than-significant level, the project can be approved only
23 if the agency finds that the project's benefits would outweigh its unavoidable impacts.
24 69. Under CEQA, all findings required for any agency's approval of a project must be legally
25 adequate and supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record. CEQA further requires that
26 an agency provide an explanation of how the evidence in the record supports the conclusions that the
27 agency has reached.
28
17
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE & COMPLAINT FOR DELCARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

F 70. The City found the Real Parties' proposed projects are exempt from CEQA under the
2 "Existing Facilities" exemption, 14 C.C.R. § 15301. The projects do not meet the requirement for the
3 Existing Facilities exemption because they are new uses-not modifications to an existing use. The

4 projects require the addition of new infrastructure state-of-the-art "grow rooms" constructed as isolated
5 ecosystems. Moreover, the projects will use massive amounts of electricity to power high-intensity
6 discharge lights including intensive lighting. The projects will also likely use C02 generators, requiring
7 even more electricity. These major indoor cannabis cultivation facilities are not minor alterations to the
8 existing use. Thus, the "Existing Facilities" exemption does not apply.

9 71. The findings made by the City and Cannabis Regulatory Commission asserting that the
10 project is exempt from CEQA constitute an abuse of discretion and failure to proceed in a manner

11 required by law. This abuse of discretion and failure to proceed in a manner required by law is
12 prejudicial. Thus, Respondents' decisions to approve the project must be set aside.

13 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

14 Illegal Pattern and Practice of Exempting Indoor Cannabis Cultivation Facilities from CEQA Review 15 Injunctive and Declaratory Relief
16 (Against City of Oakland and Cannabis Regulatory Commission)

17 72. EDP hereby realleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in their
18 entirety.

19 73. The City has an ongoing pattern and practice of approving hundreds of indoor cannabis
20 cultivation operations without CEQA review. The City has effectively determined that the indoor

21 cannabis cultivation industry is uniformly exempt from CEQA. The City made this determination
22 without public notice or an opportunity for public participation.

23 74. CEQA requires each public agency to conduct an Initial Study and prepare an EIR
24 when the agency proposes to approve or carry out a discretionary project that may have a significant
25 impact on the environment. These projects include the issuance of permits. Respondents' issuance
26 of building and other permits to indoor cannabis cultivation operations is a discretionary act subject

27 to CEQA. CEQA requires that Respondents evaluate and disclose significant environmental impacts

28
18
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE & COMPLAINT FOR DELCARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

F from indoor cannabis cultivation facilities, and impose all feasible mitigation measures and consider
2 alternatives that will reduce the impact to a level of insignificance. 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15092(b).

3 75. Respondents have exempted hundreds of indoor cannabis cultivation facilities from
4 CEQA-facilities that have the potential to cause significant impacts on the environment. EDP has
5 reviewed thousands of pages of public records regarding indoor cannabis operations in the City.
6 EDP is not aware of the City ever requiring CEQA review for an indoor cannabis cultivation
7 facility. Thus, the City has a pattern and practice of evading CEQA review for all indoor cannabis
8 cultivation facilities.

9 76. Respondents abused their discretion and failed to proceed in the manner required by

10 CEQA by approving hundreds of cannabis cultivation projects that have the potential to cause
11 significant environmental impacts including energy use, greenhouse gas emissions, diesel particulate
12 matter emissions, traffic, odor, noise, and hazardous waste. The City's abuse of discretion and failure to
13 proceed in the manner required by law is prejudicial. Thus, the City's pattern and practice of evading
14 CEQA must be declared unlawful and enjoined.

15 77. a There is a present and actual existing controversy between EDP and Respondents as
16 to the legality of Respondents' ongoing pattern and practice of evading CEQA review of cannabis
17 cultivation projects. Petitioner contends that Respondents are in violation CEQA in each of the
18 respects alleged above. Respondents have not agreed to remedy the violations despite Petitioner's
19 attempt to resolve this matter outside of the judicial context. Instead, Respondents believe that
20 their conduct and repeated pattern of conduct is in accord with the law. As Supervising Deputy
21 City Attorney Brian Mulry said in an email to counsel for EDP: Respondents' actions were "made
22 pursuant to, and consistent with, City Code and State law requirements."

23 78. Petitioner is entitled to a judicial determination of the rights and obligations of
24 Respondents with respect to their pattern and practice of exempting cannabis cultivation
25 projects from CEQA.

HOTBOXING THE POLAR BEAR:
THE ENERGY AND CLIMATE IMPACTS OF INDOOR
MARIJUANA CULTIVATION

GINA S. WARREN*

ABSTRACT
Indoor marijuana cultivation is currently legal-at least at some levelin all but eight states in the United States. This Article explores the energy and climate harms caused by the budding industry and recommends that state regulators and
public utility companies work together to ensure that those harms are mitigated. Indoor marijuana cultivation has an energy demand that rivals data centers. With energy intensities around 2,000 watts per minute, it consumes between 50 and 200 times more than an average office building and 66 times more than an average home. And, given the lucrative nature of the industry and the movement
toward legalization, its energy demand is projected to grow exponentially over the next several years. The problem is that this growth is exacerbating an already strained energy delivery system and increasing greenhouse gas emissions due to a fossil-fuel reliant grid. While moving cultivation outdoors would be the most effective way of reducing these harms, outdoor grows are prohibited, or limited, in many states and by the federal government. A small number of states and localities, however, have recognized the energy-related harms and are working to mitigate them through their licensing frameworks. This Article discusses California's new requirement to limit energy intensity or to require carbon offset purchases, Massachusetts's and Illinois's mandates for lighting efficiency, and Boulder, Colorado's renewable energy requirements and carbon offset funds. While these regulatory requirements can result in
significant out-of-pocket costs for indoor growers, this Article recommends all
states that legalize indoor cultivation implement policies to address harms
caused by overconsumption of fossil-fuel-based energy. Furthermore, public
utility companies can play a role in helping offset compliance costs and incentivizing best practices through push and pull policies that can provide incentives for energy-efficient technology, grants for studies to fully understand

INTRODUCTION
This Article discusses the energy intensity of indoor marijuana cultivation and
its harms. It looks at some of the lessons learned (or perhaps not learned) over
the last five years of marijuana legalization and offers some ideas for moving forward. While more studies are needed, it appears that commercial indoor
marijuana cultivation has an energy intensity level that rivals Internet data centers.' It requires twenty-four-hour climate control and, even at a residential
level, is a significant consumer of electricity due to lighting requirements and
temperature and climate control.2 As more states legalize marijuana cultivation, there is a concern that, if left unbridled, this electricity demand will not only result in grid vulnerabilities and blackouts but also exacerbate climate change and contribute to global warming. Part I discusses the energy demand of indoor cultivation and the prediction for future growth. Only eight states completely prohibit marijuana within their borders.3 The remaining states have either fully or partially legalized the once illicit plant.4 Furthermore, the industry has proven to be quite lucrative, and it is predicted to become fully legal in the entire United States in the future.5 As more states legalize marijuana cultivation and as states continue to require indoor cultivation and limit outdoor grows, energy demand will continue to rise.
Part II outlines two immediate concerns with the current and projected electricity demand: (1) electric grid vulnerability and (2) greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions. The U.S. electric grid is already overloaded and running on an antiquated delivery system established several decades ago.6 Utilities have disclosed that areas with high indoor marijuana cultivation have experienced blackouts and premature equipment replacement due to the stress on the system.'

2021] HOTBOXING THE POLAR BEAR 983

In addition to local grid concerns, the marijuana industry also contributes to
global GHG emissions due to the United States's reliance on fossil fuels for the majority of its electricity generation.8 This is especially problematic during a
time when the world needs to decarbonize its electricity delivery and reduce
overall energy consumption.
Part III looks at some of the lessons from the past five years and discusses state and local licensing schemes that attempt to mitigate some of the energy intensity of the indoor marijuana industry. Massachusetts and Illinois have
licensing schemes that focus on energy-efficient lighting and HVAC systems.' California's framework seeks to limit overall energy emissions,10 and both the
City of Boulder and Boulder County in Colorado tend to focus on renewable energy mandates and payment of offsets.11 While moving cultivation outdoors would no doubt be the best option from an energy and climate perspective, until that occurs, Part IV recommends that states continue (or begin) to look at state
licensing schemes as a means to control the amount and type of energy consumed by indoor cultivators. In addition, Part IV recommends that state-
regulated utilities work with indoor cultivators to help offset increased
compliance costs, better understand their energy use, incentivize clean energy
and energy-efficient technology, and penalize cultivators who consume above a
set baseline.
The Article concludes that it is time for states and state utilities to protect the energy delivery system and to mitigate unfettered GHG emissions. First, states
should consider moving cultivation outdoors. While outdoor cultivation has its
own set of environmental concerns that would need to be addressed, it would go
a long way toward alleviating its energy demands. Second, states that do require
or allow indoor cultivation need to enact a stringent framework that requires

utilization of clean energy or the payment of an offset fee substantial enough to motivate reliance on clean energy. Third, state utilities should educate indoor cultivators about their energy intensity. Electricity bills are some of the most
expensive costs for cultivators. Utilities can use push and pull policies to educate
and incentivize their customers to convert to more energy-efficient technology
and processes.

I. ENERGY DEMAND OF INDOOR CULTIVATION
Indoor marijuana cultivation has many benefits, including growers' abilities to carefully control and monitor the growing conditions.12 However, it has one major drawback: it is extremely energy intensive, requiring twenty-four-hour climate control. Exactly how much electricity does the indoor marijuana
cultivation industry require? We know it is significant, but we do not know exactly how much. The reason we do not have this information is twofold: First,
given the historical illegality of indoor cultivation, growers have not necessarily been forthcoming with their energy use. Second, as indoor cultivation has been legalized, states have mostly ignored the energy issues that go along with indoor cultivation, and they have failed to mandate or even incentivize studies that would provide a more thorough understanding of the industry's energy
intensity.13
What we do know with certainty is that it takes a lot of a electricity to run the equipment needed to sustain an around-the-clock cultivation cycle.14 "[I]ndoor grows can have energy intensities of 2,000 [watts per minute]," which is similar
to the energy intensity of data centers or somewhere between 50 and 200 times more than the average office building. 15 A 5,000 square-foot facility uses 66 times more energy than a house from the same area. 16 Even growing four plants indoors is equivalent to powering twenty-nine refrigerators.17

The three main areas of energy intensity for indoor cultivation include lighting, moisture control, and temperature control.18 Lighting tends to be the largest source of energy consumption at between 38-86%, depending on the types of lights used.19 LED lightbulbs, for example, are less energy intensive than incandescent bulbs, and a simple switch from conventional lights to LEDs
is an easy way to reduce overall energy consumption.20 Significant electricity is
also required for moisture control and temperature control-for cooling and heating of the facility.21
In 2012, it was estimated that the industry consumed some 20 billion kilowatt- hours of electricity every year and generated some $6 billion per year in energy costs.22 We also know that "electricity use increased by 36% annually between 2012 and 2016" in Colorado, and approximately 4% of Denver's electricity is consumed by indoor growers.23 Comparatively, by sector, indoor cultivation is one of the most energy-intensive industries in the United States and is on par with data centers. 24 As states have continued to legalize marijuana, there is no doubt that this number has grown-and will continue to grow-exponentially higher with consumption for legal marijuana cultivation projected to increase by 162% between 2017 and 2022.25

II. GRID VULNERABILITY AND GHG EMISSIONS
Two immediate concerns arise with this level of increased electricity demand: (1) electric grid vulnerability and (2) GHG emissions. The United States grid has long been vulnerable to blackouts caused by climate events and antiquated infrastructure. In recent years, utilities have struggled to keep demand for renewable energy and smart grid technology. This already strained, up with the fossil-fuel-dependent energy delivery system is now being challenged with an
increase in demand from data centers, electric vehicles, and the marijuana
industry. Further, GHG emissions contribute significantly to climate change and global warming due to fossil fuel electricity generation. The majority of the electricity in the United States still comes from fossil fuels, and until renewable
is energy is the dominant energy source, the energy delivery system will continue
to emit large amounts of GHG. Electric grid vulnerability. Indoor marijuana cultivators require twenty-four- hour firm (continuous) energy demand to ensure their product meets the highest
control standards.26 As a result, several utilities in the Pacific Northwest have
reported problems with higher incidents of blackouts and equipment failure and
replacement in areas with known indoor marijuana cultivation. For example,
Pacific Power in Portland, Oregon, reported seven blackouts attributable to the marijuana industry,27 and Portland General Electric reported that 10% of its transformers needed replacement due to overheating caused by indoor cultivation.28 And, risks of power outages are exponentially increasing as
"growing weed creates substantial unplanned power demands upon our already aged distribution grid infrastructure."29 When the United States power grid was constructed decades ago, no one could predict that it would need to
accommodate multiple events such as net metering, data center electricity
demand, electric vehicles, and marijuana legalization.30
GHG emissions. As energy consumption increases, so do harmful GHG
emissions. Any time we increase electricity consumption through a mostly
fossil-fuel-driven system, GHG emissions increase and climate change concerns become even more perilous.31 As of 2017, the United States was one of the biggest GHG emitters in the world.32 Per capita, the United States is only behind

Saudi Arabia and Canada.33 About 31% of United States GHG emissions come
from the electricity sector.34 In 2019, the electricity sector generated some 1,618 million metric tons ("MMmt") of the United States's total emissions of 5,146
MMmt.35 That is because the U.S. electric grid is still over 60% fossil-fuel
based.36
While the United States has made a lot of progress toward decarbonizing its electric grid, it still has a long way to go. As of 2019, U.S. electricity
consumption by energy source was 17.6% renewables, 19.6% nuclear, 38.4%
natural gas, 23.4% coal, and 1.2% other fossil fuels or about 62.6% fossil-fuel based.37 The United States has increased renewables and clean energy sources over the years and reduced reliance on coal, but it has increased reliance on natural gas.38 Furthermore, it should be noted that the 62.6% share by fossil fuels
is a nationwide statistic. To more accurately predict the amount of GHG
emissions coming from indoor cultivation, the key is to look at the electricity
portfolio in states where marijuana is legal to determine their dependence on fossil fuels. For example, in 2020, Colorado, one of the largest producers of marijuana in the country, relied on coal-fired power plants for 36% of its electricity generation, and according to 2021 numbers, fossil fuels currently generate 67% of the state's electricity with renewables making up the remaining
32%.39
Compounding the reliance on fossil fuels to supply the United States electric
grid is the global need to keep the impacts of global warming to at most 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels to avoid the harshest of climate

the cannabis industry more specifically. According to some projections, this general energy demand will continue to increase over the coming years.42 The United States's general electricity demand growth is expected to continue to

Another concern is that the indoor marijuana industry could undo state and local comprehensive climate plans to reduce carbon emissions within their jurisdictions.46 Multiple states have legislative mandates, goals, and policies in place to reduce statewide GHG emissions.47 For example, Colorado's target is to reduce emissions by 90% by 2050 (using a 2005 baseline), Massachusetts's goal is 80% by 2050 (using a 1990 baseline), and California's goal is 40% by 2030 (using a 1990 baseline).48 Without restrictions in place, the marijuana
industry could single-handedly negate any previous progress. Interestingly, Colorado has gotten creative with its attempt to capture GHG emissions and boost marijuana growth at the same time. In 2020, it initiated a

pilot program to capture the carbon dioxide emitted during the fermentation
process at local beer brewing facilities and transport it to marijuana facilities, where it is pumped into the air to speed photosynthesis.49 While this is an innovative idea on a small scale, until states can move to a zero-carbon- emissions grid, 50 the majority of electricity consumption will result in increased GHG emissions in contravention of these comprehensive plans.

III. LESSONS FROM THE PAST
When I first published on this topic in 2015,51 the legalized cannabis industry was in its infancy. As states decided how to regulate the industry, I saw an opportunity to integrate sustainable energy practices into state licensing schemes. At the time, only four states had fully legalized marijuana-Alaska,
Colorado, Oregon, and Washington. envisioned that states could mandate, as part of their licensing schemes, that marijuana growers use 100% clean energy or pay a carbon fee on a sliding scale. One big concern at the time, and still today, however, is that there simply is not enough clean energy available on the gridß2 and not enough space on the rooftops for indoor cultivators to utilize 100% clean energy. 53 In fact, by some estimates, the most rooftop solar energy can supply is "about 5% of a facility's electricity needs" due to marijuana's high energy intensity.54 a As a result, I recommended the following: One option for policymakers faced with this dilemma is to take a two- pronged approach by requiring indoor growers to pay an ever-increasing carbon fee, which would go into a fund for the development of more efficient technology and climate-friendly electricity facilities, in
conjunction with requiring growers to meet an incrementally increasing requirement to incorporate carbon-free electricity sources. Combining
these requirements would ensure growers do not become complacent just

to pay the fee. Instead, it would encourage a shift in behavior to implement
more efficient technology to keep the cost down and at the same time
encourage indoor growers and policymakers to find a solution to ending fossil-fuel consumption.55
After making this recommendation, various state regulatory entities that were interested in the concept contacted me, but none of the original states implemented clean energy standards. At the time, and still today, the City of
Boulder and Boulder County in Colorado (collectively, "Boulder") were the
only locality doing something similar.
The City of Boulder requires all commercially licensed marijuana cultivators to report their energy usage56 and to comply with 100% renewable energy targets. 57 Cultivators can meet this requirement by (1) installing on-site
renewable energy, (2) participating in a verified solar program, or (3) purchasing offsets through the city's Energy Impact Offset Fund.58 Likewise, Boulder County requires commercial cultivators to utilize 100% renewable energy or pay a 2.16 cent surcharge per kilowatt-hour of consumption.59 Fees from this surcharge go into the county's Energy Impact Offset Fund.60 Boulder County's program also has an Energy Impact Offset Fund Credit Program, which allows cultivators to receive a credit against their
usage fees for out-of-pocket costs used to install energy-efficient equipment and
technology.61 This is helpful because start-up costs for the marijuana industry are already expensive and many new growers "have limited access to capital due

In any event, the goal of both the City and the County's Energy Impact Offset
Funds is to educate the industry and create best practices for reducing energy
use and increasing reliance on clean-energy and energy-efficient technologies.
Interestingly, both funds have a secondary mission to facilitate the supply of
affordable renewable energy to low-income families.63 Through these programs, Boulder has continued to collect high-quality energy usage data and provide individualized reports to licensed indoor cultivators so that they can understand how best to lower their electricity bills
and deliver a "cleaner" product. Unfortunately, Boulder is one of the only jurisdictions in the United States that has undertaken this level of energy efficiency management.
As of January 2021, marijuana is fully legal in fifteen states Alaska,
Arizona, California, Colorado, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, Oregon, South Dakota, Vermont, Washington- plus the District of Columbia. 64 It is decriminalized in thirty-two states and legal for medicinal purposes in more than two dozen states.65 At this point, it is probably easier to list the remaining eight states where it is still fully illegal Alabama, Idaho, Kansas, Nebraska, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Wyoming.66 And, many predict that marijuana will receive federal legal status in the coming years.67 The industry is a very lucrative one, generating a lot of money and raising a lot of taxes in legalized states. According to one report, "[T]he total economic impact of legal cannabis sales [is projected to] increase[] from $38 billion-$46 billion in 2019 to $106 billion-$130 billion by 2024 - a 181% increase."68
Given this exponential growth of legal marijuana growing in the United
States,69 it follows that electricity consumption will exponentially grow as well.

This is further exacerbated by the fact that the majority of states prohibit outdoor
growing and require commercial growers to maintain secure indoor growing
facilities.70
Most states have done little to nothing to limit the negative externalities of indoor cultivation, and they are seeing skyrocketing electricity demands, failed comprehensive climate plans, and increased occurrences of blackouts and grid vulnerability.71 No jurisdiction has been hit harder than California,72 the largest producer of cannabis in the nation, which has begun to rethink unbridled
marijuana electricity consumption with new limits on energy GHG emissions and requirements to purchase carbon offsets for excess emissions.73 Two additional states Massachusetts and Illinois have utilized their licensing
authority to encourage, or in some instances mandate, energy efficiency. While neither mandate use of renewable/clean energy, they do put some additional limitations on lighting.
California. California fully legalized marijuana in 2016. Its initial licensing
scheme contained no clean energy requirements or electricity monitoring
provisions. Due to concerns with unfettered electricity use, however, the
framework was amended to incorporate emission intensity mandates. Beginning in 2022, indoor cultivators will be required to report their energy usage.74 And, beginning in 2023, growers will be required to "ensure that electrical power used for commercial cannabis activity meets the average electricity greenhouse gas emissions intensity required by their local utility provider pursuant to the California Renewables Portfolio Standard Program . . .$75 If it exceeds the emissions intensity, the cultivator will be required to purchase carbon offsets to
cover the excess.76 By some estimates, the main avenue for cultivators to comply with this limitation will be to convert existing lighting to LEDs or to pay the

only about 4% of indoor cultivators relied on LED lighting.78 Massachusetts. Massachusetts fully legalized marijuana in 2016.
Massachusetts's statutory framework for marijuana cultivators is quite extensive,79 but it became more so in July 2020, when it required applicants to comply with energy efficiency and reporting standards.80 All medical and adult- use growers of marijuana must comply with the new provisions.81 To assist in
understanding Massachusetts law, the Cannabis Control Commission issued a
fifty-seven-page "Energy and Environment Compiled Guidance" document for growers.82 To apply for a license to operate, applicants must show that they have created and maintained "written operating procedures that demonstrate compliance with the energy efficiency standards in the regulations.?83 This operating plan must
describe how the cultivator will achieve a reduction of energy and increased
efficiency, its efforts to utilize utility efficiency programs, and its efforts to
incorporate renewable energy.84 Annually, the successful candidate must show
its energy usage and water consumption as part of the license renewal process.85
As noted above, one of the largest areas of energy intensity for indoor
cultivation is the lighting system that is required to keep the plants warm and
growing twenty-four hours per day. Massachusetts's Department of Energy
Resources noted that a failure to address the lighting situation could negate the
benefits of all LED bulbs installed in Massachusetts's streetlight replacement

The industry has expressed concern that these restrictions will be too burdensome and have a discriminatory impact on smaller cultivators.%6 No doubt
replacing conventional lights with LEDs and incorporating more energy-
efficient technologies will be expensive without proper state and utility
incentives, discussed in Part IV. According to one estimate, it could cost as much
as "$62,000 for each 1,000 square feet of growing canopy."97 Greater restrictions
also have the potential to cause some cultivators to go underground,98 some
cultivators to use deceptive reporting practices,99 or corporate growers to run out the moms-and-pops.100 While this is not a new argument against greater regulatory restrictions, it is concern that should be closely monitored as states proceed with clean energy directives.

IV. IDEAS FOR THE FUTURE
Two immediate energy needs arise with indoor cultivation. First is the need to reduce grower's overall energy consumption and alleviate some of the stress on the electric grid. Second is the need to fuel switch from fossil fuels to
renewable clean energy and reduce GHG emissions. Evan Mills and Scott Zeramby, who have been researching this topic for about
a decade, argue that the only way to meet these needs is to move marijuana
grows outdoors because clean energy and energy-efficient technology will not be enough to actually mitigate the climate damage caused by indoor

(noting that Massachusetts and Illinois offer use of horticultural lighting as route for E compliance with energy efficiency regulations). While it is commendable that California acknowledges and is attempting to rectify the situation, the problem with a wattage-per-
square-foot requirement is that growers could simply install more fixtures to meet the
limitations.
100 Ryan Stoa and others have raised concerns that the regulation of marijuana and some
of the controls exerted can result in socioeconomic disparities and create discriminatory
practices in marijuana licensing and regulation. See, e.g., Ryan B. Stoa, Equity in Cannabis Agriculture, 101 B.U.L.

cultivators.101 They argue, "[T]here is a degree of naïve optimism and hubris that cultivators need only 'go solar' to solve the problem of any remaining energy requirements after efficiencies have been captured.»102 To them, the only viable solution is to move the cultivation back outdoors, where it belongs.103 I do not disagree with this premise.104 Outdoor cultivation would certainly alleviate the majority of the industry's energy demand, as indoor cultivation requires over thirteen times more power to grow one gram of marijuana as
compared to outdoor cultivation.105 One main problem is that the federal
government and most states prohibit (or at least significantly limit) outdoor
marijuana cultivation.
The Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 ("2018 Farm Bill'') provided a level of hope when it legalized some outdoor cannabis grows, but it also created
some confusion along the way.106 The 2018 Farm Bill reclassifies marijuana with low tetrahydrocannabinol ("THC"') levels as "hemp" and defines hemp as
cannabis leaves, buds, and germinating seeds with a THC concentration of 0.3%
or less.107 The 2018 Farm Bill places regulatory authority on the states for

outdoor cultivation of "hemp" and requires states that choose to regulate it to establish a plan for tracking, testing, inspecting, and disposing of the product.108 If the state does not establish a plan, the federal government will regulate it through the Department of Agriculture.109 The 2018 Farm Bill also allows for the transportation in interstate commerce110 of hemp and lessens penalties for violations of state and federal plans.111 The confusion lies with the 2018 Farm Bill's definition of hemp, "the plant's complicated biology," and an inability of law enforcement to determine the difference between hemp and marijuana.112 Local law enforcement made two high-profile arrests in 2019 when truck drivers attempted to transport what they believed was legally certified hemp across state lines.113 As noted by one commentator, "The newly enacted legislation does not mean that hemp will immediately become a cash crop or that farmers can grow it as freely as they do corn, soybeans, wheat or tobacco."114 While it appears to be a step toward the federal legalization of cannabis and an opportunity to grow at least some types of cannabis outdoors,115 the 2018 Farm Bill is not consistently applied and gives
states the authority to prohibit any hemp harvests within their borders as well as the authority to require cannabis be grown indoors.116

This leads us back to the problem at hand-most marijuana is currently cultivated indoors due to federal legal hurdles and state mandates (or due to poor growing climates). Until this indoor cultivation mindset changes, state regulators
and public utility companies should work together to mitigate the immediate
harms caused by unfettered energy consumption. State licensing schemes. State regulators are in good position to control the amount and type of electricity consumed through their state licensing schemes. They can mandate growers utilize only clean energy, limit energy intensity, and require energy-efficient technologies as a condition of licensing. As more states create licensing schemes that require indoor cultivation, they should look to Boulder's clean energy requirements and offset fund management as well as California's emissions restrictions as baseline models. Massachusetts and
Illinois each require environmental plans and limit lighting intensity, but again, neither requires clean energy nor limits the overall energy intensity of the a facility. As a result, energy consumption will continue to increase, which will strain the energy delivery system, and GHG emissions will continue to increase,
which will contribute to overall global warming.
Utility incentives. In addition. state-regulated utilities are well situated to
educate indoor cultivators and to incentivize clean and efficient energy
consumption through push-and-pull policies including energy audits, rebates
and incentives, grants, and surcharges. When marijuana emerged as a legal state industry, many utilities were very concerned about even supplying electricity to marijuana cultivators, let alone creating incentive programs for them.117 With marijuana federally illegal, banks, utilities, and other similar service suppliers were concerned that they could be subjected to fines or criminal charges if they assisted those involved in the marijuana industry.118 Even though banking can still be a gray area, state- regulated utilities are more confident in their abilityand their obligation-to meet the energy needs of their marijuana customers. That is because, in the United States, electricity is regulated through a
cooperative federalism model. Pursuant to the Federal Power Act, the federal
government, through the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC"), regulates wholesale sales of electricity in interstate commerce, and states, through state public utility commissions, regulate the retail distribution of electricity. In fact, the FERC is prohibited from regulating or interfering with
the retail distribution of electricity.119 State public utility commission
regulations mandate that utilities serve their retail customers in a

ENV'T L.J. 55, 56 (2018) (discussing role of state utility companies in supplying electricity to federally illegal marijuana growers). 118 See, e.g., id. at 77 ("While unlikely, public utilities could face criminal prosecution for providing service to marijuana grows."). 119 16 U.S.C. § 824(a)-(b).

nondiscriminatory manner.120 This means that utilities must supply electricity to anyone seeking the service at the same rate and on the same basis as others within the same customer category. It is possible that a utility receiving federal funding or receiving power from a federally owned energy source could still run up against concerns; 121 however, most utilities are fully funded through their
intrastate retail consumer base and regulated by their state public utility
commission.122
Some areas in which utilities can make a big difference in offsetting
compliance costs, reducing consumption, and increasing efficiencies include energy audits, incentives, grants, and surcharges. 123 Energy audits. As noted at the beginning of this Article, one of the biggest problems with addressing the energy consumption issue is actually knowing exactly how much energy is being consumed and what aspects of the indoor cultivation process have the highest energy intensity.124 Lighting is an obvious
area of energy intensity, but studies and on-site audits would provide additional information for growers and utilities alike. To incentivize growers to evaluate their electricity usage, some utilities are offering energy audits at discounted
prices. For example, National Grid's program in Massachusetts will defray 75%
of the cost to study the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning and lighting
systems.125
Utility incentives and grants. Reducing emissions intensity will no doubt
increase out-of-pocket costs for growers, but it will also reduce monthly electricity costs, which should offset the costs over time. The indoor cultivator's electricity bill is one of the biggest expenses incurred during the cultivation process with monthly bills ranging between $3,000 and $100,000.126 Utilities can provide incentives by reducing the costs of electricity in exchange for greater

energy efficiency and utilization of more energy-efficient technology. Puget Sound Energy in Washington, for example, offers an incentive of $0.20 per kilowatt-hour of first-year savings, up to 100% of the incremental cost of more efficient equipment.127 Likewise, some utilities are offering grants, which are nonrepayable funds given in exchange for energy efficiency, to growers who install energy-efficient technology. For example, Efficiency Maine may pay up to 50% of a project's cost (up to $1 million) for LED lights and energy-efficient HVAC systems.128 Interestingly, Efficiency Maine had originally banned
offering incentives to marijuana growers due to concerns that the federal government would crack down on the marijuana industry. 129 It was only in October 2020 that it voted to lift the ban.130 In any event, providing these types of incentives that lower the grower's electricity bill can be appealing to a grower and beneficial for an overloaded utility.131
Surcharges and taxes. The above types of incentives use the proverbial carrot
to encourage growers to become more energy conscious. Another option is using
the stick- -a surcharge or tax for electricity consumed above a certain baseline. It has always baffled me that some utilities will provide discounts for higher energy usage. It is not uncommon for the first 500 kilowatts of electricity to be
$0.10 per kilowatt, but after that, it goes down to $0.095 per kilowatt.132 Given the climate damage caused by energy consumption, this seems extremely counterintuitive and harmful. Some jurisdictions are catching on, however, and
reversing course. For example, Arcata, California is leveraging a 45% surcharge
or tax on customers who use more than 600% of an energy consumption

CONCLUSION
Indoor cultivation of marijuana is not green. With a U.S. grid that is still primarily fossil-fuel based, it is more a smoky brown than green, placing the polar bear134 in the notorious hotbox.135 Moving cultivation outdoors would be the best option, but until that happens (1) states that legalize marijuana should establish responsible licensing frameworks that mitigate the industry's energy consumption; and (2) state-regulated utilities should work with cultivators to
provide energy audits, offer incentives and grants for clean energy alternatives,
and penalize costumers whose energy intensity is over an established baseline.

Abstract

The emergent industry of indoor Cannabis production - legal in some jurisdictions and illicit in
others - utilizes highly energy intensive processes to control environmental conditions during
cultivation. This article estimates the energy consumption for this practice in the United States at
1% of national electricity use, or $6 billion each year. One average kilogram of final product is
associated with 4600 kg of carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere, or that of 3 million average
U.S. cars when aggregated across all national production. The practice of indoor cultivation is
driven by criminalization, pursuit of security, pest and disease management, and the desire for
greater process control and yields. Energy analysts and policymakers have not previously addressed
this use of energy. The unchecked growth of electricity demand in this sector confounds energy
forecasts and obscures savings from energy efficiency programs and policies. While criminalization
has contributed to the substantial energy intensity, legalization would not change the situation
materially without ancillary efforts to manage energy use, provide consumer information via
labeling, and other measures. Were product prices to fall as a result of legalization, indoor
production using current practices could rapidly become non-viable.

Highlights

1. Introduction
On occasion, previously unrecognized spheres of energy use come to light. Important historical
examples include the pervasive air leakage from ductwork in homes, the bourgeoning energy
intensity of computer datacenters, and the electricity "leaking" from billions of small power
supplies and other equipment. Intensive periods of investigation, technology R&D, and policy
development gradually ensue in the wake of these discoveries. The emergent industry of indoor
Cannabis production appears to have joined this list.1

This article presents a model of the modern-day production process - based on public-domain
sources - and provides first-order national scoping estimates of the energy use, costs, and
greenhouse-gas emissions associated with this activity in the United States. The practice is
common in other countries but a global assessment is beyond the scope of this report.

2. Scale of activity
The large-scale industrialized and highly energy-intensive indoor cultivation of Cannabis is a
relatively new phenomenon, driven by criminalization, pursuit of security, pest and disease
management, and the desire for greater process control and yields (U.S. Department of Justice,
2011a; World Drug Report, 2009). The practice occurs across the United States (Hudson, 2003,
Gettman, 2006). The 415,000 indoor plants eradicated by authorities in 2009 (and 10.3 million
including outdoor plantations) (U.S. Department of Justice, 2011a, b) presumably represent only a
small fraction of total production.

Cannabis cultivation is today legal in 15 states plus the District of Columbia, although it is not
federally sanctioned (Peplow, 2005). It is estimated that 24.8 million Americans are eligible to
receive a doctor's recommendation to purchase or cultivate Cannabis under existing state laws, and
approximately 730,000 currently do so (See Change Strategy, 2011). In California alone, 400,000
individuals are currently authorized to cultivate Cannabis for personal medical use, or sale for the

same purpose to 2100 dispensaries (Harvey, 2009). Approximately 28.5 million people in the United
States are repeat consumers, representing 11% of the population over the age of 12 (U.S. Office of
National Drug Control Policy, 2011).

Cultivation is also substantial in Canada. An estimated 17,500 "grow" operations in British
Columbia (typically located in residential buildings) are equivalent to 1% of all dwelling units
Province-wide, with an annual market value of $7 billion (Easton, 2004).

Official estimates of total U.S. Cannabis production varied from 10,000 to 24,000 metric ton per year
as of 2001, making it the nation's largest crop by value at that time (Hudson, 2003, Gettman, 2006). A
recent study estimated national production at far higher levels (69,000 metric ton) (HIDTA, 2010).
Even at the lower end of this range (chosen as the basis of this analysis), the level of activity is
formidable and increasing with the demand for Cannabis.
No systematic efforts have previously been made to estimate the aggregate energy use of these
activities.

3. Methods and uncertainties
This analysis is based on a model of typical Cannabis production, and the associated energy use for
cultivation and transportation based on market data and first-principals buildings energy end-use
modeling techniques. Data sources include equipment manufacturer data, trade media, the open
literature, and interviews with horticultural equipment vendors. All assumptions used in the
analysis are presented in Appendix A. The resulting normalized (per-kilogram) energy intensity is
driven by the effects of indoor-environmental conditions, production processes, and equipment
efficiencies.

Considerable energy use is also associated with transportation, both for workers and for large
numbers of small-quantities transported and then redistributed over long distances before final
sale.

This analysis reflects typical practices, and is thus intended as a "central estimate". While processes
that use less energy on a per-unit-yield basis are possible, much more energy-intensive scenarios
also occur. Certain strategies for lowering energy inputs (e.g., reduced illumination levels) can result
in lower yields, and thus not necessarily reduce the ultimate energy-intensity per unit weight. Only
those strategies that improve equipment and process energy efficiency, while not correspondingly
attenuating yields would reduce energy intensity.

Due to the proprietary and often illicit nature of Cannabis cultivation, data are intrinsically
uncertain. Key uncertainties are total production and the indoor fraction thereof, and the
corresponding scaling up of relatively well-understood intensities of energy use per unit of production to state or national levels could result in 50% higher or lower aggregate results.

Greenhouse-gas emissions estimates are in turn sensitive to the assumed mix of on- and off-grid
power production technologies and fuels, as off-grid production (almost universally done with
diesel generators) can - depending on the prevailing fuel mix in the grid - have substantially higher
emissions per kilowatt-hour than grid power. Final energy costs are a direct function of the
aforementioned factors, combined with electricity tariffs, which vary widely geographically and
among customer classes. The assumptions about vehicle energy use are likely conservative, given
the longer-range transportation associated with interstate distribution.
Some localities (very cold and very hot climates) will see much larger shares of production indoors, and have higher space-conditioning energy demands than the typical conditions assumed here.
More in-depth analyses could explore the variations introduced by geography and climate, alternate
technology configurations, and production techniques.

4. Energy implications
Accelerated electricity demand growth has been observed in areas reputed to have extensive indoor
Cannabis cultivation. For example, following the legalization of cultivation for medical purposes
(Phillips, 1998, Roth, 2005, Clapper et al., 2010) in California in 1996, Humboldt County
experienced a 50% rise in per-capita residential electricity use compared to other parts of the state
(Lehman and Johnstone, 2010).

Aside from sporadic news reports (Anderson, 2010, Quinones, 2010), policymakers and consumers
possess little information on the energy implications of this practice. A few prior studies
tangentially mentioning energy use associated with Cannabis production used cursory methods and
under-estimate energy use significantly (Plecas et al., 2010 and Caulkins, 2010).

Driving the large energy requirements of indoor production facilities are lighting levels matching
those found in hospital operating rooms (500-times greater than recommended for reading) and
30 hourly air changes (6-times the rate in high-tech laboratories, and 60-times the rate in a modern
home). Resulting power densities are on the order of 2000 W/m?, which is on a par with that of
modern datacenters. Indoor carbon dioxide (CO2) levels are often raised to 4-times natural levels in
order to boost plant growth. However, by shortening the growth cycle, this practice may reduce
final energy intensity.

Specific energy uses include high-intensity lighting, dehumidification to remove water vapor and
avoid mold formation, space heating or cooling during non-illuminated periods and drying, pre-
heating of irrigation water, generation of carbon dioxide by burning fossil fuel, and ventilation and
air-conditioning to remove waste heat. Substantial energy inefficiencies arise from air cleaning,
noise and odor suppression, and inefficient electric generators used to avoid conspicuous utility
bills. So-called "grow houses" - residential buildings converted for Cannabis production - can
contain 50,000 to 100,000 W of installed lighting power (Brady, 2004). Much larger facilities are also

used.

Based on the model developed in this article, approximately 13,000 kW/h/year of electricity is
required to operate standard production module (a 1.2x1.2x2.4 m (4x4x8 ft) chamber). Each
module yields approximately 0.5 kg (1 pound) of final product per cycle, with four or five
production cycles conducted per year. A single grow house can contain 10 to 100 such modules.

To estimate national electricity use, these normalized values are applied to the lower end of the
range of the aforementioned estimated production (10,000 t per year), with one-third of the activity
takes place under indoor conditions. This indicates electricity use of about 20 TW/h/year nationally
(including off-grid production). This is equivalent to that of 2 million average U.S. homes,
corresponding to approximately 1% of national electricity consumption or the output of 7 large
electric power plants (Koomey et al., 2010). This energy, plus associated fuel uses (discussed below),
is valued at $6 billion annually, with associated emissions of 15 million metric ton of CO2-
equivalent to that of 3 million average American cars (Fig. 1 and Table 1, Table 2, Table 3.)

Fuel is used for several purposes, in addition to electricity. The carbon dioxide injected into grow
rooms to increase yields is produced industrially (Overcash et al., 2007) or by burning propane or
natural gas within the grow room contributes about 1-2% to the carbon footprint and represents a
yearly U.S. expenditure of $0.1 billion. Vehicle use associated with production and distribution
contributes about 15% of total emissions, and represents a yearly expenditure of $1 billion. Off-grid
diesel- and gasoline-fueled electric generators have per-kilowatt-hour emissions burdens that are
3- and 4-times those of average grid electricity in California. It requires 70 gallon of diesel fuel to
produce one indoor Cannabis plant (or the equivalent yield per unit area), or 140 gallon with
smaller, less-efficient gasoline generators.

In California, the top-producing state, indoor cultivation is responsible for about 3% of all
electricity use, or 9% of household use.?2 This corresponds to the electricity use of 1 million average
California homes, greenhouse-gas emissions equal to those from 1 million average cars, and energy
expenditures of $3 billion per year. Due to higher electricity prices and cleaner fuels used to make
electricity, California incurs 50% of national energy costs but contributes only 25% of national CO2
emissions from indoor Cannabis cultivation.

From the perspective of individual consumers, a single Cannabis cigarette represents 1.5 kg (3
pounds) of CO2 emissions, an amount equal to driving a 44 mpg hybrid car 22 mile or running a
100-watt light bulb for 25 h, assuming average U.S. electricity emissions. The electricity
requirement for one single production module equals that of an average U.S. home and twice that
of an average California home. The added electricity use is equivalent to running about 30
refrigerators.

From the perspective of a producer, the national-average annual energy costs are approximately
$5500 per module or $2500 per kilogram of finished product. This can represent half the wholesale
value of the finished product (and a substantially lower portion at retail), depending on local
conditions. For average U.S. conditions, producing one kilogram of processed Cannabis results in
4600 kg of CO2 emissions to the atmosphere (and 50% more when off-grid diesel power generation
is used), a very significant carbon footprint. The emissions associated with one kilogram of
processed Cannabis are equivalent to those of driving across country 11 times in a 44-mpg car.

These results reflect typical production methods. Much more energy-intensive methods occur, e.g.,
rooms using 100% recirculated air with simultaneous heating and cooling, hydroponics, or energy
end uses not counted here such as well-water pumps and water purification systems. Minimal
information and consideration of energy use, coupled with adaptations for security and privacy
(off-grid generation, no daylighting, odor and noise control) lead to particularly inefficient
configurations and correspondingly elevated energy use and greenhouse-gas emissions.
The embodied energy of inputs such as soil, fertilizer, water, equipment, building materials,
refinement, and retailing is not estimated here and should be considered in future assessments.
The energy use for producing outdoor-grown Cannabis (approximately two-thirds of all production)
is also not estimated here.

If improved practices applicable to commercial agricultural greenhouses are any indication, such
large amounts of energy are not required for indoor Cannabis production. 3 The application of cost-
effective, commercially-available efficiency improvements to the prototypical facility modeled in
this article could reduce energy intensities by at least 75% compared to the typical-efficiency
baseline. Such savings would be valued at approximately $40,000/year for a generic 10-module
operation (at California energy prices and $10,000/year at U.S. average prices)(Fig. 2(a)-(b). These
estimated energy use reductions reflect practices that are commonplace in other contexts such as
more efficient components and controls (lights, fans, space-conditioning), use of daylight,
optimized air-handling systems, and relocation of heat-producing equipment out of the cultivation
room. Moreover, strain choice alone results in a factor-of-two difference in yields per unit of energy
input (Arnold, 2011).

prices are highly variable and poorly documented.

5. Energy intensities in context
Policymakers and other interested parties will rightfully seek to put these energy indicators in
context with other activities in the economy.
One can readily identify other energy end-use activities with far greater impacts than that of
Cannabis production. For example, automobiles are responsible for about 33% of U.S. greenhouse-
gas emissions (USDOE, 2009), which is100-times as much as those produced by indoor Cannabis
production (0.3%). The approximately 20 TW/h/year estimated for indoor Cannabis production is
about one/third that of U.S. data centers (US EPA, 2007a, 2007b), or one-seventh that of U.S.
household refrigerators (USDOE, 2008). These shares would be much higher in states where
Cannabis cultivation is concentrated (e.g., one half that of refrigerators in California (Brown and

Koomey, 2002)).

On the other hand, this level of energy use is high in comparision to that used for other indoor
cultivation practices, primarily owing to the lack of daylighting. For comparison, the energy
intensity of Belgian greenhouses is estimated at approximately 1000 MJ/m2(De Cock and Van
Lierde, No date), or about 1% that estimated here for indoor Cannabis production.

Energy intensities can also be compared to those of other sectors and activities.
Pharmaceuticals Energy represents 1% of the value of U.S. pharmaceutical shipments
(Galitsky et al., 2008) versus 50% of the value of Cannabis wholesale prices. The U.S. "Pharma"
sector uses $1 billion/year of energy; Indoor Cannabis uses $6 billion.

Other industries Defining "efficiency" as how much energy is required to generate economic
value, Cannabis comes out the highest of all 21 industries (measured at the three-digit SIC
level). At ~20 MJ per thousand dollars of shipment value (wholesale price), Cannabis is followed
next by paper (~14), nonmetallic mineral products (~10), primary metals (~8), petroleum and
coal products (~6), and then chemicals (~5) (Fig. 3). However, energy intensities are on a par with
Cannabis in various subsectors (e.g., grain milling, wood products, rubber) and exceed those of
Cannabis in others (e.g., pulp mills).

6. Outdoor cultivation
Shifting cultivation outdoors can nearly eliminate energy use for the cultivation process. Many
such operations, however, require water pumping as well as energy-assisted drying techniques.
Moreover, vehicle transport during production and distribution remains part of the process, more
So than for indoor operations.

A common perception is that the potency of Cannabis produced indoors exceeds that of that
produced outdoors, leading consumers to demand Cannabis produced indoors. Federal sources
(National Drug Intelligence Center, 2005) as well as independent testing laboratories (Kovner, 2011)
actually find similar potencies when best practices are used.

Illegal clearing of land is common for multi-acre plantations, and, depending on the vegetation
type, can accordingly mobilize greenhouse-gas emissions. Standing forests (a worst-case scenario)
hold from 125 to 1500 t of CO2 per hectare, depending on tree species, age, and location (National
Council for Air and Soil Improvement, 2010). For biomass carbon inventories of 750 t/ha and

typical yields (5000 kg/ha) (UNODC, 2009), associated biomass-related CO emissions would be on
the order of 150 kg CO2/kg Cannabis (for only one harvest per location), or 3% of that associated
with indoor production. These sites typically host on the order of 10,000 plants, although the
number can go much higher (Mallery, 2011). When mismanaged, the practice of outdoor cultivation
imposes multiple environmental impacts aside from energy use. These include deforestation;
destruction of wetlands, runoff of soil, pesticides, insecticides, rodenticides, and human waste;
abandoned solid waste; and unpermitted impounding and withdrawals of surface water (Mallery,
2011, Revelle, 2009). These practices can compromise water quality, fisheries, and other ecosystem
services.

7. Policy considerations
Current indoor Cannabis production and distribution practices result in prodigious energy use,
costs, and unchecked greenhouse-gas pollution. While various uncertainties exist in the analysis,
the overarching qualitative conclusions are robust. More in-depth analysis and greater transparency
of the energy impacts of this practice could improve decision-making by policymakers and
consumers alike.

There is little, if any, indication that public policymakers have incorporated energy and
environmental considerations into their deliberations on Cannabis production and use. There are
additional adverse impacts of the practice that merit attention, including elevated moisture levels
associated with indoor cultivation that can cause extensive damage to buildings,4 as well as
electrical fires caused by wiring out of compliance with safety codes (Garis, 2008). Power theft is
common, transferring those energy costs to the general public (Plecas et al., 2010). As noted above,
simply shifting production outdoors can invoke new environmental impacts if not done properly.

Energy analysts have also not previously addressed the issue. Aside from the attention that any
energy use of this magnitude normally receives, the hidden growth of electricity demand in this
sector confounds energy forecasts and obscures savings from energy efficiency programs and
policies. For example, Auffhammer and Aroonruengsawat (2010) identified statistically significant,
but unexplained, increase in the growth rate for residential electricity in California during the years
when indoor Cannabis production grew as an industry (since the mid-1990s).

For Cannabis producers, energy-related production costs have historically been acceptable given low
energy prices and high product value. As energy prices have risen and wholesale commodity prices
fallen, high energy costs (now 50% on average of wholesale value) are becoming untenable. Were
product prices to fall as a result of legalization, indoor production could rapidly become unviable.

For legally sanctioned operations, the application of energy performance standards, efficiency
incentives and education, coupled with the enforcement of appropriate construction codes could
lay a foundation for public-private partnerships to reduce undesirable impacts of indoor Cannabis

cultivation.5 There are early indications of efforts to address this.6 Were such operations to receive
some form of independent certification and product labeling, environmental impacts could be
made visible to otherwise unaware consumers.

[i]. Total Production: The lower value of 10,000 t per year is conservatively retained. Were this base adjusted to 2011
values using 10.9%/year net increase in number of consumers between 2007 and 2009 per U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services (2010), the result would be approximately 17 million tonnes of total production
annually (indoor and outdoor). Indoor Share of Total Production: The three-fold changes in potency over the past
two decades, reported by federal sources, are attributed at least in part to the shift towards indoor cultivation See
http://www.justice.gov/ndic/pubs37/37035/national.htmand (Hudson, 2003). A weighted-average potency of 10%
THC (U.S. Office of Drug Control Policy, 2010) reconciled with assumed 7.5% potency for outdoor production and
15% for indoor production implies 33.3%::67.7% indoor:outdoor production shares. For reference, as of 2008, 6%
of eradicated plants were from indoor operations, which are more difficult to detect than outdoor operations. A
33% indoor share, combined with per-plant yields from Table 2, would correspond to 4% eradication success
rate for the levels reported (415,000 indoor plants eradicated in 2009) by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency
(http://www.justice.gov/dea/programs/marijuana.htm). Assuming 400,000 members of medical Cannabis
dispensaries in California (each of which is permitted to cultivate), and 50% of these producing in the generic 10-
module room assumed in this analysis, output would slightly exceed this study's estimate of total statewide
production. In practice, the vast majority of indoor production is no doubt conducted outside of the medical
marijuana system.

Executive Summary
Decades spent in the shadows of the black market precluded opportunities to understand
the energy use of indoor cannabis cultivation and compel the industry to keep its environmental consequences in check. Although the impacts of outdoor cultivation on ecosystems have received considerable attention, those associated with vastly more
energy-intensive indoor cultivation have rarely been evaluated and integrated into policy-
making, even in the post-prohibition era. Indeed, indoor cannabis cultivators continue to
be passed over by most energy policy instruments developed since the energy crises of
the 1970s. Moreover, some cannabis regulations are inadvertently driving energy use upwards, while "financial incentives" for energy efficiency offered to indoor growers by utility companies subsidize and legitimize polluting activities that could be performed
outdoors with virtually no energy use. These anti-competitive, ill-conceived, and poorly
evaluated policy efforts demonstrate that cannabis legalization is necessary but not
sufficient to address environmental issues.

Even at ostensibly high energy efficiencies and use of renewable energy, indoor
cultivation "optimizes the suboptimal" and cannibalizes renewable energy infrastructure developed for other purposes, which is untenable in a carbon-constrained world. Outdoor cultivation-which has sufficed for millennia and could meet all U.S. demand with only
0.01% of current farmland- -is the most technologically elegant, sustainable, ethical, and economically viable approach for minimizing the rising energy and environmental burden
of cannabis production.
This chapter pinpoints blind spots in regulation, outlines research and analysis needs,
argues for consumer information and protections against greenwashing and industry
capture of regulatory and green-certification processes, and offers recommendations for incorporating energy considerations into the broader tapestry of cannabis policy.
Following are some key needs and opportunities in the policy sphere.
Improve transparency and require energy-use disclosure that informs
environmental policymakers and other stakeholders.
Create an improved consumer-information environment, including embodied-
carbon product labeling, and raise the environmental literacy of retailers.
Eliminate outdoor-cultivation bans, subsidies, loopholes and other anti- competitive market distortions such as prohibitions on interstate transportation that
favor indoor cultivation.
Design licensing fees with to encourage best practices.
Develop equitable and science-based product-testing standards to avoid unnecessary crop destruction.
Conduct market-relevant, non-proprietary research to fill information gaps.
Ban indoor cultivation, or, where deemed politically expedient, mandate exceptionally high efficiencies and maximal use of on-site solar.

Cannabis legalization is necessary but not sufficient for
addressing energy waste
Decades spent in the shadows of the black market created few opportunities to understand the patterns of energy use associated with indoor cannabis cultivation, let alone compel the industry
to manage consumption and thus keep its environmental consequences in check. Cannabis
production, distribution, and sale involve a myriad of energy uses, some of which are direct and
others indirect (Figure 1). Drivers of energy demand and the associated greenhouse-gas
emissions include creating the inputs and energy used during production, processing, managing waste, downstream retail activities, and transportation. Key decision-makers and stakeholders include policymakers, planners, producers, investors, industry analysts, and consumers.
Although the impacts of outdoor cultivation on ecosystems have received considerable attention (and do not primarily involve energy), those associated with far more energy-intensive indoor
cultivation have only rarely been evaluated and integrated into policy-making, even in the post- prohibition era. Indeed, cannabis cultivators continue to be passed over by almost every energy
policy instrument developed since the first modern energy crisis of half a century ago. Moreover,
there are many instances of post-prohibition cannabis policies that are inadvertently driving
energy use upwards, while the "financial incentives" for energy efficiency being offered to indoor cultivators by electric utility companies represent a counter-productive subsidy and legitimization of a polluting activity that could be done much more sustainably outdoors, which
could meet all U.S. demand with only 0.01% of current farmland 2
The anti-competitive repercussions of ill-conceived policy and scant evaluation of policy adequacy demonstrate that legalization is necessary but not sufficient to address the associated environmental issues. These considerations intersect with more prominent cannabis policy issues
such as taxation, public health and safety, interstate commerce, testing and product labeling, broader agricultural policy, water resources, and solid waste management. Particularly vexing is
that even the most basic analyses are impeded by lack of rigor and lingering uncertainties about the structure and drivers of energy use and how far energy-efficiency and renewable energy can
realistically go towards mitigating the associated undesirable impacts. Stemming from
fundamental data gaps, even baseline studies often omit key considerations, and unwittingly
suffer from unquantified biases due to problems with data collection and verification.

This chapter pinpoints blind spots in regulation, outlines research and analysis needs, argues for
consumer information and protections against greenwashing and industry capture of regulatory
and green-certification processes, and offers recommendations for incorporating energy
considerations into the broader tapestry of cannabis policy. The balance of evidence suggests that even at ostensibly high energy efficiencies and intensive use of renewable energy, indoor cultivation "optimizes the suboptimal" and cannibalizes renewable resources previously developed for other purposes, which is untenable in a carbon-constrained world. Outdoor cultivation-which has sufficed for millennia-is the most technologically elegant, sustainable, ethical, and economically viable approach for minimizing the rising energy and environmental burden of cannabis production.

The cannabis conundrum: Drug policy is decoupled from
environmental policy
Few public policy issues are as multifaceted as that of cannabis production and consumption.
Quantifying the energy use and carbon footprint associated with producing cannabis and its
derivative products is one of the primary and least explored policy-relevant questions. When
confined to the black market, this sector could not readily access relevant expertise and information-sharing networks. However, little progress has been made in the wake of legalization efforts. To our knowledge, no state has initiated a comprehensive approach to the
problem, and federal engagement is non-existent.
Windowless cannabis factory farms constantly battle local weather conditions to maintain stable
round-the-clock temperatures and pump out acres of electric light brighter than the summer sun, day or night. Such industrialized cannabis cultivation facilities-whether in Fairbanks or Phoenix- must simulate and maintain artificially cloudless tropical environments while suppressing disease-causing humidity year-round. Industrially manufactured carbon dioxide (an added energy-intensive input and greenhouse gas in its own right, increasing carbon footprint on the order of 5% -- more if and as energy efficiency improves), is often injected to artificially boost plant growth. Operating the equipment3 needed to create and maintain these artificial environments can require as much energy as a similarly sized a data center. Indoor cultivators cite
debatable reasons for this practice: security, a more predictable product, buffering from weather and other crop hazards, maximized cash flow due to year-round production, the need for fewer
employees, legislative restrictions, and the ability to achieve multiple harvests per year.4

As with most other environmental issues, those associated with cannabis get "shaded out" by other seemingly more pressing concerns faced by policymakers (in this case taxation, zoning, child safety, etc.). Together with the highly technical and complicated nature of how energy iS used in the industry and how to quantify energy efficiency, few policymakers are even equipped to engage effectively. As a case-in-point, the IRS has been thwarted in pursuing tax-fraud cases since it cannot readily correlate reported sales volumes with utility bills.

The environmental footprint of cannabis production:
Demonization or double standard?
Energy-intensive indoor cultivation has been conducted within the black market for decades. The original shift to the practice was, in part, a product of prohibition enforcement efforts that pushed growers indoors to avoid detection (Silvaggio in this volume). As will be outlined below,
legalization does not intrinsically address the energy issues, and can even compound them by

3 The primary energy users are heating and cooling, dehumidification, and lighting. With conventional lighting, most of the input energy results in heat generation which needs to be immediately removed by air conditioning. Other miscellaneous energy loads can include irrigation pumps,
water pre-heaters or coolers, air disinfection systems, motors 1 o operate light-deprivation curtains, and crop dryers. Transportation (during and after production) and post-cultivation product manufacturing further contributes energy use and carbon footprint.
4 This latter argument is not material, as outdoor growers using light-deprivation methods also achieve multiple harvests per year. Moreover, reducing labor intensity is contrary to the job-creation objectives of most policy makers.

encouraging the rapid scale-up of indoor facilities and otherwise altering patterns of energy use
in unexpected ways.

Some industry advocates have complained that cannabis is singled out for scrutiny, while other
sectors are left to their devices or otherwise pollute more. This argument is spurious (Mills 2016), as cannabis is in actuality one of the vanishingly few segments of the economy that has
been largely overlooked in energy and environmental policy. Moreover, as is well established in the climate change mitigation field, there is no "silver-bullet" solution and a multitude of energy a uses must be simultaneously addressed in order to meet society's important emissions-reduction
targets. It is a false choice to argue that one energy use should be addressed in lieu of another.
There is no single cause of climate change, and thus no single solution. Meanwhile, the cannabis sector is arguably decades behind the rest of the economy when it comes to energy efficiency. In any case, adequate technical fixes are unlikely to be available if the demand for extraordinary levels of artificial illumination persists.

A key starting point for establishing a context for good decision-making is quantifying the level
of energy use and associated greenhouse-gas emissions, and how that compares to other activities. Until less than a decade ago, no peer-reviewed public-domain assessment of cannabis
energy use had been published. Early work on this question included a national scoping estimate
of the issue based on the largely pre-recreational-legalization policy environment, where virtually all large-scale cultivation was conducted outdoors and indoor cultivation was predominantly windowless (Mills 2012). That said, small indoor operations were (and still are) numerous and generally not designed with energy efficiency considerations in mind.

Based on best-available information at the time, a "bottom-up" model was created based on interviews with practitioners, equipment retailers, and published guidelines for growers (e.g., Rosenthal 2010) (Mills 2012). The boundary conditions (inputs and activities resulting in energy use and greenhouse-gas emissions) represented only a subset of those depicted in Figure 1. The per-facility results compared favorably to measured data available for indoor growing operations
and the aggregate energy demand estimates compared well with those subsequently made by
others, including the long-range planning authorities for the Northwest power system (Northwest
Power and Conservation Council 2016).

From a national vantage point, Mills (2012) found that indoor cannabis consumed 20 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually as of a decade ago, with additional amounts from direct
fuel use, together corresponding to 15 million metric tonnes of CO2 released into the atmosphere each year.5 This in turn corresponded to an expenditure of $6 billion per year on energy, nationally, which amounted to 9% of California household electricity use, 3% of total statewide
electricity use (all sectors), and 1% of electricity use nationally. Other independent estimates have found similar economy-level results. For example, indoor cultivation is estimated to require 0.6% of statewide electricity use (all sectors) in Colorado and 4% in the city of Denver (Hood 2018).6 Washington State also reports that indoor cultivation is responsible for one percent of the
state's overall electricity consumption (Jourabchi 2014), a number that has probably risen in the
intervening years. As early as 2004, it was reported that indoor cannabis cultivation was

The City of Denver reports that 45% of its total growth in electricity demand stems from cannabis (Walton 2015).

responsible for 1% of electricity use in British Columbia (Easton 2004) which was long before the recreational legalization decision in Canada. Others have estimated cannabis energy use
constitutes 3% of electricity demand in parts of Washington and 0.5 to 1% in Colorado
(Remillard and Collins 2017).

For context, the aforementioned national estimate was equivalent to the emissions of 1.7 million average U.S. homes or three million cars, and was more than four-times the aggregate U.S. pharmaceutical industry energy expenditure.7 While part of this difference arises from the lower
energy prices paid by industrial users compared to residentially-based cannabis producers of the time, it is noteworthy that the average primary energy intensity of pharmaceutical facilities
(approximately 3,600 kBTU/sf-y) (Capparella 2013) is well below that of indoor cannabis cultivation facilities at around 5,500 kBTU/sf-y.8

An additional key finding was that the "energy intensity" (energy use per unit of floor area) in indoor cultivation facilities was vastly higher than in other common building types (Figure 2).

From a regional vantage point, energy use can also be put in context by estimating how it contributes to per-person carbon emissions in economies where cannabis production is significant. While cannabis has been referred to as the largest cash crop in the U.S. in dollars
(Gettman 2006), it is particularly significant in California. The implied per-person carbon footprint for the small populations in many of the cannabis-producing areas iS far above the

7 Note that the original study (Mills 2012) put at this at six-times, but the value noted here is adjusted for approximately 25% of pharmaceuticals being consumed by Americans that are produced off-shore (Altstedter 2017).
This cautiously assumes that the source of pharmaceutical industry energy is reporting in "site" energy units, i.e., not including the losses due to the inefficiencies of electricity production in power plants. The source's estimate of 1,210 kBTU/sf-year translates to approximately 3,600 kBTU/sf-year when adjusting for this conversion factor.

averages in a state otherwise known for its energy efficiency-closer to that of the most carbon-
intensive "coal" states.

a From a consumer vantage point, the energy use for growing one 1-gram "joint" creates 10 pounds of carbon dioxide pollution, equivalent to running ten 10-watt LED light bulbs (or one 100-watt incandescent bulb) for 76 hours (Mills 2012). That's as much as driving 22 miles in a 44-mpg Prius. Embedded in each average indoor-grown plant is the energy equivalent of 70 gallons of oil. A small "grow house" with ten grow lights consumes approximately as much electricity as ten average U.S. homes.
All told, the CO2 emissions of the average cannabis user ranges from 16% of their total household carbon footprint in Rhode Island (the state with the nation's lowest consumption rate) where cannabis availability is highly limited to 59% in Colorado (the nation's highest
consumption rate) where it is pervasive. Put differently, the per-capita emissions are equivalent
to that from powering two high-efficiency refrigerators in Rhode Island and nine in Colorado.'
From producer's vantage point, the cost of energy use varies widely depending on energy prices, efficiency, growing techniques, and strain choice (Arnold 2011), while the business significance of the cost depends on the prevailing wholesale price of the finished product. Circa 2012, the average energy expenditure for indoor cultivation equated to approximately one- quarter to one-half of the wholesale price. As energy prices rise and wholesale prices drop (post- legalization) this ratio will become increasingly unfavorable and could even become a factor in
the solvency of some producers. Indoor producers have a far more energy-sensitive business model than outdoor producers or those in other industries, and may find themselves in a boom- and-bust scenario given the magnitude of energy expenses.

Widespread cultivation in large-scale greenhouses is a relatively recent development. An
analysis of industrial-scale greenhouses found that they, too, are highly energy intensive (Mills
2018), especially if poorly designed and operated. While these "hyper greenhouses" use less energy than windowless facilities per unit floor area, they still require prodigious amounts of lighting, cooling, heating, and dehumidification in most climates. As evidence of the issue, cannabis greenhouses are one reason cited for the need to update high-voltage electricity transmission lines in Canada (CBC 2019a). Data published by NFD (2018) found greenhouses in the U.S. to use half the electricity of windowless facilities on a per-square-foot basis, yet, due to their lower yields, they actually required only 25% less energy per unit weight of the finished product.10 An important caveat is that the values reported in that study do not include natural gas,
which is a common heating fuel for greenhouses while heating in windowless facilities is often
provided with electricity. An assessment in Canada found that greenhouses used only about one-
third less energy than windowless facilities (Posterity Group 2019). The data thus suggest that these greenhouses are anything but "green", as their energy use per unit floor area still tends to
be greater than that of virtually any other commercial building type.

greenhouses. Values elsewhere in the NFD report suggest the greenhouses were even less favorable.

A more recent attempt to estimate national energy consumption demonstrated many of the challenges of such analysis (NFD 2018). Of note, the energy used for outdoor as well as greenhouse operations was usefully contrasted with that of windowless indoor facilities, and that of legal and black-market production estimated separately. The report admirably brought forward more measured data on specific facilities than previously available in the public domain, although the sample was small (only two dozen sites with energy and yield data), self-selected, and self-reported. Almost one third of the sites used LED lights for energy savings, likely far higher than the proportion of sites adopting this technology in the overall marketplace. The analytical scope had narrower boundary conditions (excluding energy sources other than electricity within the facility as well as transportation energy, and cultivation in perhaps more
energy-intensive non-industrial settings such as homes and other informal "small-scale"
facilities), did not include off-grid operations often reliant on diesel generators, and was based on
a non-randomized sample weighted towards milder climates in the United States. The energy intensity of black-market operations was presumably equated with that of legal operations, embodying an assumption of equivalent efficiencies not verified with actual data. Meaningful direct comparisons to the Mills (2012) study are thus not possible given the narrower boundary
conditions and non-representativeness of the sample. The study indicated that some energy- intensity metrics may be improving with the passage of time, as would be expected, although more definitive surveys are sorely needed. Of particular note, the NFD study found roughly a factor of ten variation in key energy intensity metrics (electricity per square foot and per unit of flower yield), indicating enormous non-standardization of existing practices and a correspondingly large potential for energy savings irrespective of historical trends. It is not yet known whether the carbon intensity of today's legal production facilities is lower or higher than that of earlier operations, but the recent work of Summers et al., (2021) suggests not.

There is increasing recognition of the need to manage energy use in cannabis cultivation. While it is encouraging to observe a variety of organizations developing environmental product labeling for cannabis, the methodologies often lack transparency and there is little or no direct recognition of excellence or penalties for underachievement. Organizational factors create real or perceived conflicts of interest (financial dependence on the industry and users of the product being evaluated, lack of an independent watchdog, and a chronic tension between profit or market share and rigor among certifiers which can result in the dilution of standards). It has been
reported that growers will "shop" for certifications that put their product in the best light
(Bennett 2019).

Despite nascent certification and labeling systems, consumers are largely unaware of the energy
and environmental impacts of indoor cultivation. It is notable that the "ethical purchasing"
movement (consumers seeking to vote with their dollar, e.g., to promote sustainable products)
has barely appeared in the cannabis marketplace and, perhaps fearing stigmatization, environmental organizations have conspicuously sidestepped the issue (Bennett 2019). Moreover, cannabis dispensaries have been found to be unreliable sources of information on
environmental issues associated with the products they sell and existing sustainability certifications for cannabis are underdeveloped, vulnerable, and lack credibility (Bennett 2017; Bennett 2020, in this volume). Consumers thus operate in an information environment that impedes good purchase decisions.

Externalities compound the social and environmental costs
of indoor cultivation
In addition to the policy community's need to better understand facility-scale energy use, cannabis operations have various externalities (side effects not reflected in the prices of goods
sold) that are not often considered or quantified.

These include moisture damage to buildings, nighttime light pollution, power plant emissions and other environmental impacts, power theft, and power outages and other constraints on the broader grid caused by unchecked electrical load growth. As an example of this latter issue, the city of Portland Oregon associated seven power outages over a period of five months with indoor cannabis operations (Pacific Power 2015) and Portland General Electric traced 85% of its
residential transformer problems to indoor cannabis growing (Borrud 2015).

In 2010, British Columbia reported that power theft by two thirds of cannabis producers was
costing the utility $100 million per year (BC Hydro 2016). At that time cannabis was legal only
for medical purposes, and most offending facilities were serving the black market.

Unpermitted or uninspected electrical wiring has been the source of a disproportionate number of
fires in some localities, and the building stock has been damaged by mold and other
consequences of raising humidity in buildings not intended for agricultural operations (Fire
Chiefs Association of British Columbia 2008; Mills 2012). Massive fires have occurred even in
legal facilities (Reuters 2015).

Cultivating cannabis in areas based on hydro power is often touted as an environmentally benign alternative to carbon-based power. However, attention has recently been given to the likely
linkages between hydroelectric power production, reduced salmon populations, and starvation
issues facing salmon-eating killer whales (orcas) in the Pacific Northwest (Mapes 2018;
University of Massachusetts 2017). Hydroelectric power also results in substantially more water
evaporation than other forms of electricity production.

Adverse public-health considerations and waste generation
merit more analysis
Another form of externality-public health impacts related to energy-intensive cultivation practices also merits close analysis. Cannabis has been widely demonstrated to offer medical
benefits under the appropriate circumstances. However, the countervailing health-related dimensions of indoor cultivation-for workers and the general public- -have not received much
attention, although it is treated elsewhere (Schenker and Langer in this volume).

Indoor environmental conditions can be an issue for workers and consumers. For example, while
mold is a common risk to product viability for indoor and outdoor cultivators alike, indoor
environments can be particularly prone to mold growth that can destroy an entire crop. The risk is especially high during power outages or equipment failures when ventilation and

10

dehumidification processes are interrupted. Researchers have noted the potential health risks to workers of the high levels of VOCs (terpenes) emitted from cannabis plants (Plautz 2019). In
another example, doubling or quadrupling of current background carbon-dioxide levels (up to 1500 ppm, to force growth) was once believed to be safe for humans but has subsequently been
found to result in CO2 levels found to significantly reduce nine distinct measures of cognitive and decision-making functioning (Fisk et al., 2013; Allen et al., 2015). Combustion products, such as carbon monoxide, from unvented on-site CO2 production can also pose health hazards.
Concerns have been raised about the effect of large concentrations of plants in urban areas
adversely impacting air quality through their emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs),
which catalyze other air pollutants. A recent investigation determined that 600 cultivation facilities within the city of Denver Colorado could double the prevailing levels of VOCs, while air pollution in that city already periodically violates federal limits (Wang et al., 2019).
More broadly, energy production itself has well-known health consequences, and of course is the
primary source of human-generated greenhouse gases which bring their own health impacts.
Mills (2012) estimated national greenhouse-gas emissions of 15 metric tons of CO2 each year
from indoor cannabis cultivation across the United States. Outdoor practices can also result in
greenhouse-gas emissions from land-use change and chemical fertilizers.
Hazardous wastes associated with indoor cultivation are also understudied. The "high-intensity discharge" lamps used for most cultivation contain significant amounts of mercury (~40
mg/lamp). The extent of recycling/recovery of this mercury is unknown, and broken lamps introduce mercury into the growing facility in an uncontrolled fashion. More costly LED lights do not contain mercury. However, recycling programs for LED fixtures are not yet in place.

Indoor practices involving hydroponics (or even traditional irrigation) yield contaminated wastewater that may be introduced into or circumvent wastewater systems. Moreover, non- degrading growing media, such as mineral wool that is saturated with nutrient-laden water, is typically sent to landfill after each harvest. We estimate that an operation with 100,000 square feet of canopy requires 14,000 to 34,000 cubic feet of mineral wool per cycle, which would result in the generation of approximately to 85,000 to 200,000 cubic feet of solid waste to landfill
over a year with six growing cycles. For perspective, this results in waste generation of 5- to 11- times the weight of the processed flowers.11 Recycling of agricultural mineral wool is not
currently available in the U.S. Indoor operations also tend not to re-use soils after each growth
cycle, which is yet another large source of solid waste.

Energy efficiency and renewable energy are not enough to
mitigate the problem
A key challenge intrinsic to the indoor cultivation process, and compounded by seemingly unrelated local ordinances or needs, is that these facilities tend to embody a number of counterproductive design and operational features that make energy use even higher than need

11 See assumptions below in the discussion of mineral wool embodied energy.

be. For example, CO2 injection requires facilities to be sealed and all air recirculated, which, in turn. boosts energy use significantly. Another example is the sometimes-mandated use of tall opaque walls in front of greenhouses in the name of security which can also block useful sunlight
and thus require added electric lighting energy input. Location of these facilities in or near
population centers requires high-resistance air filtration to control odor, which, in-turn requires
increased ventilation energy to counteract the backpressure caused by the dense filter media.
Heat is often run at the same time as air conditioning in an effort to control humidity that can otherwise lead to mold growth. Lastly, local light-pollution ordinances may require that light- deprivation covers be drawn over greenhouses at night (light may be on during that time, e.g., when the days are short or to capitalize on cheaper power rates), which can trap heat and thus require additional cooling energy. Lastly are a host of energy-using technologies to remove mold with UV, treat polluted water, recapture and purify waste water, etc., that are ironically used to improve the "sustainability" of indoor cultivation.
Despite these challenges, the industry has begun to look for efficiencies, likely driven more by the squeeze between falling wholesale prices and rising energy costs than by environmental concerns (Pols 2017). Aside from efficiencies (e.g., energy used per given weight of finished product), it is critical to maintain focus on trends in aggregate demand, especially for a growing
industry. For example, Colorado reports a startling year-over-year increase of 23% in overall production (Hood 2018) and that electricity use increased by 36% annually between 2012 and
2016 (Denver Public Health and Environment 2018). Energy efficiencies cannot improve rapidly enough to offset such growth, and the preceding numbers suggest that energy intensity has
actually been increasing. The energy forecasting authority in the Pacific Northwest projects an 82% increase in energy demand despite improving energy efficiency (Jourabchi 2014). A large- scale energy savings study for the province of Ontario, Canada, found a maximum technical potential of only 16% energy savings for indoor facilities and 21% for greenhouses (without
accounting for limited uptake rates or cost-effectiveness) (Posterity Group 2019).

Sleek images of energy-saving LED lights and greenhouses look "green" on the surface, but the
devil is in the details. These lighting systems are still quite energy intensive.12 One experiment found that 780 Watts of LED were needed to replace 1000-1100 watts of traditional lighting (Massoud 2014) in order to maintain yields. Peer-reviewed research dating from the time these alternative lighting sources began being manufactured suggested that cannabis grown under LEDs may actually take longer to mature and have lower yield and/or potency (Pocock 2015),
thus saving little if any energy on a per-weight basis (Nelson and Bugbee 2014). LED
performance in these applications appears to be improving, although even more recent studies
obtained mixed results (Leichliter et al., 2018). However, product attributes (flower appearance)
may be adversely affected by LEDs, which is a palpable market risk for producers. The up-front cost of LED lighting is also vastly higher than conventional lighting, the recovery of which requires a long time-horizon for the facility developer. Although the vast majority of indoor cultivation facility space has been constructed since LED fixtures have been available in the market, adoption rates are probably in the low single-digit percentage range. The aforementioned in-depth analysis for Canada found that the technical potential energy savings for LED lighting (without regard for cost-effectiveness or limited adoption rates) was only 7% of entire facility-

12 One advantage of less-efficient high-intensity discharge lamps is that the heat-producing ballasts can be placed outside the conditioned space, reducing air-conditioning needs. LED ballasts are integral to the fixture and cannot be remotely located.

12

level energy use (Posterity Group 2019). These barriers notwithstanding, it is certainly possible
to construct cultivation facilities with far higher energy efficiencies than is done at present.
Indications of these opportunities as applied to the facility envelope and daylighting are provided
a decade ago by Kinney et al. (2012).

That said, there is naïve optimism and hubris that cultivators need only "go solar" meet
remaining energy needs after efficiencies have been captured. The feasibility of this has not been demonstrated at scale, probably because the required solar array would need to be many times larger than the roof of the facility, and of course could not be on the roof at all if a traditional
greenhouse design is used. Even in areas with excellent solar availability, only about 5% of a
facility's electricity needs could be generated on the roof (Mills 2018). One noted large-scale facility aiming to be as sustainable as possible achieved a solar contribution of about 30%
(Daniels 2019), which presumably required using a very large area of land beyond the building footprint. A 'state-of-the-art' facility in Canada is projecting to offset only 8% to 10% of its electricity use by covering its entire roof (CBC 2019b), emitting approximately 9,000 tons of CO2 per year instead of 10,000 tons without the solar. Among the nation's largest proposed
facilities, with 2.4 million square feet of enclosed "cannabis industrial park", would only provide
4% of the needed electricity from its rooftops, despite being in an optimal solar resource area on the California-Arizona border. Meeting the full electricity demand would require approximately 1,400 acres of photovoltaic panel area. 13 An 80-megawatt dedicated natural-gas powerplant is instead proposed to provide energy (Kidder Mathews 2019). Such a generator would need to
produce 1.23 TWh-y, enough to power 90,000 average U.S. all-electric homes (Figure 3).

While it can be argued that cannabis industry could be powered with centralized renewable energy, the amounts required are prodigious and for practical purposes (e.g., land-use constraints) rarely achievable.

As a case in point, although California's Coachella Valley is one of the largest wind-energy production areas in that state, cannabis production there (assuming business-as-usual energy efficiencies) will soon eclipse the entire output of all 40 wind-power projects located in the area
(Figure 4).

Our "bottom-up" estimate is that projects already in operation in the Coachella Valley region
consume 13% as much as wind energy in the region produces, although other estimates (Daniels
2019) suggest cannabis facilities in the "west side" of Coachella Valley consume 235 megawatts,
which is fully 35% the rated capacity of all wind projects in the area, and far more on an energy
basis. Full build-out of existing cannabis facility entitlements would consume far more: 11-times
as much electricity as can be produced by all existing wind systems in the area, and more than all the wind power generated across California. It has taken decades and the dedication of vast land
areas to build up this level of wind-generation capacity. From a broader public-policy vantage point, there is an acute shortage of investment in renewable energy infrastructure to offset even
existing carbon emissions, let alone emissions growth from new energy-intensive development.
This comparison is a poignant illustration of the broader problematic tension between advances
in renewable energy supply and unbridled growth in energy demand.

Cannabis cultivation facilities already in operation in five cities within the Coachella Valley require the equivalent of 13% of the entire electricity production of the 40 wind energy projects (2,229 turbines) located throughout the valley. This will grow to more than 70% of the area's total wind energy output upon completion of projects proposed or under development. Full build-out per existing entitlements will consume eleven-times as much power, significantly exceeding the 14 TWh/year generated by wind power in all of California. Photos: (a). Wind turbines from

Myths and market distortions bolster environmentally
detrimental production practices
Among the fundamental preconditions for "perfect functioning" of markets is a vibrant
information environment for all actors. Unfortunately, energy-relevant information in the cannabis industry is incomplete and often incorrect. One long-standing "myth" is that indoor- cultivated cannabis is superior to its outdoor counterpart. This is a commonly held view in the popular culture, and dispensaries are notorious for "bottom-shelfing" outdoor-grown products as inferior and otherwise favoring and steering customers towards indoor-grown products. Industry experts have argued to the contrary (San Francisco Bay Guardian 2011) and medical cannabis produced by the U.S. government is cultivated almost exclusively outdoors.15
Economic signals can also distort markets. Energy utilities earn billions of dollars per year from
cannabis cultivators. While utilities play a key role in improving energy efficiency in the
economy at large (assuming that policymakers ensure that investing in new energy supply is not
more profitable than investing in efficient use), utilities benefit far less from outdoor cannabis
cultivation and have not been observed to encourage it.

In some areas, indoor cultivators receive the historically low, subsidized electricity prices
enjoyed by traditional outdoor farmers (PG&E 2017). Many agricultural customers also receive industrial rates, 16 which are lower than those paid by occupants of other types of buildings (warehouses, data centers, offices, etc.). Subsidies of this sort to indoor growers make them more
competitive against outdoor growers while artificially suppressing the profitability of making
energy efficiency improvements or investment in renewable energy supply.

Conversely, in order to discourage indoor cultivation, some well-intended policymakers have sought to impose extreme electricity surcharges (The Arcata Eye 2012). In practice, however, the expected effect could be to merely trigger relocation. This may "solve" the locality's problem, but does not address global energy concerns and can even push cultivators off-grid and onto even more polluting diesel generators for power.

In other contexts, good public policy has often included financial incentives for energy efficiency
(rebates, tax credits, etc.). However, in this context, far greater energy savings can be obtained by shifting to outdoor cultivation. A perspective must be maintained that even super-efficient indoor facilities are highly energy intensive when compared to other building types (imagine the values in Figure 2 being reduced by, say, 75%). Outdoor producers are disadvantaged when their well-funded indoor competitors are subsidized with efficiency incentives such as rebates that are, in turn, paid by consumers through utility tariff "adders" (the traditional way of financing utility

feet entitled. Energy intensity is that calculated by Mills (2012). Note that while NFD (2018) cites lower average electricity intensity for some states, their value for the adjacent desert state (Nevada) in their sample is virtually identical to that used here for a California desert location. Wind energy generating capacity values are from Hoen et al (2018) and associated energy production from California Energy Commission (2019a): average wind energy production rates for 26 projects (475 MW) in the
area (2.23 GWh/MW) are applied to the total installed 663 MW for the area to estimate total electricity production. 15 See https://pharmacy.olemiss.edu/marijuana/ 16 See https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=16231

rebate programs). Such incentives arguably disrupt market forces that could otherwise lead to optimally reduced energy use.
Investor roles in indoor operations also have an impact. Enormous cash infusions following
initial public offerings of stock can disincentivize efficiency, particularly if investors are unaware of best practices or unequipped to evaluate the adequacy of cultivation practices. Losses arising from inefficiency of energy use (or other inputs) can be camouflaged by lack of
transparency, investor ignorance of energy engineering, and the readiness of investors compensate for shortfalls. An example of this is Canopy Growth Corporation, who, despite shrinking gross margins and being unable to post a profit from their primarily indoor-cultivation- based business was still able to attract $4 billion investment from Constellation Brands (Alpert 2019). Compounding these problems, cultivation-facility investors tend not to have the time
horizons needed to amortize energy efficiency or renewable energy investments. More broadly, *green investment" funds must think twice before including carbon-intensive cannabis stocks.

The current policy environment increases the energy use of
cannabis cultivation
Prohibition was previously blamed for the environmental impacts of cannabis cultivation, but the reality is far more complicated (Vitiello 2016). Indeed, owing to the lack of coordination between cannabis policy and environmental policy, decisions are inadvertently being made in the post-prohibition era that are compounding the energy problem.

That said, there are ample reasons to pursue regulation. For example, historically, some black-
market growers have been rumored to leverage the fact of their undocumented income to take advantage of low-income electricity tariffs. This not only created an unintended cross-subsidy
from other ratepayers, but the low rates also reduced their incentive to invest in energy efficiency
or shift cultivation outdoors.

Local control of cannabis market regulation (e.g., at the city or county level) can lead to perverse outcomes that distort broader market conditions. For example, as noted above, the Coachella Valley in southern California has become a major hub of production due to the absence of caps on facility size, local efforts to promote the industry, and a generally permissive regulatory
environment. Conversely, local ordinances set a very large minimum size for facilities at five
acres (over 200,000 square feet) (Maschke 2018). As a result, very large-scale indoor cultivation
is taking place in this extremely hot region, requiring far more air conditioning than in climates
more naturally suited for cultivation. An engineer working in the area is quoted as estimating that cannabis cultivation facilities use about 25-times as much energy as a "standard industrial" development (Daniels 2019).
Perversely, there are many reports of localities banning outdoor cultivation as part of their
legalization process, examples of which include Nevada County, California (Riquelmy 2016) and the entire state of Illinois (Thill 2019). Regulations also require all production to occur
indoors in Canada (CBC 2019b). These measures are presumably taken with security in mind.

17

Yet, if giant internationally sanctioned opium poppy plantations for pain-management drugs can be secured outdoors (Bradsher 2014), surely cannabis farms can do so as well.

License fees are typically assessed on a per-square-foot basis and some localities stipulate equal limits to the allowable cultivation area for indoor and outdoor cultivation, thus strongly biasing choices towards high-density, energy intensive indoor operations where more crops can be produced each year.

Local officials and others have cited the odors arising from outdoor cultivation as a significant problem, and suggest the activity be restricted to indoor facilities (Johnson 2019). This of course
also entails the implementation of high-resistance air filters for odor control which, as noted
above, increase ventilation energy needs. This concern may be unfounded, as massive VOCs
measured in the Denver regional air basin have been traced to indoor grow operations (Wang et
al., 2019).

Providing an example of the aggregate effect of these market distortions, an estimated 80% of licensed cannabis production in California is conducted indoors (McVey and Cowee 2018). Once indoor cultivation is endorsed (or mandated), it becomes incumbent on policymakers to ensure that the resultant energy use is not excessive. Virtually all building types and the equipment in them are subject to energy codes and standards in the United States, yet comprehensive ones appropriate for cannabis cultivation facilities have not been promulgated and the supporting research essential for standards analysis has not been conducted. Massachusetts is among the early states to grapple with this. The state has determined that single (massive) indoor cultivation facility could result in an increase in lighting demand equal to the energy saved over many years by the state's effort to convert over 130,000 streetlights from conventional high- intensity lamps to LEDs.7 However, the state's efforts at setting energy standards have been clumsy, e.g., seeking to specify wattage limits on individual light fixtures, which could easily
result in operators installing more fixtures than would otherwise be the case (Davis 2019a).

In another example of unintended energy consequences, mandatory product testing--which is
certainly a potentially appropriate policy intervention--can uncover long-standing practices that
yield unacceptable contamination levels in the final product. Tainted cannabis products must be
destroyed, thus entailing all associated energy to be reallocated to materials that pass testing. The safety thresholds stipulated by the regulations are not necessarily based on scientific study, and
nor are they consistent with standards for other consumer products. For example, there are no standards or testing for heavy metals in tobacco, despite it being known to contain them, yet testing is done at the parts-per-billion level for cannabis. Researchers have described the lack of studies on the health risks of heavy metals in tobacco (Caruso et al., 2014).
Some previously black-market cultivators have found the new permitting processes under legalization to be onerous and so time-consuming that they cannot transition their businesses to the regulated market. This already appears to be having the effect of driving some legal
producers back to the black market, and thus away from access to policy inducements for environmentally improved practices. As of April 16, 2019, roughly 3,000 temporary cultivation

permits had expired and the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) had issued
only 62 annual licenses and 564 provisional permits. Reports indicated that less cannabis was sold (legally) in the year after recreational laws went into effect than before. As an indicator of the size of the black market, the most recent official estimates of California's cannabis
production, a report published in 2018 by the California Department of Food and Agriculture, showed the state producing as much as 15.5 million pounds of cannabis and consuming just 2.5 million pounds (ERA Economics 2017). The balance is presumably illegal export to areas where
prevailing retail prices are higher.

Even where states legalize cannabis cultivation, localities that thwart implementation further
reinforce black-market activity. For example, there are many counties in California where a public majority voted to legalize cannabis yet local government has banned most if not all cannabis-related business activities. According to Schroyer and McVey (2019) only 161 of California's 482 municipalities and 24 of the 58 counties allow commercial cannabis businesses.
Illinoisthe most carbon-intensive cannabis producer in the U.S. (Summers et al., 2021) has
banned outdoor cultivation statewide.

A key example of the consequences of a resurgent black market are that off-grid cultivation using diesel generators results in an even higher "carbon footprint" (carbon per unit of electricity
produced and consumed) than the electric grids in many areas -- e.g. 2.5-times higher in the case of California (Mills 2012).

Relevant to indoor and outdoor cultivation alike, cannabis regulatory practices also counterproductively influence transportation energy use. In the California regime, for example the product is typically transported at least four times between the point of cultivation and the point of consumption. Regulations require farmers to transport their product to processors, who then transport to distributors, who then transport to dispensaries. Retail consumers then transport the final product from the dispensary. Shipments of only 25 to 40 pounds between farmer and processor are not atypical. The amounts transported become progressively smaller along the supply chain, which multiplies the amount of embodied transport energy per unit weight.
Transport energy notwithstanding, one fundamental policy barrier to reducing energy use is
restrictions on interstate commerce. A comparison of electricity use per unit yield in seven states found a variation of 3.4-fold and that for greenhouse-gas emissions of 26-fold, and this did not
include the full range of climate severity or power plant emissions factors seen across the whole
country (NFD 2018). Were the nation's supply of cannabis grown in climatically benign locations, energy use would be vastly reduced as would pressures to grow indoors.

The case of California: A cannabis-climate train wreck
driven by ill-informed policymaking
California is a beacon of progressive environmental thought and has long been an engine for innovative environmental technologies and policies. State legislators have passed some of the
most far-reaching climate change policies and targets in the world, notably the California Global

19

Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (SB-32), designed to reduce statewide greenhouse-gas emissions
to a level 40% below 1990 levels by the year 2030.18

Yet, the regulatory structure established for the cannabis industry now works at cross-purposes to these overriding goals (Mills 2019). Seemingly prior to any rigorous analysis of energy impacts, the state inexplicably dictated that indoor cultivation was integral to the broader goal of
legalization, creating a preordained legal "purpose" that seemingly cannot be questioned by
subsequent environmental considerations. This binding purpose led to the explicit rejection of "environmentally superior" outdoor cultivation alternatives identified in the official Environmental Impact Report (EIR), despite a recognized lack of data that precluded more than cursory quantitative environmental impact analysis (California Department of Food and Agriculture 2017) and conclusions in other official reports that environmental impacts would be "negligible" (Bureau of Cannabis Control 2017).

The EIR takes several leaps of faith to conclude that the legalization program will be
"beneficial" towards attaining the State's greenhouse-gas emission reduction goals. They achieve
this feat by assuming, remarkably, that overall cannabis production levels would not rise
materially following legalization, while the legal fraction of production will increase from
approximately 5% to 10% of statewide totals (the rest remaining in the black market) and that
this increment will automagically conform with the state's SB-32 emissions-reduction target thus rendering aggregate emissions slightly lower than without legalization.
The net effect of these analytical contortionsjuxtaposed with the market and policy failures outlined earlier in this chapter, particularly the forcing of indoor cultivation in many local
jurisdictions- -is that California has thus far failed to grasp a rapidly closing window of opportunity to manage energy use and greenhouse-gas emissions from the cannabis industry.
Few localities have made efforts to manage energy use and emissions (California Department of Food and Agriculture 2017). A highly limited building energy standards-setting process is slowly being explored, but the earliest date for possible implementation will be 2022 - a full 25 years after the state's initial legalization of cannabis for medical use (California Energy Commission
2019b).

A large research vacuum remains
Although it has been many years since the energy issues of cannabis cultivation were first identified (Mills 2012), very little subsequent research has been conducted and thus policymaking proceeds in an information vacuum. Contributing to this problem, the cannabis industry and energy suppliers are not always forthcoming with information about current practices, and are selective about what they do release. Early work pointed out the need for open-
source energy benchmarking using measured data (Mills 2012). Some studies have come forward with information of this sort, often with small samples limited to a certain region or type of cultivation (e.g., County of Boulder 2018) while other efforts are pooling and standardize the information, although based on self-selected participants and limited public access to the

proprietary data.19 Also needed are improved estimates of market-scale drivers (numbers and types of cultivation facilities, consumption trends, etc.) Much more data (and modeling) are needed to get a strong handle on trends in national energy use associated with indoor cannabis production, and to understand the potential for improved energy efficiency and greenhouse-gas
reductions. More broadly, measured data alone does not help improve efficiency unless it compels the adoption of improved practices and technologies.

Among the critical policy-relevant questions remaining unanswered:

Are newer large industrial-scale facilities more or less energy efficient than traditionally
smaller indoor cultivation practices?
No definitive data have been presented in answer to this question. On the one hand, more
efficient heating and cooling systems can be expected, but on the other hand higher ceilings and wider lanes for vehicles and equipment result in far greater volumes of air
being space-conditioned. Pressure for maximum yields, which includes six or more crops
per year, may also entail greater aggregate energy inputs but less per final unit weight.

How much energy is used in manufacturing extracts and other derivative products? These processes can be energy intensive, involving equipment that creates high pressures and temperatures, post-processing, etc. In some cases, raw materials are frozen and stored
prior to extraction, using added energy. Post-harvest freezing becomes more likely when there is oversupply or inertia in bringing fresh product to market due to over-production or policy obstacles.
What is the added water burden of indoor cultivation with respect to electricity production and
wastewater treatment?
Conventional wisdom is that less direct irrigation water is needed for indoor cultivation,
thanks to reduced evaporation, and irrigation efficiencies may be improving with industrialized processes. However- -and of particular relevance to the many drought-
stricken parts of the countrythe massive amounts of water steadily evaporated from
dams and cooling towers while producing the electricity destined for indoor cultivation facilities vastly exceeds the direct irrigation water needed to grow outdoors. Based on a rule-of-thumb of one gallon of water per plant per day and the water intensity of average U.S. electricity production at the electricity intensities of Mills (2012) and seven liters of
cooling water per kilowatt-hour (per Torcellini et al., 2003), indoor cultivation indirectly
consumes about 18-times as much water (~1300 gallons per plant) as the amount used for direct irrigation. Amounts will vary locally depending on practices and electric generation mix in the grid. Ironically, the most water-intensive mode of electricity
production is otherwise environmentally lower-impact hydroelectric power. Meanwhile,
the greenhouse-gas emissions associated with the electricity used to power indoor grows
are fueling future droughts. The demands on wastewater treatment plants (and their energy use) must also be considered.

How much energy and emissions are embodied in inputs, equipment, and facilities used for
cultivation?
The energy use in making soils (or single-use growing media), soil amendments, and pesticides for cannabis production has not been quantified. Nor has that for constructing
facilities and the mechanical equipment that goes into them. Soils or other growing media are typically discarded after each indoor growing cycle, making this an ongoing stream of solid waste and embodied energy. As an illustration, we estimate that the mineral wool often used a as a growing media in hydroponic indoor cannabis-cultivation operations increases the overall carbon footprint of the final cannabis product by approximately 5% to 11%, depending on cultivation practices (and likely more given that it is manufactured
in areas with substantially higher electricity-related greenhouse-gas emissions than those assumed here).20 In another example, peat that is mined as a soil amendment destroys an important stable carbon sink in the environment. Meanwhile, agricultural activities of all
kinds consume about a billion pounds of plastic, a petrochemical product, annually a in the
United States alone (Grossman 2015).

never reach market? How much energy is embodied in producing cannabis products that The cannabis industry has been engaging in overproduction. Recent reports from Canada indicate extraordinary levels of overproduction, with only 4% of cannabis produced there
reaching the market (McBride 2019). Technical problems during cultivation cycles (temperature excursions and mold outbreaks) can result in total crop losses, and, for black
market actors, interdiction also results in product not reaching the market. Product failing
quality testing must be destroyed. The additional energy consumption associated with these factors has yet to be estimated but could be very significant.

How much transportation energy is involved, and how can that be minimized? The smaller the quantity of cannabis transported the greater the per-unit transportation emissions. In the original 2012 study (Mills 2012), transportation energy amounted to about 15% of the total carbon footprint. Vertically integrated operations (with co-located production, processing, and retail) may well reduce transportation energy requirements.

What is the ongoing role of black-market cultivation, which escapes measurement? There is a tendency to assume that with legalization "all" production shifts to a new footing. In practice black-market cultivation has remained dominant, and may well have a
distinctly different energy and carbon profile than industrialized operations. Misdirected policy measures appear to be enlarging the black-market share of total production, which
escapes regulation altogether. In California, for example, permitting has resulted in large
amounts of paperwork and long periods of suspended operations. Fees in that state for a

20 Per Mills (2012), the grid-based electricity related emissions of CO2 are 8.1 kg CO2 per square foot for each indoor cannabis growth cycle. Per Bribian et al., (2010), the lifecycle emissions of mineral wool are 1.511 kg CO2 per kilogram for average European conditions. This emissions factor depends heavily on electricity generation mix. A value of 2.736 was determined by Aivazidou (2013) for conditions in Greece (where the electric system is heavily dependent on lignite coal). Much U.S. manufacturing occurs in Mississippi and West Virginia, where electricity-related CO2 emissions are much higher than U.S. averages, which, in turn, are substantially higher than European-average emissions upon which Bribian et al's analysis is based.
Mineral wool usage calculations are based on specific weight of 1.8 kg per cubic foot of mineral wool (per Grodan manufacturer's specs) and range of material use in cultivation of 0.14 to 0.34 cubic feet (0.26 to 0.61kg) per square foot of growing area per growing cycle. This yields 0.38 to 0.92 kgCOz/sf-cycle, or 5 to 11% of the energy-related emissions. This analysis generously assumes that yields are two pounds per light per cycle in industrial grow operations.

22

"medium" indoor facility (10,001-22,000 square feet) can be $80,000 per year, which can
discourage participation in the regulated market (Bodwitch et al., 2019). NFD (2018) estimates that black-market operations are still responsible for three-quarters of the energy used to produce cannabis nationally. Non-uniform policy among the states is a significant driver of the black market, and also fosters illegal transportation to states
without legalization.

Policy solutions
Previously, policymakers' focus on the environmental impact of cannabis has been centered on outdoor cultivation, and even those efforts have been deemed highly inadequate by some observers (Carah et al., 2015). The past California Lieutenant Governor's 2015 report on the
topic doesn't once mention energy considerations (Blue Ribbon Commission on Marijuana
Policy 2015).

Solutions to the problems of indoor cultivation must begin with earnest policymaker engagement. Sadly, as leading promulgators of energy R&D and policy at the national level, the U.S. Department of Energy and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, federal entities with
decades of jurisdiction and impactful work on energy efficiency through all segments of the economy, remain silent on the topic. Due to absence of legalization at the federal level, these
agencies even back away from research on issues that could have significant public health and welfare implications (Plautz 2019). Moreover, vanishingly few policymakers at the state level, even in states with varying degrees of legalization, have embraced the issue. Notable exceptions are Massachusetts and Illinois, which have taken initial steps in the form of energy-related
building codes, although the quality of the outcomes is uncertain.
Following are some key needs and opportunities in the policy sphere.
Gather and publish more representative and useful energy data. A start has been made on collecting measured data for actual facilities, but it is far from being representative of the market
or having the resolution necessary to evaluate specific regions, cultivation practices, or facility types. It is essential to have third-party quality control and to ensure that these data are unbiased. An acute challenge here is that energy data in this industry--as for any energy-intensive industry--is regarded as highly proprietary. Producers as well as utilities are reluctant to disclose
information. Lessons may be taken from the IT sector, in which there is now ample transparency
of energy use in data centers and other high-tech facilities, despite prior concerns about the
sensitivity of this information. In any case. raw data on energy use doesn't in and of itself
identify rates of adoption of efficient technologies, best practices, or help facilities know how to
improve. Action-oriented benchmarking can achieve these latter objectives (Mills 2015).

Improve transparency and require energy-use disclosure. Mandatory public disclosure of total energy use as well as efficiency metrics for many types of non-residential buildings is becoming widespread nationally,?1 but the cannabis industry has thus far been passed over by these initiatives. Disclosure of this information could fill information voids that currently impede

21 See https://database.aceee.org/state/building-energy-disclosure

23

sound decision-making on the part of investors, energy companies, local authorities, cultivators,
and consumers. More transparency regarding the role of energy expenses in business cost structures can help identify inefficiencies that create energy waste, as well as help to develop
best practices. Permitted cultivators are typically required to report plant counts, the number of
cropping cycles and the total amount harvested from each crop. Requiring cultivators to report the facility type and equipment deployed during each cropping cycle along with the aggregate energy used as well as energy per data for policy analysts. unit crop finished weight could provide additional valuable

Create an improved consumer information environment, including product labeling. Policy
attention should be focused on consumer education and credible product labeling to enable more
informed consumer choice and guard against the greenwashing that is today prevalent. Prior to is distribution, producers are generally required to submit their products for testing and to make some of that information available to consumers through product labels. It would be a benefit to a
consumers to also have information regarding the methods used to produce the products and the associated carbon footprint. Dispensaries have a key role to play in this process and budtenders can help encourage decarbonization by educating customers and promoting products that are
produced using the most environmentally benign methods.

Eliminate anti-competitive market distortions favoring indoor cultivation. Subsidies to indoor cultivators (grants, tax credits, energy rebates, etc.) mask price signals that would otherwise help markets function correctly. Awarding preferential electricity tariffs or cash
incentives for new equipment disadvantages outdoor growers who have a vastly lower carbon footprint. Subsidies of all forms should be eliminated when they result in added energy use. Alternatively, it has been proposed that instead of utilities providing financial incentives to "efficient" indoor growers, that they incentivize outdoor cultivators, which achieves the greatest
energy savings (Davis 2019b).

Allocate a portion of licensing fees to help address externalities. Licensing fees for indoor operations are often higher than those for outdoor operations. This "signal" could be further
improved by incorporating some fee-proportionality to energy intensity, with an appropriate
portion of resulting fees reinvested in improving energy efficiency. Note that there is a
tremendous loophole in the current California license fee structure: greenhouses regardless of
how many supplemental lights they incorporate, are virtually exempt from indoor cultivation
fees, yet, as noted above, their energy use is substantial.

Develop science-based product-testing standards to avoid unnecessary crop destruction. To
minimize unnecessary destruction of energy-intensive finished products, more effort is needed to
ensure that required residue levels are realistic and in line with other consumer products such as
tobacco and alcohol. Rather than requiring immediate destruction of products, quarantined products should be remediated where possible. Methods such as advanced distillation and micro- filtration have been used to remove pesticides, heavy metals, mold, and other contaminants.

Conduct market-relevant open-source research and development. Public-sector R&D has a
long and successful track record of compensating for market failures where private industry does
not independently pursue technological pathways that are in the broader public interest (Mills

24

1995). Where there is lack of political will to mandate that all production be conducted outdoors, R&D can inform strenuous interventions to address the damage of any compromise position. These include better engineering and design tools for designers, labeling of energy using componentry, and mandatory efficiency standards. Other promising avenues include plant
genetics to minimize energy (and water) requirements, development of large-scale energy
benchmarking and disclosure initiatives, impartial technology assessments, and peer-reviewed
best-practice guidelines.

Where policymakers insist on subsidizing indoor growers - to the anticompetitive disadvantage
of outdoor growers - the thresholds for eligibility should be uncompromising. Arguably, only "Net Zero" facilities, i.e., those that generate all their energy on-site with zero-carbon methods (typically solar photovoltaic cells) should be allowed. Hundreds of net-zero non-residential buildings have been constructed around the country (NBI 2018), but there is no evidence that this has yet been accomplished for cannabis production.

Conclusions
Cannabis policy and environmental policy must be harmonized. Until then, some of the nation's hardest-earned progress towards climate change solutions is at risk as regulators continue to ignore this industry's mushrooming carbon footprint. Thanks to this inattention, producers have enjoyed a climate-change double standard (and lack of support) while being passed over by a
host of policies and programs successfully improving energy efficiency and deploying renewable
energy into virtually every other segment of the economy.

Those citing climate pollution as a reason not to legalize cannabis are missing the point:
legalization is necessary-but not sufficient-for addressing the problem. Yet, if done poorly, legalization can make the problem far worse. Indeed, history may judge today's cannabis policymakers as betraying the public trust by enabling an industry with such a large carbon
footprint.

Many are eager to see an industry more forthcoming about its carbon footprint and one that signals more hands-on interest in managing it and raising consumer awareness. A key factor in this process is individual consumer choice and expectations, which sends signals back to the
market that ultimately help shape production choices and processes.

The continuation of indoor cultivation does not appear to be defensible on energy and
environmental grounds. It may be argued that energy use can be reduced with large investments in energy efficiency or offset with renewable energy generation. However, this is an optimization of a suboptimal activity. These resources could be used more productively in other arenas where essentially zero-energy methods (i.e., outdoor cultivation, which has met humankind's needs for
five millennia) are not available. Meanwhile, zero-net-energy indoor cannabis production facilities have not been demonstrated, presumably because of the enormous area (and cost) of the
required solar arrays. Even with zero-net-energy indoor practices, other issues such as mercury
in lighting, embodied energy in buildings and equipment, water use, and solid waste production
remain concerns.

25

Proficiency in accomplishing the unnecessary will not yield true sustainability. Myopic optimization of an activity that does not have to be conducted in the first place is not a legitimate response to the very real risks society faces from climate change. The ethical integrity of indoor
cultivation-even at the greatest imaginable "stretch" levels of energy efficiency and renewable
propulsion-is in question. This is a pressing issue for producers, policymakers, and consumers
alike.

from plants can react with other urban air constituents (e.g., NOx, HO radical) and thus negatively affect regional air quality. In this pilot study, BVOC emissions from Cannabis plants were analyzed at four grow facilities. The concentrations of measured BVOCs inside the facilities were between 110 and 5,500 ug m-3. One adult Cannabis plant emits hundreds of micrograms of BVOCs per day and thus can trigger the formation of tropospheric ozone (approximately 2.6 g day-' plant-') and other toxic air pollutants. In addition, high concentrations of butane (1,080- 43,000 ug m*), another reactive VOC, were observed at the facilities equipped with Cannabis oil extraction
stations.
Implications: High concentrations of VOCs emitted from Cannabis grow facilities can lead to the
of formation of ozone, secondary VOCs (e.g., formaldehyde and acrolein), and particulate matter. Our results highlight that further assessment of VOC emissions from Cannabis facilities is needed, and this assessment is one of the key factors for developing policies for optimal air pollution control.

California: A cannabis-climate train wreck in
progress

An analysis I performed ten long years ago found that the carbon footprint of
electricity use in cannabis production in California (for legal and illegal activities
combined), amounted to that of 1 million average homes or 1 million cars. With the
rapid industrialization of cannabis cultivation over the intervening years (facilities well
over 100,000 square feet are now being constructed - and sometimes grouped
together in compounds with millions of square feet), energy use may be higher ... or
lower no one knows. California policymakers are flying blind regarding the current
carbon footprint of this burgeoning industry. Surely, they would not want this fledgling
industry to negate the hard-won greenhouse-gas reductions earned through decades of
effort. Alas, read on.

California is not only a symbol of progressive environmental thought, it has long been

an engine for innovative environmental technologies and policies. Many of the nation's
leading energy research and policy centers are located in the state, the utilities have
been in the vanguard as developers of energy efficiency programs and policies for
many decades, and California is one of the top states in the nation in terms of
renewable energy production. State legislators have passed some of the most far-
reaching climate change policies and targets in the world, notably State Bill 32 (SB 32),
the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 which aims to reduce statewide
greenhouse-gas emissions to a level 40% below 1990 levels by the year 2030.

Yet, a quiet but potent countervailing challenge to the attainment of these goals is

dictated that indoor cultivation was integral to the broader goal of legalization,
creating a preordained "purpose" that cannot be trumped by subsequent
environmental considerations.

At a higher level, the state's flagship California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA)
guidelines for development set a high bar for industries such as cannabis by stipulating
that "[i]f analysis of the project's energy use reveals that the project may result in
significant environmental effects dur 'nefficient, or unnecessary use of
energy, or wasteful use of energy resources, une EIR [Environmental Impact Report]
shall mitigate that energy use. This analysis should include the project's energy use for
all project phases and components, including transportation-related energy, during
construction and operation." Project owners are also required to make good-faith
estimates of long-term greenhouse-gas impacts and give more consideration to water
issues [CEQA Guideline §§15064.4, 15155].

These safeguards are well-founded in the case of cannabis. I recently completed a
couple of calculations that are truly shocking.

The first one involves a thought experiment to see how much "rooftop solar" it would
take to "zero-out" all the energy needed by indoor grow facility. Even in areas with
excellent solar availability, less than 5% of a facility's electricity needs could be
generated on the roof (and none in the case of greenhouses). One noted large-scale
facility aiming to be as sustainable as possible achieved a solar contribution of about
30% (Daniels 2019), which presumably required using a very large area of land beyond
the building footprint. A 'state-of-the-art' facility in Canada is projecting to offset only
8% to 10% of its electricity use by covering its entire roof (CBC 2019b), emitting
approximately 9,000 tons of CO2 per year instead of 10,000 tons without the solar.
Among the nation's largest proposed facilities, with 2.4 million square feet of enclosed
"cannabis industrial park", would only provide 4% of the needed electricity from its
rooftops, despite being in an optimal solar resource area on the California-Arizona
border. Meeting the full electricity demand would require approximately 1,400 acres of
photovoltaic panel area. An 80-megawatt dedicated natural-gas power plant is instead

centralized renewable energy, the amounts required are prodigious and for practical
purposes (e.g., land-use constraints) rarely achievable. Although California's Coachella

desert state (Nevada) in their sample is virtually identical to that used here for a
California desert location. Wind energy generating capacity values are from USGS

26 projects (475 MW) in the area (2.23 GWh/MW) are applied to the total installed 663

Here's another illustration of the emerging madness. Even in areas with excellent solar

Remarkably, despite available evidence, the state's Department of Consumer Attairs
initial CEQA analysis of proposed regulations for licensing of cannabis businesses
(applicable to cultivation operations up to 10,000 square feet) in California arrived at a
"Negative Declaration", indicating a perception of negligible environmental impacts
(Bureau of Cannabis Control 2017). The report deemed the energy-related impacts as
"Less Than Significant". A parallel Environmental Impact Report (EIR), prepared by
the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA), examined the larger-scale
cultivation and "track-and-trace" system for product distribution. The CDFA report
concedes that "[d]ue to the proprietary and often illicit nature of past and current
cannabis cultivation activities, limited accurate and reliable data are available ...
sufficient detail is not available to determine whether this [legalization] could result in
a meaningful change in energy use and GHG emissions compared to baseline
conditions" (California Department of Food and Agriculture 2017). They thus
undertake a "qualitative" rather than "quantitative" analysis.

Despite their enormous caveat, the EIR takes several leaps of faith to conclude that the
legalization program will be "beneficial" to attaining the State's greenhouse-gas
emission reduction goals. They achieve this feat by assuming that overall cannabis
production levels will not rise materially following legalization, while the legal fraction
of total statewide production will increase from approximately 5% to 10% of the state
totals (the rest being black market) and that this increment will automagically conform
with the state's SB emissions-reduction target. Thus, thanks to quick arithmetic, the
overall average emissions would be (slightly) lower than without legalization.
Additional (seemingly irrelevant) benefits are claimed via improvements in non-
greenhouse-gas emissions by diesel generators (with perhaps some assumed efficiency
gains therein). Moreover, in practice, diesel generators are rarely if ever used by legal
operators, so this is a largely irrelevant claim of benefits. The document predicts a
"small increase" in indoor cultivation, but does not document or quantify this heroic
assumption or anticipate the fact that localities are forcing large numbers of legal
projects indoors. In an additional oversight, no serious consideration seems to be
given to potential increases (due to regulatory requirements) in transportation energy

focus cultivation activities on outdoor and mixed-light techniques using natural
lighting and would prohibit indoor cultivation and some mixed-light cultivation
techniques that rely solely or partially on high-intensity grow lights." However, this
option is ultimately rejected because of the requirement under MAUCRSA that indoor
cultivation be allowed. The even more environmentally superior alternative of
restricting cultivation to outdoor farming (as is most of the other agriculture in the
state), was dismissed as well.

The net effect of these machinations is that California has thus far failed to grasp a
rapidly-closing window of opportunity to manage energy use and greenhouse-gas
emissions from the cannabis industry. California is:

Allowing a degree of statewide development that cannot be met by renewable
energy

Establishing an onerous post-prohibition regulatory regime that is compelling
producers to return to the black market and its covert, energy-intensive practices

Fostering cannabis development in some of the harshest climates in the state,
leading to higher energy use

Forcing cannabis cultivation to be done only indoors in many localities, per
decisions made at the city/county level

Providing financial incentives to indoor producers (via utility rebates), without
corresponding incentives to outdoor producers who save even more energy
Not investing in R&D on how to manage energy and greenhouse-gas emissions in

To their credit, a few localities have made preliminary efforts to manage energy use
and emissions. Yet, only 3 of 58 counties have implemented regulations calling for
renewable energy and/or limits on energy use (California Department of Food and
Agriculture 2017). Unfortunately, the very low stipulated energy budgets (e.g., 6 to 10

Abstract
Interest in growing cannabis for medical and recreational purposes is increasing worldwide. This study reviews the environmental impacts of cannabis cultivation. Results show that both indoor and outdoor cannabis growing is
water-intensive. The high water demand leads to water pollution and diversion, which could negatively affect the
ecosystem. Studies found out that cannabis plants emit a significant amount of biogenic volatile organic compounds,
which could cause indoor air quality issues. Indoor cannabis cultivation is energy-consuming, mainly due to heating,
ventilation, air conditioning, and lighting. Energy consumption leads to greenhouse gas emissions. Cannabis cultiva-
tion could directly contribute to soil erosion. Meanwhile, cannabis plants have the ability to absorb and store heavy
metals. It is envisioned that technologies such as precision irrigation could reduce water use, and application of tools
such as life cycle analysis would advance understanding of the environmental impacts of cannabis cultivation.
