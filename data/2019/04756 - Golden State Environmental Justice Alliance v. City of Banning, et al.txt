27 Environmental Quality Act (CEQA") and alleges:

28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) -

INTRODUCTION
2
1. Petitioner Golden State Environmental Justice Alliance ("Petitioner") challenges
3 the Banning Distribution Center (*Project"), located in the County of Riverside. The proposed
4 Project analyzed in the EIR calls for the development of an approximately 990,000 square foot
5 warehouse building, 10,000 square feet of office space, and a 503-space parking lot for
6 automobiles, ADA vehicles, and truck trailers.
7 2. City of Banning and City Council of Banning ("Respondents") certified the
8 Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") for the Project.
9
3. In approving the Project, the Respondents violated provisions of CEQA requiring
10 that the EIR adequately analyze significant adverse environmental impacts. The Respondents
11 further violated the requirement that it analyze a reasonable range of alternatives, and that it
12 adopt an environmentally superior alternative. Respondents failed to adopt all feasible mitigation
13 for project impacts, and the analysis of impacts and the planned mitigation measures is uncertain
14 and is unreasonably deferred. The level of review adopted by Respondents was insufficient and
15 therefore did not allow decision makers to intelligently consider the environmental consequences
16
of the Project.
17
4. Respondents' Findings of Fact and Statement of Overriding Considerations were
18 not supported by substantial evidence in the record. The Statement of Overriding Considerations
19 was improperly adopted when feasible mitigation measures and alternatives existed to lessen
20 significant project impacts.
21

22 JURISDICTION AND VENUE
23
5. This Court has jurisdiction under Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and
24 1094.5 and for declaratory relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 1060. The Court has
25 jurisdiction of CEQA matters pursuant to Pub. Resources Code sections 21168, 21168.5, and
26 21168.9.
27

28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 2

1
6. Venue is proper in this Court because the Respondents and Project are located in
2 Riverside County and the actions giving rise to the causes of action herein transpired in
3 Riverside County. See Code of Civil Procedure §§ 393 and 394.
4
7. This action is timely filed within 30 days of the posting of the Notice of
5
Determination under CEQA.
6
8. Petitioner has exhausted its administrative remedies by commenting on the
7 Project prior to the close of the public hearing on the Project in compliance with Public
8 Resources Code section 21177(b).
9 9. Petitioner has complied with CEQA by filing and serving with this Petition for
10 Writ of Mandate a Notice to the City of Banning of Intent to File pursuant to Pub. Resources
11 Code section 21167.5, a Notice to Attorney General of Commencement of Action pursuant to
12 Pub. Resources Code section 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure section 388, and a Notice of
13 Commencement of Action to Responsible Agencies pursuant to Public Resources Code section
14 21167.6.5.
15

16
PARTIES
17 10. Petitioner Golden State Environmental Justice Alliance ("Petitioner") is a
18 California not for profit corporation devoted to the preservation of the environment as well as the
19 promotion of safe and healthy communities. It is a corporation formed and operating under the
20

21 laws of the State of California. Members of Petitioner are taxpayers who reside in or near
Riverside County and would be irreparably harmed by the Project's environmental impacts and
22 have an interest in ensuring open, accountable, and responsive government and in protecting the
23 region's environment. Petitioner and its members submitted comments on the Project, bring this
24 action on behalf of the public, and are acting as private attorneys general conferring a significant
25 benefit on the general public or a large class of persons under Code of Civil Procedure section
26 1021.5.
27

28
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 3

1
11. Respondents City of Banning, a municipal corporation, and City Council of
2 Banning, a public entity ("Respondents") are located in Riverside County and are the lead
3 agencies for the Project under CEQA. Respondents are the agencies charged with regulating and
4 administering land use and development within its territory in compliance with the provisions of
5 its General Plan and zoning ordinances as well as applicable provisions of state law including
6 CEQA. As the lead agencies for the Project, Respondents have the duty to ensure compliance
7 with these applicable laws. Respondents are authorized and required by law to hold public
8 hearings, to determine whether CEQA applies to development within its jurisdiction, to
9 determine the adequacy of and certify environmental documents prepared pursuant to CEQA,
10 and to determine whether a project is compatible with the objectives, policies, general land uses,
11 and programs specified in the General Plan.
12 12. Real Party In Interest, Banning Distribution, LP, is the applicant for the Project
13 and is therefore served as Real Party in Interest pursuant to Public Resources Code section
14 21167.6.5(a). Banning Distribution, LP, is a California Limited Partnership that is located and
15 does business in the County of Riverside, State of Califomnia.
16 13. The true names and capacities of the Respondents and Defendants identified as
17 DOES 1 through 100, and of the Real Parties in Interest identified as DOES 101 through 200 are
18 unknown to Petitioner, who will seek the Court's permission to amend this pleading in order to
19 allege the true names and capacities as soon as they are ascertained. Petitioner is informed and
20 believes and on that basis, alleges that the fictitiously named Respondents and Defendants
21

22 - through 100 have jurisdiction by law over one or more aspects of the Project that is the subject
of this proceeding; and that each of the fictitiously named Real Parties in Interest 101 through
23 200 either claims an ownership interest in the Project or has some cognizable interest in the
24 Project.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA)

STATEMENT OF FACTS AND COMMON ALLEGATIONS
2
14. Petitioner opposes the Project and challenges certain actions taken by
Respondents. In particular, Petitioner seeks to invalidate the approvals with respect to the
4
Project on the grounds that Respondents have violated CEQA, the Planning and Zoning Law,
5
and other laws.
6
15. Petitioner seeks review by and relief from this Court under Public Resources
7 Code Section 21168 or 21168.5 as applicable; and Code of Civil Procedure Sections 1060 et seq.
8
and 1084 et seq., among other provisions of law.
9 16. Petitioner has satisfied all exhaustion-of-remedies requirements to maintain this
10 proceeding. By way of example and without limitation, Petitioner submitted written opposition
11 to the Project during the administrative proceedings for the Project.
12 17. Alternatively, and additionally, neither Public Resources Code Section 21177(a)-
13 (b) nor any other exhaustion-of-remedies requirement may be applied to Petitioner.
14
18. Respondents' conduct in approving the Project without complying with CEQA
15 constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion because, as alleged in this pleading, it failed to
16

17 proceed in the manner required by law and made findings not supported by substantial evidence.
19. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of
18 law, since its members and other members of the public will suffer irreparable harm as a result of
19 Respondents' violations of CEQA and other laws. Respondents' approval of the Project also
20 rests on the failure to satisfy a clear, present, ministerial duty to act in accordance with those
21 laws. Even when Respondents are permitted or required by law to exercise their discretion in
22 approving projects under those laws, they remain under a clear, present, ministerial duty to
23 exercise their discretion within the limits of and in a manner consistent with those laws.
24 Respondents have had and continue to have the capacity and ability to approve the Project within
25 the time limits of and in a manner consistent with those laws, but Respondents have failed and
26 refused to do so and have exercised their discretion beyond the limits of and in a manner that is
27 not consistent with those laws.
28
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA)

1
20. Petitioner has a beneficial right and interest in Respondents' fulfillment of all
2 their legal duties as alleged in this pleading.
3

4 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
5 Failure to Prepare Adequate Environmental Impact Report

6 (Against all Respondents and Real Parties in Interest)
7 21. Paragraphs through 20 are fully incorporated into this paragraph.
8 22. CEQA requires that every environmental impact report identify and analyze the

9 significant adverse environmental impacts of a proposed project, giving due consideration to
10 both short term and long term impacts, providing decision makers with enough information to
11 enable them to make an informed decision with full knowledge of the likely consequences of
12 their actions, and providing members of the public with enough information to participate
13 meaningfully in the project approval and environmental review process. CEQA also requires
14 that every environmental impact report identify and analyze a reasonable range of alternatives to
15 a proposed project. CEQA further requires that every environmental impact report identify and
16 analyze all reasonable mitigation measures for a proposed project 's significant adverse
17 environmental impacts. In each respect, CEQA mandates that the analyses contained in an
18 environmental impact report and all decisions of the lead agency based on the report be
19 supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record.
20 23. The Project's EIR fails to provide adequate identification and analysis of the
21 significant adverse environmental impacts of the Project. Further, neither the analysis of impacts
22 in the Project's EIR nor Respondents' certification of the EIR in this respect is supported by
23 substantial evidence in the administrative record.

24 24. The EIR is inadequate in ways that include, but are not limited to, those described
25 below.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 6

-

2 Unsubstantiated Input Parameters Used to Estimate Project Emissions

25.
3 The EIR for the Project relies on emissions calculated from the California

4 Emissions Estimator Model Version CalEEMod.2016.3.2 ("CalEEMod"). CalEEMod provides

5 recommended default values based on site specific information, such as land use type,

6 meteorological data, total lot acreage, project type and typical equipment associated with project

7 type. If more specific project information is known, the user can change the default values and

8 input project-specific values, but the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) requires that

9 such changes be justified by substantial evidence. Once all of the values are inputted into the

10 model, the Project's construction and operational emissions are calculated, and "output files" are

11 generated. These output files disclose to the reader what parameters were utilized in calculating

12 the Project's air pollutant and GHG emissions, and make known which default values were

13 changed as well as provide a justification for the values selected.
26.
14 When reviewing the Project's CalEEMod output files, located in Appendix C.3,

15 one input parameter was not consistent with information disclosed in the EIR. As a result,

16 emissions associated with the Project may be underestimated.

17 Failure to Include Parking Land Uses

27.
18 Review of the Project's CalEEMod output files demonstrates that not all of the

19 land uses proposed by the EIR were included in the Project's CalEEMod model. As a result, the

20 Project's construction and operational emissions are underestimated.

28.
21 According to the EIR, in addition to a 990,000 square foot warehouse and 10,000

square
22 feet of office space, the Project proposes to construct "174 automobile parking spaces, 8

23 American Disabilities Act-compliant (ADA) parking spaces, and 321 truck trailer parking

24 spaces" (pp. 1). Review of the EIR's CalEEMod output files, however, demonstrates that the

25 Project Applicant completely omitted the proposed parking land uses from the air model

26 (Appendix C, pp. 182).

29.
27 The omission of the Project's proposed parking land uses presents a significant

28 issue. As previously stated, the land use type and size features are used throughout CalEEMod

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 7

1 to determine default variable and emission factors that go into the model's calculations. By
2 omitting the parking land use from the model, the emissions that would be produced during
3 construction of the proposed parking structure are greatly underestimated. Paving for the parking
4 spaces involves laying concrete or asphalt, which will result in air pollutant emissions during
5 construction. Furthermore, operational emissions from architectural coating activities, electricity
6
usage from outdoor lighting, ventilation, and elevators in the proposed parking structures are
7 unaccounted for. By omitting the parking land use from the model, the emissions that would be
8 produced during construction and operation of the proposed warehouse are unaccounted for, and
9 as a result, the Project's emissions are greatly underestimated.
10 Failure to Implement All Feasible Mitigation to Reduce Emissions
11 30. The EIR's air quality analysis determines that the Project's construction and
12 operational emissions would exceed thresholds set forth by the South Coast Air Quality
13 Management District (SCAQMD) (Table 4.2-H, p. 4.2-38, Table 4.2-I, p. 4.2-39, Table 4.2-J, p.
14 4.2-39). As result, the Project proposes several mitigation measures to reduce the Project's
15 criteria air pollutant emissions (Table 1-C, p. 1-32). However, even after implementation of
16 mitigation, the EIR concludes that the Project's operational air quality impacts would be
17 significant with respect to NOx and greenhouse gases (GHG) (p. 4.2-39, p. 1-42). While it is
18 true that the Project would result in significant NOx and GHG impacts, the EIR's conclusion that
19 these impacts are "significant and unavoidable" is entirely incorrect. According to CEQA,
20 "CEQA requires Lead Agencies to mitigate or avoid significant environmental impacts
21 associated with discretionary projects. Environmental documents for projects that have
22 any significant environmental impacts must identify all feasible mitigation measures or
23 alternatives to reduce the impacts below a level of significance. If after the identification
24 of all feasible mitigation measures, a project is still deemed to have significant
25 environmental impacts, the Lead Agency can approve a project, but must adopt a
26 Statement of Overriding Consideration to explain why further mitigation measures are
27 not feasible and why approval of a project with significant unavoidable impacts is
28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 8

H warranted."
2
31.
3 An impact can only be labeled as significant and unavoidable after all available,

4 feasible mitigation is considered. Review of the Project's proposed mitigation measures,

5 however, demonstrates that not all feasible mitigation is being implemented (Table 1-C, p. 1-32 -

6 1-33). Therefore, the EIR's conclusion that impacts are significant and unavoidable is

7 unsubstantiated. As a result, additional mitigation measures should be identified and

8 incorporated in order to reduce the Project's air quality impacts to the maximum extent possible.

9 Until all feasible mitigation is reviewed and incorporated into the Project's design, impacts from

10 operation-related NOx and GHG emissions cannot be considered significant and unavoidable.

11 Project Alternatives

32.
12 Additionally, and alternatively, the Project's EIR fails to provide adequate

13 identification and analysis of a reasonable range of alternatives to the Project. Neither the

14 analysis of alternatives in the EIR nor Respondents' certification of the EIR in this respect is

15 supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record.

33.
16 CEQA requires that an EIR consider a "reasonable range of alternatives,"

17 Guidelines § 15126.6(a), and that the document must include a discussion of alternatives even if

18 to some degree they would limit accomplishment of the project's objectives, or would be more

19 costly. Guidelines § 15126.6(b).

34.
20 Respondents failed to adequately identify, analyze, and consider alternatives that

21 lessened the Project's impacts. The CEQA Guidelines mandate that "The range of potential

22 alternatives to the proposed project shall include those that could feasibly accomplish most of the

23 basic objectives of the project and could avoid or substantially lessen one or more of the

24 significant effects." Guidelines § 15126.6(c).

35.
25 Additionally, and alternatively, the Project's EIR fails to provide adequate

26 identification and analysis of measures to mitigate the Project's significant adverse

27 environmental impacts and fails to eliminate or substantially eliminate all such impacts. Neither

28 the analysis of mitigation measures nor Respondents' certification of the EIR in this respect is

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 9

L

2 supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record.

36.
3 CEQA requires an agency to adopt feasible mitigation measures that will

4 substantially lessen or avoid the Project's potentially significant impacts and to describe those
mitigation measures in the EIR. Pub. Res. Code §§ 21002, 21081(a), 21100(b)(3); Guidelines

6 § 15126.4. A lead agency may not conclude that an impact is significant and unavoidable

7 without requiring the imposition of all feasible mitigation measures to reduce impacts to less

8 than significant levels. Guidelines §§ 15126.4, 15091.
37.
9 CEQA also requires that an agency must adopt a "statement of overriding

10 considerations" for any significant effects which have not been mitigated to a level of

11 insignificance by mitigation measures or the adoption of alternatives. The agency must find

12 "that specific overriding economic, legal, social, technological, or other benefits of the project

13 outweigh the significant effects on the environment." Pub. Res. Code § 21081(b). The

14 statement of overriding considerations must be based on substantial evidence in the record. Pub.

15 Res. Code § 21081.5; Guidelines § 15093(b).

38.
16 Respondents adopted the statement of overriding considerations when feasible

17 mitigation measures and project alternatives existed, in violation of CEQA. Pub. Res. Code

18 § 21081; Guidelines § 15092. Respondents also failed to make all required written findings

19 regarding the Project's impacts. Respondents also approved the Project based on one or more®

20 written findings that there exist considerations outweighing the Project's significant adverse

21 environmental impacts, but there is not substantial evidence in the administrative record to

22 support all such findings. Moreover, Respondents approved the Project based on one or more

23 non-written findings that such considerations exist.

39.
24 As a result of Respondents' violations of CEQA, Petitioner has been harmed in

25 that the decision makers who approved the Project were not fully informed about the impacts of

26 mitigation measures for and alternatives to the Project prior to its approval, and the Petitioner

27 and the public will have to endure significant, avoidable, unmitigated adverse environmental

28 impacts without there being any (or there being insufficient) benefits to outweigh such impacts.
