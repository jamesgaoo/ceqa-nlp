h Pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure Sections 1094.5 and 1085, and
2 California Public Resources Code section 21000 et seq., Petitioners/Plaintiffs THE
3 SALVATION ARMY, EAST YARD COMMUNITIES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL
4 JUSTICE, GROWGOOD INC., and SHELTER PARTNERSHIP (collectively
5 "Petitioners/Plaintiffs") bring this action on their own behalf, on behalf of their members,
6 residents and staff, on behalf of the general public, and in the public interest in order to
7 enforce the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), and to protect air quality and
8 public health in and near the City of Bell, California. Petitioners/Plaintiffs allege as follows:

10 INTRODUCTION

1. is This is a case of a poor local community being exploited by a large foreign
11 construction company. Swayed by an offer of $450,000 per year, the City of Bell ("City")
12 has approved operation of a massive gravel pile, including train trips hauling crushed rock in
13 open cars through the City and hundreds of diesel trucks trips per day hauling the gravel
14 away -- all under the authority of a 6-year old EIR that approved a series of warehouses not
15 a rail project and gravel operation.
16 2. The proposed operator of the gravel pile, Real Party CEMEX Construction Materials
17 Pacific, LLC, ("CEMEX") a subsidiary of a huge foreign construction materials company,
18 failed to secure road access to the project site from the private road called out in the 2013
19 EIR to serve that site. CEMEX now claims the right to send hundreds of loaded gravel
20 trucks per day down a small, undermaintained private road that bisects The Salvation Army
21 and GrowGood properties - a route that was not analyzed in the 2013 EIR. In addition,
22 trains serving the CEMEX project will use a rail spur that is directly behind The Salvation
23 Army's property - where ten 3-bedroom modular homes are located - as well as
24 GrowGood's property. Air pollution associated with these train trips was not analyzed in the
25 2013 EIR.
26 3. To make matters worse, CEMEX has plans to seek approval for and build a Redi-Mix
27 cement plant on the same site. This would lead to hundreds more daily truck trips in the
28 neighborhood, a huge introduction of fine particulate matter into the atmosphere from the

RELIEF Printed on recycled paper

- cement manufacturing and processing operations, and an increase in greenhouse gas
2 emissions in the region.
3 4. This lawsuit challenges the January 31, 2019 approval by the Bell Design Review
4 Board of CEMEX's application to begin gravel delivery, storage and shipping operations on
5 the site (the "Project"). The Design Review Board was created in the 2013 Development
6 Agreement between Bell and Real Party PI Bell LLC for warehouse development in the area,
7 for the express purpose of determining whether a subsequent development was consistent
8 with the 2013 Development Agreement and EIR. But without conducting any new or
9 additional CEQA analysis, the Design Review Board found, incorrectly, that CEMEX's
10 application was consistent with the 2013 EIR and Development Agreement. Bell filed a
11 Notice of Exemption under CEQA for this Design Review Board approval on February 5,
12 2019, claiming that the Design Review Board approval was exempt from CEQA as a
13 ministerial act.
14 JURISDICTION AND VENUE
15 5. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to California Code of Civil
16 Procedure sections 1085, 1094.5 and 1060, and California Public Resources Code sections
17 21168, 21168.5 and 21168.9.
18 6. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure sections
19 393 and 394 because Respondents/Defendants are located in the County of Los Angeles and
20 the CEMEX project is proposed to be built in the County. Los Angeles County Superior
21 Court Rule 2.3(a) authorizes the filing of this Petition in the Central District of the Los
22 Angeles County Superior Court.
23 7. This action was timely filed within 35 days of the City's posting of its February 5,
24 2019 Notice of Exemption under CEQA.
25 8. Petitioners/Plaintiffs have provided written notice of their intention to file this
26 petition to Respondents/Defendants and other relevant agencies, in compliance with
27 California Public Resources Code section 21167.5, and are including the notice and proof of
28 service as Exhibit A hereto.

9. Petitioners/Plaintiffs have served the Attorney General with a copy of the present
2 petition along with a notice of its filing, in compliance with California Public Resources
3 Code section 21167.7, and are including the notice and proof of service as Exhibit B hereto.
4 10. Petitioners/Plaintiffs have complied with California Public Resources Code section
5 21167.6 and Los Angeles County Superior Court Local Rule 3.232(d)(2)(i) by filing a notice
6 that they are considering election to prepare the administrative record for this action. A copy
7 of the notice is attached hereto as Exhibit C.

8 11. The maintenance of this action is for the purpose of enforcing important public
9 policies of the State of California with respect to the protection of the environment and
10 public participation under CEQA. The maintenance and prosecution of this action will
11 confer a substantial benefit upon the public by protecting the public from the environmental
12 and other harms alleged in this Petition and Complaint. As such, Petitioners/Plaintiffs are
13 entitled to the recovery of reasonable attorneys' fees under California Civil Procedure Code
14 section 1021.5.
15 PARTIES

16 12. Petitioner/Plaintiff Salvation Army runs The Bell Shelter
17 (https://bellshelter.salvationarmy.org/)located on K Street in the City of Bell, near the site of
18 the proposed CEMEX project and directly adjacent to CEMEX's proposed truck route. The
19 Bell Shelter was established in 1988 by former Ninth Circuit Judge Harry Pregerson, an ex-
20 Marine and WWII veteran who spent his long career caring for homeless veterans and the
21 homeless population in general. The Shelter serves 500 people at a time and takes referrals
22 from all over Los Angeles County. In addition to the 500 people served at the Shelter, in
23 July 2018, The Salvation Army - with support and approval from the City of Bell - opened
24 Bell Oasis Apartments, which is a 64-unit permanent supportive housing development for
25 formerly homeless, disabled adults, most of whom are veterans. The Bell Shelter property
26 was acquired from the United States Government in 2007 under the McKinney-Vento
27 Homeless Education Assistance Improvements Act of 2001, 42 U.S.C. Sections 11301 et seq.
28 and is deed-restricted to providing services for the homeless.

13. Petitioner/Plaintiff East Yard Communities For Environmental Justice (*East Yard) is
2 a member-based organization that was established in 2002. With a base in Commerce, East
3 Los Angeles, and Long Beach, EYCEJ's mission is to achieve a safe and healthy
4 environment for communities that are disproportionately suffering the negative effects of
5 industrial pollution. Today, EYCEJ has a membership of over 350 community residents,
6 many of whom are active and participate regularly in community outreach, education and
7 civic engagement efforts.
8 14. Petitioner/Plaintiff GrowGood Inc. operates the Grow Good community garden
9 (https://www.grow-good.org/), a 501(c)(3) organization that grows food for the Bell Shelter
10 and provides job training for Bell Shelter clients. The GrowGood property is leased from the
11 Bell Shelter. GrowGood is also located on K Street, a poorly-maintained two-lane private
12 road beginning at the site of the proposed CEMEX project.
13 15. Petitioner/Plaintiff Shelter Partnership (https://www.shelterpartnership.org/)is a
14 501(c)(3) homeless services agency which solicits large-scale donations of merchandise and
15 provides items such as clothing to the people and agencies who need them free of charge, and
16 which provides technical assistance to community-based organizations and public agencies
17 that serve the homeless. The Shelter Partnership is on Rickenbacker Road, a private road a
18 owned by the federal government that the 2013 Bell EIR designated as access for the parcel
19 on which the CEMEX project is proposed. The Shelter Partnership also holds a deed from
20 the United States Government pursuant to the McKinney Act which restricts the uses of the
21 Shelter Partnership property. One condition of the deed is that, for 30 years from the
22 conveyance, the Shelter Partnership cannot convey an interest in its property without prior
23 approval from the U.S. General Services Administration.
24 16. Defendant/Respondent City of Bell is a public entity located in the County of Los
25 Angeles and was the lead agency for the warehouse project described in the 2013 EIR. This
26 was a speculative project and there was no project proponent at that time within the meaning
27 of CEQA.

1 17. Real Party in Interest CEMEX, a subsidiary of the construction materials company
2 CEMEX S.A.B. de C.V. (https://www.cemex.com/about-us/our-history),submitted that
3 application that was approved at the January 31, 2019 Bell Design Review Board meeting.
4 CEMEX is not a party to the 2013 EIR. Real Party in Interest PI Bell LLC, also not a party
5 to the 2013 EIR, entered into a Development Agreement with Bell in 2013 to develop
6 warehouses on land that it had purchased from Bell.
7 18. Petitioners/Plaintiffs do not know the true names of defendants DOES 1 through 100,
8 inclusive, and therefore sue them by those fictitious names. Petitioners/Plaintiffs are
9 informed and believe, and on the basis of that information and belief allege, that each of
10 those defendants was in some manner proximately responsible for the events and happenings
11 alleged in this complaint and for Petitioners' /Plaintiffs' injuries.
12 THE PROPOSED CEMEX PROJECT IN BELL
13 19. This matter arises from a proposed aggregate (gravel) storage and distribution facility
14 in the city of Bell, California. Bell is a small, mostly Latinx blue collar community of
15 approximately 36,000 residents southeast of Los Angeles. For a small city, it has a
16 remarkable history of municipal malfeasance and scandal, resulting in jail terms for two
17 former officials and the recall of its entire City Council. See
18 http://www.latimes.com/local/bell/la-me-bell-scandal-a-times-investigation-20160211-
19 storygallery.html#.
20 20. At the behest of its corrupt former Mayor, Bell decided to buy federally-owned
21 parcel of land near the I-710, a busy freeway. The idea was to lease the property for use as
22 an intermodal yard. To finance the purchase, the City issued $35 million in bonds secured by
23 the property to be purchased, with the proceeds from the lease supporting the City's
24 payments on the bonds. However, the lease was invalidated by a lawsuit brought in 2007 by
25 East Yard based on violations of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).
26 Subsequently, the City bonds went into default; see
27 http://articles.latimes.com/2010/aug/07/local/la-me-bell-bond-20100807. A European bank
28 that had bought the bonds sued Bell and sought to foreclose on the secured property.

P 21. To resolve the foreclosure litigation, the new Bell City Council sold 40.2 acres of
2 City property in 2013 to Real Party PI Bell LLC for $44.5 million. On August 7, 2013, the
3 City Council approved a Purchase and Sale Agreement, Environmental Impact Report
4 ("EIR") and Development Agreement enabling PI Bell to develop the property into the "Bell
5 Business Park." The EIR contemplated commercial warehouse use for the property.
6 22. The current dispute concerns 14.5 acre triangular property, Parcel A, directly east of
7 the I-710 Freeway. Traditional warehouses have built on the other parcels bought by PI Bell.
8 Until very recently, Parcel A remained undeveloped. The 2013 EIR and Development
9 Agreement require that Rickenbacker Road be the primary access for Parcel A. CEMEX
10 leased Parcel A and came to the City with proposal to build an open-air receiving and
11 distribution center for aggregate (mostly gravel) for construction projects, and later to add a
12 cement-making plant. However, CEMEX did not acquire an easement or any other right to
13 use Rickenbacker Road.
14 23. As part of its development proposal, CEMEX applied to the South Coast Air Quality
15 Management District (AQMD) for a permit, claiming that the CEMEX operation would
16 include over 300 truck trips per day, every day. The AQMD permit was approved based on
17 the 2013 EIR - which did not
18 describe the CEMEX project or anything like it.
24. In 2017, CEMEX submitted building plans to the City. CEMEX promised to pay the
19 City $450,000 per year if the Project were approved. The CEMEX plans contemplate one or
20 two train trips per week, with open-topped rail cars carrying aggregate from a mine in the
21 Victorville area along a rail spur directly behind the The Salvation Army and GrowGood
22 property. Gravel would then be moved by conveyor into a roofless storage silo until
23 transferred into trucks for delivery in Southern California. Bell purported to approve this
24 plan in 2017 by an action by a now-former employee who disregarded the requirements for
25 project approval in the Development Agreement.
26 25. East Yard thereupon filed suit against Bell, seeking to halt the CEMEX project until
27 the project went through the City's Design Review Board process as required by the 2013
28 Development Agreement. The case settled on condition that the project go through the

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; 7

COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF Printed on recycled paper

Design Review Board by the end of November 2018. After some delay, the Design Review
2 Board approved the project in January 2019, rejecting Plaintiffs/Petitioners' demand that the
3 approval prohibit use of K Street by CEMEX. In particular, the Design Review Board found
4 that the CEMEX plans were consistent with the 2013 Development Agreement and EIR
5 despite the contrary position taken by the Bell City Attorney in a letter to CEMEX's attorney
6 dated March 23, 2018, in which the City Attorney wrote:
7
co In addition, in approving a minor modification, the DRB must make findings,

9 including a finding that the modification "would not require additional

10 environmental review subject to Section 15162 of the CEQA Guidelines."

11 The lack of analysis in the EIR for the DA of any kind of particulate

12 emissions from the uses on the site would have precluded the DRB from

13 making such a finding had the plan been presented to them. The original EIR

14 approved on August 7, 2013, did not contemplate storage of aggregate

15 materials and outdoor conveyor systems, as the tenants then being considered

16 by the developer were instead light industrial.
26. As of the filing of this Petition/Complaint, CEMEX does not have a legal right to use
17 Rickenbacker Road for any purpose. CEMEX has threatened to use K Street instead -- a
18 small street that passes by the front door of the Bell Shelter and its several hundred military
19 veteran residents, many of whom are disabled. Neither use of the CEMEX property for an
20 aggregate storage and distribution center, nor use of K Street for any purpose, nor delivery of
21 crushed rock by rail, was analyzed or approved in the 2013 EIR or Development Agreement,
22 and the Design Review Board finding of consistency was arbitrary, capricious and plainly
23 wrong.
24

25 CEQA VIOLATIONS

26 a 27. CEQA requires a subsequent or supplemental EIR in the circumstances of this case.

27 28. CEQA Guideline 15162, cited in the Bell City Attorney's letter described in

28 paragraph 25 above, provides that a subsequent EIR may be appropriate where:
(1) Substantial changes are proposed in the project which will require major

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; 8

COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF Printed on recycled paper

2 revisions of the previous EIR or negative declaration due to the involvement of new

3
L significant environmental effects or a substantial increase in the severity of previously
identified significant effects;

Un (2) Substantial changes occur with respect to the circumstances under which the

6 project is undertaken which will require major revisions of the previous EIR or

7 Negative Declaration due to the involvement of new significant environmental effects

or

8 substantial increase in the severity of previously identified significant effects; or

9 (3) New information of substantial importance, which was not known and could not

10 have been known with the exercise of reasonable diligence at the time the previous

11 EIR was certified as complete or the Negative Declaration was adopted, shows any of
the following:
12
13 (A) The project will have one or more significant effects not discussed in the

14 previous EIR or negative declaration;

15 (B) Significant effects previously examined will be substantially more severe

16 than shown in the previous EIR;

17 (C) Mitigation measures or alternatives previously found not to be feasible

18 would in fact be feasible, and would substantially reduce one or more

19 significant effects of the project, but the project proponents decline to adopt

20 the mitigation measure or alternative; or

21 (D) Mitigation measures or alternatives which are considerably different from

22 those analyzed in the previous EIR would substantially reduce one or more

23 significant effects on the environment, but the project proponents decline to

24 adopt the mitigation measure or alternative.
29. Alternatively, a supplement to an EIR may be appropriate under CEQA Guideline
25 15163 when:
26
27 (1) Any of the conditions described in Section 15162 would require the preparation

28 of a subsequent EIR, and

(2) Only minor additions or changes would be necessary to make the previous EIR

1 adequately apply to the project in the changed situation.
2 30. Here, a subsequent or supplemental EIR is required to analyze, for the first time, the
3 effects on the environment of the CEMEX aggregate facility proposal, including the air
4 quality and noise issues inherent in running hundreds of diesel trucks per day down K Street
5 or Rickenbacker Road and in the proposed rail operations. The Bell City Attorney
6 recognized this in his May23, 2018 letter. The EIR should also analyze the effect of the
7 McKinney Act on the proposed CEMEX project. These analyses have never been done.
8 31. Moreover, the January 2019 decision of the Design Review Board was a discretionary
9 act subject to CEQA because the Board had to determine whether the CEMEX Project was
10 consistent with the 2013 EIR and Development Agreement, and had to exercise planning and
11 development judgment to interpret the 2013 documents in light of a new and very different
12 project.
13 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
14 (Writ of Mandate, California Civil Code Section 1085)
15 32. Paragraphs 1 through 31 are incorporated by reference herein.
16 33. The findings of the Design Review Board hearing conducted by the City of Bell on
17 January 31, 2019 were arbitrary, capricious and contrary to law for the reasons set forth
18 herein. In particular, and without limitation, the CEMEX proposal that was before the
19 Design Review Board is not consistent with the 2013 EIR or Development Agreement at
20 issue,

23 VIOLATION OF CEQA - SUBSEQUENT OR SUPPLEMENTAL EIR REQUIRED
24 34. Paragraphs 1 through 33 are incorporated by reference herein.
25 35. The Project was not analyzed in the 2013 EIR, nor was the use of K Street for
26 sustained commercial purposes such as those now threatened by CEMEX. In these
27 circumstances, CEQA requires the preparation of a subsequent or supplemental EIR
28 analyzing the effects on the environment of the Project and requiring all feasible mitigation

VIOLATION OF CEQA - FAILURE TO PREPARE EIR
36. Paragraphs 1 through 35 are incorporated by reference herein.
37. The January 31, 2019 decision of the Design Review Board was a discretionary act
7 subject to CEQA, but the CEQA process was ignored. No Notice of Preparation was
8 prepared, no Scoping Meeting held, and no negative declaration or other CEQA document
9 other than the Notice of Exemption was prepared. The Notice of Exemption was and is
10| invalid because Design Review Board review of the Project was a discretionary decision and
11 its approval of the Project was subject to CEQA.

20| Design Review Board;
21 B. For a writ of mandate to be issued under the seal of this Court commanding Bell to
22 conduct a subsequent or supplemental CEQA analysis of the Project, and to set aside its

INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO COMPLETE THE COVER SHEET CM-010

To Plaintiffs and Others Filing First Papers. If you are filing a first paper (for example, a complaint) in a civil case, you must complete and file, along with your first paper, the Civil Case Cover Sheet contained on page 1 . This information will be used to compile statistics about the types and numbers of cases filed. You must complete items 1 through 6 on the sheet. In item 1, you must check one box for the case type that best describes the case. If the case fits both a general and more specific type of case listed in item check the more specific one. If the case has multiple causes of action, check the box that best indicates the primary cause of action. To assist you in completing the sheet, examples of the cases that belong under each case type in item 1 are provided below. A cover sheet must be filed only with your initial paper. Failure to file a cover sheet with the first paper filed in a civil case may subject a party, its counsel, or both to sanctions under rules 2.30 and 3.220 of the California Rules of Court.
To Parties in Rule 3.740 Collections Cases. A "collections case" under rule 3.740 is defined as an action for recovery of money owed in a sum stated to be certain that is not more than $25,000, exclusive of interest and attorney's fees, arising from transaction in which property, services, or money was acquired on credit. A collections case does not include an action seeking the following: (1) tort damages, (2) punitive damages, (3) recovery of real property, (4) recovery of personal property, or (5) a prejudgment writ of attachment. The identification of a case as a rule 3.740 collections case on this form means that i will be exempt from the general
time-for-service requirements and case management rules, unless a defendant files a responsive pleading. A rule 3.740 collections case will be subject to the requirements for service and obtaining a judgment in rule 3.740.
To Parties in Complex Cases. In complex cases only, parties must also use the Civil Case Cover Sheet to designate whether the case is complex. If a plaintiff believes the case is complex under rule 3.400 of the California Rules of Court, this must be indicated by completing the appropriate boxes in items 1 and 2. If a plaintiff designates a case as complex, the cover sheet must be served with the complaint on to all parties to the action. A defendant may file and serve no later than the time of its first appearance a joinder in the plaintiff's designation, a counter-designation that the case is not complex, or, if the plaintiff has made no designation, a designation that the case is complex.
