Encinitas Residents Coalition v. California Coastal Commission Page Verified Petition

1 INTRODUCTION

2 1. This action challenges the approvals by Respondent California Coastal Commission

3 ("Commission" or "Respondent") of the North Coast Highway 101 Streetscape Project ("Project"), and

4 the related failure to comply with the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Pub. Res.

5 Code § 21000, et seq., the California Coastal Act ("Coastal Act"), Pub. Res. Code § 30000, et seq., and

6 the Public Trust.

7 2. The Project involves reductions in the number of travel lanes along scenic and historic

8 Coast Highway 101 and the construction of roundabouts and other streetscape modifications within the

9 Leucadia community in the City of Encinitas.

10 3. Among other things, the Commission violated the Coastal Act and violated public easement
11 rights and the Public Trust in approving the amendments to the City's Local Coastal Program ("LCP")

12 and Coastal Development Permit ("CDP") for the Project. The Commission also failed to adequately

13 consider the environmental and cumulative impacts associated with the Project, failed to adequately

14 prepare, circulate, and consider required environmental analysis, failed to consider and adopt feasible
15 alternatives, and failed to provide meaningful and measurable mitigation measures.

16 4. Petitioner seeks alternative and peremptory writs of mandate declaring the Commission's

17 approvals invalid, and enjoining the Commission from taking steps to implement the approvals.

18 PARTIES

19 5. Petitioner Encinitas Residents Coalition is an unincorporated association of residents and

20 neighbors in Encinitas created after approval of the Project. Petitioner's goal is to carefully address all
21 development and growth issues in the City of Encinitas for the protection and well-being of its citizens,

22 unique community character and environment. Petitioner seeks to protect the environment, community

23 character, public health, safety, and scenic viewshed in the North Coast Highway 101 Corridor, and to

15 will amend the Petition to set forth the names and capacities of said real parties in interest along with

16 appropriate charging allegations when the same have been ascertained.

17 PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND HISTORY

18 10. The City of Encinitas LCP was certified by the Commission on November 17, 1994. On

19 May 15, 1995, the City began issuing permits for the areas of the City within the Coastal Zone.

20 11. The Project involves a 2.5-mile segment of North Coast Highway 101 between La Costa

21 Avenue at the north end and A Street at the south end, in the community of Leucadia within the City of

22 Encinitas.

23 12. The Circulation Element of the City's General Plan designates this portion of North Coast

24 Highway 101 as a 4-lane Major Arterial.

25 13. Currently, the Project Corridor is a scenic and historic 4-lane roadway between A Street

26 and Leucadia Boulevard. Between Leucadia Boulevard and La Costa Avenue it provides one

27 "through" vehicle lane and a bike lane in a the northbound direction, and it provides a "through" vehicle

28 land and a shared vehicle/bicycle lane in the southbound direction.

Encinitas Residents Coalition v. California Coastal Commission
Verified Petition Page 3

1 14. The corridor is a portion of one of the most heavily traveled routes anywhere in the City.

2 Drivers are experiencing increased traffic congestion and neighboring residents are experiencing
increased cut-through traffic onto residential streets adjacent to the Coast Highway.
15. This segment of the Coast Highway is the primary ingress and egress corridor for residents
living on the west side of the highway, as they travel to destinations north, south and east. It is also

6 used by visitors to the area seeking to access the beaches and coastline.
16. Signalized intersections occur at Leucadia Boulevard and at La Costa Avenue. An all-way

8 stop-controlled intersection occurs at Marcheta Street near the south end of the corridor. All remaining
side streets intersecting the corridor are stop controlled.

10 17. There has been historic and continued use of the unimproved NTD right of way for parking

11 along the east side of the North Coast Highway 101 through the corridor. On-street parallel parking is

12 available along the west side of the corridor. There are no public parking lots within the corridor.
13 18. Drainage problems have been frequent along many portions of the corridor, with excessive

14 ponding and flooding in several areas.

15 19. Fire Department Emergency response times to the Northwest portion of the City, located

16 within the Project Corridor, have often not been able to meet the requisite standards for emergency

17 service response 5 within 5 minutes 80% of the time.

18 20. The corridor contains several mature trees, many of which surround and provide enclosure

19 over the streets and walkways. There is a center median that provides a landscaped buffer through

20 much of the corridor. Many of the trees date back to the early settlers of the region, are over 100 years
21 old, and provide an important role in defining the unique community character along the corridor.

22 21. On the west side of the Leucadia Boulevard intersection, Leucadia Roadside Park provides

23 an open space area with a lawn and trees.

24 22. The corridor generally contains the North Coast Transit District railroad right-of-way on its

25 east side and several mainly one- and two-story businesses, restaurants, hotels and other commercial
26 establishments on its west side. Collectively, the structures, many of which date back to the mid-

27 1900s, form an eclectic blend of architecture that is distinctively "Leucadia."

28

Encinitas Residents Coalition v. California Coastal Commission
Verified Petition Page 4

1 23. All properties along the side streets to the west of the corridor support residential land uses.

2 The neighborhood residential side streets are generally formed into a street grid pattern or terminate at

3 Neptune Avenue, which extends north-south atop the bluff edge to the Pacific Ocean.

4 24. The railroad tracks run along the east end of the corridor and Vulcan Avenue, a two-lane

5 Collector Street, runs parallel to the corridor east of the train tracks. Land uses are primarily

6 residential along Vulcan Avenue, although there are some commercial businesses and Paul Ecke

7 Elementary School.

8 25. A Coast Rail Trail is planned for pedestrian and bicycle pathways within the NCTD right-

9 of-way, directly east and adjacent to the Coast Highway Project Corridor.

10 26. The Project includes the reduction in the number of lanes in each direction, the addition of

11 bike lanes on both sides of the roadway, six new roundabouts, crosswalks, a new median, bus turnout

12 bays along the east side of Highway 101, improvements to the existing sidewalk on the west side of

13 Coast Highway 101, new landscaping, stormwater improvements and other revisions to existing on and

14 off street parking along Highway 101.

15 27. In early 2008 the City initiated the Leucadia Streetscape project to create a concept plan.
16 28. At a January 13, 2010 City Council meeting, staff presented an overview of a design and
17 process, including plan alternatives, design and traffic calming concepts, and traffic analysis. The City
18 Council directed staff to move forward with "Alternative 4A Concept Plan."

19 29. At a December 15, 2010 City Council meeting, the City Council directed staff to move

20 forward with implementation of "Refined Phase 1" of the plan.

21 30. On September 11, 2013, the City Council authorized the Director of Public Works to enter

22 into an agreement with a consultant to provide design services for "Refined Phase 1.33

23 31. On April 8, 2015, staff updated the City Council to present the changes that occurred

24 between the 2010 4A Concept Plan and the refined 4A30% Design Plan.

25 32. On or about December 2, 2016, a Draft EIR regarding the Project was made available for

26 public review. The City subsequently amended a portion of the Draft EIR, which was recirculated on

27 or about March 14, 2017.

28

Encinitas Residents Coalition v. California Coastal Commission
Verified Petition Page 5

1 33. The City received numerous comment letters on the Draft EIR and the recirculated Draft

2 EIR, including from Petitioner's members. Additional comments were submitted after the close of the

3 comment period on the draft EIR.

4 34. Comments noted the Project's impacts, including impacts to community character, traffic

5 and circulation, safety, parking, noise, lighting, public services, and other issues.

6 35. Commenters also noted that the EIR had failed to consider impacts to intersections and

7 roadways adjacent to the Project area. The City defined the "Project area" too narrowly, thereby

8 ignoring impacts in locations just outside of the Project corridor.

9 36. Commenters also noted the City had adequately failed to analyze and pursue an
10 environmentally superior alternative.

11 37. On March 1, 2018, the Planning Commission considered the Project and EIR. Testimony
12 was received. The Planning Commission voted to recommend approval of the Project and EIR, as well

13 as to recommend adoption of amendments to the General Plan, Local Coastal Plan and North 101

14 Corridor Specific Plan.

15 38. On March 21, 2018, the City Council met to consider the Project and EIR. Testimony,

16 including from Petitioner's members, was received regarding several concerns. Again, concerns about

17 the methodologies of traffic assessments, cut through traffic onto neighboring residential streets,

18 emergency response times, and environmental impacts were expressed, as well as other concerns.

19 Despite these concerns, the City Council voted to approve the Project and EIR. Approvals included

20 approving: (1) Resolution No. 2018-35, approving the EIR, findings, a Statement of Overriding
21 Considerations, and a Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program; (2) Resolution No. 2018-34,

22 approving a Design Review Permit and a Coastal Development Permit; and (3) the first reading of

23 Ordinance No. 2018-05, amending the General Plan, North 101 Corridor Specific Plan, and Local Coastal

24 Program.

25 39. On April 18, 2018, the City Council met to consider the second reading of Ordinance No.

26 2018-05. Again, Petitioner's members expressed concerns about the Project and its impacts. The City

27 Council approved the second reading of Ordinance No. 2018-05.

28

Encinitas Residents Coalition v. California Coastal Commission Page 6 Verified Petition

1 40. Several parties timely filed an appeal of the City's issuance of the CDP for the Project with

2 the Commission, Appeal Number A-6-ENC-18-0019.

3 41. On April 27, 2018, the City submitted LCP Amendment No. LCP-6-ENC-18-0034-1 to the

4 Commission. The proposed amendments, necessary to implement the Project, sought to revise the

5 Circulation Element of the City's certified Land Use Plan ("LUP") and the North 101 Corridor

6 Specific Plan, part of the City's certified LCP Implementation Plan ("IP"), (collectively "LCP
7 Amendments").

8 42. The LCP Amendments were originally scheduled for the Commission's August 2018

9 hearing. The City requested the hearing on the LCP Amendments be postponed to the same hearing

10 for the appeal of the City's issuance of the CDP for the Project.

11 43. The Commission scheduled a hearing on both LCP Amendment No. LCP-6-ENC-18-0034-
12 and the CDP appeal for its October 2018 meeting.

13 44. In its report to the Commission, Coastal Commission staff recommended the Commission

14 deny LCP Amendment No. LCP-6-ENC-18-0034-1 and the CDP. In making its recommendation,

15 Coastal Commission staff stated the: "LCP amendment fails to address the potential scope of road

16 modifications on major coastal access routes and the coastal resources impacts that need to be

17 addressed in the context of the LCP."

18 45. The Coastal Commission staff report noted that the Project would adversely impact public

19 coastal access and recreation, water quality and biology, and community character and visual

20 resources, in violation of the Coastal Act.

21 46. At the October 11, 2018 Commission meeting, Petitioner and others provided testimony

22 and a presentation to the Commission opposing approval of LCP Amendment No. LCP-6-ENC-18-

23 0034-1 and CDP.

24 47. Despite this testimony, the Commission approved the LCP Amendments and CDP.

25 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

26 AND INADEQUATE REMEDIES AT LAW

27 48. Petitioner exhausted all available administrative remedies, and objections to the Project

28 have been presented orally and in writing to the Commission, as required by Public Resources Code

Encinitas Residents Coalition v. California Coastal Commission Page 7 Verified Petition

1 Section 21177. These include, but are not limited to, letters and oral comments presented during

2 public hearings.

3 49. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code Section 21167.5

4 by mailing a written notice of commencement of this action to the Commission. A true and correct

5 copy of that notice is attached hereto as Exhibit 1.

6 50. Petitioner has advised the Commission that Petitioner has elected to prepare the record of
7 proceedings relevant to the approval of the Project, pursuant to Public Resources Code Section

8 21167.6. A true and correct copy of that notice is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.

9 51. Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code Section 21167.7 by filing a copy of
10 the original petition with the California Attorney General. A true and correct copy of the notification

11 is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.

12 52. Petitioner has no adequate remedy at law unless the Court grants the requested writ of

13 mandate requiring the Commission to set aside its approval of the LCP Amendment No. LCP-6-ENC-

14 18-0034-1 and denial of the CDP appeal. In the absence of such remedy, the Commission's approvals
15 will remain in effect in violation of State law, and Petitioner will suffer irreparable harm because of the

16 significant adverse environmental impacts generated by the Project.

17 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

18 (VIOLATION OF THE CALIFORNIA COASTAL ACT)

19 53. Petitioner incorporates by reference each of the allegations set forth in this Petition as if set
forth herein in full.
20

21 54. The Project violates and is inconsistent with the California Coastal Act. Public access and

22 availability is major tenant of both the Coastal Act and the City's certified Local Coastal Program.

23 Rather than maximize public access to and along the coast as required by the Coastal Act, the Project

24 would degrade and limit coastal access in a variety of ways.

25 55. The Commission's approval of the LCP Amendments and CDP will negatively impact

26 public beach access and recreation, in a manner that is inconsistent with the Coastal Act.

27 56. Among other things, the Project impacts the public's ability to access the beach or enjoy a

28 recreational drive along the coast on the historic Coast Highway. The Project would also increase the
time it takes to travel on Highway 101 which could deter the public from traveling to the beach.

Encinitas Residents Coalition v. California Coastal Commission Page 8 Verified Petition

1 57. Additionally, the EIR for the Project fails to analyze weekend and summer traffic condition,

2 which also effects beach access. These traffic conditions limit public access to and along the coast and

3 public recreational opportunities in violation of the Coastal Act.

4 58. The Commission also failed to fully analyze historic public parking. The Project would

5 eliminate the ability for the public to continue parking in the informal dirt parking area that the public

6 has used for many years and that serves as an important public access resource. The loss of this public

7 parking limits public access to and along the coast and public recreational opportunities in violation of

8 the Coastal Act.

9 59. The Commission's approval of the LCP Amendments and denial of the CDP appeal

10 violates, among other things, the policies contained in Coastal Act Section 32000, et seq., including

11 negatively impacting public access, recreation, water quality, biological resources, community

12 character, and visual resources.

13 60. The piecemeal development violates the Coastal Act. The Commission failed to consider
14 future development that foreseeably will occur as a result of the LCP Amendments approval and denial

15 of the CDP appeal.

16 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

17 (FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH CEQA PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS)

18 61. Petitioner incorporates by reference each of the allegations set forth in this Petition as if set
forth herein in full.
19

20 62. The FEIR fails to meet the requirements for an objective analysis of impacts.

21 63. Respondents committed to developing the Project prior to the approval of the FEIR.

22 64. Respondents failed to recirculate the EIR after substantial changes were made.

23 65. Respondents failed to revise the EIR or prepare supplemental analysis after substantial

24 changes were made to the Project.

25 66. Respondents failed to follow procedures mandated by CEQA, including but not limited to,

26 failing to notify responsible agencies, failing to provide proper notice for public involvement, failing to

27 provide adequate information in the EIR and allow adequate opportunity for public input, and failing to

28 provide adequate access to Project-related documents.
