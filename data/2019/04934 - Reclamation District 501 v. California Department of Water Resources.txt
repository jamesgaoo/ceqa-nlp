RE: Notice to Attorney General of Commencement of Action against the California Department of Water Resources
To the Attorney General of the State of California:
Please take notice, under Public Resources Code section 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure section 388, that on September 18, 2019, Petitioner Reclamation District 501 filed a Petition for Writ of Mandate (the "Petition") under the provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code section 21000 et seq. ("CEQA"), against the California Department of Water Resources ("DWR"). The Petition challenges DWR's August 19, 2019 certification of the Final Environmental Impact Report for the Prospect Island Tidal Restoration Project ("Project"). The lawsuit will be based on violations of CEQA and other claims, as discussed more fully in the Project's administrative and environmental review proceedings. The exact nature of the allegations and relief sought is described in the Petition, and is attached to this notice as Exhibit 1.

Very truly yours,

1 INTRODUCTION

2 1. Petitioner RECLAMATION DISTRICT 501 ("RD 501" or "Petitioner") petitions

3 this Court for a Writ of Mandate ("Petition"), directed to Defendant CALIFORNIA

4 DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES ("DWR" or "Respondent"). Petitioner challenges

5 DWR's August 19, 2019 certification of the Final Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") for the

6 Prospect Island Tidal Restoration Project ("the project"), which is intended to restore tidal action

7 to the interior of Prospect Island and fulfill DWR's obligations from the United States Fish and

8 Wildlife Service's ("USFWS") Delta Smelt Biological Opinion ("BiOp") for the long-term

9 coordinated operations of the State Water Project ("SWP") and the federal Central Valley

10 Project ("CVP").

11 2. In certifying the EIR and approving the project, DWR prejudicially abused its
12 discretion and failed to proceed in the manner require by law, including but not limited to its

13 failure to comply with the substantive and procedural mandates of the California Environmental

14 Quality Act ("CEQA"), the State CEQA Guidelines, Title 14, California Code of Regulations,
15 section 15000 et seq. ("CEQA Guidelines"), and other applicable regulations and policies.

16 3. The conclusions reached in the EIR are not supported by substantial evidence.
17 The EIR does not provide adequate analysis of, or identify adequate mitigation measures for, the

18 project's individual and cumulative impacts, including but not limited to its impacts on
19 hydrology, water quality, aquatic biological resources, geology and soils, air quality, agricultural
20 resources, land use, transportation, and cumulative impacts.

21 4. DWR also failed to provide a stable and finite project description, adequately
22 analyze project alternatives, or adequately discuss other permitting requirements.

23 5. Because DWR prejudicially abused its discretion and failed to proceed in a
24 manner required by law, Petitioner requests that the Court direct DWR to set aside its actions to

25 approve the project and certify the EIR.

26 PARTIES

27 6. Petitioner RECLAMATION DISTRICT 501 ("RD 501") is a special district

28 located on Ryer Island in Solano County, California. RD 501 was organized on June 16, 1887

CORPORATION Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

F under the laws of California for the purpose of maintaining levees and providing drainage

2 services to property owners within its boundaries. In that function, RD 501 maintains 20.6

3 miles of flood protection levees along the perimeter of Ryer Island, 34.4 miles of interior

4 drainage canals, and three drainage pump stations. Ryer Island contains 11,700 acres and

5 numerous farms rely on RD 501 to ensure that drainage services are provided on the island and

6 to ensure that the land within the island is suitable for farming. In addition, the farms on Ryer
7 Island rely on an adequate supply of water of suitable water quality for irrigation use, and

8 residents of Ryer Island rely on groundwater suitable for domestic use.

q 7. Petitioner reasonably believes that there will be additional petitioners who will
10 want to be included in this litigation but had insufficient time to do so because DWR failed to

11 provide commenting entities notice of its certification of the EIR and Notice of Determination.

12 Petitioner will request leave of Court to amend this Petition to include these additional
13 petitioners who were not able to make a decision on whether to challenge the project.

14 8. Defendant CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES ("DWR")

15 is an agency of the State of California located in Sacramento, California. DWR is the project's
16 lead agency under CEQA. DWR was established in 1956 for the purpose of building and
17 operating the SWP. In addition to operating the SWP, DWR's major responsibilities include

18 overseeing the statewide process of developing and updating the California Water Plan (Bulletin

19 160 series); undertaking restoration in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta according to its permit

20 terms; regulating dams, providing flood protection, and assisting in emergency management.

21 9. The true names and capacities, whether individual, corporate, associate,

22 governmental, co-conspirator, partner or alter-ego of those Respondents sued herein under the

23 fictitious names of DOES 1 through 10, inclusive, are not known to Petitioner, who therefore

24 sue those Respondents by such fictitious names. Petitioner will ask leave of Court to amend this

25 Petition and insert the true names and capacities of these Respondents when the same have been

26 ascertained. Petitioner is informed and believes and, on that basis, alleges, that Respondents

27 designated herein as DOE Respondents are legally responsible in some manner for the events

F and happenings alleged in this Petition, and that Petitioner's alleged injuries were proximately

2 caused by said Respondents' conduct.

3 FACTUAL BACKGROUND

4 The Project and Project Setting

5 10. Prospect Island is located in east Solano County, bounded by the Sacramento

6 River Deep Water Shipping Channel to the west and Miner Slough to the east. The project is
7 meant to restore tidal action to the interior of Prospect Island, thereby fulfilling DWR's

8 responsibilities with respect to the delta smelt and salmonid BiOp's for the long-term operations

9 of the SWP and CVP. The proposed project, Alternative 2, includes two breaches on Prospect
10 Island's Miner Slough levee, the removal of the internal cross levee which bisects the island's

11 north and south ends, and construction of a high stage overflow weir at the far northeast corner

12 of the island.

13 Environmental Review of the Project

14 11. DWR issued the Notice of Preparation ("NOP") for public review on May 17,
15 2013, and held a public scoping meeting on June 10, 2013. On November 4, 2014, during
16 preparation of the Draft EIR ("DEIR"), the unincorporated entity Local Agencies of the North
17 Delta ("LAND"), of which RD 501 is a member, provided comments on the NOP to DWR. The

18 comments established RD 501's primary concerns with respect to project impacts and mitigation
19 measures, and also highlighted the importance of communication between DWR and
20 stakeholders. The comments made clear that LAND and RD 501 were willing to work with

21 DWR to minimize the project's impacts to neighboring land owners, and the letter provided a

22 list of "good neighbor" policies that would further that goal.
23 12. DWR released the DEIR for public review on August 9, 2016. LAND and RD
24 501 submitted comments on the DEIR on November 7, 2016. The comment letter challenged
25 the technical premises of the DEIR, particularly with respect to hydrology, water quality, and

26 aquatic biological resource impacts. The DEIR comments also addressed DWR's failure to

27 include adequate mitigation for the project's potentially significant project impacts. To this end,
28

SOLURI
4 MESERVE
A LAW Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate CORPORATION

F the comment letter again cited the potential for good neighbor policies which would alleviate

2 impacts to adjacent land owners and reclamation districts.

3 13. During the environmental review period, DWR indicated an interest in developing

4 a collaborative mitigation and monitoring approach. On February 15, 2017, LAND submitted a

5 follow-up letter proposing how such a mitigation and monitoring approach would work. The

6 letter provided extensive detail for mitigating the project's potentially significant impacts that

7 would most directly harm adjacent infrastructure and landowners, including salinity, nutrients,

8 seepage and erosion, invasive weeds, traffic, and road damage.

9 14. RD 501 also provided separate technical comments primarily focused on erosion

10 and seepage on September 26, 2016, and again on August 20, 2018.
11 15. RD 501, other interested parties and DWR engaged in discussions throughout

12 2017 to attempt to resolve concerns with the project. However, on September 14, 2017, DWR
13 abruptly indicated that it did not believe further mitigation discussions would be fruitful, stating
14 that "DWR has gone above and beyond what is legally necessary to identify and alleviate
15 impacts .. .."

16 16. In response to public comments on the DEIR and changes in land acquisition,
17 DWR decided to revise its analysis of the project's hydrology, water quality, traffic noise, and

18 air quality impacts. DWR released the Partial Recirculated DEIR ("RDEIR") for public review

19 on March 1, 2019. The RDEIR only includes the sections that DWR changed from the DEIR.
20 Despite the considerable amount of discussion between DWR, RD 501 and other interested

21 entities regarding the need for adequate mitigation measures and good neighbor policies, DWR
22 actually removed mitigation measures that were previously included in the DEIR.

23 17. RD 501 jointly submitted comments on the RDEIR with LAND and other major

24 landowners on Ryer Island on April 15, 2019 and supplemental comments on June 28, 2019.

25 The comments extensively document the procedural flaws present in the RDEIR and those not
26 corrected from the DEIR, as well as the project's numerous undisclosed, unanalyzed, and

27 unmitigated potentially significant impacts. RD 501's supplemental comments included

28 discussion and evidence regarding the RDEIR's deficient cumulative impact analysis,

SOLURI
MESERVE
A LAW Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate CORPORATION

F undisclosed flow, seepage and land use impacts, and how proposed good neighbor policies

2 would alleviate RD 501, and potentially other commenters', primary concerns with the project.

3 18. Other local entities, adjacent land owners and groups, including Solano County

4 and the California Farm Bureau Federation, also provided comments on the project during the

5 various review periods.

6 19. On August 7, 2019, DWR notified public agency commenters that responses to

7 comments had been prepared and provided a link to those responses to comments.

8 20. During the project's environmental review process, RD 501 and DWR were in

q communication regarding the project regarding good neighbor policies and mitigation measures,

10 and environmental review timelines, among other topics. For example, on February 20, 2019,
11 DWR notified counsel for RD 501, Osha R. Meserve, of DWR's intention to recirculate the

12 DEIR and included the potential changes that would be present in the RDEIR. Additionally, on
13 August 7, 2019, counsel for DWR, Catherine F. Cavanaugh, contacted counsel for RD 501, Ms.
14 Meserve and Michael Van Zandt, to discuss documents that would ultimately be included in the
15 project's administrative record. During those communications, Ms. Cavanaugh also indicated
16 that the Final Environmental Impact Report ("FEIR") was likely to be certified around August
17 26, 2019.

18 21. On August 19, 2019, without notice to RD 501 or any other interested entity,
19 DWR certified the FEIR, approved the project, and provided the Notice of Determination to the
20 State Clearinghouse.

21 22. Counsel for RD 501 contacted DWR on August 30, 2019 requesting an update on

22 the project's status, since DWR had indicated the FEIR would be certified on August 26, 2019.
23 DWR did not respond to the inquiry.

24 23. On the morning of August 18, 2019, the final day of the statute of limitations for
25 this Petition, that DWR provided a link to review the FEIR online. As of the time of the filing

26 of this petition, no response was provided to counsel for RD 501's request for a tolling
27 agreement, which was requested via telephone on August 17, 2019, and also via email on

3 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4 24. This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this Petition pursuant to
5 Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5, and Public Resources Code sections 21168 and

6 21168.5.

7 25. Venue is proper in the Sacramento County Superior Court because DWR is a state

8 agency based in Sacramento County, and the Attorney General also has an office in Sacramento

q County. (Code Civ. Proc., § 401, subd. (1).)

10 26. This Petition is timely filed in accordance with Public Resources Code section
11 21167, subdivision (b) and CEQA Guidelines section 15112, as well as Code of Civil Procedure

12 section 1094.5.

13 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

14 27. Petitioner has exhausted administrative remedies to the extent required by law.
15 Petitioner has performed all conditions precedent to this filing and participated in the
16 administrative process. Petitioner, directly and also as a member LAND, actively participated in

17 the administrative process leading up to DWR's approval of the project and issuance of a notice

18 of determination, and stated its objections to DWR's actions. (See Pub. Resources Code,

19 21177, subd. (b).)
20 28. DWR has taken final agency actions with respect to certifying the EIR and
21 approving the project. DWR has a mandatory duty to comply with all state and federal laws,
22 including but not limited to CEQA, prior to undertaking the discretionary actions at issue in this

23 lawsuit.

24 STANDING

25 29. Petitioner has standing to assert the claims alleged in this Petition because it is
26 beneficially interested in this matter, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 1086.
27 a Petitioner is a special district located directly adjacent to the project and will be directly
28 impacted by the project. Petitioner's interests have been, are being, and will continue to be

SOLURI 7 MESERVE
A LAW Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate COrPORAtIOn

F adversely affected by DWR's failure to comply with applicable laws, and by the proposed

2 project's negative impacts to resources including but not limited to, groundwater, surface

3 waters, and associated species, ecosystems, and human uses and flood control infrastructure.

4 Unless the relief requested herein is granted, the environment will be adversely affected and

5 injured by the DWR's failure to comply with CEQA in approving the project and certifying the

6 EIR.

7 30. Petitioner also actively participated in the administrative process conducted by

8 DWR to determine the project's environmental impacts and to ensure DWR complied with

q CEQA and all other applicable laws in processing the application for the project.

10 31. Petitioner has no other adequate remedy at law, and brings this action on behalf of
11 its adversely affected landowners.

12 IRREPARABLE HARM

13 32. DWR's failures, set forth in this Petition, constitute a prejudicial abuse of

14 discretion within the meaning of the Code of Civil Procedure and CEQA. (See Code Civ. Proc.,
15 §1094.5; Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21168, 21168.5.)

16 33. Petitioner possesses no other remedy than to challenge the DWR's abuse of

17 discretion other than by means of this lawsuit. If DWR's actions concerning the project are
18 effectuated, Petitioner, its landowners and the environment will be irreparably harmed. No
19 money damages could adequately compensate for that harm.

20 PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL DOCTRINE

21 34. Petitioner brings this action as a private attorney general pursuant to Code of Civil
22 Procedure section 1021.5, and any other applicable legal theory, to enforce important rights
23 affecting the public interest.

24 35. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will confer a significant benefit on
25 the general public by requiring DWR to carry out its duties under CEQA before approving the
26 project.

27 36. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will also result in the enforcement
of important rights affecting the public interest by compelling DWR to engage in fair, 28

SOLURI 8 MESERVE
A LAW
CORPORATION Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

F objective, and legally adequate analysis of the project's environmental impacts, and to ensure

2 that the public has a meaningful opportunity to review and comment on these impacts and

3 mitigation measures for that project.

4 37. The necessity and financial burden of enforcement are such as to make an award

5 of attorney's fees appropriate in this case. Absent enforcement by RD 501, DWR will proceed

6 with a project that will cause significant, unmitigated environmental impacts that might

7 otherwise have been reduced or avoided through legally adequate environmental review and the

8 adoption of feasible mitigation measures.

9 NOTICE OF CEQA SUIT

10 38. On September 18, 2019, RD 501 served a notice of Petitioner's intent to file this

11 lawsuit, pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.5. (See Exhibit A, Notice of

12 Commencement of Action against the Department of Water Resources.)
13 REQUEST TO PREPARE ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD

14 39. Pursuant to Public Resources Code, section 21167.6, subdivision (b)(2), and any
15 other applicable authority, RD 501 elects to prepare the record of proceedings in this action.

16 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
Violations of CEQA 17 (Pub. Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.)
18 40. Petitioner incorporates by reference each and every allegation contained in
19 Paragraphs 1 through 39 as though fully set forth herein.
20 41. DWR prejudicially abused its discretion in certifying the EIR. DWR did not
21 proceed in the manner required by law and its decisions in approving the project and certifying

22 the EIR are not supported by substantial evidence. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21168.5; Vineyard
23 Area Citizens for Responsible Growth v. City of Rancho Cordova (2007) 40 Cal.4th 412, 426.)
24 These legal deficiencies include, without limitation, the following:

25 The EIR Fails to Adequately Define the Project's Baseline

26 42. In order to determine whether a project's impacts will be significant, CEQA
27 requires lead agencies to compare the impact of a proposed project to the "physical

28 environmental conditions in the vicinity of the project, as they exist at the time the notice of

SOLURI 9 MESERVE
A LAW Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate CORPORATION

-

2 preparation is published." These conditions serve as the project's "baseline." (CEQA

3 Guidelines, § 15125.) The description of the project's baseline ensures that the public has "an

4 understanding of the significant effects of the proposed project and its alternatives." (CEQA

5 Guidelines § 15125, subd. (a). Accurately determining the baseline environmental conditions is

6 crucial to accurately evaluating a project's impact. (E.g., San Joaquin Raptor/Wildlife Rescue

7 Ctr. v. County of Stanislaus (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 713, 722-723.) The EIR failed to evaluate

8 the comparative merits of the alternatives in a manner that was reasonably calculated to inform
the public.

q 43.

10 The EIR's description of baseline conditions is alternatively incomplete and

11 inaccurate, infecting and invalidating the entirety of the EIR's environmental analysis. The

12 EIR's deficiencies include, but are not limited to, the following examples.
44.

13 The EIR fails to comply with the requirement that the baseline must be "realistic"

14 and give the "most accurate picture possible" of the project's likely impacts. (Neighbors for

15 Smart Rail v. Exposition Metro Line Const. Authority (2013) 57 Cal.4th 439, 507.) Here the

16 baseline fails to meet the required standard of realism and accuracy.

45.

17 The EIR fails to include an up-to-date description of the environmental baseline.

18 The EIR uses an environmental setting baseline that is tied to the May 2013 NOP. This

19 approach is not reasonable for the project, which was approved by DWR 6 years after
publication of the NOP,

20 The Project Description Is Vague., Incomplete, and Unstable

21 46.

22 CEQA requires that an EIR include an accurate project description, and that the

23 nature and objective of a project be fully disclosed and fairly evaluated in an EIR. (San Joaquin

24 Raptor Rescue Center v. County of Merced (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 646, 655.) An EIR should

25 contain a "sufficient degree of analysis to provide decision-makers with information which
enables them to make a decision which intelligently takes account of environmental
26 consequences." (CEQA Guidelines, § 15151.)

27

28

SOLURI
MESERVE
A LAW 10

CORPORATION Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 47. The EIR's project description is deficient because numerous details of the

2 proposed project are missing, inconsistent, or shifting throughout the administrative review

3 process, including, without limitation, the following:

4 a. The RDEIR failed to update the Project Description or the Proposed

5 Actions or otherwise disclose significant changes to the project, including, but not limited

6 to, new plans for importing fill material to the project site and the decision to adopt

7 Alternative 2.

8 The EIR Fails to Adequately Analyze Project Alternatives

o 48. The EIR failed to include an adequate analysis of project alternatives, or a
10 reasonable range of project alternatives. The EIR's deficiencies include, without limitation, the

11 following:

12 a. The RDEIR failed to disclose Alternative 2's erosion impacts on RD 501's

13 adjacent levee and failed to account for flooding and high water elevations. Alternative 2
14 differs from Alternative 1 in 1 that it includes a second levee breach that would face

15 southeast toward Ryer Island. Without appropriate mitigation, this component of

16 Alternative 2 would degrade the Ryer Island levee immediately across Miner Slough.

17 The DEIR does not consider this impact in its alternatives analysis.

18 b. The EIR failed to integrate a discussion of other actions by agencies with

19 permitting authority over sensitive natural resources. When there is credible evidence
20 that sensitive natural resources, for instance, are within the project area, an EIR must

21 discuss other agencies' authority over those resources and discuss how the project

22 alternatives have been devised to anticipate that authority. (Banning Ranch Conservancy)

23 V. City of Newport Beach (2017) 2 Cal.5th 918, 938.) This failure to integrate and

24 disclose the ramifications of other agencies' actions for the project alternatives renders
25 the EIR's discussion of alternatives inadequate.

26 The EIR Fails to Adequately Analyze the Project's Significant Environmental Impacts

27 49. CEQA requires that an EIR describe the proposed project's significant
28 environmental effects. Each must be revealed and fully analyzed in the EIR. (Pub. Resources

SOLURI
MESERVE 11
A LAW
CORPORATION Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

-

2 Code, § 21100, subd. (b), CEQA Guidelines, § 15126.2, subd. (a).) "[T]he adequacy of an EIR's

3 discussion of environmental impacts is an issue distinct from the extent to which the agency is

4 correct in its determination whether the impacts are significant." (Sierra Club v. County of

5 Fresno (2018) 6 Cal.5th 502, 514 Friant Ranch]; Cleveland National Forest Foundation v. San

6 Diego Assn. of Governments (2017) 3 Cal.5th 497, 514-515; see also Berkeley Keep Jets Over

7 the Bay Com. V. Board of Port Cmrs. (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1344, 1371.) "[W]hether a

8 description of an environmental impact is insufficient because it lacks analysis or omits the
magnitude of the impact is not a substantial evidence question. A conclusory discussion of an

10 environmental impact that an EIR deems significant can be determined by a court to be

11 inadequate as an informational document without reference to substantial evidence." (Friant

12 Ranch, supra, 6 Cal.5th at 514.) To "comport with its intended function" an EIR must include

13 detail sufficient to enable those who did not participate in its preparation to understand and to

14 consider meaningfully the issues raised by the proposed project." (Ibid. [internal quotations

15 omitted].) "Whether or not the alleged inadequacy is the complete omission of a required

16 discussion or a patently inadequate one-paragraph discussion devoid of analysis, the reviewing

17 court must decide whether the EIR serves its purpose as an informational document." (Ibid.)

50.

18 The EIR lacks adequate analysis and omits an adequate discussion of the

19 magnitude of the project's impacts, therefore failing to provide decision makers with sufficient
analysis for numerous resources.

20 51.

21 The EIR's analysis of the project's hydrology impacts is legally inadequate and
fails to provide for several reasons, including, without limitation:

22 a.

23 The EIR fails to adequately analyze how the project's design would alter

24 tidal dynamics and sediment deposition, increase water residence times and facilitate

25 harmful algal blooms, reduce available nitrogen, and increase salinity. The DEIR

26 incorrectly concludes that there would be no increases in water velocities for the middle
breach facing Ryer Island.

27

28

1 b. The EIR fails to disclose how the project's impacts to tidal range would

2 increase agricultural pumping costs and increase exposure of pumps and siphons to

3 damage.

4 C. The EIR fails to disclose how cumulative projects would alter Sacramento

5 River flows and tidal ranges.

6 d. The EIR fails to disclose the impacts of increased invasive species would

7 have on water supply.

8 The EIR fails to adequately analyze the project's reduction of tidal range
9 and improperly considers the impact a project benefit.

10 f. The EIR fails to adequately analyze how increases in flow and velocity due

12 g. The EIR fails to adequately analyze, or disclose the extent of, the project's

13 groundwater seepage impacts.

14 52. The EIR's analysis of the project's water quality impacts is legally inadequate for
15 several reasons, including, without limitation:
16 a. The EIR fails to identify the project's need for petition for change in

17 diversion from the State Water Resources Control Board.

18 b. The EIR fails to adequately analyze the project's impacts to beneficial uses

19 of water.

20 C. The EIR fails to adequately analyze the project's impact on the formation

21 of Harmful Algal Blooms ("HABs").

22 d. The EIR also fails to account for potential drought conditions and/or

23 climate change in its water quality analysis. Droughts reduce flows and increase water

24 temperature, both which facilitate formation of HABs.

25 e. The EIR fails to disclose how the project would impact compliance with the

26 Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta methylmercury TMDL.

27 f. The EIR fails to sufficiently analyze water quality impacts to local water

28 supplies due to project-related increases in a wide range of water quality constituents,

-

2 including chloride, bromide, nitrate, pesticides, increased temperatures, and the potential

3 for increased occurrence of HABs such as toxic Microcystis. Increases in these

4 constituents would threaten water users' ability to use their water supply, rendering it
potentially unusable

5 53.

6 The EIR's analysis of the project's aquatic biological resource impacts is legally
inadequate for several reasons, including, without limitation:

7 a.

8 The EIR fails to adequately analyze how the project would create ideal

q habitat conditions for the Asian clam, which depletes nutrients in the Delta.
b.

10 The EIR fails to adequately analyze how increased methylmercury would
harm the local food chain and fish stocks.

11 54.

12 The EIR's analysis of the project's geology impacts is legally inadequate for
several reasons, including, without limitation:
13 a.

14 The EIR fails to disclose how cumulative projects would cause significant
sediment depletion in the project area.
15 b.

16 The EIR inaccurately characterized the baseline sediment conditions,

17 failing to provide evidence that Prospect Island could withstand scour from the project.

55.

18 The EIR's analysis of the project's agricultural resources impacts is legally
inadequate for several reasons, including, without limitation:

19 a.

20 The EIR fails to adequately analyze how seepage and levee damage would
impact agriculture on Ryer Island.

21 b.

22 The EIR fails to adequately analyze how interference with agricultural

23 diversions, including pumps and siphons, would impact agriculture on Ryer Island.
56.

24 The EIR's analysis of the project's land use impacts is legally inadequate for
several reasons, including, without limitation:
25 a.

26 The EIR fails to adequately analyze the project's consistency with all

27 relevant policies of the Delta Protection Commission's 2010 Land Use and Resource
Management Plan for the Primary Zone of the Delta.

F 57. The EIR's analysis of the project's air quality impacts is legally inadequate for

2 several reasons, including, without limitation:

3 a. The EIR fails to adequately analyze the increased numbers of truck trips

4 disclosed for the first time in the RDEIR.

5 b. The EIR underestimates the total land area that would be disturbed,

6 hindering analysis of the project's air quality impacts.

7 C. The EIR's description of the source of air quality impacts, barge and truck

8 travel, is inconsistent and unclear.

g d. The EIR's conclusion regarding the project's air quality impacts are not
10 based on substantial evidence.

11 e. The EIR fails to disclose or adequately analyze the project's toxic air
12 contaminant ("TAC") emissions or the resulting human health impacts. The EIR's
13 threshold of significance for TAC emissions only considers exposure from stationary
14 sources, despite the significant mobile sources included in the project, trucks and barges.
15 f. The EIR's baseline conditions for air quality impacts fails to recognize
16 existing sensitive receptors, such as Arrowhead Harbor Marina and residents on Ryer

17 Island.

18 g. The EIR fails to disclose or adequately analyze the project's ultrafine
19 particle emissions.
20 h. The EIR fails to adequately analyze the air quality impacts of the change in

21 access routes. The EIR assumed trucks would access the project site via easements
22 across private property on Little Holland Tract. DWR abandoned the efforts to obtain the
23 easements during environmental review of the project, but this change is not reflected in

24 the EIR.

25 58. The EIR's analysis of the project's traffic impacts is legally inadequate for several
26 reasons, including, without limitation:

27 a. The EIR fails to adequately analyze traffic impacts in light of the increase

28 in total truck trips disclosed in the RDEIR.

SOLURI
MESERVE 15
A LAW
CORPORATION Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

b. The EIR also fails to adequately analyze degradation of local roads and

2 infrastructure.

3 The EIR Fails to Adequately Analyze Cumulative Impacts

4 59. An EIR must evaluate project's cumulative impacts if the project's incremental

5 effects "are significant when viewed in connection with the effects of past ... current .and .

6 probable future projects." (CEQA Guidelines, §15065, subd. (a)(3); Banning Ranch

7 Conservancy v. City of Newport Beach (2012) 211 Cal.App.4th 1209, 1228.) The purpose of
8 cumulative impact analysis is to ensure a project is not considered in a vacuum. (Whitman v.

9 Board of Supervisors (1979) 88 Cal.App.3d 397, 408.)

10 60. The EIR's analysis of the project's cumulative impacts is legally inadequate for
11 several reasons, including, without limitation:

12 a. The EIR relied on the "list" approach for review of cumulatively

13 considerable projects, without actually providing a complete list of cumulative projects.
14 The EIR relies on a narrative that fails to identify specific projects and does not include

15 all related Delta restoration and other projects.

16 b. The EIR excludes other related private and public restoration and other
17 projects, projects in Solano County, and past projects from consideration as cumulative
18 projects without explanations. Consideration of these projects would lead to potentially
19 significant impacts not disclosed in the EIR.
20 DWR Failed to Adequately Respond to Public Comments

21 61. The FEIR failed to respond in good faith to public comments raising deficiencies

22 with the document. The FEIR responses are insufficient to comply with CEQA's public
23 participation requirements. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15088, subd. (c).)

24 62. Where experts disagree about an EIR's data or methodology, the EIR should
25 summarize main points of disagreement and explain why expert comments have been rejected.

26 (CEQA Guidelines, § 15151; see also Berkeley Keep Jets Over the Bay Comm. v. Bd. of Port
27 Commissioners (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1344, 1367, 1371.) The FEIR fails to include these

28 critical disclosures.

SOLURI
MESERVE 16
A LAW
CORPORATION Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

F 63. The FEIR failed to provide a reasoned, good faith response to comments,
2 including but not limited to impacts on roads, agriculture, flood control infrastructure, water

3 quality and the FEIR's failure to adequately analyze the project's consistency with the Delta

4 Plan.

5 DWR Failed to Recirculate the EIR after Adding Significant New Information to the
6 RDEIR and to the FEIR

7 64. Recirculation under Public Resources Code section 21092.1 and CEQA

8 Guidelines section 15088.5, subdivision (a) was required due to the addition of "significant new

9 information" that "deprives the public of a meaningful opportunity to comment upon a
10 substantial adverse environmental effect of the project or a feasible way to mitigate or avoid
11 such an effect after public review, but before certification of the EIR. (See also Pub. Resources

12 Code, § 21092.1; Laurel Heights Improvement Ass'n. V. Regents of University of California
13 (1993) 6 Cal.4th 1112, 1129-1130.)

14 65. DWR became aware of significant new information prior to certification of the
15 FEIR that mandated re-circulation, yet DWR refused to do so. This new information includes,

16 but is not limited to, new and different hydrologic impacts associated with the adoption of
17 Alternative 2 as well as more severe water quality impacts due to the increased incidence of

18 HABs that would occur under the project.

19 The EIR Distorts the Concept of Mitigation in Violation of CEQA

20 66. DWR failed to adopt all feasible mitigation measures and alternatives to reduce or

21 avoid significant impacts, in direct contravention of CEQA. (CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15126.6,

22 15126.4.)

23 67. The EIR systematically relies upon mitigation measures that are impermissibly

24 deferred, and, because they have not been adequately formulated, are unenforceable. (CEQA

25 Guidelines, §§ 15126.4, subd. (a)(1)(b); see also Sacramento Old City Ass'n v. City Council
26 (1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 1011, 1029 [performance criteria must be articulated at project

27 approval].) Mitigation in the EIR, however, does not articulate specific performance criteria.

28

SOLURI 17 MESERVE
A LAW Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate CORPORATION

68. "Mitigation measures must be fully enforceable through permit conditions,

2 agreements, or other legally-binding instruments." (CEQA Guidelines, § 15126.4, sub. (a)(2).)

3 The EIR fails to sufficiently identify any such permit conditions, agreements or other legally-

4 binding instruments that would ensure adequate funding and other conditions are in place to

5 fully implement all of the adopted and/or deferred Mitigation Measures.

6 69. The EIR also impermissibly relies on the future preparation of an Adaptive
7 Management Plan to address impacts. The EIR contains no analysis of the extent of

8 environmental impacts in the absence of an effective Adaptive Management Plan, which has not

Q yet been prepared.

10 70. As discussed above, the EIR fails to integrate a discussion of other actions by
11 agencies with permitting authority over other resources. As with the discussion of project

12 alternatives, when there is credible evidence that resources, including sensitive natural

13 resources, are within the project area, an EIR must discuss other agencies' authority over those
14 resources and discuss how mitigation measures have been devised to anticipate that authority.

15 (Banning Ranch Conservancy v. City of Newport Beach (2017) 2 Cal.5th 918, 938.) The full
16 scope of other agencies' permitting authority over the project is not disclosed in the EIR, nor did
17 DWR adequately consult with the agencies with responsibility for these resources. A

18 discussions or analysis of mitigation measures relating to a resource is inadequate if it does not
19 sufficiently integrate other agencies' authority and likely actions.

20 DWR's CEQA Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations Are Not Supported
21 by Substantial Evidence

22 71. DWR's CEQA Findings violate CEQA, and are not supported by substantial
23 evidence. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15091, subd. (b).)

24 72. The Findings improperly conclude without substantial evidence that all but one

25 project impact would be mitigated to less than significant levels.
26 73. Required findings regarding critical project impacts are entirely absent.
27 74. The failure to include findings to support impact determinations prevents the
28 public from understanding the full range of project impacts, and critically, the reasons why the

SOLURI
MESERVE 18
A LAW
CORPORATION Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

M agency has determined the impacts are less than significant. DWR's omission of findings for

2 these impacts constitutes a failure "to bridge the analytic gap between the raw evidence and

3 ultimate decision." (Topanga Ass'n for a Scenic Cmty. v. County of L.A. (1974) 11 Cal.3d 506,

4 515; see also Pub. Resources Code, § 21081, subd. (a)(1).)

5 75. To the extent that DWR's CEQA Findings do discuss particular impacts, DWR's

6 determination that these impacts would be less than significant is unsupported by substantial

7 evidence.

8 76. DWR's statement of overriding considerations is not supported by substantial

9 evidence and furthermore fails to demonstrate that mitigating project impacts to less than

10 significant levels is not feasible.

11 77. Feasible mitigation is available to reduce impacts from the significant and
12 unavoidable impacts of the project.

13 78. DWR failed to properly determine that economic, legal, social, technological, or

14 other benefits of the program were overriding considerations that permitted approval of the
15 project despite significant and unavoidable impacts on the environment. (CEQA Guidelines, §

16 15091.)

17 79. DWR's adopted project is not consistent with the stated project objectives.

18 PRAYER

19 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for judgment and relief as hereinafter set forth:

28 pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21168.9;

3 with any activity, which may result in any physical change in the environment on the project site

4 pending completion of this litigation and full compliance with CEQA;

5 3. That the Court issue a writ of mandate directing DWR to suspend all necessary

6 steps and all activity in furtherance of the project until DWR takes all necessary steps to bring

7 its actions into compliance with CEQA;

8 4. That Petitioner be awarded costs of this proceeding;
9 5. That Petitioner be awarded reasonable attorney's fees for this action pursuant to
10 Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5, and any other applicable provisions of law; and
