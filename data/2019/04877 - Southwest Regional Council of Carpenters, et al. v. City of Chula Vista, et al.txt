VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

H INTRODUCTION

2 1. This lawsuit seeks to enjoin the City of Chula Vista's (*Respondent" or "City") June 4,

3 2019 action (and all subsequent actions) approving the appeal by Real Party in Interest Silvergate

4 Development, LLC (*Real Party") and approving Design Review Permit DR17-0040 to construct a

5 170-unit apartment development on an approximately 5.3 acre site located on Bonita Road, between

6 Bonita Glen Drive and I-805 (*Project"), and the adoption of a Mitigated Negative Declaration (State

7 Clearinghouse No. 2018121041) finding that all potential impacts will be reduced to a less-than-

8 significant level after mitigation, and a Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program.
2. The Project involves the construction of a 170-unit apartment development on an

9

10 approximately 5.3-acre site, consisting of one four-story, elevator-served podium style building and six
three-story, walk-up garden-style buildings, and including nine rent-restricted units for occupancy by

11 very low-income households. The Project also includes construction of 101 covered and 130 uncovered

12 parking spaces as well as recreation areas including a pocket park, tot lot, swimming pool, club house,
and dog run.
13 3.

14 The project is located south of Bonita Road between Bonita Glen Drive and Interstate

15 805 in Chula Vista, California 91910. The area of land is an existing site consisting of five contiguous

16 parcels, APN's 570-131-11-00, 570-140-40-00, 570-140-54-00, 570-140-48-00, 570-140-51-00
(*Project Site").

17 4. Real Party in Interest requested a State Density Bonus pursuant to California

18 Government Code Section 65915 and Chula Vista Municipal Code, Chapter 19.90 in connection with

19 the project, which promotes affordable housing through the issuance of incentives, concessions,

20 waivers, and reductions to development standards and/or reduced parking ratios.
5.
21 In approving the Project, Respondent violated the California Environmental Quality Act,

22 Cal. Pub Res. Code § 21100, et seq ("CEQA"), State Planning and Zoning Law, Cal. Government Code

23 § 65000 et seq ("State Planning & Zoning Law"), State Density Bonus Act, Cal. Government Code §§

24 65915-65918 ("State Density Bonus"), Chula Vista Density Bonus Ordinance, Chula Vista Municipal

25 Code § 19.90,;Chula Vista General Plan; Chula Vista Bonita Glen Specific Plan.
PARTIES

26 6.

27 Petitioner SOUTHWEST REGIONAL COUNCIL OF CARPENTERS ("Petitioner[s]")
is a labor union representing 50,000 union carpenters in six states, including in southern California, and

28 has a strong interest in well ordered land use planning and addressing the environmental impacts of
development projects, such as the Bonita Glen Project. Southwest Regional Council of Carpenters
-1-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

- submitted comments on the Project that addressed the inadequacies of Respondent's environmental

2 review and violation of planning and zoning laws.
7. Defendant and Respondent City of Chula Vista (*The City" or "Respondent") is a
3 California charter city. The City prepared the Mitigated Negative Declaration and Mitigation
4 Monitoring Program and the City Council adopted Resolution No. 2019-095 approving the Project and
5 adopting the Mitigated Negative Declaration and Mitigation and Reporting Program.

6 8. Defendants and Respondents DOES 1 - 10 are entities which the true names, capacities,

7 corporate, and associates are unknown to Petitioner at this time, and who, therefore, are sued using

8 fictitious names. Petitioner will amend this Petition/Complaint to show the true names and capacities

9 when ascertained.

9. 10 Real Party in Interest Silvergate Development, LLC (*Real Party") is listed on the

11 Notice of Determination as the Project applicant and Real Party in Interest. On information and belief,
and on this basis, Petitioners allege Silvergate Development, LLC applied for and received the
12 approvals from Respondent for the Project.
13 10. Real Parties in Interest ROES 1 - 10 are entities which the true names, capacities,
14 corporate, and associates are unknown to Petitioner at this time, and who, therefore, are sued using

15 fictitious names. Petitioner will amend this Petition/Complaint to show the true names and capacities

16 when ascertained.

17 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

18 11. Pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure ("CCP") sections 1085 and 1094.5 and
California Public Resources Code ("PRC") sections 21168, 21168.5, and 21168.9, this Court has 19

20 jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandate to set aside Respondent's decisions to (a) adopt a Mitigated
Negative Declaration and Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program, and (c) approve the Project,
21 including the Design Review Permit.
22 12. Venue is proper in this Court because the Project Site lies entirely within the County of
23 San Diego and the environmental impacts of the Project will be acutely felt in this County. The cause

24 alleged in this Petition, or some part of that cause, arise in this county. (CCP § 393; Cal. State Parks

25 Foundation v. Super. Ct. (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 826.) Venue is also proper in this Court pursuant to

26 Code of Civil Procedure §§ 394 (actions against city, county or local agency), and 395 (actions

27 generally), since Respondent is the City of Chula Vista.
13. This petition is timely filed within 30 days after Respondent's decision to issue a Notice 28 I of Determination in accordance with PRC § 21167(a).
-2-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

14. Petitioner has provided written notice of its intention to file this petition to Respondents

2 in compliance with PRC § 21167.5, a true and correct copy of and are including which the notice and
proof of service as are attached hereto as Exhibit A.
3 15.
4 Petitioner has concurrently filed a notice of its election to prepare the record of
administrative proceedings relating to this action, in compliance with PRC section 21167.6 or other
5 applicable laws, a true and correct copy of which notice is attached hereto as Exhibit B.

6 16. Petitioner has concurrently filed a request for hearing in compliance with PRC section

7 21167.4, a true and correct copy of which request is attached hereto as Exhibit C.

8 17. Petitioner has concurrently filed and served notice of this lawsuit to the California

9 Attorney General in compliance with PRC § 21167.7 and CCP § 388, a true and § correct copy of which

10 notice is attached hereto as Exhibit D.

18.
11 Petitioner has performed all conditions precedent to filing this instant action and has

12 exhausted administrative remedies to the extent required by law under PRC $ 21177. Petitioner and/or
other agencies and individuals raised each of the legal deficiencies asserted in this petition orally or in
13 writing during the Respondent's decision-making process.
14 19. The violations by Respondent as alleged herein have affected the beneficial interests of
15 Petitioner and/or its supporting members. The relief sought by way of this Petition will redress this

16 beneficial interest and the likelihood of future injury and interference with Petitioner's interests, and

17 those of its supporting members.

18 20. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law unless

19 this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondent to set aside the certification of

20 the Project and the supporting environmental documents. In the absence of such remedies,

21 Respondent's decisions will remain in effect in violation of state law and injurious to Petitioner and its
members.
22 STATUTORY FRAMEWORK

23 California Environmental Quality Act

24 21. The California Environmental Quality Act, Cal. Public Resources Code ("PRC") § §

25 21100, et seq (CEQA) requires state and local agencies to identify the potentially significant

26 environmental impacts of their actions, and then to avoid or mitigate those impacts if feasible.

27 22. CEQA requires agencies to analyze the potential environmental impacts of its proposed

28 actions in an environmental impact report (except in certain limited circumstances). The EIR is the very
heart of CEQA. (Dunn-Edwards v. BAAQMD (1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 644, 652.) "The foremost
-3-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

- principle' in interpreting CEQA is that the Legislature intended the act to be read so as to afford the

2 fullest possible protection to the environment within the reasonable scope of the statutory language."

3 (Cmtys. for a Better Env't v. Cal. Resources Agency (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 98, 109.)
23.
4 CEQA has two primary purposes. First, CEQA is designed to inform decision makers and

5 the public about the potential, significant environmental effects of a project. (CEQA Guidelines

6 15002(a)(1).) "Its purpose is to inform the public and its responsible officials of the environmental

7 consequences of their decisions before they are made. Thus, the EIR 'protects not only the environment

8 but also informed self-government.'" (Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Bd. of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d

9 553, 564.) The EIR has been described as '"an environmental 'alarm bell' whose purpose it is to alert the

10 public and its responsible officials to environmental changes before they have reached ecological points
of no return." (Berkeley Keep Jets Over the Bay v. Bd. of Port Comrs. (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1344,

11 1354.)

24.
12 Second, CEQA requires public agencies to avoid or reduce environmental damage when

13 "feasible" by requiring "environmentally superior" alternatives and all feasible mitigation measures.

14 (CEQA Guidelines, § 15002(a)(2-3); Citizens of Goleta Valley, supra, 52 Cal.3d at 564.) The EIR

15 serves to provide agencies and the public with information about the environmental impacts of a

16 proposed project and to "identify ways that environmental damage can be avoided or significantly
reduced." (CEQA Guidelines § 15002 (a)(2).)

17 25. To achieve its objectives of environmental protection, CEQA a has a three-tiered

18 structure. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15002(k)); Comm. to Save the Hollywoodland Specific Plan v. City of

19 Los Angeles (2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 1168, 1185 - 86.) First, if a project falls into an exempt category,

20 or it can be seen with certainty that the activity in question will not have a significant effect on the

21 environment, no further agency evaluation is required. (Id.) Second, if there is a possibility the project

22 will have a significant effect on the environment, the agency must perform a threshold initial study.

23 (Id.; CEQA Guidelines, § 15063(a).) If the study indicates that there is no substantial evidence that the

24 project may cause a significant effect on the environment the agency may issue a negative declaration.

25 (Id.; CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15063(b)(2), 15070.) Finally, if the project will have a significant effect on
the environment, an environmental impact report ("EIR") is required. (Id.)

26 Initial Studies & The Fair Argument Standard Under the California Environmental Quality Act

27 26. As the California Supreme Court very recently held, "[i]f no EIR has been prepared for a

28
14 CCR 15000 et seq. are referred to herein as the "CEQA Guidelines" -4-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

- nonexempt project, but substantial evidence in the record supports a fair argument that the project may

2 result in significant adverse impacts, the proper remedy is to order preparation of an EIR."
(Communities for a Better Environment v. South Coast Air Quality Management Dist. (2010) 48 Cal. 3 4th 310, 319-320 (citing No Oil, Inc. V. City of Los Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 75, 88; Brentwood
4 Assn. for No Drilling, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles (1982) 134 Cal. App. 3d 491, 504-505.) "The
5 'foremost principle' in interpreting CEQA is that the Legislature intended the act to be read so as to

6 afford the fullest possible protection to the environment within the reasonable scope of the statutory

7 language." (Communities for a Better Environment v. Calif. Resources Agency (2002) 103 Cal. App.

8 4th 98, 109.)

9 27. In very limited circumstances, an agency may avoid preparing an EIR by issuing a

10 negative declaration, a written statement briefly indicating that a project will have no significant impact

11 thus requiring no EIR. (CEQA Guidelines § 15371.) Only if there is not even a "fair argument" that the
project will have a significant environmental effect is adoption of an initial study and negative
12 declaration appropriate. (Pub. Res. Code, §§ 21100, 21064.) Since "[t]he adoption of a negative
13 declaration … has a terminal effect on the environmental review process," by allowing the agency "to
14 dispense with the duty [to prepare an EIR]," negative declarations are allowed only in cases where "the

15 proposed project will not affect the environment at all." (Citizens of Lake Murray v. San Diego 1989)

16 129 Cal.App.3d 436, 440.) CEQA a contains a "preference for resolving doubts in favor of

17 environmental review." (Pocket Protectors v. City of Sacramento (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 903, 927.)

18 28. A mitigated negative declaration may be issued when the initial study on a proposed a

19 project reveals that the project may have one or more significant effects on the environment, but the
project applicant revises the project, or agrees to revise the project, to eliminate or avoid all significant
20 impacts by incorporating mitigation measures into the project. (Pub. Res. Code §§ 21064.5,
21 21080(c)(2); CEQA Guidelines §§ 15064(f)(2), 15070(b).)
22 29. When adopting mitigated negative declaration, the agency must also adopt a mitigation
23 monitoring or reporting program for the mitigation measures incorporated in the negative declaration.
24 (Pub. Res. Code § 21081.6(a); CEQA Guidelines § 15097(a).)

25 Mitigation Negative Declaration Recirculation Standard

26 30. CEQA requires that a proposed mitigated negative declaration be circulated for review

27 and public comment for a minimum of 20 days. (Pub. Res. Code § 21091(b); CEQA Guidelines §
15105(b).)
28 31. A proposed mitigated negative declaration circulated for review and comment must
-5-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

- describe the project as modified to incorporate mitigation measures, rather than as originally proposed.

2 (Pub. Res. Code § 21080(c); CEQA Guidelines §§ 15070(b)(1), 15071(e); see Perley v. Board of

3 Supervisors (1982) 137 Cal.App.3d 424.) This is required so that the public and other agencies will

4 have an opportunity to review the mitigation measures to determine whether they are sufficient to

5 mitigate the project's environmental effects and to ensure that the mitigation measures will not
themselves cause significant environmental impacts.

6 32.

7 If substantial revisions are made to a proposed mitigated negative declaration after

8 having been circulated to the public (e.g., new information, project changes, and new or modified

9 mitigation measures), recirculation of the mitigated negative declaration is required. (Pub. Res. Code, §
21080; CEQA Guidelines, § 15073.5.)

10 Availability of Supporting Documentation

11 33. CEQA requires that copies of a mitigated negative declaration and all supporting

12 documentation be made available to the public for review during the public comment period for the

13 mitigated negative declaration. (Pub. Res. Code § 21092; CEQA Guidelines § 15072(f)(4).
General Plan Consistency
14 34.

15 Each California city and county must adopt a comprehensive, long-term general plan

16 governing development. (Napa Citizens for Honest Gov. v. Napa County Bd. of Supervisors (2001) 91

17 Cal.App.4th 342, 352, citing Gov. Code §§ 65030, 65300.) The general plan sits at the top of the land

18 use planning hierarchy (see DeVita v. County of Napa (1995) 9 Cal.4th 763, 773), and serves as a
I "constitution" or "charter" for all future development. (Lesher Communications, Inc. v. City of Walnut

19 Creek (1990) 52 Cal.3d 531, 540.)
35.
20 General plan consistency is "the linchpin of California's land use and development laws;

21 it is the principle which infused the concept of planned growth with the force of law." (See Debottari v.

22 Norco City Council (1985) 171 Cal.App.3d 1204, 1213.)
36. State law mandates two levels of consistency. First, a general plan must be internally or
23 | "horizontally" consistent: its elements must "comprise an integrated, internally consistent and
24 compatible statement of policies for the adopting agency." (See Gov. Code § 65300.5; Sierra Club v.

25

26 Bd. of Supervisors (1981) 126 Cal.App.3d 698, 704.) A general plan amendment thus may not be
internally inconsistent, nor may it cause the general plan to become internally inconsistent. (See

27 DeVita, 9 Cal.4th at 796 fn. 12.)

28 37. Second, state law requires "vertical" consistency, meaning that zoning ordinances and
other land use decisions also must be consistent with the general plan. (See Gov. Code § 65860(a)(2)
-6-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

- [land uses authorized by zoning ordinance must be "compatible with the objectives, policies, general

2 land uses, and programs specified in the [general] plan."]; see also Neighborhood Action Group V.

3 County of Calaveras (1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 1176, 1184.) A zoning ordinance that conflicts with the

4 general plan or impedes achievement of its policies is invalid and cannot be given effect. (See Lesher,
52 Cal.3d at 544.)
5 38.

6 State law requires that all subordinate land use decisions, including conditional use

7 permits, be consistent with the general plan. (See Gov. Code § 65860(a)(2); Neighborhood Action
Group, 156 Cal.App.3d at 1184.)

8 39.

9 A project cannot be found consistent with a general plan if it conflicts with a general
plan policy that is "fundamental, mandatory, and clear," regardless of whether it is consistent with other

10 general plan policies. (See Endangered Habitats League v. County of Orange (2005) 131 Cal.App.4th

11 777, 782-83; Families Unafraid to Uphold Rural El Dorado County v. Bd. of Supervisors (1998) 62

12 Cal.App.4th 1332, 1341-42). Moreover, even in the absence of such a direct conflict, an ordinance or

13 development project may not be approved if it interferes with or frustrates the general plan's policies

14 and objectives. (See Napa Citizens, 91 Cal.App.4th at 378-79; see also Lesher, 52 Cal.3d at 544

15 (finding that a zoning ordinance restricting development conflicted with growth-oriented policies of
general plan).

16 State Density Bonus Law

17 40.

18 State Density Bonus Law under Gov. Code section 65915 - 65918 provides that when
an applicant seeks a density bonus for a housing development within the jurisdiction of a city or county,

19 the local government must comply with the State Density Bonus Law.
41.
20 Gov. Code section 65915(d) sets the number of concessions or incentives that an

21 applicant for a density bonus could receive from the City.
42.
22 Gov. Code section 65915(d)(2)(A) provides that for projects which would include at
least 10 percent of the total units for lower income households or at least 5 percent for very low-income
23 households, the applicant shall receive one concession or incentive.

24 43.

25 Gov. Code section 65915(d)(2)(B) provides that for projects which would include at

26 least 20 percent of the total units for lower income households or at least 10 percent for very low-
income households, the applicant shall receive two concession or incentive.

27 44. Gov. Code section 65915(a)(1) requires a city or county to adopt an ordinance that

28 specifies how compliance with the section will be implemented.
45. The City has adopted ordinances in accordance with Gov. Code section 65915(a)(1) in
-7-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

P sections 19.90.010 through 19.90.150 of its Municipal Code.

2 46. Sections 19.90.040 and 19.90.050 of the Chula Vista Municipal Code provides that for

3 projects which would include at least 10 percent of the total units for lower income households or at

4 least 5 percent for very low-income households, the applicant shall be permitted one density or floor

5 area ratio bonus and/or one incentive or concession. "Incentives or concessions" means such regulatory

6 incentives and concessions as stipulated in Government Code Section 65915(k), to include, but not be

7 limited to, the reduction of site development standards or zone code requirements, approval of mixed

8 use zoning in conjunction with the housing project, or any other regulatory incentive which would

9 result in identifiable cost reductions to enable the provision of housing for the designated income group
or qualifying (senior) residents. (Chula Vista Municipal Code Section 19.90.020(N).)

10

11 47. PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL
This proceeding involves enforcement of important rights affecting the public interest.

12 Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will confer a substantial benefit on the public, including a

13 citizens, residents, businesses and taxpayers of the City, and will result in the enforcement of important

14 public rights by requiring Respondent to comply with CEQA and other legal requirements applicable to

15 the proposed Project; by voiding the Project approvals and prohibiting Respondent and Real Parties in

16 Interest from taking further actions with respect to the Project until it has complied with those legal

17 requirements; and by prohibiting the Respondent from undertaking any portion of the Project until they
have fully complied with these legal requirements.

18 48. Petitioner is entitled to recover attorneys' fees as provided in Code of Civil Procedure

19 section 1021.5 when it prevails in this action. The necessity and financial burden of enforcement of

20 these public rights entitle Petitioner to an award of reasonable attorneys' fees pursuant to that section.

21 STATEMENT OF FACTS
49.
22 On or about December 22, 2017, Real Party Silvergate Development, LLC applied for a
Design Review Permit for the Project.
23 50.

24 On or before December 17, 2018, the City of Chula Vista Development Services

25 Department conducted an Initial Study and reviewed the Project for compliance with the California

26 Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). Based upon the results of the Initial Study, the City determined

27 that the Project could result in significant effects on the environment, but that revisions to the Project
made by or agreed to by Real Party Silvergate Development, LLC would avoid the effects or mitigate

28 the effects to a point where no significant environmental effects would occur.
51. On or about December 17, 2018, Respondent released a Draft Mitigated Negative
-8-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

- Declaration, IS-18-0001 ("Draft MND") for the Project and associated Mitigation Monitoring and

2 Reporting Program and circulated these documents for public comment until approximately January 23,
2019.
3 52.
4 During the comment period from December 17, 2018 until approximately January 23,

5 2019, the City received two agency comment letters, fifteen individual comment letters, and one
comment letter from Petitioner, dated January 15, 2019.

6 53.

7 On or about February 15 2019, Respondent released a Final Mitigated Negative

25 lead agency also must provide for public review and comment on the project and associated

26 environmental documentation. An environmental impact report, initial study or mitigated negative
declaration must provide an adequate project description and sufficient environmental analysis such

27 that decision-makers can intelligently consider environmental consequences when acting on the

28 proposed project.
65. Respondent violated CEQA by failing to provide an adequate project description.

-11-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

- with CEQA and by approving the Project in reliance thereon. Accordingly, Respondent's certification

2 of the mitigated negative declaration and purported approval of the Project must be set aside.

3 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

4 68. (Violations of CEQA; Failure to Substantially Support Factual Findings)

5 herein. Petitioner hereby realleges and incorporates all the above paragraphs as if fully set forth

6 69.

7 CEQA requires that a lead agency's findings for the approval of project be supported

8 by substantial evidence in the administrative record. CEQA further requires that a lead agency provide
an explanation of how evidence in the record supports the conclusions it has reached.

9 70. Respondent violated CEQA by adopting findings that are inadequate as a matter of law a

10 as they are not supported by substantial evidence in the record, including but not limited to the

11 following:

a.
12 The determinations that the Project's environmental impacts would be less than

13 significant or that adopted mitigation measures would avoid or lessen the

14 71. Project's significant effects on the environment to less than significant levels.

15 As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondent prejudicially abused their discretion by

16 making determinations or adopting findings that do not comply with the requirements of CEQA and

17 approving the Project in reliance thereon. Accordingly, Respondent's adoption of the mitigated
negative declaration and purported approval of the Project must be set aside.

18 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

19 (Gov. Code § 65000 et seq. Violations of City's General Plan, Bonita Glen Specific Plan, By

20 72. Petitioner Against All Respondents and All Real Parties)

21 herein. Petitioner hereby realleges and incorporates all the above paragraphs as if fully set forth

22 73.

23 As required by State Planning and Zoning Law, the a City has a General Plan that governs
land use planning throughout the City.

24 74.

25 The Bonita Glen Specific Plan is integrated into the City's General Plan and applies to
the Project Site.

26 75. The Project fails to comply with the objectives and mandates set forth in the City's

27 General Plan and the Bonita Glen Specific Plan as the Project is inconsistent with the General Plan's

28 zoning, density limits, height limits, permitted floor-area-ratio for the Project Site as well as the
framework, air quality, conservation, housing, noise, open space, service systems / public recreation,
-12-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

- safety, traffic, circulation, mobility elements and other objectives of the General Plan and Bonita Glen

2 Specific Plan.
76.
3 In particular, the Project exceeds three separate height limitations within the Bonita Glen

4 Specific Plan, including the Bonita Glen Specific Plan's maximum building height limitation of 45 feet,

5 maximum stories of three stories and maximum architectural features limitation of 50 feet.

77.

6 The Project also violates the Bonita Glen Specific Plan's designation of the Project Site

7 as a Central Commercial Zone by placing no commercial uses in the Project and designating the Project
exclusively for residential.

8 78.

0 The Project violates the Bonita Glen Specific Plan's objective that the Project Site be
developed as an "integrated residential-commercial project based upon special standards and

10 a regulations and a predetermined conceptual plan," as the Project has no commercial component, being

11 entirely residential, and does not conform with the Bonita Glen Specific Plan's conceptual plan.
79.
12 The Project violates the Bonita Glen Specific Plan's bulk requirement that building

13 cover at most 40% of the net area of the Site, as the Project's building area of 149,913 square feet on an

14 approximately 230,868 square foot or 5.3 acre Project Site, approximately sixty-five percent (65%) of
the Project Site.

15 80.

16 The Project violates the Bonita Glen Specific Plan's setback requirement that "[a]ll

17 buildings and structures . be set back a minimum of 25 feet from the street right-of way" as the
Project's buildings and structures come within 22 feet of the street right-of-way.

18 81. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by

19 approving the Project. Accordingly, Respondents' approval of the Project must be set aside.

20 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

21 (Gov. Code 88 65915 to 65918 - Violation of the State Density Bonus Law By Petitioner Against

22 82. All Respondents and All Real Parties)

23 83. Petitioner realleges and incorporates all the above paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.

24 The City committed prejudicial abuse of discretion and failed to proceed in a manner

25 required by law in approving this Project, in that the Project violates the State Density Bonus Law.
84.

26 According to Gov. Code § 65915(d)(2)(A) provides that for projects which would

27 include at least 10 percent of the total units for lower income households or at least 5 percent for very
low-income households, the applicant shall only receive one concession or incentive.

28 85. The Project proposes nine affordable units to very low-income households out of 170
total units. Thus, the Project would provide five percent of its units to very-low-income households.
-13-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

86. Based on the percentage of the units dedicated to low income or very low-income

2 affordable units, the Project falls under Gov. Code section 65915(d)(2)(A) and the applicant can receive
one concession or incentive.
3 87. However, the Project, as approved, provides more than one concessions/incentives,
4 including granting relief from three separate height requirements as well as the Bonita Glen Specific
5 Plan's Central Commercial designation and bulking requirements that require that building area not

6 cover more than 40% of the Project Site.

7 88. As such, the City violated Gov. Code section 65915 by allowing more incentives or

8 concession for the Project than is allowed by the section, jeopardizing the public health and safety of

9 the residents in and nearby the Project, including Petitioner.

10 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

11 (Chula Vista Municipal § 19.90 - Violation of the Density Bonus Ordinance By Petitioner Against
All Respondents and All Real Parties)
12 89. Petitioner realleges and incorporates all the above paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.
13 90. The City committed prejudicial abuse of discretion and failed to proceed in a manner
14 required by law in approving this Project, in that the Project violates the City Density Bonus Ordinance,
15 Municipal / County Code § 19.90.

16 91. Chula Vista Municipal Code § 19.90 requires that the City grant one density / FAR

17 bonus when a housing development of at least five units sets aside a minimum of five percent of the

18 total units of the housing development for very low income households.
92.
19 The City allowed more than one concession, including granting relief from three

20 separate height requirements as well as the Bonita Glen Specific Plan's Central Commercial

21 designation and bulking requirements that require that building area not cover more than 40% of the
Project Site.,
22 93. Based on the foregoing, the City improperly made findings (A) and (B) of Westminster
23 Municipal Code section 17.570.025.

24 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

25 WHEREFORE, Petitioner pray for judgment as set forth below:

26 A. For a writ of mandate commanding Respondent to vacate and withdraw the certification

27 of the Mitigated Negative Declaration (IS-18-0001) and any purported approvals of the Project, and to
