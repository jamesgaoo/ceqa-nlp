Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 INTRODUCTION

2 Petitioner SUSTAINERS ALLIANCE FOR ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY

3 ("SAFER", "Petitioner") petitions this court for a Writ of Mandate ("Petition"), directed to Respondents
4 CITY OF BANNING, CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF BANNING, and PLANNING

5 COMMISSION OF THE CITY OF BANNING ("Respondents" or the "City") and Real Parties in

6 Interest DA VID HIDALGO ARCHITECTS, INC., A PROFESSIONAL CORPORATION and DJL

7 PROPERTIES, LLC ("Real Parties" or "Applicant"), and by this verified petition, alleges as follows:
8 1. Petitioner brings this action to challenge the unlawful actions of Respondents in

9 approving the Lawrence Equipment Industrial Warehouse Project ("Project") because the Initial
10 Study/Mitigated Negative Declaration ("IS/MND") failed to satisfy the requirements of the California
11 Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code § 21000 et seq., and the CEQA
12 Guidelines, title 14, California Code of Regulations, § 15000 et seq. The specific actions challenged are:
13 (1) certification of the MND for the Project; (2) adoption of related findings and mitigation monitoring
14 plan; and (3) approval of the Project including the General Plan Amendment 18-2501 and Zone Change
15 18-3501 to change the zoning and land use designation from General Commercial to Business Park and
16 the Design Review 18-7001 and Environmental Assessment 18-1501 approving construction of the
17 Project.

18 2. The Project includes a General Plan Amendment (GPA 18-2501), a Zone Change (ZC
19 18-3501) for 19.69 acres from the General Commercial land use district to the Business Park land use
20 district, and a Design Review (DR 18-7001) on 6.7 acres to allow the construction of a single story
21 146,890 square-feet light manufacturing and warehouse building for the expansion of the existing
22 manufacturing business. The proposed building would include 73,445 square-feet of industrial
23 warehousing and 73,445 square-feet of light manufacturing. In addition, 174 parking spaces with related

24 fencing, walls, and laudscaping is proposed for the Project site. The expansion is expected to employ 25
25 employees for both warehousing and manufacturing for a total of 50 employees.
26 3. Petitioners submitted evidence from experts explaining that the proposed Project may
27 have significant environmental effects on air quality, human health, and birds and that the City's
28 IS/MND failed to disclose, analyze, and mitigate these potentially significant effects. Respondents are

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

in violation of CEQA by failing to prepare an EIR for the Project despite substantial evidence in the

2 record of a fair argument that the Project may have significant environmental effects.

4. Because the IS/MND violates several of CEQA's requirements, the approvals that are

4 reliant upon it must be overturned. Therefore, Petitioner respectfully requests that the Court direct

5 Respondents to set aside the certification of the IS/MND and associated Project approvals.

6 PARTIES

7 5. is Petitioner SAFER is a California nonprofit public benefit corporation with members who

8 live and/or work in the City of Banning. The primary objective and purpose of SAFER is to contribute

9 to the preservation and enhancement of the environment; to advocate for programs, policies, and

10 development projects that promote not only good jobs but also a healthy natural environment and

11 working environment, including but not limited to advocating for changes to proposed projects and

12 policies that, if adopted, would reduce air, soil and water pollution, minimize harm to wildlife, conserve

13 wild places, reduce traffic congestion, reduco global warming impacts, and assure compliance with

14 applicable land use ordinances; to work to attain the widest range of beneficial uses of the environment

15 without degradation, risk to health or safety, or other undesirable and unintended consequences; to
16 promote environmentally sustainable businesses and development projects, including providing

17 comments raising environmental concerns and benefits on proposed development projects; to advocate
18 for changes to proposed development projects that will help to achieve a balance between employment,

19 the human population, and resource use which will permit high standards of living and wide sharing of
20 life's amenities by the general public; to take steps to preserve important historic, cultural, and natural
21 aspects of our national heritage, and maintain, wherever possible, an environment which supports

22 diversity and variety of individual choice; and to carry on other charitable and educational activities

23 associated with this goal as allowed by law. SAFER's members who live and/or work near the Project

24 have several legally cognizable interests in the Project and will be negatively affected by the Project's

25 adverse environmental impacts and improper approval. The interests of Petitioner and its members are

26 unique and will be directly impacted by the Project. Petitioner brings this action on behalf of itself, their
27 members, and in the public interest. Petitioner and its members have a direct and beneficial interest in
28 Respondents' compliance with laws bearing upon approval of the Project. These interests will be

2
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 directly and adversely affected by the Project, which violates provisions of law as set forth in this

2 Petition and would cause substantial harm to the natural environment and the quality of life in the
3 surrounding community. The maintenance and prosecution of this action will confer a substantial

4 benefit on the public by protecting the public from the procedural, environmental, and other harms

5 alleged herein.

6 6. Respondent City of Banning is a municipal corporation in whose jurisdiction the Project
7 will be located.

8 7. Respondent the City Council of the City of Banning ("City Council") serves as the

9 legislative body of the City of Banning for the planning and provision of services related to public needs

10 and the requirements of state laws. As the elected representatives of the people of the City of Banning,
11 the members of the City Council establish overall City priorities and set policy. Respondent City
12 Council is the governing body of the City, and is ultimately responsible for reviewing and approving or
13 denying the Project. The City Council voted on April 23, 2019 to approve the Project, including
14 certification of the MND.

15 8. Respondent Planning Commission of the City of Banning ("Planning Commission") is
16 the "lead agency" for the Project for purposes of Public Resources Code $21067, and has principal
17  responsibility for conducting environmental review for the Project and taking other actions necessary to
18 comply with CEQA.

19 9, Real Party in Interest David Hidalgo Architects, Inc., a Professional Corporation,
20 ("Hidalgo") is a California corporation with a principal place of business at 316 South First Ave.,

21 Arcadia, CA 91006. David Hidalgo Architects, Inc. is listed on the Notice of Determination as the

22 Project applicant.

23 10. Real Party in Interest DJL Properties, LLC is a California limited liability corporation
24 a with a principal place of business at 2034 North Peck Rd, South El Monte, CA 91733. DJL Properties,
25 LLC is listed on the Initial Study as the Project Applicant.

26 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

27 11. This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this Petition pursuant to Code of
28 Civil Proceduro sections 1085 and 1094.5, and Public Resources Code sections 21167, 21168 and

3
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 21168.5.

2 12. Venue is proper in Riverside County Superior Court in accordance with Code of Civil

3 Procedure section 395 because the Project at issue is located in the County of Riverside.

4 13. Venue is proper in this Court under California Code of Civil Procedure §§394 (actions

5 against a city, county, or local agency) and 395 (actions generally) because Respondents include a city

6 and local agencies based in the County of Riverside and because the cause of action alleged in this

7 Petition arose in the County of Riverside and the Project will occur within the County of Riverside.

8 STANDING

9 14. Petitioner has standing to assert the claims alleged in this Petition because they are
10 beneficially interested in this matter, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 1086. Petitioner
11 has a direct and beneficial interest in Respondents' compliance with laws bearing upon approval of the
12 Project. These interests will be directly and adversely affected by the Project, which violates the law as

13 set forth in this Petition and would cause substantial harm to the natural environment and the quality of
14 life in the surrounding community. In addition, unless the relief requested herein is granted, the
15 environment will be adversely affected and injured by Respondents* failure to comply with CEQA when
16 certifying the EIR and approving the Project.
17 15. Petitioner actively participated in the Project's administrative approval process in an
18 attempt to ensure Respondents complied with CEQA and all other applicable laws.

19 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

20 16. Petitioner has performed or will perform all conditions precedent to the filing of this

21 Petition. Petitioner has actively participated in the administrative and environmental review process

22 prior to close of the public hearings on the Project and before the issuance of the notice of

23 determination. Petitioner has fully exhausted administrative remedies to the extent required by law.
24 (Pub. Resources Code, § 21177, subd. (a).)

25 17. CEQA allows a petitioner who objected to a project to allege in a writ petition all
26 deficiencies asserted by others. (Citizens for Clean Energy v. City of Woodland (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th
27 173, 191.) Petitioner, other agencies, interested groups, and individuals made oral and written

28 comments on the Project, and raised each of the legal deficiencies asserted in this Petition.

4
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 18. Respondents have taken final agency actions certifying the IS/MND and adopting the
2 Approvals. Respondents had mandatory duty to comply with all applicable laws, including, but not
3 limited to CEQA prior to undertaking the discretionary approvals at issue in this lawsuit. Petitioners

4 possess no effective remedy to challenge the Approvals at issue in this action other than by means of this

5 lawsuit.

6 STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS

7 19. On April 23, 2019, the City Council approved the Project.

8 20. On April 25, 2019, Respondents posted a Notice of Determination ("NOD") for the
approvals of the Project.
10 21. The statute of limitations for a CEQA challenge to Respondent's decision to certify the
11 Project EIR expires 30 days from the filing and posting of the NOD. (Guidelines, §§ 15094, subd. (g),
12 15112, subd. (o)(1).) The 30th day after the April 25, 2019 NOD falls on Saturday, May 25, 2019. The
13 next weekday after Saturday May 25, 2019 is Monday May 27, 2019, which is a court holiday for
14 Memorial Day. Thus, the statute of limitations expires on Tuesday May 28, 2019.
15 22. Thus. Petitioner has filed this Petition prior to the expiration of any applicable statute of
16 limitations.

17 NOTICE OF CEOA SUIT

18 23. On May 21, 2019, Petitioner served a notice of their intent to file this lawsuit, in
19 accordance with Public Resources Code section 21167.5. (See Exhibit 1: Notice of Intent to File
20 Petition Pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act.)
21 PREPARATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD

22 24. Pursuant to Public Resources Code, section 21167.6, subdivision (b)(2), Petitioner elects
23 to prepare the record of proceedings in this action. (See Exhibit 2: Petitioner's Notice of Intent to

24 Prepare Record.)
25 PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL DOCTRINE

26 25. Petitioner brings this action as privatc attorney generals pursuant to Code of Civil
27 Procedure section 1021.5, and any other applicable legal theory, to enforce important rights affecting
28 the public interest.

S
Jerified Potition for Writ of Mandate

26. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will confer significant benefit on the

2 general public by requiring Respondents to carry out its duties under CEQA and other applicable laws

3 before approving the Project.

4 27. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will also result in the enforcement of

5 important rights affecting the public interest by compelling Respondents to engage in a legally adequate

6 analysis of the Project, and to ensure that the public has a meaningful opportunity to review and
7 comment on the impacts and mitigation measures for the Project.

8 28. The necessity and financial burden of enforcement make an award of attorneys' fees
9 appropriate in this case. Without this Petition, Respondents and Real Parties will proceed with a plan
10 and development that will cause significant, unmitigated environmental impacts that might otherwise
11 have been reduced or avoided through legally adequate environmental review and the adoption of
12 | feasible mitigation measures.
13 ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS ACTIONS

14 29. Petitioner asserts that Respondents acted arbitrarily and capriciously when certifying the
15 IS/MND and approving the Project.
16 30. In accordance with Government Codo section 800, and other applicable laws, Petitioner
17 is entitled to reasonable attorneys' fees for bringing this Petition to overturn Rospondents' arbitrary or
18 capricious actions.

19 IRREPARABLE HARM

20 31. Petitioner and its members live and/or work near the Project site and in the County of
21 Riverside and the City of Banning. They have been and will continue to be harmed by Respondents'
22 failure to provide environmental documents that accurately and fully inform interested persons of the

23 Project's true impacts, and mitigate those impacts. Such documents would lead to better environmental
24 decision-making regarding the Project, and would enable all residents, land owners, and business
25 owners in the affected region to better understand the true environmental impacts of the Project.
26 32. Petitioner has no plain, specdy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law unless
27 this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to set aside their approval of the
28 Project. In the absence of such remedies, Respondents' decisions will remain in effect in violation of

6
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 State law and Petitioner will be irreparably harmed. No monetary damages or legal remedy could fully
2 and adequately compensate Petitioner for that harm.

3 FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

4 33. On January 11, 2019, the City released the IS/MND for public review and comment

5 describing a Project including t General Plan Amendment (GPA 18-2501), a Zone Change (ZC 18-

6 3501) for 19.69 acres from the General Commercial land use district to the Business Park land use

7 district, and a Design Review (DR 18-7001) on 6.7 acres to allow the construction of a single story
8 146,890 square-feet light manufacturing and warehouse building for the expansion of an existing
9 manufacturing business.
10 34. The Project described in the IS/MND included the construction of a single story 146,890
11 square-feet light manufacturing and warehouse building for the expansion of the existing
12 manufacturing business with 73,445 square-feet of Industrial warehousing, 73,445 square-feet of light
13 manufacturing, and 174 parking spaces with related fencing, walls, and landscaping.
14 35. The period for public review and comments on the IS/MND began on January 11, 2019
15 and closed on January 31, 2019.
16 36. On January 16, 2019, the Planning Commission adopted Resolution 2019-01
17 | recommending that the City Council approve the General Plan Amendment, Zone Change, and Design
18 Review for the Project. The Planning Commission also recommended that the City Council adopt the
19 MND for the Project.

20 37. On February 26, 2019, Petitioner submitted extensive written comments to the City

21 Council.

22 38. Petitioner submitted the expert comments of wildlife biologist Dr. Shawn Smallwood,
23 PhD. Dr. Sunallwood noted that the environmental setting and baseline relied upon in the IS/MND for
24 biological resources was inadequate because the IS/MND underestimated the number of special-status
25 species that may be impacted by the Project. The IS/MND merely concluded that there would be on

26 impact on wildlife because the Project site did not fall within the three special survey areas established
27 by the Western Riverside County Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan ("MSHCP") established
28 for the Yucaipa Onion, the Burrowing Owl, and the Los Angeles Pocket Mouse and that the Project site

7
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 did not fall within any critical area or special linkage area as set forth in the MSHCP. Dr. Smallwood

2 noted that no detection surveys were performed in preparation of the IS/MND. Dr. Smallwood
3 conducted site visit on February 2, 2019 and observed five species of wildlife, including two red-

4 tailed hawks, within 68 minutes. By looking at occurrence records, Dr. Smallwood identified 45

5 special-status species of birds occurring at or near the Project site, including 19 species not covered

6 under the MSHCP. By reviewing relevant literature, Dr. Smallwood identified 19 special-status species
7 of mammals and reptiles occurring at or near the Project site, including 16 species not covered by the

8 MSHCP. Dr. Smailwood concluded that the occurrence of such species at or near the Project site

9 warranted discussion and analysis in an EIR to ensure that impacts on those species were mitigated to
10 less-than-significant levels.

11 39. Dr. Smallwood also noted that compliance with the MSHCP failed to ensure that the

12 Project's impact on wildlife would be less than significant because the MSHCP has failed to meet its
13 goals and objectives. For example, as of 2016, the MSHCP had added only 35.7% of its additional
14 acreage goals and managed only 24% of its managed acreage goals. Additionally, although the MSHCP
15 requires no fewer than five breeding pairs of burrowing owls in five defined core areas, only two pairs
16 were observed at one core area, only four pairs were observed at another core area, and surveys were
17 not conducted at the other three core areas. Because the MSHCP has failed to achieve its conservation

18 goals, Dr. Smallwood concluded that the City could not rely on compliance with the MSHCP to ensure

19 that the Project's impact on wildlife would be less than significant.
20 40. Dr. Smallwood also noted that the IS/MND failed to disclose and analyze the potential

21 adverso impact on wildlife due to vehicle collisions from the increased traffic associated with the

22 Project. Because it is estimated that vehicle collisions result in the death of 89 million to 340 million

23 birds per year and because the Project would result in increased traffic to the Project area, Dr,

24 Smallwood concluded that such an impact must be discussed in an EIR.
25 41. Dr. Smallwood also noted that the IS/MND failed to address the potential adverse
26 impact on wildlife movement due to the Project. Although the IS/MND concluded that there would be
27 no adverse impact on wildlife movement because the Project site contains no important wildlife
28 corridors, Dr. Smallwood commented that the standard under CEQA is whether the Project would

8
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 interfere with wildlife movement regardless of whether such movement is channeled by a corridor. Dr.

2 Smallwood stated that many species of wildlife likely use the Project site for stop-over and staging

3 habitat. Moreover, Dr. Smallwood observed that the Project site is located within the San Gorgonio is

4 pass, a special place with respect to bird and bat movement. Dr. Smallwood concluded that the potential
5 impacts to wildlife movement must be further discussed and evaluated in an EIR.

6 42. Petitioner also submitted an expert comment letter from the environmental consulting
7 firm Soil Water Air Protection Enterprise ("SWAPE"). SWAPE noted that the IS/MND relied upon
8 I unsubstantiated input parameters to model emissions and therefore failed to adequately analyze the

9 Project's impacts on air quality. SWAPE reviewed the output files for the IS/MND's air quality analysis

10 and found that the values used in the emission model were inconsistent with the information provided

11 in the IS/MND. Specifically, although the IS/MND described the building to be constructed as light
12 manufacturing warehouse and industrial warehouse, the emission model used in the IS/MND modeled

13 the entire proposed building as a manufacturing land use. By modeling the entire proposed building as
14 manufacturing, the IS/MND underestimated the emissions of the Project and thereby failed to rely on
15 substantial evidence for its conclusion that the Project would have less than significant impacts on air
16 quality. SWAPE concluded that the City must prepare an EIR using the correct input parameters to
17 ensure that emissions from the Project were less than significant.

18 43. SWAPE also noted that the IS/MND concluded that diesel particulate matter ("DPM")
19 emissions from the Project would not significantly impact human health without conducting a health
20  risk assessment ("HRA") as recommended by the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard
21 Assessment ("OEHHA") and the California Air Pollution Control Officers Association ("CAPCOA").

22 44. SWAPE noted that the IS/MND provided conflicting information as to the proximity of
23 sensitive receptors to the Project site. In the Air Quality section, the IS/MND stated that the closest
24 sensitive receptor was 1,575 feet north. However, in the Noise section, the IS/MND stated that the

25 closest home to the Project site was 300 feet south. SWAPE concluded that such inconsistencies

26 rendered the IS/MND inadequate as an informational document under CEQA,
27 45. SWAPE prepared a screening-level HRA, consistent with OEHHA guidance, for the
28 Project. SWAPE concluded that the excess cancer risk from the Project for children and infants was 16

9
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

and 77 in one million, respectively. SWAPE calculated the excess cancer risk over the course of a

2 residential lifetime as approximately 100 in one million. Because the significance threshold for excess

3 cancer risk is 10 in one million, SWAPE concluded that an EIR with a more refined HRA must be

4 prepared to ensure that the Project's impacts on human health were properly evaluated and mitigated.
5 46. Lastly, Petitioners comment letter noted that the IS/MND failed to consider cumulative

6 air quality impacts from nearby projects. The comment letter identified two reasonably foresecable
7 projects in Banning: the Banning Distribution center located 2.5 miles from the Project site and the
8 Banning Business Park located 2.25 miles from the Project site. Because the cumulative impacts of the

9 Project in conjunction with other reasonably foreseeable projects were not addressed in the IS/MND,
10 the IS/MND failed to properly conform to the requirements of CEQA.

11 47. On February 26, 2019, the Project came before the City Council. The City Council voted
12 to continue the decisions on the Project to March 12, 2019.
13 48. On March 12, 2019, the Project again came before the City Council. Petitioner

14 submitted oral comments at that meeting summarizing Potitioner's written comments submitted on
15 February 26, 2019. The City Council voted to continue the decisions on the Project to April 9, 2019.

16 49, The City Council again continued the decisions on the Project from April 9, 2019 to
17 April 23, 2019.

18 50. On April 12, 2019, the City received written correspondence from the Applicant
19 responding to Petitioner's written comment of February 26, 2019 and corresponding expert letters.

20 51. The Applicant's air quality consultant, FirstCarbon Solutions, noted that the emissions
21 model of the IS/MND had been updated in response to SWAPE's comment to include the correct land

22 use a parameters for a 50 percent industrial warchouse and 50 percent manufacturing warehouse.

23 FirstCarbon Solutions also noted that the HRA had been updated in the IS/MND in response to
24 SWAPE's comment and indicated that the construction and operation of the Project would not exceed
25 health risk significance thresholds. FirstCarbon also noted that because the Project would not have
26 individually significant impacts, the cumulative impacts of the Project and other reasonably foreseeable
27 projects would not be significant.

28 52, The applicant's biological resources cousultant, Melissa Fowler, responded to the

10
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 comments of Dr. Shawn Smallwood. Ms. Fowler stated that biological surveys had been conducted
2 through queries to databases maintained by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the California

3 Department of Fish and Wildlife. Ms. Fowler noted that the Project site was assessed for burrowing

4 owls on October 21, 2018 (outside of burrowing owl breeding season) and detected no presence or
5 associated signs of burrowing owls. Ms. Fowler repeated the conclusion of the IS/MND that there

6 a would not be a significant impact on wildlife movement because the Project site was not part of an
'7 important wildlife corridor. Lastly, Ms. Fowler repeated the conclusion of the IS/MND that the
8 additional vehicle trips due to the Project would not have significant impact on biological resources.

9 53. On April 23, 2019, Petitioner submitted an additional written comment, including
10 additional letters from experts SWAPE and Dr. Shawn Smallwood, responding to the Applicant's April
11 12, 2019 response to Petitioner's February 26, 2019 written comment.
12 54. SWAPE noted that the HRA conducted in response to its earlier comment continued to
13 inadequatelty evaluate the potential health risk impact of the Project. Specifically, the HRA incorrectly
14 assumed that "Tier 4 Final" equipment would be used for all scrapers, bulldozers, and excavators
15 during construction of the Project. However, SWAPE noted that "Tier 4 Final" equipment would not
16 nocessarily be available at the time of Project construction and that, as a result, "Tier 4 Interim"
17 equipment would be used. Because "Tier 4 Interim" equipment has greater emissions levels than "Tier
18 4 Final" equipment, the HRA conducted by FirstCarbon Solution inappropriately underestimated
19 emissions by assuming all equipment would be "Tier 4 Final." SWAPE also noted that the HRA
20 incorrectly modeled the horsepower for the Rubber Tired Dozer that would be used during the
21 underground utilities phase of Project construction and failed to model the correct number of usage
22 || hours for the air compressor during the architectural coating phase of Project construction.
23 55. Dr. Smallwood responded to the reply of Ms. Melissa Fowler regarding the Project's
24 impacts on biological resources. Dr. Smallwood noted that one should not expect to detect special-
25 status species during a cursory two-hour survey conducted on a single day. Dr. Smallwood critiqued the
26 reconnaissance-level survey as grossly inadequate for detecting special-status species of wildlife. Dr.
27 Smallwood also critiqued Ms. Fowler for relying on database queries which have explicit warnings
28 from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife ("CDFW") as to the limitations of using such

11
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 databases. Dr. Smallwood also critiqued Ms. Fowler's detection survey for burrowing owls, noting that

2 the survey failed to meet the standards of CDFW. Dr. Smallwood observed that Ms. Fowler's survey

3 detected ground squirrels on the Project site, which should have prompted detection surveys for

4 burrowing owls because burrowing owls rely on ground squirrels for access to burrows and for mutual

5 predator vigilance and alarm. Dr. Smallwood reitereated the point from his previous comment that the

6 bare conclusion that the Project site is not an important wildlife corridor failed to adequalely assess the

7 Project's impact on wildlife movement. Lastly, Dr. Smallwood noted that Ms. Fowler's dismissal of his

8 concerns over the impact on wildlife from vehicle collisions was unfounded. Dr. Smallwood noted that

9 the Project would result in an additional 20,000 vehicle trips per year and that an EIR was necessary to
10 assess and mitigate the impacts of increased traffic on wildlife mortality.
11 56. On April 23, 2019, the City Council adopted the IS/MND and the Mitigation Monitoring

12 and Reporting Program and approved the General Plan Amendment, Zone Change, and Design Review
13 for the Project.
14 57. On April 25, 2019, the City posted the Notice of Determination for the City Council's
15 April 23, 2019 actions for the Project.

16 MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS OF CEOA

17 58. CEQA prohibits local agencies from approving projects that may have adverse
18 environmental effects without first undergoing environmental review and avoiding or reducing the

19 significant environmental effects of those projects whenever feasible.

20 59. CEQA mandates that "the long-term protection of the environment . .. shall be the

21 guiding criterion in public decisions" throughout California. (PRC $21001(d).) CEQA requires

22 environmental factors to be considered at the "carliest stage before [the project] gains irreversible

23 V, momenturo," Bozung v. LAFCO (1975) 13 Cal.3d 263, 284 n.28, "at a point in the planning process
24 where genuine flexibility remains." (Sundstrom v. County of Mendocino (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 296,
25 307 [internal quotation marks and citation omitted].) Moreover, "the 'foremost principle' in
26 interpreting CEQA is that the Legislature intended the act to be road so as to afford the fullest possible
27 protection to the environment within the reasonable scope of the statutory language." (Communities for
28 ( Better Env't v. Cal. Resources Agency (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 98, 109.)

12
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 60. CEQA generally requires that a lead agency prepare and certify an EIR for any project
2 a that may have a significant effect on the environment to identify those effects, alternatives to the
3 project, and mitigation of the effects. (PRC §§21002.1(a), 21061, 21100(a).)

4 61, CEQA requires that an agency analyze the potential environmental effects of its
5 proposed actions in an EIR if "there is substantial evidence, in light of the whole record before the lead
6 agency, that the project may have a significant effect on the environment." (PRC §21080(d).) A
7 "*project" is "the whole of an action" directly undertaken or supported by a public agency "which may
8 cause either a direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical
9 change in the environment." (PRC $21065; CCR §15378(a).)
10 62. CEQA has two primary purposes. First, CEQA is designed to inform decision makers
11 and the public about a project's environmental effects. (14 CCR §15002(a)(1).) "The EIR process
12 protects not only the environment but also informed self-government." (Laurel Heights Improvement
13 Ass'n v. Regents of the University of Culifornia (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 392.)
14 63. Second, CEQA requires public agencies to identify ways to avoid or reduce
15 environmental damage and prevent such damage "by roquiring changes in projects through the use of
16 alternatives or mitigation measures when the governmeutal agency finds the changes to be feasiblo.»
17 ||(14 CCR §15002(a)(2), (3).) Put another way, "agencies are required to give major consideration to
18 preventing environmental damage" and "should not approve a project as proposed if there are feasible
19 alternatives or mitigation measures available that would substantially lessen any significant effects that
20 the project would have on the environment.' (14 CCR $1502 l(a).)
21 64. CEQA requires the lead agenoy to conduct an "initiai study" with respect to
22 environmental effects. (14 CCR $15063(a).) The initial study must describe "the environmental
23 setting" of the Project. (14 CCR $15063(d)(2).)
24 65. CEQA requires that a lend agency analyze all significant environmental effects of its
25 proposed actions in an EIR, (PRC $21100(b)(1); 14 CCR §15126(a).) The EIR must not only identify
26 the effects, but must also provide "information about how adverse the adverse impact will be."
27 (Santiago County Water Dist. v. County of Orange (1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 818, 831.)
28 66. "CEQA requires the preparation of an EIR "whenever it can be fairly argued on the

13
/erified Petition for Writ of Mandate

-

2 basis of substantial evidence that the project may have significant environmental impact." (Quail

3 Botanical Gardens Found., Inc. v. City of Encinitas (1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 1597, 1602 [quoting No Oil,

4 Inc. V, City of Los Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 75.) The point is to "impose a low threshold

5 requirement for preparation of an EIR." (No Oil, 13 Cal.3d at 84.) By definition, "expert opinion

6 supported by fact" constitutes substantial evidence. (PRC $21080(e)(1); 14 CCR §15064(f)(5).)
67.

7 A project may have a significant effect on the environment if "possible effects of a

8 project are individually limited but cumulatively considerable," meaning "that the incremental effects

9 of an individual project are considerable when viewed in connection with the effects of past projects,
the effects of other current projects, and the effects of probable future projects." (PRC §21083(b)(2).)
10 The definition of "cumulative impacts" is "two or more individual effects which, when considered

11 together, are considerable or which compound or increase other environmental impacts.' (14 CCR
12 §15355.) These "individual effects may be changes resulting from a single project or a number of
13 separate projects." (14 CCR §15355(a).)

14 68. If a project may have a significant effect on the environment, the agency may approve
15| the project only if it has "[elliminated or substantially lessened all significant effects on the
16 environment where feasible" and finds that any unavoidable significant effects on the environment are
17  "acceptable due to overriding concerns." (14 CCR §15092(b)(2).)
18 69. If a proposed project "would not have a significant effect on the environment," then the
19 "lead agency" prepares a "negative declaration" or a "mitigated negative declaration" instead of an

20 EIR. PRC §§21064, 21064.5, 21080(c).

21 70,

22 A mitigated negative declaration is proper only if project revisions would avoid or

23 mitigate the potentially significant effects identified in an initial study "to a point where clearly no
significant effect on the environment would occur, and

24 is there is no substantial evidence in light of the

25 whole record before the public agency that the project, as revised, may have a significant effect on the
environment.» PRC $521064.5, 21080(c)(2). But "if a lead agency is presented with a fair argument
26 that a project may have a significant effect on the environment, the lead agency shall prepare an EIR
27

28 even though it may also be presented with other substantial evidence that the project will not have a
significant effect." Arviv Enterprise v. South Valley Area Planning Com. (2002) 101 Cal.App.4th

14
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

P 1333, 1345-46.

2 71. An abuse of discretion under CEQA may be shown either because an agency failed to

3 proceed in the manner required by law or reached factual conclusions unsupported by substantial
4 evidence. (E.g., Banning Ranch Conservancy v. City of Newport Beach (2017) 2 Cal.5th 918, 935.) A
5 procedural failure is reviewed de novo; in contrast, greater deference is accorded an agency's factual

6 conclusions. (Id.) In any event, "the reviewing court is not to 'uncritically rely on every study or
7 analysis presented by a project proponent in support of its position. A clearly inadequate or
8 unsupported study is entitled to no judicial deference."" (Berkeley Keep Jets Over the Bay Committee v.
9 Bd. of Port Comrs. (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1344, 1355 [quoting Laurel Heights, 47 Cal.3d at 409 n.12].)
10 There is a prejudicial abuse of discretion "if the failure to include relevant information precludes
11 informed decisionmaking and informed public participation, thereby thwarting the statutory goals of the
12 EIR process." (Kings County Farm Bureau v. City of Hanford (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 692, 712 [citing
13 Laurel Heights, 47 Cal.3d at 403-05].)
14 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

15 Violation of CEQA
16 (Public Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.) (Code of Civil Procedure § 1085 or in the alternative $1094.5)
17 72. Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference the paragraphs set forth above.
18 73. Respondents violated CEQA because the City's IS/MND is inadequate, inter alia: (a) for
19 failing to describe special status species on or near the Project site; (b) for relying on the Western
20 Riverside County MSHCP; (c) for failing to disclose and analyze the Project's impact on wildlife due to
21 increased vehicle trips; (e) for failing to disclose and analyze the Project's impact on wildlife movement:l
22 (f) for failing to use correct input parameters in the health risk assessment; (g) for failing to analyze and
23 mitigate the Project's impacts related to airborne health risks; and (h) for failing to disclose analyze the
24 cumulative impacts of the Project and other reasonably foreseeable projects on air quality.
25 74. Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion because they failed to proceed in a
26 manner required by law and because their decision is not supported by substantial evidence, which
27 precluded informed decisionmaking and informed public participation.
28

15

1 75. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents' adoption of the IS/MND and
2 associated approvals should be set aside.
