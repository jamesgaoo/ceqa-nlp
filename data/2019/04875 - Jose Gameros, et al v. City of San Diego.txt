ATTORNEYS AT LAW
SAN DIEGO VERIFIED PETTTION FOR WRI

1 AND COMPLAINT 1

1 I. INTRODUCTION

2 1. The City of San Diego (*City") violated the California Environmental Quality Act

3 ("CEQA") by adopting an ordinance to ban the distribution of polystyrene foam ("foam" or

4 "EPS") food containers in San Diego (*Ordinance") without first preparing any environmental

5 analysis with respect to the potential environmental impacts of the proposed ban.' Not a single

6 sentence of analysis; simply two conclusory sentences stating that the ban is exempt from

7 CEQA. Despite hundreds of pages of testimony, reports, and letters-including detailed expert

8 letters, reports, and studies raising serious concerns regarding potentially significant

9 environmental impacts from such a ban-the City disregarded all of the testimony, reports and
10 studies, did not even ask to have it reviewed, and adopted a two-sentence conclusion without any

11 analysis or support:

12 The proposed Ordinance is exempt from the provisions of the
13 California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) pursuant to Section 15061(b)(3) of Title 14 of the California Code of Regulations

14 because it can be seen with certainty that there is no possibility that the proposed Ordinance would have a significant adverse effect on
15 the environment. Further, the proposed Ordinance iS exempt from CEQA on the separate and independent ground that it is an action of

16 a regulatory agency (the City) for the "maintenance, restoration, enhancement, and protection of the environment" pursuant to

17 Section 15308 of Title 14 of the California Code of Regulations, through the regulation of the distribution of expanded polystyrene

18 products.

19 2. Evidence before the City when it adopted the Ordinance uniformly showed that a

20 ban on EPS, which is recyclable, will not reduce litter or trash and will result in polystyrene foam
21 being substituted with replacement products that have far greater environmental impacts and

22 result in increased litter and trash.

23 3. This substitution effect and the significant environmental problems a ban creates

24 IS well recognized by experts and regulators. Indeed, as was presented in testimony and reports

25 to the City Council, three California State agencies- the California Department of Toxic
26 Substance Control, the California State Water Resources Control Board, and CalRecycle with

27

28 Polystyrene foam is sometimes referred to as expanded polystyrene or EPS.

LATHAM•WATKINS US-DOCS\105681742 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT
ATTORNEYS AT LAW AND COMPLAINT FOR INJU
SAN DIEGO 2 DECLARATORY RECI

I broad expertise in hazardous waste, water quality, and recycling have specifically analyzed bans

2 and rejected them as having potentially significant environmental impacts and being ineffective

3 and counterproductive.

4 4. The State Water Resources Control Board ("State Board"), the State of

5 California's top water-quality regulator, in 2015 rejected a policy that would have encouraged
6 bans statewide, finding after detailed study that bans cause significant environmental impacts
7 because products that replace polystyrene foam after it is banned have significant environmental

8 impacts:2

9 [B]ans on polystyrene food containers would cause a shift to materials with other significant environmental impacts (University
10 of California at San Diego 2006).

11 In other words, the State's lead water quality regulator foundafter years of detailed technical
12 study-that bans of polystyrene foam create significant environmental impacts. Yet the City,

13 after no analysis, and without even acknowledging the existence of the State Board's analysis

14 and conclusion (which was presented to the City Council), found that there is no possibility a ban

15 would have significant impacts. This standing alone is enough for the Court to overturn the
16 City's finding and to find that the City violated CEQA. CEQA does not allow the City to waive
17 off the State Board's explicit finding that bans cause significant environmental impacts (made

18 after years of technical analysis) with two conclusory sentences. The City's finding was not
19 supported by substantial evidenceit was not supported by any evidence. rather, it ignored the

20 mountain of evidence that bans do cause environmental impacts.

21 5. Similarly, the California Department of Toxic Substances Control ("DTSC")

22 found that bans "often create new problems when substitutions are made";3 and CalRecycle, as

23 part of a detailed study on polystyrene commissioned by the Legislature, found that bans are "not

an effective long-term solution.™4

6. Members of the public, including the American Chemistry Council (*ACC"), Dart
Container Corporation of California ("Dart Container Corporation," or "Dart"), and numerous

4 small business owners and residents submitted hundreds of pages of evidenceincluding
approximately twenty-five expert reports, scientific studies, and government studies containing

6 detailed technical analysisshowing that banning the distribution of polystyrene foam may
cause numerous significant environmental and health impacts and would not eliminate litter and
will undermine recycling. The studies and reports showing that the ban may cause significant
environmental impacts included reports by leading academics, consultants, and government

10 agencies. Among the numerous studies and reports submitted regarding potential environmental

11 impacts and the effectiveness of such a ban were reports from Dr. Mark Berkman, an expert in

12 applied microeconomics, with a PhD from The Wharton School of the University of

13 Pennsylvania, Ramboll, one of the world's leading environmental consultant firms, and The

14 Acheson Group, one of the nation's foremost experts on food safety. Also studies by the State

15 Board, California's leading water-quality regulator, and Dr. Mark Grey, an expert with decades

16 of expertise in trash and water quality were submitted.

17 7. The City simply ignored the mountains of evidence presented to it -it ignored

18 the findings of other agencies, it ignored the academic experts from prestigious institutions, and

19 it ignored the dozens of technical and expert reports submitted to it. Not only did the City not

20 prepare an environmental impact report, as CEQA requires, but it also failed to conduct any

21 analysis of the Ordinance. There was no screening analysis, no initial study, no expert report-
22 nothing but two sentences of conclusory findings with no analysis.

23 8. The clear evidence presented to the City demonstrated that the proposed ban will
24 have environmental impacts with respect to a host of environmental resources: increased energy
25 consumption, increased greenhouse gas emissions, decreases in water quality, increases in
26 marine litter, increased water use, increased regulated air emissions, increased forest products

consumption, and increases in the amount of material sent to landfill facilities. The expert
2 analysis submitted to the City was very clear that the ban may have significant impacts that need
to be analyzed in an environmental impact report. For example, Ramboll stated: "A ban on
certain EPS products, as is being considered by the City, would result in potentially significant
environmental impacts." And regarding specific impacts, the expert analysis concluded as

6 follows:

"[T]he increased use of substitute products could have, and is not necessarily limited

8 to, significant environmental effects within the following CEQA technical areas:
utilities and service systems, hydrology/water quality, biological resources, air
10 quality, greenhouse gases ("GHGs"), aesthetics, and agriculture/forest resources. "*6
11 "An EPS ban would impact the City's waste systems (e.g., recycling, composting,

12 and landfill operations)."7

13 "[I]ncreasing the prevalence of non-EPS plastics in use may increase marine litter."8

14 "[S]ubstituting other single-use products in place of EPS will result in increased

15 criteria air pollutant emissions."9

16 "[S]ubstituting other single-use products in place of EPS will result in increased

17 greenhouse gas emissions."10

18 "[T]he proposed ban is very unlikely to achieve its stated purpose and very likely to

19 have unintended consequences. These include higher levels of air pollution, water

20 consumption, and material consumption. The ban will also discourage investment and

21 innovation in efforts to recycle EPS."11

"A ban is likely to increase litter and trash ."12

2 9. The City offered no explanation at all regarding its conclusion that the Ordinance

3 would not have significant environmental impacts and that it was exempt. it And the City cannot

4 assume that San Diego is a small jurisdiction so that what it does will not make much of a

5 difference. Quite the contrary, with a population of approximately 1.4 million people, the City

6 of San Diego is the second largest city in California, and the eighth largest in the United States.

7 The City IS very large geographically-spanning 370 square miles, including 44 miles of

8 shoreline. And the City is a significant economy in itself-its economy is approximately the size

o of Portugal's. So when the City adopts a City-wide ban, the potentially significant
10 environmental impacts are magnified. Again, the City did no analysis of the ban's potential

11 impacts given the size of the City and its economy.

12 10. Additionally, the ban is directly contrary to San Diego's recycling goals. EPS is
13 recyclable. Many of the substitute products are not and have significant environmental and

14 health issues. Indeed. in 2017, the City announced a program to recycle EPS, including "all

15 foam food and drink containers."13 Now, the City is reversing course with no reasonable
16 explanation and banning EPS, despite acknowledging that it is recyclable. By banning this

17 recyclable material, the City is acting directly contrary to its own zero waste goals.

18 11. The City's ban also undermines the City's Climate Action Plan ("CAP"), which
19 includes "zero waste" as a key component. And the ban will increase use of local landfills which

20 are already capacity constrained. Despite hundreds of pages of expert analysis showing that the
21 ban may, and, in fact, will, have significant environmental impacts, the City simply ignored the
22 evidence submitted to it showing that the ban is directly contrary to its own CAP.

23 12. As described further below, in this suit, Petitioners ask the Court to require the

24 City to set aside the Ordinance and to conduct an environmental impact report as CEQA requires

25 before reconsidering the ban.

- 13. The City needs to evaluate mitigation measures and alternatives in an
2 environmental impact report, including the alternative of promoting and expanding recycling

3 instead of banning a recyclable material.

4 II. THE PARTIES

5 14. Petitioner and Plaintiff Jose Gameros owns and operates Mariscos El Golosito, a
6 small San Diego seafood restaurant that has been in business for more than 25 years.

7 Gameros

8 stated his opposition to the City's proposed polystyrene ban, prior to the City Council's adoption

9 of the ban, by letter submitted to the City. Gameros has a direct and beneficial interest in the

10 City's compliance with CEQA and in the protection of San Diego's environment.

15.

11 Petitioner and Plaintiff Reinaldo Gatica works at, and is the son of the owner of,
Orlando's Taco Shop, a San Diego small business in operation for at least six years. Expanded
12 polystyrene has been used at Orlando's Taco Shop for many years. Gatica sent the City of San

13 Diego a letter expressing his opposition to the ban. Gatica has a direct and beneficial interest in
14 the City's compliance with CEQA and in the protection of San Diego's environment.

15 16. Petitioner and Plaintiff Javier Rodriguez is the owner and operator of Antojitos
16 Colombianos, a San Diego small business for at least seven years.

17 Prior to the City Council's
adoption of the expanded polystyrene ban, Rodriguez sent the City of San Diego a letter
18 expressing his opposition to the ban. Rodriguez has a direct and beneficial interest in the City's
19 compliance with CEQA and in the protection of San Diego's environment.

20 17. Petitioner California Restaurant Association ("CRA") is a not-for-profit trade
21 association based in Auburn, California. CRA represents the interests of thousands of
22 restaurants across California, including restaurants in San Diego that benefit from and rely on

23 San Diego's unique coastal environment. CRA has a direct and beneficial interest in the City's
24 compliance with CEQA and in the protection of San Diego's environment.

25 18. Petitioner Dart Container Corporation of California is a Michigan Corporation,
26 which has at all relevant times been in good standing and qualified to do business in California.

27 Dart exhausted its administrative remedies. Dart Container Corporation manufactures foam
28 products that are banned by the Ordinance. The Ordinance will therefore have a severe effect on

LATHAM•WATKINS US-DOCS\105681742
ATTORNEYS AT LAW
SAN DIEGO VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF1

7 AND COMPLAIN DEOEARANEN RELI

l Dart Container Corporation's business in San Diego and Dart Container Corporation has a direct,

2 substantial beneficial interest in this case.

3 19. Respondent City of San Diego is a political subdivision of the State of California.

4 The City IS the "lead agency" for the purposes of Public Resources Code section 21067, with
5 principal responsibility for conducting environmental review of the Ordinance and complying
6 with CEQA and other state laws.

20. The Notice of Exemption does not identify any other real parties in interest, and
therefore there is no requirement to name any additional real parties in interest as parties.

o Petitioners are unaware of any other parties that CEQA requires as named real parties under
10 applicable law or the true names and capacities of Respondents/Defendants/Real Parties

11 fictitiously named herein as Does 1 through 100, inclusive, and sues such
12 Respondents/Defendants/Real Parties by fictitious names. Petitioners will amend this Petition,

13 with leave of the Court if necessary, to allege the fictitiously named
14 Respondents/Defendants/Real Parties' true names and capacities if ascertained.

15 III. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

16 21. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 1060,

17 1085, and 1094.5, and Public Resources Code sections 21168 and 21168.5.

18 22. Petitioners performed all conditions precedent to filing this Petition and
19 Complaint, including, but not limited to, exhausting all administrative remedies.

20 23. Venue is proper in this Court because Respondent City of San Diego is located in

21 the County of San Diego, and the violations of Petitioners' rights occurred in the County of San

22 Diego.

23 24. Petitioners have standing to assert their claims because they have a material a
24 interest in ensuring that the City properly analyzes and mitigates the effects of the Ordinance.

25 Petitioners have a legitimate interest in foam, plastics, recycling, and the environment.
26 Petitioners have no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law.

SAN DIEGO AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATOR

l IV. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

2 A. The City adopted its proposed ban with no CEQA review, despite substantial

3 evidence that a ban may have significant environmental impacts and that

4 CEQA exemptions do not apply.

5 25. The City Council held the first reading of the Ordinance on October 15, 2018.

6 26. A staff report accompanied the Ordinance. It contained a conclusory assertion-

7 with no analysis-that the Ordinance is exempt from CEQA. The portion of the staff report

8 addressing the ban's environmental impacts states in its entirety:
The proposed Ordinance is exempt from the provisions of the
2= California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) pursuant to Section 15061(b)(3) of Title 14 of the California Code of Regulations because it can be seen with certainty that there is no possibility that the proposed Ordinance would have a significant adverse effect on 12 the environment. Further, the proposed Ordinance is exempt from CEOA on the separate and independent ground that it is an action of
13 a regulatory agency (the City) for the "maintenance, restoration, enhancement, and protection of the environment" pursuant to Section 15308 of Title 14 of the California Code of Regulations, 14 through the regulation of the distribution of expanded polystyrene products. 15

16 27. With the agenda packet that accompanied the draft Ordinance, the City also
17 included a report by Equinox Project titled "Recommendations for Reducing or Banning Foam

18 Food Containers." The report by the Equinox Project is a high-level report discussing foam bans
19 generally. It is not a San Diego-specific analysis of potential impacts of banning foam, nor is it a
20 cumulative-impacts analysis of bans across the state. Indeed, the report acknowledges that "the

21 production of alternative food service containers may have : greater environmental impact than

22 EPS production, since EPS requires relatively little energy and water to produce."
23 28. Also included with the draft Ordinance was a resolution finding the Ordinance is

24 exempt from CEQA. The resolution includes no analysis whatsoever, but finds "the Council of

25 the City of San Diego, using its independent judgment, has determined that the Project will not

26 have a significant effect on the environment." The resolution does not describe how the City

27 made that finding or what evidence it was relying on. The resolution found the Ordinance

28 exempt from CEQA under both the "common sense exemption" and under the Class 8 exemption

LATHAM•WATKINS US-DOCS\105681742 VERIFIED PETTTION FOR WRIT OF AND COMPLAINT FOR INJL ATTORNEYS AT LAW
SAN DIEGO 9

for "actions taken by regulatory agencies, as authorized by state or local ordinance, to assure the

2 maintenance, restoration, enhancement, or protection of the environment where the regulatory

3 process involves procedures for protection of the environment." 14 Cal. Code Regs., § 15308.

4 29. The City failed to do any environmental analysis on the ban despite substantial

5 evidence that the public submitted that the ban may have significant environmental impacts and

6 IS not exempt from CEQA. At the October 15, 2018 hearing, dozens of members of the public

7 spoke or submitted letters to the City urging it not to it adopt the ban. ACC submitted letter

8 urging the City to expand recycling of polystyrene foam, rather than banning this
9 environmentally superior material. CRA submitted a presentation on behalf of its members

10 showing that alternatives to EPS could be 145% more expensive than EPS. And approximately

11 156 independent restaurants submitted letters urging the City not to adopt the ban.

12 30. Also at the October 15, 2018 hearing, Dart Container Corporation submitted an

13 extensive comment letter through its counsel. The letter and its attachments were approximately

14 335 pages of analysis, technical reports, and expert materials-including two expert reports
15 prepared specifically analyzing San Diego's proposed ban. The letter included approximately 11
16 technical studies and papers supporting the comment letter and demonstrating how the ban will
17 have significant environmental impacts. The expert studies show that product bans simply

18 replace one type of trash with another without reducing overall trash and result in other,

19 potentially more harmful, products ending up in waterways. Included with the comment letter

20 were expert reports by Ramboll and The Acheson Group specifically analyzing the potential

21 impacts of the Ordinance in the City of San Diego. The evidence submitted to the City showed
22 that the Ordinance would result in environmental impacts including greater energy use, pollutant

23 emissions, and water use, and further demonstrates that foam has life-cycle advantages over
24 substitute products. In addition, the evidence showed that foam is recyclable, and a ban would
25 undermine San Diego's ability to meet the recycling goals in the City's Zero Waste Plan and the
26 GHG goals in the City's CAP. The report by The Acheson Group showed that, as a result of

27 foam's lesser porousness and better insulating qualities, it offers greater protection against
28 foodborne illness and communicable diseases than alternative single-use food service products.

SAN DIEGO 10 AND COMPLAINT FOR INJL

Dart Container Corporation specifically explained in its comments that the City could not rely on

2 a CEQA exemption, but was required to prepare an environmental impact report to study these
and other potential impacts from the Ordinance.

4 31. The City ignored all of the evidence submitted to it showing that the ban could
have significant impacts. It did not conduct any CEQA analysis, and did not even respond to the
materials submitted showing that the ban could have significant impacts.

32. Despite the voluminous evidence showing that a ban a could have significant
environmental impacts, on October 15, 2018, the City Council voted 5-3 to adopt the Ordinance.

9 On the same day, the City Council adopted a resolution finding the Ordinance exempt from

10 CEQA.

11 33. Under the City Charter, the Ordinance required a second reading by the City

12 Council for its adoption. San Diego City Charter § 275(c).

13 34. On January 8, 2019, the City held a public hearing and a second reading of the

14 Ordinance. Again, numerous small business owners testified against a proposed ban. Dart

15 Container Corporation once again submitted comments asking the City to complete an analysis
16 under CEQA before considering : ban and urging the City to look at alternatives such as

17 recycling instead of a ban.

18 35. Dart Container Corporation's letter for the January 8, 2019 hearing included

19 approximately 14 expert reports, included approximately 1,318 pages of technical analysis,

20 study, and reports, and further demonstrated that the ban may have significant environmental

21 impacts. Two of the additional technical reports specifically analyzed potential impacts of the

22 Ordinance in San Diego-a second report by Ramboll and a report by the Brattle Group.

23 36. Dart Container Corporation's January 7, 2019 letter to the City and technical

24 reports cite potential impacts from the Ordinance, including preventing the City from meeting its

25 recycling goals in the City's Zero Waste Plan and the GHG goals in the City's CAP, increasing
26 odor complaints from local composting facilities, and additional impacts regarding landfill space,

27 biological resources, forest resources, air quality, hydrology and water quality, micro-litter, and
28 increasing demand at landfills and composting facilities. The Ramboll report also explained that,

-

2 based on Ramboll's survey, homeless shelters in San Diego use foam. Banning foam would

3 impose greater costs on the shelters, and also deprive the vulnerable homeless population of a

4 safe, sanitary, superior insulator-polystyrene foam. The ban could thus increase foodborne

5 illness and have significant impacts related to public health, including the health of homeless
persons. Once again, Dart Container Corporation (and other commenters) explained that the
6 City could not rely on a CEQA exemption.

7 37.

8 As it had done in the prior hearing, the City simply ignored the evidence

9 submitted to it showing that the ban may have significant environmental impacts. Despite the

10 evidence that a ban may have numerous significant environmental impacts, at the January 8,

11 2019 second reading of the Ordinance, the City voted 6-3 to adopt the Ordinance.

38.

12 Upon information and belief, the City Clerk transmitted the Ordinance to the

13 Mayor on January 8, 2019. The Mayor declined to sign the Ordinance. Under the City's

14 Charter, "final passage" of the Ordinance occurred on or about January 24, 2019 ten business

B. The ban will not reduce trash or litter, and it may substantially increase
trash and litter; the City must analyze this potential impact in an
environmental impact report.

4 42. One of the City's purported reasons for the ban was to address litter. But
evidence submitted to the City shows that the ban will not reduce litter. Rather it is likely to

6 increase trash and litter, including litter that may be carried to San Diego's waterways and
ultimately to the ocean. Once again, evidence that the ban is likely to increase trash and litter

8 was submitted to the City. Based on the record in front of the City Council there was clear

9 evidence of potentially significant environmental impacts that the City must analyze in an
10 environmental impact report. But the City simply ignored it, without any meaningful

11 explanation and without any CEQA analysis. In fact, there was no analysis from the City to even

12 explain its rationale for the asserted CEQA exemptions. Just two conclusory sentences.

13 43. Substantial evidence presented to the City, including expert reports from the

14 State, demonstrate that the ban would not be effective in reducing trash or litter. One reason that
15 the Ordinance will not reduce trash or litter is the substitution effect. People will not stop using
16 single-use food containers after the ban goes into effect. Rather, they will use substitute products

17 that may also be littered. This is common sense, and it is also affirmed by multiple experts. Dr.

18 David Sunding, Thomas Graff Professor in the College of Natural Resources at University of
19 California, Berkeley, studied this issue and concluded: "No study has been conducted showing
20 that bans of polystyrene materials are successful in reducing overall litter. In fact, a recent report

21 shows that due to a substitution of alternative products for banned PS [polystyrene] products,

22 litter volume remains the same or even increases after the implementation of a PS ban."14

23 44. Dr. Mark Grey, another expert with deep expertise in trash and water quality,
24 explains that plastic bag bans are not a good analogue for polystyrene foam bans. There are
25 readily available reusable substitutes for plastic bags, but there are not readily available reusable

I substitutes for polystyrene foam food containers. 15

2 45. Michael Harding, another expert with over 35 years of experience in pollution

3 control, similarly finds that bans of polystyrene foam do not reduce litter because litter is a
4 problem of human behavior: "The source of all categories of trash and litter is anthropogenic,

5 meaning that if one particular type of container, bag or food ware is banned (i.e.,
6 plastic/polystyrene) whatever material takes its place will in all likelihood be discarded and
7 introduced into the storm drain unless public education programs, improved collection
8 management, anti-littering enforcement programs are proportionally increased."16

Q 46. The State Board analyzed empirical data from before and after a polystyrene foam
10 ban in San Francisco. It also found a substitution effect: 17

11 Data from the City of San Francisco's Streets Litter Re-Audit report

12 confirmed that eliminating all food-related polystyrene would simply change the type of litter found on our streets and in our
13 waterways, and result in an increase in the non-polystyrene related litter items, thus, showing no overall reduction in litter (or trash to

14 the waterways) (City of San Francisco 2008).

15 47. In sum, the evidence shows that the City's ban will not reduce litter or trash.
it 16 Rather, it will change the composition of the litter and trash. As discussed below, substitute

17 products are likely to have greater environmental impacts than polystyrene foam.

18 48. In addition, because of polystyrene foam's superior insulating properties, and
19 because more replacement products are needed to meet the performance of foam, there will

20 likely be more trash and more litter after the ban. As Ramboll stated in its expert report: 18

1 Due to the superior insulation properties of EPS, there is likely a

2 greater than one-for-one product substitution based on the attempts to reproduce the insulation properties of EPS. Often when a hot beverage is served inside a paper cup, an additional layer of insulation such as a sleeve or another cup is used to make the

4 beverage safe or comfortable to hold. This generates more waste compared to simply using one EPS cup. Given the size of the San Diego market, this could cause a significant increase in trash and litter in San Diego.

6 This phenomenon of people double cupping hot beverages (like hot coffee) is well-known and is

7 cited as inspiration for the invention of the cup sleeve. 19

8 49. Additionally, according to Ramboll, "Consumers are also more likely to litter

Q substitutes to EPS because they may wrongly believe that littering products marketed as
10| 'biodegradable' does not impact the environment. A national survey to examine littering

11

12 behavior in the United States found that littering was reported more frequently in instances when
the item was biodegradable."20 Keep America Beautiful explains the phenomenon as follows:

13 "Littering was reported more frequently in instances when the person was in a hurry, no trash

14 can was nearby, the item was biodegradable, there was a sense that someone else would pick it

15 up, and when the item was not recyclable.™21 In other words, people may wrongly think that

16 littering paper or compostable products is benign, so they are more likely to litter those products
17 than polystyrene foam. The government agency tasked with increasing recycling in California

18 has acknowledged this same effect.22

19 50. Thus, the ban will not be effective in reducing litter or trash. But more than that,

3 that they may wrongly believe are environmentally benign.

4 51. This evidence was submitted to the City before the ban, but the City simply

5 ignored it. The City made no attempt to analyze the Ordinance's potential impact of additional

6 trash and littering. The City did not even acknowledge this potential impact--despite the ample
7 technical support for it, including from state agencies charged with protecting California's
8 environment. This impact is potentially significant, and the City must analyze it in an
9 environmental impact report.

10 C. The ban will increase GHG emissions and San Diego is particularly

11 vulnerable to climate change.

12 52. The public submitted technical reports and evidence showing that a ban may

13 increase greenhouse gas emissions. But instead of analyzing this potentially significant impact

14 in an environmental impact report, the City ignored the evidence of this potentially significant

15 impact.

15 57. Due to the serious risk of sea level rise within the City of San Diego, the City's
16 2008 General Plan includes provisions requiring setbacks from the coast in areas subject to sea
17 level rise. 32
18 58. Despite these risks and the City's seemingly serious commitment to fighting
19 climate change, the City adopted the ban on polystyrene foam, which is likely to increase
20 greenhouse gas emissions because substitutes for polystyrene foam food service ware use more
21 energy and water. Specifically, there was evidence before the City when it acted that the life
22 cycle of foam containers generates lower greenhouse gas emissions.33
23 59. Banning polystyrene foam will result in the use of substitute products, some of
24 which have been shown to have a larger GHG emissions footprint. Specifically, polystyrene

4 potential than coated paperboard cups (21% lower even without the insulating sleeve) and 34%

5 lower than solid polylactic acid (PLA) cups.3

6 60. The City of San Diego's ban of polystyrene foam runs directly contrary to the
7 City's own stated concerns about and efforts to reduce GHG emissions. The ban may have

8 significant impacts on the environment and greenhouse gases in particular due to the use of

10 replacement products with greenhouse gas impacts higher to those of foam. The Ordinance must

2 Based on several life-cycle assessments, it is clear that polystyrene food service

3 products consume less energy and water and generate less greenhouse gases in production and
transport than their substitutes.38

4 64.

5 Alternatives to foam are associated with increased energy consumption. The life

6 cycle of foam containers consumes less energy than that of alternative products. 39 For example,

7 studies have found that foam plates have significantly lower total energy requirements than

8 coated paperboard alternatives,4° and that foam containers use significantly less energy than

9 paper-based or corn-based alternatives, primarily due to polystyrene's much lower weight.41

5 recognized reducing greenhouse gases as an important State and City goal.49

papermaking process demands large amounts of fresh water and produces large quantities of

lignin, cellulosic compounds, phenols, mercaptans, sulfides, and chlorinated compounds. 51

10 These chemicals end up in aquatic ecosystems in part because many wastewater treatment plants

11 do not filter out the chemicals completely.52 The chemicals have toxic effects on marine life and

12 species. 53

13 67. Alternatives to foam are associated with increased water use. The life cycle of

14 foam containers consumes less water due to the paper making process demanding large amounts

15 of fresh water and producing large quantities of wastewater. 54 For example, polystyrene

16 clamshells use up to four times less water to produce than PLA clamshells.5 California is

Production of common plastic substitutes to EPS- -polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and
in polypropylene (PP)-result in greater particulate emissions (PM10) compared to EPS on a "per-

6 cup" basis 58 PET production results in up to five times the particulate emissions of EPS on a
"per-cup" basis.59 Particles can be carried over long distances by wind; when they settle on

8 water or land, they cause water acidity, upset water nutrient balance, deplete soil of nutrients,

3 Paper-based product manufacturing impacts forests and other biological resources, and increases

4 GHG emissions through increased harvesting, which could be significant. 66 Demand for wood

5 products such as paper is major cause of damage to tropical forests, and that demand is

6 expected to increase over the next half century.67

7 72. Alternatives to foam are associated with increases in the amount of material sent

8 to landfilling facilities. EPS is almost 95% air; it generates less solid waste both in weight and
volume than other comparable alternative products.68 The U.S. is in the midst of a garbage

10 crisis; some recycling facilities are so full they have stopped sorting through plastic and paper

11 altogether and are sending it all to landfill.09 Moreover, compostable food products are not

12 recyclable in the City of San Diego,7 and PLA materials cannot be recycled and will

14 73. Alternatives to foam are associated with impacts on the marine environment. For

15 example, expanded polystyrene foam is a much smaller contributor to litter in marine
16 environments than other materials. 72 Alternative products do not biodegrade in marine
17 environments. Almost all biodegradable plastics are designed to break down in soil, not water.

18 Hence, issues similar to conventional plastics can be anticipated for biodegradable plastics.73

- Polystyrene foam is not a major contributor to plastic debris in the ocean.74 Studies do not show

2 foam to be a hazard to marine life.75

74. To take one example of increased impacts caused by alternatives to foam, a

4 common alternative to a foam cup, a Polyethylene Coated Paper cup with a corrugated sleeve, is
associated with greater energy use, higher solid weight, higher solid waste volume, greater water

6 emissions, and greater GHG emissions than a foam cup.76

7 75. The ban by San Diego of EPS is not analogous to the ban of plastic bags by the
8 City of Manhattan Beach. First, as noted by Dr. Mark Grey, plastic bag bans are not a good

9 analogue for polystyrene foam bans. There are readily available reusable substitutes for plastic
10 bags, but there are not readily available reusable substitutes for polystyrene foam food

11 containers. Moreover, the negative environmental effects of a polystyrene ban in San Diego will

12 have & much greater environmental impact than a ban in a much smaller city. Environmental

13 impacts of a polystyrene ban correlate with the size of the region in which it is implemented.77

14 San Diego is the eighth most populous city in the United States, with a population of
15 approximately 1.4 million, 40 times larger than Manhattan Beach, a land area 93 times larger
16 than Manhattan Beach, and a coastline over 20 times longer.78

17 76. Retail sales and sales from accommodation and food service in the City of San
18 Diego are 23 times those of Manhattan Beach, and waste disposal rates are 42 times greater.79 In
19 effect, a much larger amount of disposable products such as shopping bags and food containers

20 are used and disposed of (or littered) in San Diego.80 The environmental impacts of an EPS ban

21 in San Diego are significant given its size and footprint.

13 E. The ban will harm San Diego's vulnerable homeless population and put

14 public health at risk: the City must analyze these potential impacts in an

15 environmental impact report.

16 77. Evidence was submitted to the City showing that the Ordinance will hurt San
17 Diego's homeless population by increasing the costs for non-profits that serve the homeless

18 community and that it threatens public health by depriving the homeless community of a safe,

19 sanitary means to keep their food safe for consumption. Instead of analyzing these impacts in an
20 environmental impact report, the City simply ignored them.

21 78. San Diego has the fourth-largest homeless population in the United States, with

22 8,576 homeless in 2018 as reported by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
23 Development.&1 San Diego has the second most homeless veterans of any City in the United

24 States- 1,312 homeless veterans. 82 The City also has 876 "unaccompanied homeless youth,"

and 78.8 percent of these homeless children are what HUD defines as "unsheltered."83 This
means they live and sleep on the street or in other locations not suitable for human habitation 84

79. San Diego lacks sufficient resources to meet the needs of its homeless population.
For example, a recent press report recounts that San Diego's shelters are falling short of goals in
finding permanent housing for the homeless.85 The strain on is resources is becoming more acute

6 in recent months as the federal government releases asylum seekers and immigrants on to the
streets with no resources. According to press reports, "Federal authorities have released

8 thousands of migrant families in San Diego over the past two months, sometimes straight into the
streets and otherwise leaving them to find their way as they await asylum proceedings."86 The

10 same press account says that the City has said they are willing to help, but that so far this offer

11 has been just talk: "The [C]ity and [C]ountry both said they are willing to step in and do what

12 they can, but so far it's mostly remained at the conversation level."787 As such, "the burden of
13 providing the shelter continues to remain on the nonprofits....»88

14 80. The crisis of homelessness also threatens public health. It is reported that
15 "Service providers and state officials say the finger-pointing, the punting of responsibility and
16 resulting inaction has reminded them of the bureaucratic stumbling over hepatitis A last year."89

2 500 people and killed 20.90 In a report regarding the hepatitis A outbreak, the County of San

3 Diego notes that hepatitis A is commonly spread through contaminated food:91

4 HAV [hepatitis A] can be spread two ways: person-to-person via the fecal-oral route or through exposure to contaminated food or water.

5 Person-to-person transmission via the fecal-oral route occurs when an uninfected person takes in the virus by mouth due to contact with

6 objects (such as drug paraphernalia or cigarettes), food, or drinks that have been contaminated with feces from an infected person.

7 82. Numerous people, including public health workers and homeless people
8 themselves, concluded that one reason for the City's hepatitis A outbreak was the City's ban of

10 plastic bags.92 Homeless people are known to use plastic bags to dispose of human waste, and

11 by banning plastic bags, the City eliminated an important tool for homeless people to protect

12 their health.93 Said one homeless man: "The plastic bag ban is the main reason for the hepatitis

13 outbreak. The hepatitis outbreak was completely predictable-it's why left San Diego."94

83. Similarly, the polystyrene foam food containers that the City banned are a safe,
14 hygienic way of keeping food clean and healthy. The Acheson Groupnationally recognized
15

16 experts in food safety-authored a report warning of the consequence of banning foam:95

17 Paper-based single-use food-service materials are more porous than foam. As a result, bacteria are more likely to become trapped and to

18 grow in paper-based food-service materials than in foam food- service materials. In addition, foam has superior insulating

19 properties, which can retard the growth of bacteria by keeping food

appropriately hot or cold. Because of foam's lesser porousness and

2 better insulating qualities, it offers greater protection against foodborne illness and communicable diseases than alternative single-use food-service products.

84. Ramboll, another nationally recognized scientific and environmental consultant
4 concluded that the superior safety of foam for storing food is particularly important for homeless
5 people, and for avoiding foodborne illness:%6
6

7 An EPS ban could also have significant impacts regarding public health.. This is important to consider for homeless individuals,

8 who use (and often reuse) disposable containers for food storage. For those without reliable access to a refrigerator, longer-term storage in containers better suited for controlling bacterial growth is
9 a safer from a public health standpoint as it may result in reduced instances of foodborne illness.
10 85. The City's ban of polystyrene foam directly harms our most vulnerable
11 including homeless children, homeless veterans, and homeless immigrants and asylum seekers in
12 at least two ways.
13 86. First, the ban will deprive vulnerable populations of a safe, sanitary means of
14 handling food. As Ramboll, the nationally recognized scientific and environmental expert,
15 cautioned the City, "An EPS ban could also have significant impacts regarding public health."97
16 The Ordinance deprives homeless people of an important tool for hygiene and to keep
17 themselves free of foodborne disease. But the Ordinance did not make any provision for
18 mitigating the potential public health effects on the homeless. For example, the Ordinance did
19 not study potentially providing homeless people with food-storage facilities, since the ban is
20 depriving them of one option for safe storage of food. In fact, the City simply ignored the public
21 comments pointing out that it is potentially endangering public health by enacting the ban.
22 87. Second, the ban forces non-profits that work with these vulnerable populations to
23 purchase more expensive alternatives to foam. Resources for our most vulnerable populations
24 are short, and every penny counts. The Ordinance does not have a provision to reimburse
25 nonprofits for the added cost of purchasing more expensive substitutes for polystyrene foam. So

1 by forcing them to purchase more expensive products, the ban takes money from nonprofits

2 helping homeless veterans, homeless children, homeless immigrants, and other vulnerable

3 populations. This is not a theoretical concern-there are shelters in the City that will have fewer

4 resources to serve homeless veterans, homeless children, impoverished asylum seekers, and other
5 vulnerable populations as a direct result of the Ordinance. During the administrative proceedings

6 on the Ordinance, the commenters made the City aware that passing the Ordinance would result

7 In fewer meals served to the homeless. As one report submitted to the City stated:98

8 Based on interviews with local homeless shelters in San Diego made

Q by Ramboll in late 2018, some shelters utilize disposable food containers made from EPS. One representative in charge of
10 coordinating meals at a local shelter revealed that they rely on EPS foodware items to serve thousands of meals per week. The
11 representative indicated that if EPS were banned, this shelter's costs would increase significantly due to the need to purchase foodware
12 items made from alternative materials other than EPS. According to the representative, these substitute items likely cost twice as much
13 as EPS, if not more. Thus, the Proposed Ban would likely result in a diversion of funds from food served at this shelter to the containers

14 used to store it, which would likely result in fewer meals served, based on the same available funding.

15 88. Despite this plea, the City approved the ban without any mechanism to reimburse
16 nonprofits for their increased costs or any other mechanism to mitigate the ban's harm to
17 homeless children, veterans, immigrants, and other vulnerable populations.

18 89. In sum, the ban may have significant impacts on public health in general and on

19 the health of San Diego's most vulnerable populations specificallyincluding homeless

20 veterans, homeless children, and homeless immigrants. The City must analyze these impacts in

21 an environmental impact report under CEQA before considering the ban.

22 F. Polystyrene foam is recyclable but many substitute products are not, so the

23 ban will undermine San Diego's recycling goals.

24 90. Ample evidence was submitted to the City showing that foam is recyclable, and
25 that many substitutes for foam are not recyclable. But the City simply ignored the evidence that
26 the ban may have significant environmental impacts regarding undermining recycling-

I including the State of California's recycling goals and the City's own recycling goals.

2 91. Recycling is a statewide priority for California. CalRecycle's website explains:
3 "Through landmark initiatives like the Integrated Waste Management Act and Beverage

4 Container Recycling and Litter Reduction Act, California works toward a society that uses less,

5 recycles more, and takes resource conservation to higher and higher levels. Our state leads the

6 nation with an approximate 65 percent diversion rate for all materials, and today recycling

7 supports more than 140,000 green jobs in California."99

8 92. In 2011, the California Legislature adopted Assembly Bill 341, which set a policy

Q goal for the state that not less than 75 percent of solid waste generated be source reduced,

10 recycled, or composted by the year 2020.100 CalRecycle's 2015 report to the Legislature on

11 Assembly Bill 341 makes clear that recycling has been at the center of California's success in

12 reducing waste: 101

13 In moving away from its historically disposal-dominated approach

14 to waste management, California developed an infrastructure for collection, sorting, and preliminary processing of recyclable

15 materials in order to meet the state's statutory recycling and diversion directives. This was accomplished with the hard work and

16 dedication of all of our partners including local jurisdictions, the waste and recycling industry, and an enlightened public that
17 embraced the new programs and changed its behavior.

18 The report also states that California has long way to go to reach the 75% goal- as a state we

19 need to increase source reduction, composting, and recycling from about 37 million tons to about

20 60 million tons per year.' 102 One of the key strategies CalRecycle identifies in its 2015 report to

21 the Legislature on Assembly Bill 341 is expanding California's current recycling and

22 manufacturing infrastructure. 103 Notably, nowhere does the report recommend banning

recyclable material like polystyrene foam to increase California's recycling rate.

93. The City of San Diego has adopted an aggressive Zero Waste Plan, which calls
for increased recycling and ultimately for the City to reach zero waste. 104 The Zero Waste Plan
explains the principle of using discarded materials as a valuable commodity:105

5 Zero Waste is a principle that calls for handling discarded materials

6 as commodities for reuse rather than for disposal, and conserving those commodities through waste prevention, recycling, composting, and other technologies. This "discards" management system emphasizes commodities can flow full circle focusing on

8 conservation during the total life cycle of materials from product design, collection, and processing to the marketing of new products
9 made from the material.

10 94. The City's Zero Waste Plan sets a goal of 75% diversion of waste from landfills

11 by 2020, 90% diversion by 2035, and 100% diversion (zero waste) by 2040.106 The City

12 acknowledges that it has a long way to go to achieve these goals, and that even to "increase the
13 City's waste diversion rate to 75% will require an estimated additional 332,000 tons per year to

14 be diverted from landfill disposal."107 Nowhere does the City's Zero Waste Plan recommend

15 banning recyclable material like polystyrene foam to increase San Diego's recycling rate.

16 95. Polystyrene foam is recyclable.108 And polystyrene foam used for food service

17 specifically is recyclable. As the City is well aware, recycling foam is feasible, and the City is

18 already recycling foam, including foam used for foodservice. An expert report submitted to the

19 City explains that newer technology in materials recovery facilities has enabled increased

20 recycling of foam:109

21 EPS is a recyclable material and has many characteristics that make
22 it an ideal product for foodware (and other) applications. In fact, the

, N City of San Diego has permitted the recycling of certain EPS materials such as packaging material for years and in mid-2017, the City Council voted to expand recycling capabilities to include all EPS foodware products. This ability to recycle a wider range of EPS products is partially attributable to the emergence of new secondary Material Recovery Facilities (MRFs), which make the process more economically viable. These secondary processing facilities accept baled materials that typical MRFs would otherwise landfill and further sort out mixed plastics, polystyrene, and other high-value

6 recyclables that may have escaped the initial MRF sort. By using technological advances in material sorting, such as optical scanners that can accurately identify plastic resins, these secondary MRFs are able to bale solid polystyrene with EPS to achieve an ideal density for the commodity.

9 96. As of the drafting of this Petition, the City's website still shows that foam is

16 97. Not only is it technically feasible to recycle foam, but also there is a market for
17 recycled foam, with both buyers and sellers. As two leading natural resources economists put

18 it-111

19 One key sign that recycling of polystyrene is economically feasible

20 is the existence of a market for recycled PS, with both buyers and
sellers. Buyers exist because recycled polystyrene can be used as an

21 input in manufacturing processes. Companies are currently using recycled PS to produce products such as picture frames, crown

22 molding, baseboards, and flower pots. Regarding sellers, the California Ocean Science Trust report cites several examples. One

23 of the companies mentioned in the report, FP International, is able to recycle about 4 million pounds of polystyrene per year, another saves $80,000 per year by recycling EPS. while

2 that makes them difficult to recycle. "'Most waste management facilities will treat the cups as

3 99. Compostable food products are not recyclable in the City of San Diego. In fact,

5 the Environmental Services Department published a pamphlet advising citizens to stop using

6 compostable products, noting that they "do not biodegrade into compost and eventually end up

7 creating methane gas in the Miramar Landfill" and "...if they are mixed with other recyclables in

8 the blue bin, they can contaminate the quality of plastics when they are made into new
products."113 An excerpt of this City publication is below.

: Stop Using Compostable Products!

11 Compostable products such as containers, utensils, plates and

12 bowls are made out of corn, potatoes, sugarcane, etc. You may think you're doing good

13 thing for the environment by using compostables.
However, in the City's Greenery Program they do not biodegrade

14 into compost and eventually end up creating methane gas in the Miramar Landfill. Also, if they are mixed with other recyclables in

15 the blue bin, they can contaminate the quality of plastics when they

16 are made into new products.
So please place all compostable

17 products in the black trash bin BIODEGRADA
and use reusable plates, cups and

18 silverware whenever possible.

19 100.

20 A more recent pamphlet included a reminder that compostable foodware products

21 must still be disposed of in the regular trash bin. 114 Thus, there is currently no feasible way to
recycle or compost these products in San Diego, some of the very products that will be

in numerous jurisdictions in California, but replacement products often are not, banning foam
will undermine recycling in the City. This potentially conflicts with Assembly Bill 341 and with
the City's own Zero Waste Plan, and the City failed to analyze this potential conflict. By
banning a recyclable material, the Ordinance will cause more waste to be diverted to the land fill,
and it will undermine the City's recycling goals. The City must analyze these potentially

6 significant impacts in an environmental impact report. Instead, in adopting the Ordinance, the
City showed no awareness that products that are likely substitutions for banned foam are not

8 recyclable.

9 102. As jurisdictions ban foam, especially large cities like San Diego, "it will become

10 more difficult and expensive to collect sufficient amounts of used EPS to recycle
11 Il economically."113 In other words, by banning foam instead of recycling it, the City is not just
12 undermining its own recycling efforts-it is potentially making it more difficult for other
13 jurisdictions to recycle foam, because the City's ban undermines the whole industry. This is a

14 potential cumulative impact that was pointed out to the City in the administrative proceedings,

15 but the City failed to analyze it or even acknowledge it. The City must analyze these potentially
16 significant impacts in an environmental impact report.

17 G. By undermining the City's zero waste goals, the City's ban also undermines

18 the City's Climate Action Plan.

19 103. The City's polystyrene foam ban may also interfere with the City's ability to

20 attain its lauded greenhouse gas emission reduction goals.116 The City of San Diego CAP calls

21 for eliminating half of all greenhouse gas emissions in the City.117 In order to achieve this goal,
22 the CAP outlines a strategy for greenhouse gas reductions and specifies particular action items

23 and steps that must be implemented to achieve state-mandated reduction targets.

- achieving these greenhouse gas reductions is "zero waste."112

2 105. In the CAP, the City explains that implementation of the City's Zero Waste Plan
is key to achieving necessary greenhouse gas

4 reductions 119 One goal in the CAP is to "divert
solid waste and capture landfill methane gas emissions." 120 In order to achieve this goal, the

6 City's CAP sets stringent targets for solid waste diversion. Specifically, "the goal for the City is

7 to achieve a 75 percent waste diversion rate by 2020. The City also has a goal to strive for Zero
Waste disposal by 2040."121

106. According to the City's own 2018 CAP Annual Report, the City has achieved a

10 solid waste diversion rate of only 66 percent. 122 This rate is far below the 75 percent goal that

11 must be achieved by next year in order for the City to stay on track to achieve state-mandated
greenhouse gas reductions.

12 107.

13 Once again, expert evidence of this potential impact was submitted to the City,

14 but the City simply ignored it. The City must prepare an environmental impact report that
analyzes this potential impact.

currently projected to reach capacity and close by 2022.123 One recent report commissioned by

2 the City of San Diego concluded that: 124
The City faces running out of landfill capacity at the [West Miramar
4 Landfili] by 2021. The region is projected to have capacity only until 2025 if the Sycamore Landfill expansion is not approved.
5 These projected dates include the capacity gained from the City's recycling and [construction and demolition] ordinance

6 implementation. If the Sycamore Landfill expansion is approved and diversion continues from implementing the City's recycling and [construction and demolition] ordinances, as well as continued implementation of existing zero waste programs, the region iS projected to have capacity until 2037 at the Sycamore Landfill.

110. The City of San Diego continues to go to great lengths to research and analyze

10 how to extend the life of and maximize the capacity of the Miramar Landfill, 125 including

11 through implementation of the City's Zero Waste Plan discussed above.

12 111. Despite the City's constrained landfill capacity, the City adopted a ban in the face

13 of evidence in the Ramboll Report that it could generate more waste that would need to be
14 landfilled.

15 112. Specifically, as the report stated, "[o]ften when a hot beverage is served inside a

16 paper cup, an additional layer of insulation such as a sleeve or another cup is used to make the
17 beverage safe or comfortable to hold. This generates more waste compared to simply using one

18 EPS [foam] cup. Given the size of the San Diego market, this could cause a significant increase

19 in trash and litter in San Diego."

20 113. In addition, analyses in the record found that substitutes for polystyrene foam

21 food service ware increases the amount of material sent to recycling and landfilling facilities-

114. As the City's Ordinance forces consumers to purchase, use, and dispose of
2 substitute products, the City is placing increased pressure on its already constrained landfills.
Replacement products that are not 95% air will not compress down in a landfill the way
polystyrene products will. These replacement products, therefore, have the potential to take up
more space in the City's already dwindling landfill capacity.

115. The City has spent a tremendous amount of time and government resources

7 attempting to solve its landfill capacity problem. And yet, the City is carelessly undermining its
own zero waste goals and landfill planning processes by increasing the amount of waste that will
be disposed of and the amount of space that waste will take up in a landfill. This is a potential
10 environmental impact that was raised with the City during its administrative proceedings and it

11 has not been addressed. The City must analyze this potentially significant impact in an

12 environmental impact report.

13 I. The ban may cause significant impacts on the marine environment; the City

14 must analyze this potential impact in an environmental impact report.

15 116. Evidence submitted to the City showed that the ban may have significant impacts

16 on the marine environment. But as with evidence of other impacts, the City simply ignored

17 evidence of potential impacts to the marine environment. The City must study potential impacts

18 to the ocean and to the marine environment in an environmental impact report.

19 117. Polystyrene foam is not a hazard for marine animals. "[N]o available studies have
20 specifically shown polystyrene foam to be either an entanglement or ingestion hazard in the

21 marine environment."127

22 118. As discussed above, the ban will not reduce litter or trash, and it is likely even to

23 increase litter and trash. And the substitute products will have greater impacts related to
24 greenhouse gas emissions, energy use, water quality, air emissions, deforestation, and other
25 impacts. Thus, a ban will not help the marine environment, but it will hurt the marine
26 environment by forcing substitution of products with greater impacts. Dr. Angelique White,

Associate Professor of Ocean Ecology and Biogeochemistry at Oregon State University, puts this

2 unfortunate result of bans as follows:128 "In the case of polystyrene foam, there is little to no

3 existing data for deleterious impacts of this specific product on marine organisms; there is the

4 likelihood that substituted products may have similar litter rates and more significantly, product
substitutions may lead to enhanced greenhouse gas production that continue to threaten our

6 ocean resources."

119. Instead of analyzing the ban's potential impacts on the marine environment, the

8 City failed to analyze, or even acknowledge, potential impacts of the ban on these resources.

q The City must analyze these potential impacts in an environmental impact report.

10 J. The City needs to evaluate mitigation measures and alternatives in an

11 environmental impact report.

12 120. The City failed to propose and analyze mitigation measures for the significant

13 impacts caused by an expanded polystyrene ban. Dart Container Corporation's October 15, 2018

14 letter includes recommended mitigation measures that are both feasible and enforceable,
15 including the following: (i) requiring the City to offset the increased carbon emissions due to the

16 ban; (ii) requiring the City to purchase renewable energy credits for the increased energy use that

17 ban will cause; and (iii) requiring the City to conduct restoration projects to compensate for the

18 increased water use and pollutant discharges that a ban will cause.

19 121. The City failed to propose and analyze alternatives that would avoid or reduce the
20 environmental impacts of the ban. The opportunity costs of a polystyrene ban are high due to the

21 fact that "[p]olystyrene bans are expensive."129 A polystyrene ban requires funds that could

22 otherwise be used by the City for trash reduction methods that are demonstrably effective,

23 including structural best management practices, the use of full capture devices, education, litter

24 cleanup programs, street and storm drain cleanups, and river and shoreline cleanups. 130 Since

] polystyrene can be recycled, promoting recycling is likely to be far more effective than a ban. 131

2 122. One alternative that the City should analyze in a full environmental impact report

3 is a public-private partnership to upgrade and further develop the City's recycling program.

4 ACC offered to enter into such a public-private partnership with the City.

5 123. ACC made its offer of a public-private partnership to the City in writing on

6 October 11, 2018.132 ACC's proposal is designed to meet the following goals: "establish a

7 sustained, efficient and economical polystyrene recycling program for the City of San Diego that

8 a) utilizes best available recovery technology, likely predicated upon proactive optical sorting,

Q b) accesses developed and developing markets, and c) is well supported technically and
10 administratively by its industry partners to achieve ongoing effectiveness."133

11 124. ACC's proposal had four key elements to ensure the further expansion of
12 polystyrene foam recycling:

13 Bridge support funding. ACC's proposal included funding intended to defray the

14 City's cost of polystyrene recycling while the program is implemented.

15 Technical support. ACC's proposal included funding of technical resources to

16 support the strongest possible implementation of the polystyrene recycling

17 system.

18 Funding for best available technology. ACC's proposal included funding for

19 technology to help processing polystyrene foam for recycling.

20 Ongoing market development support. ACC's proposal included a commitment

21 to help the City find, evaluate, and support markets for the recycled polystyrene

22 material.

23 ACC proposed to invest $1,970,000 in this public-private partnership to support polystyrene

foam recycling.134

2 125. Instead of working with stakeholders to further expand recycling of polystyrene

3 foam, the City chose to adopt the Ordinance, which bans this recyclable product and will have

4 the impacts described above. The City did not analyze or study whether increasing recycling

5 would be better for the environment than adopting a ban of polystyrene foam that may have

6 significant environmental impacts. The Court should require the City to prepare a full
environmental impact report before considering a ban. And the alternatives analysis should
include the alternative of expanding recycling, including via a public-private partnership.

9 V. CAUSES OF ACTION

10 126. Based on the allegations herein, the following causes of action are alleged.

11 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

12 (Violations of CEQA)

13 127. The foregoing allegations are incorporated by reference.

14 128. The Legislature enacted CEQA to ensure that government agencies incorporate

15 the goal of long-term protection of the environment into their decisions that may affect the
16 environment. CEQA applies to any discretionary action taken by an agency that may cause a
17 reasonably foreseeable change in the environment.

18 129. Because categorical exemptions like the Class 8 exemption and the common

19 sense exemption excuse environmental review under CEQA, they are narrowly construed. The
20 burden of showing an exemption applies is on the agency-in this case, the City.
21 130. The City violated CEQA by relying on exemptions to adopt the Ordinance. The

22 City failed to meet its burden of showing that the Class 8 exemption or the common sense

23 exemption apply. Evidence submitted by Petitioner Dart and others showed that the Ordinance

24 may have significant environmental impacts.

25 131. The Class 8 exemption does not apply to the Ordinance, because even though the

26 Ordinance is intended to address one set of environmental issues, the evidence in the record

27

I shows the Ordinance may cause other environmental impacts. In other words, even a "new

2 regulation that strengthens some environmental requirements may not be entitled to an

3 exemption if the new requirements could result in other potentially significant effects."
4 California Unions for Reliable Energy v. Mojave Desert Air Quality Management Dist. (2009)

5 178 Cal. App. 4th 1225, 1240-1247 [rejecting use of Class 8 exemption for air district rule where

6 there was evidence that rule could lead to increased paving]. Here, the evidence in the record, at

7 a minimum, shows the Ordinance will not improve environmental conditions across the board;

8 rather, it will cause people to use more substitute products that have greater environmental
impacts. Thus, the Class 8 exemption does not apply.

10 132. The common sense exemption also does not apply. That exemption applies only

11 if "it can be seen with certainty that there is no possibility that the activity in question may have

12 a significant effect on the environment...." 14 Cal. Code Regs., § 15061(b)(3). Here, mountains

13 of uncontroverted evidence in the record shows that the Ordinance may have significant
14 environmental impacts.

15 133. Even if the City had shown that the Ordinance fits within 8 the Class 8 categorical
16 exemption or the common sense exemption (which it did not), there is substantial evidence in the

17 record showing that exceptions to the exemptions apply. is There is substantial evidence in the

18 record showing that "there is a reasonable possibility" that the Ordinance "will have a significant

19 effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances." Cal. Code Regs., § 15300.2(c). Those

20 unusual circumstances include the fact that an agency would typically ban a product only when

21 alternative products have fewer impacts. The Ordinance is unusual in that the City has chosen to

22 ban product-polystyrene foam-that has superior environmental attributes to alternative
23 products. It is also an unusual circumstance for the City to adopt a ban in the face of findings by

24 the state agencies with primary jurisdiction over water quality, recycling, and waste that bans are

25 ineffective or bad public policy.

26 134. Independently, the cumulative impact exception applies here such that the City

27 may not rely on a Class 8 exemption. The CEQA Guidelines provide that exemptions "are
28 inapplicable when the cumulative impact of successive projects of the same type in the same

LATHAM•WATKINS… US-DOCS\105681742 VERIFIED PETTTION FOR WRIT OI
ATTORNEYS AT LAW
SAN DIEGO 41 AND COMPLAINT FOR INJU DECLARATOR

place, over time is significant." Cal. Code Regs., § 15300.2(b). The evidence in the record

2 shows that polystyrene foam bans will have significant cumulative effect on the environment.
3 Approximately 117 jurisdictions in California have banned the distribution and sale of
4 polystyrene. When analyzed together, substituting polystyrene foam for its alternatives due to

5 this ban in conjunction with others results in significantly increased energy consumption, greater

6 GHG emissions, decreased water quality, increased marine litter, increased water use, increased
7 particulate emissions, increased VOC emissions, increased criteria air pollutant emissions,

8 increased forest products consumption, and increased material sent to recycling and landfilling

Q facilities.

10 135. As a result of the foregoing defects, the City prejudicially abused its discretion by

11 relying on exemptions for CEQA compliance for the Ordinance. As such, the Ordinance must be

12 set aside until the City complies with CEQA and prepares an environmental impact report.

13 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

14 (Declaratory Relief)

15 136. The foregoing allegations are incorporated by reference.

16 137. An actual controversy exists between Petitioners and Plaintiffs on the one hand,

17 and the City on the other, involving substantial questions regarding the City's compliance with

18 CEQA.

19 138. Accordingly, Petitioners and Plaintiffs seek a declaration of the rights of the

20 public and the obligations of the City under CEQA.

21 139. Such a declaration is a necessary and proper exercise of the Court's power at this
22 time and, under the circumstances, in order to prevent further actions by the City in violation of

23 law.

26 Ordinance violates CEQA as alleged herein;
