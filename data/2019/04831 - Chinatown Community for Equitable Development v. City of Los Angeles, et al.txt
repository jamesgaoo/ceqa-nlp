INTRODUCTION
1.
2 This action challenges and seeks to enjoin the City of Los Angeles, Los Angeles City

3 Council ("City Council") and Los Angeles Department of City Planning ("Planning" or collectively
"Respondents" or "City") action on March 22, 2019 and all subsequent actions certifying an
4 environmental impact report ("EIR") for land use entitlements including amending the City's General
5 Plan to change the land use designation for the Project Site from Hybrid Industrial to Regional Center
6 Commercial within the Central City North Community Plan (*Community Plan"), amending the Generall
7 Plan Generalized Land Use Map for the Community Plan area to reflect the Regional Center

8 Commercial land use designation, a Zone and Height District Change from UC(CA) to (T)(Q)(C2-2, a

9 vesting tentative tract map and other associated entitlements including a Master Conditional Use permit

10 for the sale and dispensing of alcoholic beverages and a site plan review ("Land Use Entitlements") for

11 the "College Station Project," a proposed mixed-use development that proposes to build 725 residential

12 apartment units and 51,600 square feet of retail, restaurant, and other commercial space (618,580 square
feet of total building floor area) ("Project") a on a 4.92-acre site located at 129-135 West College Street /
13 924 North Spring Street ("Project Site").
14 2. In approving the Project, the City violated the California Environmental Quality Act
15 ("CEQA"), Cal. Public Resources Code §§ 21000, et seq ("CEQA"), the Subdivision Map Act,

16 Government Code §§ 66410, et seq ("Subdivision Map Act"), the City's General Plan, City Charter and

17 the Los Angeles Municipal Code.

18 PARTIES

3.
19 Petitioner CHINATOWN COMMUNITY FOR EQUITABLE DEVELOPMENT, an

20 unincorporated association ("CCED" or "Petitioner"), is a grassroots non-profit organization based in

21 |Los Angeles Chinatown that seeks to build grassroots power through organizing, education, and mutual
help. CCED's mission is to advocate on behalf of low-income and immigrant communities for tenant
22 rights, quality affordable housing, and socioeconomic equity. CCED's members include residents of
23 Chinatown and Lincoln Heights, particularly low-income renters and workers that make up the majority
24 of the Chinatown community.

25 4. Defendant and Respondent CITY OF LOS ANGELES is a California charter city located

26 in the County of Los Angeles, California. The Project is within the jurisdictional limits of the City.

27 5. Defendant and Respondent LOS ANGELES CITY COUNCIL is the elected governing

28 body of the City and is the body responsible for the decision being challenged herein.
6. Defendant and Respondent LOS ANGELES DEPARTMENT OF CITY PLANNING is

1 an agency of the City responsible for developing, applying and enforcing state and local land-use and

2 zoning laws within the jurisdictional limits of the City.
7.
3 Defendants and Respondents DOES - 10 are entities which the true names, capacities,
corporate, associate are unknown to Petitioner at this time who, therefore, sues said Respondents by
4 fictitious names. Petitioner will amend this Petition to show the true names and capacities when
5 ascertained.

6 8. Real Party in Interest ATLAS CAPITAL GROUP, LLC, a California limited liability

7 company ("ATLAS" or "Real Party") is the owner of the Project Site and is the applicant to the City for

8 the Project's General Plan amendments, vesting tentative tract map and other associated entitlements.

9 9. Real Parties in Interest ROES 1 - 10 are entities which the true names, capacities,

10 corporate, associate are unknown to Petitioner at this time who, therefore, sues said Real Parties in

11 Interest by fictitious names. Petitioner will amend this Petition to show the true names and capacities
when ascertained.
12 JURISDICTION AND VENUE
13 10. Pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 and section 1085 and
14 Public Resources Code sections 21168, 21168.5 and 21168.9, this Court has jurisdiction to issue a writ
15 of mandate to set aside Respondents' decision to certify the EIR and purported approval of the Project.
16 11. Venue is proper in this Court because the Project lies entirely within the County of Los

17 Angeles and the environmental impacts of the Project will be acutely felt in this County. The cause

18 alleged in this Petition, or some part of that cause, arise in this county. (CCP § 393; Cal. State Parks

19 Foundation v. Super. Ct. (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 826.) Venue is also proper in this Court pursuant to

20 Code of Civil Procedure Sections 394 (actions against a city, county or local agency), and 395 (actions

21 generally), since the City of Los Angeles is in the County of Los Angeles.
12. This petition is timely filed within 30 days after Respondents' decision to issue a Notice
22 of Determination in accordance with Public Resources Code sections 21167(a).
23 13. Petitioner has provided written notice of their intention to file this petition to
24 Respondents in compliance with Public Resources Code section 21167.5, and are including the notice

25 and proof of service as Exhibit A.

26 14. Petitioner has concurrently filed a notice a of their election to prepare the record of

27 administrative proceedings relating to this action, in compliance with Public Resources Code Section

28 21167.6 or other applicable laws, and are including the notice of this election as Exhibit B.

-3-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

15. Petitioner has performed any and all conditions precedent to filing this instant action and

2 have exhausted administrative remedies to the extent required by law under Public Resources Code

3 section 21177. Petitioner and/or other agencies and individuals raised each of the legal deficiencies
asserted in this petition orally or in writing during the Respondents' decision-making process.
4 16. The violations by Respondents as alleged herein have affected the beneficial interests of
Petitioner and/or their supporting members. The relief sought by way of this Petition will redress this
6 beneficial interest and the likelihood of future injury and interference with Petitioner's interests, and
7 those of its supporting members.

8 17. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law unless

9 this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to set aside its certification of the

10 Project and environmental documents. In the absence of such remedies, Respondents' decisions will

11 remain in effect in violation of state law and injurious to Petitioner.
STATUTORY FRAMEWORK
12 California Environmental Quality Act
13 18. Passed in 1970 as a state counterpart to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA),
14 the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) requires state and local agencies to identify the
15 potentially significant environmental impacts of their actions, and then to avoid or mitigate those
16 impacts if feasible.

17 19. CEQA requires that an agency analyze the potential environmental impacts of its

18 proposed actions in an environmental impact report (except in certain limited circumstances). See, e.g.,

19 Cal. Pub. Res. Code ("PRC") § 21100, et seq. The EIR is the very heart of CEQA. Dunn-Edwards v.

20 BAAQMD (1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 644, 652. "The 'foremost principle' in interpreting CEQA is that the
Legislature intended the act to be read so as to afford the fullest possible protection to the environment
21 within the reasonable scope of the statutory language." Cmtys. for a Better Env't v. Cal. Resources
22 Agency (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 98, 109.
23 20. CEQA has two primary purposes. First, CEQA is designed to inform decision makers
24 and the public about the potential, significant environmental effects of a project. 14 Cal. Code Reg.

25 ("CCR") § 15002(a)(1).) "Its purpose is to inform the public and its responsible officials of the

26 environmental consequences of their decisions before they are made. Thus, the EIR *protects not only

27 the environment but also informed self-government.'" Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Bd. of Supervisors

28 (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 564. The EIR has been described as "an environmental 'alarm bell' whose
purpose it is to alert the public and its responsible officials to environmental changes before they have
-4-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 reached ecological points of no return." Berkeley Keep Jets Over the Bay v. Bd. of Port Comrs. (2001)

2 91 Cal.App.4th 1344, 1354 ("Berkeley Jets").
21.
3 Second, CEQA requires public agencies to avoid or reduce environmental damage when
"feasible" by requiring "environmentally superior" alternatives and all feasible mitigation measures. 14
4 § CCR § 15002(a)(2) and (3); Citizens of Goleta Valley, supra, 52 Cal.3d at 564. The EIR serves to
5 provide agencies and the public with information about the environmental impacts of a proposed project
6 and to "identify ways that environmental damage can be avoided or significantly reduced." 14 CCR §
7 15002(a)(2).

8 22. The required CEQA environmental review involves both substantive and procedural

9 steps. Public participation plays an important and protected role in the CEQA process. Laurel Heights

10 Improvement Association v. Regents of the University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 392 ("The

11 EIR process protects not only the environment but also informed self government."); Concerned
Citizens of Costa Mesa, Inc. v. 32nd District Agricultural Association (1986) 42 Cal.3d 929, 936
12 (members of the public have a "privileged position" in the CEQA process). "Each public agency should
13 include provisions in its CEQA procedures for wide public involvement, formal and informal, consistentl
14 with its existing activities and procedures, in order to receive and evaluate public reactions to
15 environmental issues related to the agency's activities." 14 Cal. Code of Regulations ("CCR") § 15201.
16 The lead agency must consider all a "comments it receives on a draft environmental impact report,

17 proposed negative declaration, or proposed mitigated declaration." PRC, § 21091(d)(1); 14 CCR §

18 15074(b).
23.
19 Procedurally, a lead agency may not approve a project until the public has been given a

20 full and adequate opportunity to participate and comment on the project.
24. CEQA also disallows approval of a project that fails to comply with other laws. A lead
21 agency may not approve a project with significant unavoidable impacts unless it is "otherwise
22 permissible under applicable laws and regulations." PRC §21002.1(c).
23 25. An action alleging that a public agency is "carrying out or has approved a project that
24 may have a significant effect on the environment" without having followed CEQA procedures with a

25 legitimate approval of the project must be commenced within "180 days from the date of the public

26 agency's decision to carry out or approve the project, or, if a project is undertaken without a formal

27 decision by the public agency, within 180 days from the date of commencement of the project." PRC

28 21167(a).
26. Recirculation of an EIR prior to certification, as here, is addressed in PRC § 21092.1, and
-5-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

14 CCR §15088.5. "When significant new information is added to an environmental impact report after

2 notice has been given pursuant to Section 21092 ... but prior to certification, the public agency shall

3 give notice again pursuant to Section 21092 and consult again pursuant to Sections 21104 and 21153
before certifying the environmental impact report." PRC § 21092.1.
4 27. "Significant new information" includes:
5 (1) A new significant environmental impact would result from the project or from a new
6 mitigation measure proposed to be implemented.

7 (2) A substantial increase in the severity of an environmental impact would result...
(3) A feasible project alternative or mitigation measure considerably different from others 8 previously analyzed would clearly lessen the significant environmental impacts of the
9 project...

10 (4) The draft EIR was so fundamentally and basically inadequate and conclusory in nature that meaningful public review and comment were precluded.
11 14 CCR $15088.5; Mountain Lion Coal. v. Fish and Game Comm'n (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 1043

12 28. In Laurel Heights Impr. Assn. v. Reg. of Univ. of Cal. (1993) 6 Cal. 4th 1112, 1130

13 (*Laurel Heights IP'*), the Supreme Court explained that Section 21092 favors EIR recirculation prior to

14 certification. The Court stated:

15 Section 21092.1 was intended to encourage meaningful public comment. [citation omitted] Therefore, new information that demonstrates that an EIR commented upon by
16 the public was so fundamentally and basically inadequate or conclusory in nature that public comment was in effect meaningless triggers recirculation under section 21092.1.
17 [citation omitted]

18 The Subdivision Map Act

19 29. The Subdivision Map Act, Government Code §§ 66410, et seq, ("Subdivision Map Act"

20 or "Act") requires local agencies to review and approve all land subdivisions. The Act regulates both the

21 process for approving subdivisions and sets substantive requirements for approval of land subdivisions.
30. The Act requires that a local agency deny approval of a land subdivision, referred to as a
22 tentative map or a parcel map, if "(a) That the proposed map is not consistent with applicable general
23 and specific plans . (b) That the design or improvement of the proposed subdivision is not consistent
24 with applicable general and specific plans. (c) That the site is not physically suitable for the type of
25 development. (d) That the site is not physically suitable for the proposed density of development. (e)

26 That the design of the subdivision or the proposed improvements are likely to cause substantial

27 environmental damage or substantial and avoidably injure fish or wildlife or their habitat. (f) That the

28 design of the subdivision or type of improvements is likely to cause serious public health problems. (g)
That the design of the subdivision or type of improvements will conflict with easements, acquired by the
-6-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

public at large, for find as part of approving a subdivision map that access through or use of, property

2 within the proposed subdivision."

3 The Planning and Zoning Law
31. The Planning and Zoning Law, Cal. Government Code §§ 65000 et seq ("Planning and
4 Zoning Law") governs the land use planning process for city, county and local government agencies
5 within the State of California.

6 32. The Planning and Zoning Law mandates that cities and counties prepare a General Plan
7 to govern the long term, physical development of the land under city and county jurisdiction addressing

8 the following eight mandatory elements: land use, circulation, housing, conservation, open space, noise,

9 safety and environmental justice. Cal. Government Code §§ 65300, 65302.

10 33. The Planning and Zoning Law requires that "[i]f the approval of development project

11 results in fewer units by income category than identified in the jurisdiction's housing element for that

12 parcel and the jurisdiction does not find that the remaining sites in the housing element are adequate to
accommodate the jurisdiction's share of the regional housing need by income level, the jurisdiction shall
13 within 180 days identify and make available additional adequate sites to accommodate the jurisdiction's
14 share of the regional housing need by income level ..." Cal. Government Code § 65863(c)(2).
15 The City's General Plan Housing Element

16 34. The Housing Element of the City's General Plan sets out a number of objectives and

17 policies for the City concerning affordable housing, including producing "an adequate supply of rental

18 and ownership housing in order to meet current and projected needs" by "[e]xpand[ing] affordable rentall

19 housing for all income groups" as well as "[p]romot[ing] a more equitable distribution of affordable

20 housing opportunities throughout the City" through "policies and incentives to include affordable
housing in residential development, particularly in mixed use development, Transit Oriented Districts
21 and designated Centers" that would "[f]oster the development of new affordable housing units citywide
22 and within each Community Plan area." General Plan Housing Element 2013 - 2021 at p. 6-6, 6-10,
23 35. In particular, the Housing Element requires the City to create "affordable housing
24 requirements for projects that . .. receiv[e] zone changes that result in significantly more units than

25 otherwise permitted . General Plan Housing Element 2013 - 2021 at p. 6-19.

26 The Central City North Community Plan

27 36. Central City North Community Plan ("Community Plan") sets out several objectives

28 including providing for "the preservation of existing housing and for the development of new housing to
meet the diverse economic and physical needs of the existing residents and projected population" and
-7-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

"adequate housing for all persons regardless of income, age, or ethnic background." Community Plan II-

2 2, III-4.
37.
3 In particular the Community Plan requires that the City implement policies to "minimize
displacement of the existing residents by requiring that City decisionmakers "adopt a finding which
4 addresses any potential displacement of residents as part of any decision relating to the construction of
5 new housing .. Community Plan III-4

6 38. Finally, the Community Plan requires that residential and mixed use projects at the
7 Project Site with a Floor Arca Ration of 1.5:1 to 3:1 set aside 20% of their units for affordable housing.

8 Community Plan fn. 12.

9 The City Charter

10 39. The City Charter puts several procedural and substantive limitations on amendments to

11 the City's General Plan.
40.
12 The City Charter requires that any amendment to its General Plan be made by subject
elements, parts of subject elements, or by geographic area provided that the area has significant social,
13 economic or physical identity. City Charter § 555(a).
14 41. The City Charter states that if the City Council initiates a proposed ordinance, order or
15 resolution, the proposed ordinance order or resolution must be referred to the City's Planning
16 Commission (*Planning Commission") to issue a recommendation as to whether the proposed

17 ordinance, order or resolution "will be in conformity with public necessity, convenience, general welfare

18 and good zoning practice. City Charter § 558(d).

19 The Los Angeles Municipal Code's Affordable Housing Requirements (Measure JJJ)
42.
20 The Los Angeles Municipal Code (*Municipal Code" or "LAMC"*) imposes additional

21 affordable housing requirements on projects with ten or more residential dwelling units seeking a
general plan amendment, zone change or height district change resulting in an increase in allowable
22 residential floor area density or height or a residential use where not previously allowed. LAMC §
23 11.5.11.

24 43. Section 11.5.11 subd. (a)(1) of the LAMC requires that rental projects seeking a general
25 plan amendment, zone change or height district change resulting in a residential density increase greater

26 than 35% allocate "no less than 5% of the total units at rents affordable to Extremely Low Income

27 Houscholds, and either 6% of the total units at rents affordable to Very Low Income households or 15%

28 of the total units at rents affordable to Lower Income households."
44. Section 11.5.11 subd. (a)(2) of the LAMC requires that rental projects seeking a general
-8-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

plan amendment, zone change or height district change to allow residential uses where residential uses

2 were not previously allowed allocate "no less than 5% of the total units at rents affordable to Extremely

3 Low Income houscholds, and either 11% of the total units at rents affordable to Very Low Income
households or 20% of the total units at rents affordable to Lower Income households."
4 The Los Angeles Municipal Code as to Conditional Use Permits for Alcohol Sale and Dispensing
5 45. The City's Municipal a Code requires a conditional use permit ("CUP" or "Conditional

6 Use") for the sale or dispensing of alcoholic beverages, including beer and wine. LAMC § 12.24(W).
7 46. The City is required to deny a CUP unless 1) "the project will enhance the built

8 environment in the surrounding neighborhood," 2) "the project's location, size, height, operations and

9 other significant features [are] compatible with and will not adversely affect or further degrade

10 adjacent properties, the surrounding neighborhood, or the public health, welfare and safety" and 3) "the

11 project substantially conforms with the purpose, intent and provisions of the General Plan, the applicable

12 community plan, and any applicable specific plan."
47. In addition , the Municipal Code requires the City to deny a CUP if the sale or dispensing
13 of alcohol will 1) "adversely affect the welfare of the pertinent community,' 2) "result in an undue
14 concentration of premises for the sale or dispensing for consideration of alcoholic beverages, . .. in the
15 area of the City involves, giving consideration to applicable State laws and to the California Department
16 of Alcoholic Beverage Control's guidelines for undue concentration . . ." and 3) will not detrimentally

17 affect nearby residentially zoned communities in the area of the City involved." LAMC §

18 12.24(W)(1)(a).

19. PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL
48.
20 This proceeding involves enforcement of important rights affecting the public interest.
Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will confer a substantial benefit on the public, including
21 citizens, residents, businesses and taxpayers of the City, and will result in the enforcement of important
22 public rights by requiring Respondents to comply with CEQA and other legal requirements applicable to
23 the proposed Project; by voiding the Project approvals and prohibiting Respondents and Real Parties in
24 Interest from taking further actions with respect to the Project until it has complied with those legal

25 requirements; and by prohibiting the Respondents from undertaking any portion of the Project until they

26 have fully complied with these legal requirements

27 49. Petitioner is entitled to recover attorneys' fees as provided in Code of Civil Procedure

28 section 1021.5 if they prevail in this action. The necessity and financial burden of enforcement of these
public rights entitle Petitioner to an award of reasonable attorneys' fees pursuant to that section.

1 STATEMENT OF FACTS
50.
2 On June 7, 2016 the City released an Initial Study as well as Notice of Preparation of an

3 Environmental Impact Report and Public Scoping Meeting for the Project.
51. On June 22, 2016, the City held a Public Scoping Meeting for the Project which members
4 of Petitioner CCED appeared at and spoke out at in opposition to the Project.
5 52. On July 6, 2016, Petitioner CCED submitted written comments on behalf of Chinatown

6 residents and community members to City Planner Sarah Molina Pearson in response to the Initial Study
7 for the Project.

8 53. The Draft EIR for the Project (No. ENV-2012-2055-EIR) was issued in March 2018.

9 The Draft EIR described the Original Project as follows: 770 residential units and up to 51,390 square

10 feet of ground-floor commercial uses, for a total of up to 642,239 square feet of floor area on the 4.92-

11 acre site, with the overall floor-to-area ratio (FAR) of 3:1 ("Original Project").
54.
12 On or about April 30, 2018, Petitioner CCED submitted a comment letter regarding the
Draft EIR. In its letter, Petitioner CCED raised several concerns that the Project (1) will erode the
13 cultural historical fabric of the neighborhood, (2) improperly seeks to be exempted from the affordable
14 housing obligations to meet the needs of the community, (3) does not help meet goals for reducing
15 vehicle traffic and greenhouse gas emissions, and (4) fails to consider alternatives that include
16 affordable housing.

17 55. In August 2018, the City issued the Final EIR for the Project. The Final EIR modified

18 the Project by selecting Refined Alternative 5, with a reduction in the number of residential units to 725

19 units but with the same amount of commercial space, with a total building floor area of 618,580 square

20 feet with an overall FAR of approximately 2.7:1 ("Modified Project" or "Project".)
56. On September 26, 2018, a joint hearing was held by the Hearing Officer on behalf of the
21 Planning Commission and the Deputy Advisory agency regarding the Project. CCED members testified
22 in opposition to the Project.
23 57. On November 6, 2018, the Deputy Advisory Agency approved the Project's Vesting
24 Tentative Tract Map (VTT- 74200), certified the EIR, adopted related environmental findings and a
25 mitigation monitoring program.

26 58. On November 13-16, 2018, the entirety of the Advisory Agency's action was appealed by

27 appellants Southwest Regional Council of Carpenters, Laborer's International Union of North America,

28 Local 300, Coalition of Responsible Equitable Economic Development.
59. On November 30, 2018, the City completed an Errata to the Environmental Impact
-10-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

Report to make corrections and clarifications to the EIR. Some of the corrections that the Errata

2 addressed regarding to the amount of public and private open space, clarified haul route information
