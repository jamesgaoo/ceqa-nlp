First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

1 1. Petitioners and Plaintiffs County of San Joaquin, Central Delta Water Agency,
2 South Delta Water Agency, County of Contra Costa, Contra Costa County Water Agency,

3 County of Solano, County of Yolo, and Local Agencies of the North Delta (collectively,
4 "Plaintiffs") hereby allege as follows:

5 2. This civil action is brought pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act

6 ("CEQA") (Public Resources Code section 21000 et seq.), the California Endangered Species
7 Act ("CESA") (Fish and Game Code section 2050 et seq.), a "fully protected species" provision

8 of the Fish and Game Code (Fish & G. Code, § 3511), the 1959 Delta Protection Act (Wat.

9 Code, § 12200 et seq.), the 1992 Delta Protection Act (Pub. Resources Code, § 29700 et seq.),
10 the Watershed Protection Act (Wat. Code, § 11460 et seq.), the Delta Reform Act of 2009 (Wat.
11 Code 85000 et seq.), and the Public Trust doctrine.

12 3. Plaintiffs herein-four Delta counties and several California water resource

13 management and flood control organizations-challenge Defendant California Department of
14 Water Resources' ("DWR") environmental review and approval of the construction and
15 operations of the California WaterFix, or Delta Tunnels, project (*Project") and the California
16 Department of Fish and Wildlife's ("DFW") approval of a Section 2081 Incidental Take Permit

17 ("Project ITP"). (DWR and DFW are collectively referred to as "Defendants".) Similar to how

18 the State and powerful water districts previously destroyed Owens Lake and the San Joaquin
19 River to support unsustainable growth in Southern California and unsustainable agriculture in
20 naturally arid portions of the San Joaquin Valley, Defendants' Project approvals would
21 devastate the Sacramento River and the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta ("Delta").
22 4. The proposed Project involves the construction of two massive tunnels with an
23 internal diameter of 40 feet, with a capacity of 9,000 cubic feet per second ("cfs") of water to be

24 diverted from the Sacramento River via three new diversions in the northern Delta near

25 Clarksburg. The tunnels would then run 37 miles at about 150 feet below ground surface, to the
26 existing DWR diversion facilities at Clifton Court Forebay, which is near the town of Byron in
27 Contra Costa County. (See Project Overview, attached hereto as Exhibit A.)
28

10
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

5. The Delta already faces interrelated problems of overstressed water supplies,
instream flow deficits, water quality impairments, and degraded aquatic habitats. This Project,

3 if built and operated, would exacerbate those existing problems, worsen the currently good

4 water quality in the north Delta, and drive the nail in the coffin for water quality in the South

5 Delta, among other harms.

6 6. The environmental impacts of the Project were purportedly assessed in joint

7 "Environmental Impact Report/Environmental Impact Statement" ("EIR/S") prepared pursuant

8 to both CEQA and the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 ("NEPA"), 42 U.S.C. section

9 4321 et seq. However, impermissibly narrow project objectives, legally impermissible
10 predetermination with respect to alternatives and a failure to consider alternatives that do not
11 rely on new conveyance, flawed assumptions, wholly missing or inadequate impact analyses, an

12 insufficient and incomplete project description, and ineffective and unenforceable mitigation
13 measures (among other defects) render the EIR/S fatally defective as an informational document
14 under CEQA.

15 7. While DWR purports to have examined thousands of alternatives leading to the 18

16 alternatives included in the EIR/S, by 2007 DWR had already decided that it would aggressively
17 pursue only options that included new diversions (termed "conveyance") on the Sacramento

18 River. Of the 18 alternatives in the EIR/S, only did not include construction of new diversionsl
19 and conveyance facilities. And while initial iterations of the proposal included a commitment to
20 habitat restoration in addition to new conveyance, the lead agencies jettisoned that prior
21 commitment in 2015.

22 8. The Project proposes the most significant transformation of the Delta since the

23 initial construction of the Central Valley Project ("CVP") and State Water Project ("SWP") and
24 pumping facilities in the South Delta, completed respectively in 1961 and 1969. The Project
25 would fundamentally alter the hydrodynamics of the Delta, creating entirely new impacts in the
26 North Delta and significantly worsening conditions in the Central and South Delta. Counties
27 and water agencies, and their partners and constituents, are among the most directly affected
28 entities in the Delta. And the Project would generate ripple effects far beyond the Delta, which

11
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

P

2 are also left undisclosed, unanalyzed and unmitigated by the bloated yet ineffective EIR/S for
the Project.

3 9.

4 As a result of numerous and compounding deficiencies in the EIR/S, the public

5 remains very much in the dark about what the Project actually entails, its environmental impacts,

6 and the efficacy of the mitigation measures proposed by DWR to lessen Project impacts. As

7 such, the fundamental purposes of CEQA have been thwarted. Moreover, in approving the

8 Project, DWR and DFW violated other state laws designed to protect fish and wildlife, the Delta

9 watershed and water supplies, and the public trust. Unless DWR and DFW meet the

10 requirements of CEQA and these other vital safeguards under California law, the Project may
not proceed.

11

12 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

10. This Court has jurisdiction over this action

13 pursuant to sections 1060, 1085, and

14 1094.5 of the California Code of Civil Procedure, and sections 21168 and 21168.5 of the Public
Resources Code.

15 11.

16 Venue for this action properly lies in Sacramento County Superior Court because

17 DWR and DFW are state agencies based in Sacramento County, and the Attorney General also

18 has an office in Sacramento County. (Code Civ. Proc., § 401, subd. (1).)

12.

19 This Petition is timely filed in accordance with Public Resources Code section
21167, subdivision (b) and CEQA Guidelines section 15112, as well as Code of Civil Procedure
20 section 1094.5.

21 PARTIES

22 13.

23 Plaintiff COUNTY OF SAN JOAQUIN ("San Joaquin County") is a political

24 subdivision of the State of California. Two-thirds of the legal Delta is located within San

25 Joaquin County, and the Delta comprises over one-third of San Joaquin County's total area.

26 Approximately 167,000 people live in the San Joaquin County portion of the Delta, and those

27 cities and communities rely in significant part on the Delta for their water supplies. The Delta

28 supports a $5.2 billion annual agricultural industry, and approximately forty percent (40%) of
those farms are located in San Joaquin County. A large portion of the Delta's $750 million

12
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

recreational economy is centered in San Joaquin County, encompassing, among other

2 enterprises and activities, innumerable privately-owned marinas, public and private boat launch

3 facilities, recreational facilities for fishing, tent camping, RV camping, hiking and picnicking,

4 and many lodging establishments and restaurants that contribute to the Delta's recreational

5 economy.

6 14. Plaintiff CENTRAL DELTA WATER AGENCY ("CDWA") is political

7 subdivision of the State of California created by the California Legislature under the Central

8 Delta Water Agency Act, chapter 1133 of the statutes of 1973 (Wat. Code, Appendix, 117-1.1,

9 et seq.), by the provisions of which CDWA came into existence in January of 1974. CDWA's
10 boundaries are specified in Water Code Appendix section 117-9.1 and encompass approximately
11 120,000 acres, which are located entirely within both the western portion of San Joaquin County

12 and the "Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta" as defined in California Water Code section 12220.

13 While the lands within the agency are primarily devoted to agriculture, said lands are also
14 devoted to numerous other uses including recreational, wildlife habitat, open space, residential,
15 commercial, and institutional uses. CDWA is empowered to "sue and be sued" and to take all

16 reasonable and lawful actions, including pursuing legislative and legal action, that have for their
17 general purpose: (1) to protect the water supply of the lands within the agency against intrusion

18 of ocean salinity; and/or (2) to assure the lands within the agency a dependable supply of water
19 of suitable quality sufficient to meet present and future needs. The agency may also undertake
20 activities to assist landowners and local districts within the agency in reclamation and flood
21 control matters. (See Wat. Code, Appendix, 117-4.3, subd. (b) & 117-4.1, subds. (a) and (b),

22 respectively.) CDWA may assist landowners, districts, and water right holders within its
23 boundaries in the protection of their vested water rights and may represent the interests of those
24 parties in water right proceedings and related proceedings before courts of both the State of

25 California and the United States to carry out the purposes of the agency. (See Wat. Code,

26 Appendix, 117-4.2, subd. (b).) Those vested water rights include post-1914 water permits and
27 licenses issued by the SWRCB and its predecessor agencies, overlying rights, statutory rights,

28

13
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

contract rights, riparian rights, prescriptive rights, salvage rights, rights to recycled and

2 recaptured water, and rights to artesian flow.

3 15. Plaintiff SOUTH DELTA WATER AGENCY ("SDWA") is a political
4 subdivision of the State of California created by the California Legislature under the South Delta

5 Water Agency Act, chapter 1089 of the statutes of 1973 (Wat. Code, Appendix, 116-1.1, et

6 seq.), by the provisions of which SDWA came into existence in January of 1974. SDWA's

7 boundaries are specified in Water Code Appendix section 116-9.1 and encompass approximately

8 148,000 acres, which are located entirely within both the south-western portion of San Joaquin

9 County and the "Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta" as defined in California Water Code section
10 12220. While the lands within the agency are primarily devoted to agriculture, said lands are
11 also devoted to numerous other uses including recreational, wildlife habitat, open space,

12 residential, commercial, municipal and institutional uses. SDWA is empowered to "sue and be

14 actions, that have for their general purpose: (1) to protect the water supply of the lands within
15 the agency against intrusions of ocean salinity; and/or (2) to assure the lands within the agency a

16 dependable supply of water of suitable quality sufficient to meet present and future needs. The

17 agency may also undertake activities to assist landowners and local districts within the agency in
18  reclamation and flood control matters. (See Wat. Code, Appendix, 116-4.2, subd. (b) & 116-

20 holders within its boundaries in the protection of their vested water rights and may represent the
21 interests of those parties in water right proceedings and related proceedings before courts of both
22 the State of California and the United States to carry out the purposes of the agency. (See Wat.
23 Code, Appendix, 116-4.2 subd. (b).) Those vested water rights include post-1914 water permits
24 and licenses issued by the SWRCB and its predecessor agencies, overlying rights, statutory
25 rights, contract rights, riparian rights, prescriptive rights, salvage rights, rights to recycled and
26 recaptured water, and rights to artesian flow.

2 mentioned herein was, a political subdivision of the State of California. Solano County is vitally
3 and beneficially interested in the decisions made by the Defendants that would affect the

4 Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. The eastern portion of Solano County, including the Cache

5 Slough region, is located within the Delta. Solano County's southern boundary borders San

6 Pablo and Suisun Bays, the Carquinez Strait, and the Sacramento River. Solano County is home

7 to more than 400,000 people, as well as a thriving agricultural economy. Persons who live and

8 work within Solano County rely on the Delta as a source of drinking and irrigation water, and as

9 a place to live, work, and recreate. Solano County's interests, as well as the interests of the

10 residents, landowners, farmers, and local districts within its boundaries, would be directly and
11 indirectly impacted by the Project's adverse environmental impacts.
12 19. Plaintiff COUNTY OF YOLO ("Yolo County") is, and at all times mentioned
13 herein was, a political subdivision of the State of California. Yolo County is vitally and
14 beneficially interested in Defendants' actions approving the Project because it would affect the
15 environment, economy, and public welfare within the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. A
16 substantial portion of Yolo County lies within the Delta, including part of the City of West
17 Sacramento, the town of Clarksburg and its surrounding farms and vineyards, and the Yolo
18 Bypass. Persons who live and work within Yolo County depend on Delta waters for agricultural
19 and municipal uses, as well as for commerce and recreation. Delta levees protect local
20 communities and farms and, together with other infrastructure such as roads and bridges, sustain
21 the agricultural heritage and economic vitality of Yolo County. For these and other reasons,

22 Yolo County's interests and the interests of its residents, landowners, and local agencies, such as
23 reclamation districts ("RDs"), would be directly and indirectly adversely impacted by the
24 Project.

25 20. Plaintiff LOCAL AGENCIES OF THE NORTH DELTA ("LAND"), an

26 a unincorporated association, is a coalition comprised of reclamation, water and levee districts
27 ("districts") in an approximately 120,000-acre area of the northern geographic area of the Delta.
28 These districts provide water delivery and/or drainage services, and assist in the maintenance of

16

-

2 the levees that provide flood protection to Delta communities, homes and farms that contribute

3 to the agricultural productivity of the Delta. LAND member interests, as well as the interests of

4 local landowners within individual LAND districts, would be directly and indirectly adversely

5 impacted by the Project through reduced fresh water flows, changes in water levels, and

6 worsened quality of water in the channels within the boundaries of LAND member agencies. In

7 addition, LAND member districts' flood control protection levels would be worsened by the

8 massive changes to the levee system necessary to construct the Project. The Project's

9 destruction of aquatic and terrestrial habitat needed by Delta wildlife is also adverse to the
interests of LAND member districts.

16 FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

17 Delta History

18 25. The Delta is the largest estuary on the west coast of the Americas. The Delta

19 supports some of the most productive farmland in the world, wineries and other agriculture-
20 related enterprises. Of the approximately 500,000 acres of farmland in the Delta, approximately
21 eighty percent (80%) is classified as Prime Farmland. This is the largest contiguous swath of
22 Prime Farmland in the state. The Delta also supports a substantial sports-fishing and recreation
23 industry, many cities and communities, and hundreds of aquatic and terrestrial species (many of
24 which are unique to the Delta and at risk of extinction). Rich in history and culture, the Delta is
25 also a core component of California's water system, from which water flows to rural and urban

26 users throughout California. The Delta is a critical component of the San Francisco Bay Delta
27 Estuary. In 1959, the Legislature enacted Water Code sections 12200 through 12205. This Act,
28 commonly referred to as the Delta Protection Act of 1959 ("1959 DPA"), was enacted to retain

18
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

-

2 the Delta as the common pool, stating: "water surplus to the needs of the areas in which it

3 originates is gathered in the Delta and thereby provides a common source of fresh water supply

4 for water-deficient areas." (Wat. Code, § 12200.) The act makes clear that "among the

5 functions to be provided by the State Water Resources Development System, in coordination

6 with the activities of the United States in providing salinity control through operation of the

7 [CVP], shall be the provision of salinity control and an adequate water supply for the users of

8 water in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta." (Wat. Code, §12202.) In Water Code section

9 12205, the Legislature sought to ensure that the adequacy of the common pool for in Delta users

10 by requiring that "the operation and management of releases from storage into the Sacramento-

11 San Joaquin Delta of water for use outside the area in which such water originates shall be

12 integrated to the maximum extent possible in order to permit the fulfillment of the objectives of

13 this part." The proposed tunnels, which would isolate the water for export from the Delta pool,

14 are inconsistent with the objectives of providing salinity control and an adequate supply for the
Delta.

15 26.

16 The 1959 DPA has been the subject of administrative and judicial interpretation

17 making clear that there can be no export of water from the Delta unless the Delta users are first

18 provided salinity control and an adequate water supply. In United States vS. State Water

19 Resources Control Board (1986) 182 Cal.App.3rd 82, 139, the court determined:

20 In 1959, when the SWP was authorized, the Legislature enacted the Delta

21 Protection Act. (Secs. 12200-12220.) The Legislature recognized the unique water problems in the Delta, particularly "salinity intrusion,' which mandates the need

22 for such special legislation "for the protection, conservation, development, control and use of waters in the Delta for the public good." (Sec. 12200.) The act prohibits

23 project exports from the Delta of water necessary to provide water to which Delta users are "entitled" and water which is needed for salinity control and an adequate supply for Delta users. (Secs. 12202, 12203, 12204.)

24

25 The court further explained: "Section 12201 clarifies that an adequate water supply is a supply

26 sufficient 1) to maintain and expand agriculture, industry, urban and recreational development in

27 the Delta and 2) to provide a common source of fresh water for export to water-deficient areas,

28 subject to the provisions of the watershed and county-of-origin statutes." (182 Cal.App.3d at p.
139, fn. 37.)

19
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

P

H 27. DWR's December 1960 Bulletin 76 Report to the Legislature contemporaneously

2 interpreted the 1959 DPA, explaining at page 12: "In 1959 the State Legislature directed that

3 water shall not be diverted from the Delta for use elsewhere unless adequate supplies for the

4 Delta are first provided." In this same report, at page 44, referencing alternative plans for Delta

5 facilities, DWR explained: "Under any of the foregoing projects, water of very good quality

6 would continue to be supplied to about 90 percent of the Delta lowlands through existing

7 facilities. It is estimated that the mineral quality of the supplies would range between 15 to 80

8 parts of chlorides and between 100 and 350 parts of total dissolved solids per million parts
9 water. The quality of water in the southern portion of the Delta would be improved." As the

10 1959 DPA and other authority direct, the export of water from the Delta was expressly

11 conditioned on there first being provided an adequate supply for in-Delta users as defined in

12 Water Code section 12201.

13 28. In reliance on these promises, the two major water infrastructure projects that
14 serve California's water needs, the SWP and the CVP, were ultimately constructed to include
15 major diversions in the South Delta. DWR operates the SWP, which includes pumping plants,
16 hydroelectric power plants, water storage, as well as conveyance structures. SWP exports Delta
17 water from the SWP system at Clifton Court Forebay from the Harvey 0. Banks pumping plant
18 in Contra Costa County. The SWP operates under long-term contracts with water contractors
19 throughout California. These water contractors, in turn, deliver water to wholesalers or retailers

20 or deliver it directly to agricultural, municipal, and industrial water users.
21 29. The CVP comprises reservoirs, power plants, and more than 500 miles of major
22 canals and aqueducts. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation ("Reclamation") operates and maintains
23 the CVP, which is generally operated as an integrated project, and coordinates operations with
24 the SWP. Reclamation has entered into approximately 250 long-term contracts with water

25 districts, irrigation districts, and others for delivery of CVP water. Reclamation exports water
26 into the CVP system at the C. W. "Bill" Jones Pumping Plant, which supplies the Delta-
27 Mendota Canal.

28

20
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

1 30. In the early 1960s, an Interagency Delta Committee was convened to coordinate

2 water resources planning for the SWP, CVP, and local agencies. Although no isolated

3 peripheral canal or tunnel was contemplated or included in DWR's 1960 Report to the

4 Legislature, a 1963 report acknowledged that Delta export pumps were a threat to Delta fish

5 populations and proposed a "peripheral canal" to allow balanced growth of Delta activities.

6 (CEQA Findings, p. 11.)

7 31. Following nearly decade of further study of this proposal, DWR released a draft

8 EIR for a proposed "Peripheral Canal Project" in 1974, describing as an isolated facility to

9 convey freshwater from the Sacramento River via a diversion near Hood to the SWP and CVP

10 pumping plants with up to 12 release facilities to distribute water from the canal to Delta

11 channels. (Id. at 10-11.) The proposal included 43 miles of above-ground, open earth channel
12 that would have had a total carrying capacity of 23,300 cfs, as well as four large siphons 18 to
13 25 feet in diameter to move water under the Mokelumne River, San Joaquin River,
14 Disappointment Slough, and Old River. (lbid.) The Peripheral Canal would have permanently
15 impacted 5,800 acres of agricultural land in the eastern Delta, in addition to land that would be

16 affected by disposal of dirt and construction materials. (Id. at 12.) In 1972, the California

17 Legislature passed the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, protecting the north coast's remaining free-
18 flowing rivers from development. In 1980, these state-designated wild and scenic rivers were
19 placed under federal Wild and Scenic Rivers Act protection. Protection of these rivers
20 effectively cut off the prospect of new water supplies from northern California being routed into
21 the Delta and distributed to SWP and/or CVP users. In 1982, in a statewide referendum

22 election, California voters, by a margin of 62.7 percent to 37.3 percent, definitively rejected the
23 act that would have authorized construction of the Peripheral Canal facilities. (Ibid.)
24 32. The SWP and CVP water infrastructure are operated in a coordinated manner,
25 pursuant to a 1986 Coordinated Operations Agreement. Joint points of diversion allow the use

26 of one project's diversion facility by the other under certain conditions. In part, both the SWP
27 and CVP water delivery systems rely on runoff and reservoir releases in areas upstream of the
28

21
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

Delta to deliver contracted water via the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers to Delta export
2 pumps in the South Delta.

3 33. The flows of both the San Joaquin River System and the Sacramento River System

4 vary greatly from year to year and from season to season within each year. In the late summer

5 and early fall, the flow is usually low and it rises in the winter, spring, and early summer as a

6 result of rains and run-off from the melting snow. Sacramento River flows in the vicinity of the
7 proposed North Delta Diversions vary broadly over the course of the year from just over 10,000
cfs to over 50,000 cfs. San Joaquin River Flows at Vernalis before flowing into the South Delta

9 can range from 30 cfs to almost 80,000 cfs. Operation of the state and federal pumping systems
10 in the Delta rely on a through-Delta conveyance approach that allows fresh water from the

11 Sacramento River to freshen the Delta prior to water being exported from the South Delta.
12 34. The lands within the boundaries of the Delta are riparian to Delta channels and the
13 Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers. Delta water users claim the right to the waters flowing into
14 the Delta from the west, including water flowing with the tides, water flowing from the
15 Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers, and water from all other tributaries and other sources.

16 These claims are based on riparian rights, prescriptive rights, pre-1914 rights, salvage rights,
17 overlying rights, statutory rights, rights to recycled and recaptured water, rights to artesian flow
18 and appropriative rights based on applications made and permits granted. These landowners
19 also claim vested rights in the underground water supply where it is available and which is fed
20 by the rivers, channels, canals and sloughs in the Delta. If the surface water quality is degraded,
21 the groundwater is also gradually degraded.

22 35. Dams and diversions on the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers and their
23 tributaries decrease flows entering the Delta, which adversely affects in-Delta quality by, amongl
24 other things, reducing net flows in Delta channels. Changes in the flows in the rivers, channels,
25 canals and sloughs in or tributary to the Delta have a material effect on a the farming operations
26 conducted on the lands irrigated from these sources. At times of low flows, the source of water
27 used for irrigation, domestic and other beneficial uses may become degraded because of: (1) the
28 poor-quality drainage water from lands lying upstream, particularly on the San Joaquin River;

22
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

-

2 and (2) the incursion of salt water from San Francisco Bay. At such times, poor quality causes

3 reduction in crop yields and values, and increases irrigation costs.

36.

4 The operation of the CVP and SWP causes other adverse effects in the South

5 Delta. The operation of the CVP and SWP export pumps, if not carefully controlled,

6 substantially decreases the height of water levels in the South Delta, especially the low tide

7 level, to the point where local siphons and pumps cannot operate properly. The operation of the

8 CVP and SWP export facilities also alters the flow in the channels, creating reverse flows and
stagnant zones. This results in insufficient flushing of Delta waters and the concentration of all
9 constituents, including municipal effluent and salts from upstream return flows. In addition,

10

11 such stagnation exacerbates the conditions that promote proliferation of invasive water weeds

12 and harmful algal blooms ("HABs") such as toxic Microcystis. Delivery of Delta water to the

13 CVP's San Joaquin Valley service area results in the importation thereto of upwards of

14 1,000,000 tons of salt into the San Joaquin Valley. After this exported water is used, much of

15 the salt is delivered to the San Joaquin River in concentrations which exceed downstream Water

16 Quality Objectives. This drainage also includes high levels of other constituents such as
selenium and boron.

17 37.

18 The CALFED Bay-Delta Program ("CALFED") was an interagency effort

19 involving 25 state and federal agencies with management or regulatory responsibilities for the
Bay-Delta. Local agencies in the Delta were not permitted to participate in the development of
20 CALFED, despite being within the project area. In August 2000, Reclamation, DWR and other
21

22 state and federal agencies committed to implementing CALFED in a Record of Decision for the

23 CALFED programmatic EIR/S. Among other elements, the CALFED approach included

24 ecosystem restoration, levee improvements, and changes to the South Delta pumping facilities to

25 reduce fish mortality by 2006. CALFED deferred consideration of any new conveyance

26 structures in the Delta until alternative efforts were undertaken. While the California Supreme

27 Court ultimately upheld CALFED as legally adequate, the court recognized that reductions in

28 Bay-Delta exports may ultimately be necessary to protect state and federally listed species.

23
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

1 38. The California Bay-Delta Act of 2003 established the California Bay-Delta

2 Authority as a governance structure charged with implementation and oversight of the CALFED
3 Program progress. Yet little progress was made on the CALFED goals. In January 2010, the

4 California Bay-Delta Act of 2003 was repealed, and new legislation transferred all of the

5 Authority's responsibilities to the newly created Delta Stewardship Council ("DSC"). Except

6 for the science program, the actions included in CALFED are no longer active.

7 Predetermined "Planning" Process for Delta Tunnels

8 39. The planning process for the Bay Delta Conservation Plan ("BDCP") formally
9 commenced in 2006. The BDCP was conceptualized as a voluntary effort to obtain long-term,
10 incidental take permits for: (1) the operations of the SWP through development of a
11 comprehensive Habitat Conservation Plan ("HCP") under the federal Endangered Species Act
12 ("ESA"), and a Natural Community Conservation Plan ("NCCP") under the California Natural

13 Community Conservation Planning Act; and (2) support for incidental take authorization for the
14 operations of the CVP under section 7 of the ESA.

15 40. In 2006, certain Federal and State regulatory agencies, fisheries agencies, water
16 export contractors (termed "potentially regulated agencies"), and environmental non-
17 governmental organizations entered into a Memorandum of Agreement on the Collaboration on
18 the Planning, Preliminary Design and Environmental Compliance for the Delta Habitat and

19 Conservation and Conveyance Program in Connection with the Development of the BDCP.
20 They began meeting at the Resources Agency on a regular basis regarding the development of
21 the project that would eventually become the California WaterFix. No public notice was

22 provided of these meetings, and for the most part, the affected public was not aware of the
23 meetings.

24 41. Also in 2006, several parties entered into a Planning Agreement Regarding the
25 BDCP ("Planning Agreement"). The purpose of the Planning Agreement was to determine the
26 scope of the BDCP, establish processes for reviewing scientific input and review of potential
27 projects in order to achieve BDCP goals. A Steering Committee was formed to help direct the
28 development of the BDCP. To the disappointment of the local entities that would be most

24
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

impacted by any new conveyance facility and associated restoration, participation in the BDCP

2 Steering Committee was conditioned on agreement to new points of diversion on the

3 Sacramento River and an isolated conveyance facility. (The BDCP Points of Agreement for
4 Continuing into the Planning Process (Nov. 16, 2007), section 2.3.)

5 42. CDWA and other local interests requested Steering Committee membership, but

6 the request was rejected because they could not agree to support isolated conveyance as a
7 precondition given its devastating consequences for the Delta. As a result of the restrictions on

8 membership, very few local entities-and none of the Plaintiffs herein- -participated in the

9 process as Steering Committee members, and were forced to participate instead as members of

10 the public, often without full access to meetings and meeting materials.
11 43. A 2007 Conservation Strategy Options Report confirmed DWR and other Steering
12 Committee members' predetermination that the BDCP process would focus only on alternatives
13 that included new North Delta diversions, and would not analyze other alternatives to improve
14 export water supplies in compliance with state and federal species requirements. While the
15 report initially considered options that relied on Existing Through-Delta Conveyance and
16 Improved Through-Delta Conveyance, those options were summarily dismissed, never to be

17 considered again by the Project proponents.

18 44. As fish numbers in the Delta continued to decline, the United States Fish and

19 a Wildlife Service ("USFWS") issued a Biological Opinion (*2008 FWS BO") concluding that
20 the effects of the proposed long-term operations of the SWP and CVP were likely to jeopardize
21 the continued existence of Delta smelt. As one measure to avoid jeopardy to Delta smelt and
22 adverse modification of its critical habitat, the 2008 FWS BO required the creation of 8,000
23 acres of tidal habitat restoration by the SWP contractors.

24 45. In 2009, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries ("NOAA
25 Fisheries") issued a biological opinion ("BO") (*2009 NOAA BO") concluding that the effects
26 of proposed long-term SWP and CVP operations were likely to jeopardize the continued
27 existence of the Sacramento River winter-run Chinook salmon, Central Valley spring-run
28 Chinook salmon, Central Valley steelhead, and Southern Distinct Population Segment of North

25
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

-

2 American green sturgeon. To avoid jeopardy and adverse modification of critical habitat, the

3 2009 NOAA BO additionally required the creation of 17,000+ acres of enhanced floodplain
habitat by the SWP and the CVP contractors.

4 46.

5 In 2009, the California Legislature passed the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta

6 Reform Act of 2009 (*2009 DRA") (Wat. Code, § 85000 § et seq.) The 2009 DRA aptly

7 describes the Delta as "a critically important natural resource for California and the nation,"

8 which "serves Californians concurrently as both the hub of the California water system and the

9 most valuable estuary and wetland ecosystem on the west coast of North and South America."
(Wat. Code, § 85002.)

10 47.

11 DWR released the first draft of the BDCP to the public in 2010. After reviewing

12 this draft, which already proposed an isolated conveyance, the National Academy of Sciences

13 ("NAS") commented that the draft lacked a detailed effects analysis. NAS also cautioned that

14 for a broad conservation plan like the BDCP that purportedly aims to protect the ecosystem and

15 provide a reliable water supply, it would be more logical to carry out an effects analysis, and

16 then identify several alternative projects to reach the two goals. Instead, choosing the project

17 design before evaluating alternative ways to reach a predetermined outcome, amounted to post

18 hoc rationalization. DWR provided no scientific reasons for not considering alternative actions
in the draft BDCP.

19 48.

20 In 2013, the draft BDCP and accompanying Draft Environmental Impact Report

21 ("DEIR/S") were released for public review and comment. Although the DEIR/S contained 15

22 "alternatives," it included only one alternative, Alternative 9, which included other

23 improvements to the existing through-Delta conveyance system other than a new canal or

24 tunnels to convey water to the South Delta. Alternative 9 was also the only project alternative to

25 include any improvements to the South Delta pumping facilities to reduce chronic and illegal

26 fish kills. Yet, Alterative 9 also included "poison pill" components such as placing intakes with

27 large fish screens at the town of Locke and at Georgiana Slough that would destroy important
cultural and other Delta resources.

49. The DEIR/S preferred Project alternative was Alternative 4, which included three

2 new intakes on the Sacramento River with maximum diversion capacity of 9,000 cfs. Despite

3 the requirement to improve the South Delta diversion facilities to reduce fish kills in CALFED,

4 as well as the 2009 NOAA BO, and the continued reliance in most of the Project alternatives on

5 continued pumping from the South Delta, none of the Project alternatives included measures to

6 reduce fish kills at the South Delta pumps.

7 50. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("USEPA") found, upon review of the

8 BDCP DEIR/S, that "all project alternatives would result in adverse, significant, unmitigated
effects to water quality and one or more beneficial uses within the affected water bodies."

10 (DEIR/S Comment 2006.) Upon review of the Project's Recirculated Draft EIR/S ("RDEIR/S")

11 in 2015, the USEPA rated the RDEIR/S review as "Inadequate."

12 51. In the intervening years following the 2008-2009 Biological Opinions' initially-
13 required creation of 28,000 acres of habitat, very few acres of habitat were actually created.

14 According to the 2016 Fish Restoration Program Annual Report, not one acre of habitat
15 pursuant to the 2008 FWS BO has actually been completed in the Delta. Meanwhile, special
16 status species continue to decline, with Delta smelt and several salmon runs teetering on the
17 brink of extinction.

18 52. After six years of working on the BDCP, DWR and Reclamation gave up on
19 seeking an HCP/NCCP with 50-year take authority and "no surprises" assurances. Unable to

20 meet ESA standards requiring that the BDCP version of the Delta Tunnels plan contribute to the
21 recovery of state and federally listed species, the BDCP proponents jettisoned the HCP/NCCP
22 idea and announced the selection of Alternative 4A and the proposed Project under CEQA,
23 dubbing it the "California WaterFix." The HCP/NCCP restoration elements that were stripped
24 from the BDCP were then rebranded as "EcoRestore." Restoration of all but 2,000 of the
25 30,000 acres now called "Eco Restore" and presented as "new" habitat restoration was in fact

26 already required by the 2008 and 2009 Biological Opinions. While Alternative 4A reduced

27 impacts on the Delta associated with creation of over 100,000 acres of habitat, to be placed
28

27
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

1 largely on productive farmland in private ownership, Alternative 4A did little to address other

2 local concerns about the Project.

3 53. As the environmental review and planning process for the BDCP, and later the
4 California WaterFix, ground on, the California Legislature enacted the Sustainable Groundwater

5 Management Act ("SGMA") in 2014. (Wat. Code, § 10720 et seq.) SGMA was designed to

6 close the gap in California's groundwater management by directing the creation of local
7 groundwater sustainability agencies to monitor and manage groundwater basins to ensure that

8 the basins are managed to prevent and correct overdraft conditions.
9 54. Concurrently with the Project's CEQA review, the SWRCB has proceeded to

10 update the Bay Delta Water Quality Control Plan ("WQCP"), and in 2016 the SWRCB released

11 its Substitute Environmental Document ("SED"), the equivalent of a CEQA document, for the
12 WQCP updates related to San Joaquin River Flows and Southern Delta Water Quality. In the
13 SED, the SWRCB proposed to relax the South Delta Salinity Objective, which would allow
14 higher salinity in the surface waters and would impair South Delta agriculture. The SED
15 provided no scientific justification for the increase in salinity, but instead relied on the fact that
16  increasing permissible levels of salinity in South Delta water would result in fewer violations of
17 the standard.

18 Project - Description - Tunnel/Canal Vision

19 55. The Project proposes a drastic change to the current through Delta conveyance
20 approach in the Delta. Construction and operation of the Project would occur within the legal
21 Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and Suisun Marsh. (See Project Overview, attached as Exhibit
22 A.)

23 56. The project would include two 40-foot interior diameter underground water
24 conveyance tunnels and ultimately divert a combined capacity of 9,000 cfs of water from the
25 Sacramento River in the north Delta to South Delta pumping plants.

26 57. The Project would divert water through three intakes on the east bank of the
27 Sacramento River between Clarksburg and Courtland, just adjacent to the Stone Lakes National
28 Wildlife Refuge ("Wildlife Refuge"). a These three intakes, each a footprint of 90-150 acres, are

28
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

-

2 referred to as the North Delta Diversions ("NDDs"). The three new intakes would each extend

3 nearly a third of a mile along the river, thus encompassing nearly a mile of river frontage over a
five-mile length of river.

4 58.

5 The EIR/S fails to provide sufficient detail about the fish screens for the intakes to

6 evaluate their efficacy or their potential for entrainment and impingement of fish and aquatic

7 organisms. The flow effects on fish of having three enormous intakes over a five mile stretch of

8 river that is also subject to tidal variation are not fully evaluated or understood, and the best

9 available science is not included. (See Exhibit B, Simulated Intake View.) Water would travel

10 from the three intakes, each with a 3,000 cfs capacity, to a sedimentation basin, the Glannvale

11 Tract Forebay, and ultimately two 40-foot-wide tunnels, where it would travel 37 miles to two

12 new pumping plants adjacent to the Clinton Court Forebay in the South Delta. Once the new

13 facilities were operational, the SWP would operate through the Project facilities as well as
existing SWP facilities.

14 59.

15 While DWR claims the tunnels would operate "by gravity," in fact the Project

16 would include a huge pumping plant at the Clifton Court Forebay end of the tunnels to would

17 suck water from the new diversions in the North Delta. The Project also includes approximately|

18 20 miles of permanent new transmission lines and 38 miles of temporary transmission lines,

19 some of which would be built right through the Wildlife Refuge. (See Exhibit C, Power Supply

20 and Grid Connections.) Projected greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions from construction of the

21 Project would be about three million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent ("CO2e"); that is

22 the equivalent of placing 633,000 new passenger cars on the road (about a five percent increase

23 in total cars on the road in California). Operational energy demand for the Project is estimated

24 to be 1,405 gigawatt hours per year (the average power plant produces about 1,000 gigawatt
hours per year).

25 60.

26 Completing a Project of such mammoth proportions would take a significant

27 amount of time; DWR has estimated that construction would take anywhere from 9 to 14 years,
and even the upper end of this
28 range may be a conservative estimate. Rural Delta communities
would bear the burden of living with the direct construction impacts for more than a decade.

29
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

-

2 Project construction would cause traffic and circulation impacts of an unprecedented magnitude

3 in largely rural, agricultural areas. For instance, in the Yolo County communities of West

4 Sacramento and Clarksburg, and on a number of roads throughout the county, the impacts would

5 be severe. Lengthy road segments would operate at potentially "unacceptable" levels for 10 or

6 more hours daily during the 14-year construction timeframe of the new conveyance facilities.
One stretch of State Road 84 would see a 600

7 percent increase in daily traffic. Here and

8 throughout the Project construction area, the increase in traffic would make crop harvests
difficult or, in some cases, impossible.

9 61.

10 A 2012 Delta Protection Commission ("DPC") report estimates that increased

11 salinity in Delta water could result in agricultural losses between $20 million and $80 million
per year.

12 This number is in addition to the $10 to $15 million in annual crop losses that DPC

13 estimates the Project would generate due to the loss of farmland for Project construction.
62. Reclamation districts ("RDs"), local agencies responsible for protecting Delta
14 communities, agriculture, and industry from flood damage and ensuring that these entities have
15

16 a reliable water supply, would also pay a price for DWR's Project. These districts, and their
landowners, have invested substantial resources in levees, drainage ditches, pumps, and other
17 | infrastructure to prevent flooding in their service areas. Over a dozen of these districts are
18

19 located within the Project footprint. The Project's intakes, tunnel shafts, tunnel alignments, and
barge facilities would be constructed on the Delta channels, i.e., constructed on or under RD
20 levees, potentially damaging them in the process.
21 63.

22 Project construction would also block Delta channels, limiting the amount of waten

23 they can hold, placing increased stress on RD flood infrastructure. For example, the Project

24 would construct a barge loading facility on 185 feet of an RD 1002 levee on Snodgrass Slough,

25 which will extend 185 feet into the slough, leaving only 50 feet in the channel. In addition, the

26 Project's Intermediate Forebay would be built adjacent to RD 1002's southwest levee, and the
Project proposes large muck storage areas within RD 1002.

27 64.

28 Delta residents are not the only people who would be harmed by the Project.
Project construction also threatens to destroy unique elements of California history, such as the

30
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

A

- historic Rosebud Mansion. There are also nine towns in the path of Project construction that the

2 2009 DRA designated as "legacy communities." (Wat. Code, § 32300, subd. (f).) Each of these

3 towns represents a piece of Delta history: some were established in the 1850's in the wake of

4 the California Gold Rush, and several were culturally unique as Chinese immigrant

5 communities, like Locke, built entirely by Chinese immigrants and added to the National

6 Register of Historic Places in 1971.

7 65. The Project also seriously threatens Delta agriculture in all five Delta counties,

8 whose farmlands provide the region with a locally-sourced food supply, helping make "Farm to
9 Fork" a reality in Sacramento and other cities surrounding the Delta. The Delta region also
10 produces now world-renowned Lodi and Clarksburg Appellation wines, among other wines. A
11 broad range of crops is grown in the Delta counties, and provides important economic and

12 environmental benefits.

13 66. According to the Economic Sustainability Plan prepared by the DPC, Delta

14 agriculture generated about $795 million in direct agricultural production in 2008. This
15 production is estimated to create 9,681 jobs, $683 million in value added and $1.416 billion in

16 output in the five Delta counties. Across all of California, the economic impact of Delta
17 agriculture is estimated to be 12,934 jobs, $819 million in value added, and $1.642 billion in

18 output. Delta counties and their constituents have expressed their desire to protect agriculture's
19 place in the Delta economy and culture Solano County, for example, has designated essentially
20 all Delta land, including the uniquely valuable Cache Slough, as agricultural. And Solano
21 County voters have approved, by overwhelming majority, measures to preserve agricultural
22 areas outside of incorporated cities.

23 Project Review and Approvals

24 67. On January 24, 2008, Reclamation published a Notice of Intent in the Federal

25 Register, and on March 17, 2008, DWR published a Notice of Preparation ("NOP") of the EIR

26 for the Project, at that time still referred to as BDCP.4 On December 13, 2013, Reclamation and
27

28 DWR published a revised NOP for the BDCP on February 13, 2009.

31
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

1 CEQA-lead agency DWR released the Draft BDCP and DEIR/S and accepted public comment

2 through July 29, 2014. The lead agencies received more than 18,500 public comments.

3 68. Following the extensive public comment received, the Lead Agency changed the
4 a Project in a number of ways, including the addition of a new, previously unanalyzed preferred

5 alternative, Alternative 4A, which eliminated the HCP element and the intent to create a regional

6 conservation plan to conserve ecosystems in a sustainable manner and contribute to the recovery|

7 of threatened and endangered species. The RDEIR/S was released on July 20, 2015 and public

8 comment was accepted through October 30, 2015. About 12,500 comments were received on
9 the RDEIR/S.

10 69. On August 26, 2015, in advance of completion of the EIR, DWR submitted a
11 Petition for Change of Point of Diversion ("Petition") to the State Water Resources Control
12 Board ("SWRCB") adding three new 3,000 cfs intakes on the Sacramento River for the Project,
13 and contending that increasing conveyance capacity and diverting water from potentially new

14 sources was not actually a new diversion. The SWRCB has not yet completed hearings on
15 whether or not to approve this Petition or, if it is to be approved, what conditions would be
16 imposed on construction and operation of the Project. Submittal of such Petition is further

17 evidence of the predetermination of the selected alternative prior to completion of the EIR.

18 70. On December 22, 2016, the Lead Agencies released a Final EIR/S ("FEIR/S").
19 This final environmental review document of over 80,000 pages did not disclose changes to the
20 RDEIR/S. DWR attempted to limit comments on the FEIR/S to 30 days and rejected requests to
21 keep the comment period open longer. The lead agencies received more than 1400 comments
22 on the FEIR/S.

23 71. On June 26, 2017, USFWS and NOAA Fisheries issued their final BOs ("2017

24 FWS BO" and "2017 NOAA BO", respectively") on the Project. The 2017 FWS BO authorized
25 take of nine (9) ESA-listed species. The 2017 NOAA BO authorized take of four (4) ESA listed
26 species.

27 72. Although the 2017 FWS BO was characterized as "Final" it used a so-called
28 "mixed standard/programmatic approach" that defers out ESA permitting for several Project

32

-:

- components, as well as actual operation of the Project. Proposed actions within the Project

2 analyzed in the EIR/S that require future approvals are: (1) construction of the NDDs and

3 associated structures, (2) construction of the Head of Old River Barrier ("HORB"),' (3)

4 construction of the Contra Costa Water District ("CCWD") settlement agreement facilities, (4)

5 operations of new and existing CVP and SWP water facilities under duel conveyance, (5) future

6 maintenance, (6) future monitoring, and (7) compensatory mitigation associated with

7 construction of the NDDs, HORB, and CCWD settlement agreement facilities. Thus, the 2017

8 FWS BO deferred the analysis of the most important aspects of the Project a until a later time.
9 73. DWR certified the FEIR/S on July 21, 2017, adopted Findings and Statement of
10 Overriding Considerations ("CEQA Findings") and a Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Plan
11 ("MMRP"), and executed and filed a Notice of Determination the same a day. Reclamation has
12 yet to issue a Record of Decision for the Project pursuant to NEPA or to approve the Project.
13 74. At the time that DWR issued its Notice of Determination, it issued a 294-page
14 document titled "Developments after Publication of the Proposed Final Environmental Impact
15 Report," that was ambiguously dated "July 2017." DWR's findings asserted in a footnote that
16 the FEIR/S released in December 2016 was in fact "proposed Final EIR/EIS" (emphasis in
17 original) but that the true FEIR/S certified by DWR included both the December 2016 documentl

18 as well as the July 2017 "Developments" document. This document purported to address
19 comments on the December 2016 FEIR/S and further changes to the Project that had been
20 developed since December 2016.

21 75. On a July 21, 2017, DWR filed a direct validation action pursuant to Code of Civil

22 Procedure section 860, et seq. in Sacramento County Superior Court, seeking to validate: (1)
23 revenue bonds DWR has authorized to finance the capital costs of the Project; (2) the resolutions
24 DWR adopted in connection with those bonds; and (3) the pledge of revenues for their
25 repayment. In its complaint, DWR estimates the Project would require the contribution of $7.2

26 billion in unidentified "other sources" not covered by the proposed bonds. DWR's complaint,

2 which does not allege that DWR "has satisfied all of the statutory and regulatory requirements to

3 construct" the Project, characterizes compliance with these requirements as "not at issue" in the

4 validation action. DWR's validation summons indicated that answers to the validation

5 complaint would be due by September 15, 2017. On July 28, 2017 DFW issued the Project ITP

6 pursuant to Fish and Game Code section 2081, authorizing take of eight (8) CESA-listed
species.

7 LEGAL FRAMEWORK

8

9 76. California Environmental Quality Act

10 CEQA has two purposes: environmental protection and informed self-

11 government. CEQA must "be interpreted to afford the fullest possible protection to the

12 environment within the reasonable scope of the statutory language." (Mountain Lion

13 Foundation v. Fish & Game Comm'n. (1997) 16 Cal.4th 105, 134.) CEQA requires agencies to

14 "take all action necessary to protect, rehabilitate, and enhance the environmental quality of the
state." (Pub. Resources Code, § 21001, subd. (a).)

15 77.

16 Under CEQA, a "project" is an activity which may cause either direct physical

17 change in the environment, or reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the

18 environment (Pub. Resources Code, § 21065, subd. (a)); and a "discretionary" project is one that

19 is subject to judgmental controls, where the agency can use its judgment to decide whether and
how to carry out a project. (Cal. a Code Regs., tit. 14, ch. 3 ("CEQA Guidelines"), § 15002, subd.
20 | (i).) Prior to approving a discretionary project, an agency must fully disclose and analyze all of
21

22 the project's potentially significant direct, indirect, and cumulative environmental effects. (See,

23 e.g., CEQA Guidelines, § 15002, subd. (f).) Public agencies must avoid or minimize such

24 environmental damage where feasible. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15021, subd. (a).) Pursuant to this

25 duty, no public agency may approve or carry out a project where one or more significant effects

on

26 the environment may occur if the project is approved, unless certain narrow findings are
made. (CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15091, 15093.)

27

1 California Endangered Species Act/Fully Protected Species Provisions

2 78. The Legislature enacted CESA, Fish and Game Code section 2050 et seq., in 1984

3 based on three basic findings:

4 (a) Certain species of fish, wildlife, and plants have been rendered extinct as a

5 consequence of man's activities, untempered by adequate concern and conservation.

6 (b) Other species of fish, wildlife, and plants are in danger of, or threatened
7 with, extinction because their habitats are threatened with destruction, adverse modification, or severe curtailment, or because of overexploitation, disease,
8 predation, or other factors.

9 (c) These species of fish, wildlife, and plants are of ecological, educational, historical, recreational, esthetic, economic, and scientific value to the people of
10 this state, and the conservation, protection, and enhancement of these species and their habitat is of statewide concern.
11 (Fish & G. Code, § 2051.)

12 79. In light of these findings, the Legislature stated succinctly the policy of the State
13 of California with respect to endangered and threatened species:
14 The Legislature further finds and declares that it is the policy of the state to
15 conserve, protect, restore, and enhance any endangered species or any threatened species and its habitat and that it is the intent of the Legislature, consistent with
16 conserving the species, to acquire lands for habitat for these species.

17 (Fish & G. Code, § 2052.)

18 80. Among other measures taken to implement State policy with respect to
19 endangered and threatened species, CESA provides, in pertinent part: "No person shall . take

20 any species, or any part or product thereof, that the commission determines to be an
21 a endangered species or a threatened species, or attempt any of those acts, except as otherwise
22 provided in this chapter . . . ." (Fish & G. Code, § 2080.)
23 81. As used in Fish and Game Code section 2080, "take" is a defined term which,
24 under Fish and Game Code section 86, means: "hunt, pursue, catch, capture, or kill, or attempt
25 to hunt, pursue, catch, capture, or kill."

26 82. In addition to CESA, the California Fish and Game Code includes provisions
27 expressly designed to provide a heightened level of protection for specific species referred to as
28 "fully protected species." Under Fish and Game Code section 3511, and subject to exceptions

35
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

1 not applicable in this case: "a fully protected bird may not be taken or possessed at any time. No

2 provision of this code or any other law shall be construed to authorize the issuance of a permit or

3 license to take a fully protected bird, and no permit or license previously issued shall have any

4 force or effect for that purpose." "Fully protected" birds subject to the prohibition of section

5 3511 include the greater sandhill crane (Grus canadensis tabida) and the white-tailed kite

6 (Elanus leucurus). (Fish & G. Code, § 3511; see Exhibit D, Photos of Fully Protected Birds.)

7 Legislative Protections for the Delta

8 83. Over the course of California's water development history, the Legislature has

9 enacted measures to protect the Delta and other areas in which water serving other parts of the
10 states originates.

11 84. The 1959 DPA: (1) requires the SWP and CVP to provide salinity control and an
12 adequate water supply for the Delta (Wat. Code, §§ 12201, 12202); (2) prohibits the export of
13 water from the Delta to which in-Delta users are entitled through water rights and water, which

14 iS necessary for salinity control and an adequate supply "to maintain and expand agriculture,
15 industry, urban and recreational development in the Delta" (Wat. Code, § 12204); (3) § requires
16 maintenance of a "common source of fresh water" in the Delta to serve both in-Delta water

17 needs and export water needs when water surplus to the in-Delta needs is available (Wat. Code,
18 § 12201); and (4) requires all releases of water from storage reservoirs into the Delta for export
19 from the Delta to be integrated to the "maximum extent possible" in order to fulfill the
20 objectives of the Act (Wat. Code, § 12205).
21 85. The 1992 Delta Protection Act ("1992 DPA"), Public Resources Code section
22 29700 et seq., and the Watershed Protection Act, Water Code section 11460 et seq., were

23 enacted to further protect the Delta and ensure that protected areas are not deprived of adequate
24 supplies of water.

25 86. The Delta Reform Act, adopted by the Legislature in 2009, includes substantive
26 protections for the Delta. The Legislature declared State policy in pertinent part in the Act as:
27 "The policy of the State of California is to reduce reliance on the Delta in meeting California's
28

36
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

-

2 future water supply needs through statewide strategy of investing in improved regional

3 supplies, conservation, and water use efficiency . ..." (Wat. Code, § 85021.)
87.

4 protections: The 2009 DRA expressly preserves area of origin and related water rights

5

6 This division does not diminish, impair, or otherwise affect in any manner whatsoever any area of origin, watershed of origin, county of origin, or any other

7 water rights protections, including, but not limited to, rights to water appropriated prior to December 19, 1914, provided under the law. This division does not limit.

8 or otherwise affect the application of Article 1.7 (commencing with Section 1215) of Chapter 1 of Part 2 of Division 2, Sections 10505, 10505.5, 11128, 11460,

9 11461, 11462, and 11463, and Sections 12200 to 12220, inclusive.
(Wat. Code, § 85031, subd. (a).)

10 Public Trust Doctrine

11 88.

12 The State of California, as a sovereign entity, owns "all of its navigable waterways

13 and the lands lying beneath them 'as trustee of a public trust for the benefit of the people.'

14 (Colberg, Inc. V. State of California ex rei. Dept. Pub. Wks. (1967) 67 Cal.2d 408.) The Public

15 Trust doctrine, as recognized and developed in California decisions, encompasses all navigable

16 lakes and streams, and protects navigable waters from harm caused by diversion of non-

17 navigable tributaries. DWR has a duty to take the public trust into account in the planning and

18 allocation of water resources, and to protect public trust whenever feasible. As a lead agency

19 under CEQA, DWR has an independent duty to perform a public a trust consistency analysis,

20 based on substantial evidence in the record, as part of an adequate CEQA review.
STANDING

21 89.

22 Plaintiffs--constituents of Plaintiff counties, landowners, water rights holders and

23 beneficial users of water, including counties and other public entities-are located in the Delta

24 and rely on surface water and groundwater for their homes, businesses, recreation, and irrigation

25 requirements. Plaintiffs rely on Delta water and Delta waterways in their participation in the

26 economy of the region. Constituents of Plaintiff counties, landowners, water rights holders and
beneficial water users use

27 the waters, including groundwater, affected by DWR's proposed

28 Project, for agriculture, recreation, wildlife habitat, open space as well as residential,
commercial, municipal and institutional uses. The Project impairs these beneficial uses of water

37
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

1 by negatively impacting water quantities, levels, quality, and circulation, among other impacts.
2 The Project's impacts on biological resources, including impacts to protected species, also

3 impairs these Plaintiffs' use and enjoyment of the Delta region for recreational and other uses.

4 90. Thus, Plaintiffs' interests have been, are being, and will continue to be adversely

5 affected by Defendants' failure to comply with applicable law, and by the proposed Project's

6 likely dramatic negative impacts to resources including but not limited to, groundwater, surface

7 waters, and associated species, ecosystems, and human uses. Consequently, Plaintiffs would be

8 directly, adversely, and irreparably harmed by the Project and its components, as described

9 herein, until and unless this Court provides the relief prayed for in this complaint.
10 91. Plaintiffs have no other adequate remedy at law, and they bring this action on
11 behalf of their adversely affected constituents and members.

12 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

13 92. The Plaintiffs in this litigation have participated extensively in the administrative
14 process, including attending public meetings and submitting detailed comments throughout the
15| administrative process. Plaintiff County of San Joaquin submitted comments on the DEIR/S on
16 July 25, 2014, the RDEIR/S on October 27, 2015 and on the FEIR/S on January 30, 2017.
17 Plaintiff CDWA likewise submitted comments on every version of the EIR/S, including:
18 DEIR/S comments submitted on July 27, 28, and 29, 2014; RDEIR/S comments submitted on

19 October 30, 2015, and EIR/S comments submitted on January 30, 2017. Plaintiff SDWA also
20 submitted comments on all Project EIRs: DEIR/S on July 25, 2014; RDEIR/S on October 30,
21 2015, and on the EIR/S on January 30, 2017. LAND submitted comments on the DEIR/S on
22 July 29, 2014, on the RDEIR/S on October 28 and 30, 2015, and on the EIR/S on January 30,

7 CAUSES OF ACTION

8 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

9 VIOLATIONS OF CEQA

10 (Against DWR)

11 102. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained in
Paragraphs 1 through 101 as though fully set forth herein.

12

13 The EIR/S Content and the Process Leading Up to Its Certification Violated Key Requirements of CEQA

14 103.

15 DWR prejudicially abused its discretion in certifying the EIR/S. DWR did not
proceed in the manner

16 required by law, and its decisions in approving the Project and certifying

17 the EIR/S are not supported by substantial evidence. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21168.5.) These
legal deficiencies include, without limitation, the following:

18

19 104. A court evaluating an agency's procedural compliance "determine[s] de novo
whether the agency has employed the correct procedures, scrupulously enforcing all legislatively
20 mandated CEQA requirements." (Citizens for a Sustainable Treasure Island v. City and County
21

22 of San Francisco (2014) 227 Cal.App.4th 1036, 1045.) "[T]he existence of substantial evidence

23 supporting the agency's ultimate decision ... is not relevant when one is assessing a violation of

24 [CEQA's] information disclosure provisions." (Communities for a Better Environment v. City
of 'Richmond (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 70, 82 (CBE).)
25

26 105. Thus, an allegation that the EIR does not contain required information is an

27 allegation of procedural error and is reviewed de novo. Examples include: failure to describe

28 the entire project (Citizens Association for Sensible Development of Bishop Area v. County of
Inyo (1985) 172 Cal.App.3d 151, 165-166), failure to describe the environmental setting and

40
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

- baseline (San Joaquin Raptor/Wildlife Rescue Center v. County of Stanislaus (1994) 27

2 Cal.App.4th 713, 722-723); and deferral of the development of mitigation measures (CBE,

3 supra, 184 Cal.App.4th at 90).

4 106. DWR committed a number of procedural errors in performing its environmental

5 review of the Project, as further described herein below.

6 The Project Objectives are Impermissibly Narrow
7 107. The project objective must illuminate all elements of the project's underlying

8 purpose. (Habitat & Watershed Caretakers v. City of Santa Cruz (2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 1277,

9 1300.) However, project objectives must not be so narrowly defined that they preclude
10 Il consideration of reasonable alternatives for achieving the project's underlying purpose. (North
11 Coast Rivers Alliance v. Kawamura (2015) 243 Cal.App.4th 647, 668.) The EIR/S
12 impermissibly narrowed the Project objectives in precisely this way.
13 The final Project objective listed in the CEQA Findings is:
14 To identify new operations and a new configuration for conveyance of water
15 entering the Delta from the Sacramento River watershed to the existing SWP and CVP pumping plants in the southern Delta by considering conveyance options in
16 the north Delta that can reliably deliver water at costs that are not so high as to preclude, and in amounts that are sufficient to support, the financing of the
17 investments necessary to fund construction and operation of facilities and/or improvements.
18 (CEQA Findings, p. 30, emphasis added.)

19 108. Neither the EIR/S nor the CEQA Findings provide any logical or evidentiary
20 support for why "new operations and a new configuration for conveyance of water" are
21 necessary to achieve the Project purposes "to improve the movement of water entering the Delta
22 from the Sacramento Valley watershed to the existing SWP and CVP pumping plants located in
23 the southern Delta in a manner that minimizes or avoids adverse effects to listed species,
24 supports coordinated operation with the SWP, and is consistent with the Project Objectives."
25 (FEIR/S, p. 2-4.)

26 109. DWR misused Project objectives to foreclose the possibility of analyzing Project
27 alternatives that satisfy the Project's basic purpose, but not the agency's predetermined
28 preference for new conveyance structures. DWR's intent to foreclose all alternatives without

41
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

1 new conveyance structures has been evident in BDCP planning since at least 2007, when DWR

2 barred any entity from participating in the BDCP Steering Committee unless it signed onto the

3 Planning Agreement endorsing the construction of isolated conveyance.

4 110. The inclusion of a Project objective requiring "new" conveyance thus

5 impermissibly narrows the Project's objectives and the EIR/S's analysis of a reasonable range of

6 alternatives.

7 The Project Description Is Shifting, Incomplete and Inadequate

8 111. The EIR/S's Project description describes Project elements in such indefinite

9 terms, or omits descriptions entirely, that the EIR/S lacks a Project description that permits
10 analysis of Project impacts at a "project" level.
11 112. CEQA requires that an EIR include an accurate project description and fully
12 disclose and fairly evaluate the nature and objective of a project. (San Joaquin Raptor Rescue
13 Center v. County of Merced (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 646, 655.) An EIR must contain a
14 "sufficient degree of analysis to provide decision-makers with information which enables them

15 to make a decision which intelligently takes account of environmental consequences." (CEQA
16 Guidelines, § 15151.)

17 113. The EIR/S's project description is legally deficient because it omits significant
18 components of a legally sufficient project description that would permit informed decision-
19 making. Some examples of this deficiency are described below.
20 114. The EIR/S fails to provide sufficient technical information about the preferred
21 Project alternative (4A) to allow informed decision-making.

22 115. Project alignment, alignment features, and alignment geotechnical information are
23 currently considered preliminary. Project engineering is only a little over 10 percent complete.
24 116. The EIR/S is deficient as an informational document for the public and decision-
25 makers because it treats Project facility locations, dimensions, and elevations as being
26 approximate, not specific.

27 117. The EIR/S fails to describe the Project's Adaptive Management operations.
28 According to the Delta Independent Science Board's ("DISB's") comments on the FEIR/S, "A

42
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

compelling case of adaptive management implementation to mitigate environmental impacts of

2 the projects over the long term is lacking."

3 118. An adaptive management plan may properly be part of a complete project
4 description and/or provide mitigation under CEQA if the lead agency adopts enforceable
5 performance standards. (See CEQA Guidelines, § 15126.6, subd. (a)(2).) As pointed out by the

6 NAS and the DISB, the Adaptive Management described in the EIR/S lacks critical information

7 such as species-specific thresholds and timelines for action, specific scenarios with target

8 thresholds and alternatives, and commitments and funding needed for the development of

9 effective adaptive management. Instead, the EIR/S claims that adaptive management will be
10 developed during the early years of Project implementation. In order to be effective, this plan
11 must be in place before project initiation. The EIR/S also lacks any discussion of the potential
12 impediments or constraints on implementing adaptive management that have been identified in

13 other Delta projects.

14 119. The EIR/S fails to include Delta levees and channels and their required
15 maintenance as a Project component, despite the fact that the Project includes continued reliancel

16 on through-Delta conveyance for operation of the South Delta pumps. Failure to include these
17 structures in the Project description precludes a legally sufficient impacts analysis.

18 120. The EIR/S fails to provide sufficient locations, maps, figures, and boundaries
19 showing precisely where various Project elements would be constructed and which parcels are
20 considered to be within the Project's footprint.
21 121. The EIR/S fails to disclose the specific location and design features of
22 approximately 20 miles of permanent new transmission lines and 38 miles of temporary
23 transmission lines included as Project components. Nor are locations of replacements for
24 existing transmission lines disclosed.

25 122. The EIR/S fails to disclose basic critical information about proposed tunnel muck
26 (referred to as "reusable tunnel material" or "RTM" in the EIR/S) disposal sites, including
27 precise location, size, shape, water infiltration rates, and peak rainfall events. This information
28 is necessary to be able to disclose and analyze the Project's impacts, including impacts to local

43
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

-

2 water supply and drainage facilities, agricultural and biological resources, as well as water
quality impacts due to runoff or sedimentation from these sites.

3 123. The EIR/S fails to disclose relevant information about

4 proposed borrow pitting

5 activities associated with Project construction. The EIR/S does not identify the origin of the

6 borrow fill or the locations of borrow pits necessary to construct the Project. This information is

7 necessary to disclose and analyze water quality, hazardous materials, traffic, air quality and

8 other impacts due to extraction and transportation of and runoff from these materials.

9 124. Project construction would require the removal of 21 million cubic yards of soil

10 via borrow pitting, resulting in significant unanalyzed impacts. Due to the geology and

11 geography of the Delta, locations with usable soil for borrow are limited. If borrow is obtained

12 locally, it would need to either be barged or trucked in for dewatering treatment and unfilled

13 borrow pits would be left throughout the Project area. Local borrow fill could also contain toxic|

14 constituents that would create potentially significant hazard impacts; no testing has been done to

15 evaluate this risk. The EIR/S fails to analyze these potentially significant impacts.
125.

16 The EIR/S fails to adequately define the processes necessary for reclamation of

17 borrow pits. Under the Surface Mining and Reclamation Act (Pub. Resources Code, § 2710 § et

18 seq. ["SMARA") borrow pitting constitutes a surface mining activity. Borrow pitting would

19 occur in Yolo, Sacramento, Solano, San Joaquin, and Contra Costa Counties. The EIR/S fails to

20 disclose all of the reclamation plans required pursuant to local and/or state authority.

21 126. The EIR/S fails to disclose information about the exact sizes and locations of the

22 construction areas that would surround the intake sites during multi-year construction, and the

23 locations of the batch plant and fuel stations that would be located at each site.

24 127. Elements of the Project which were described in the 2013 BDCP documents as

25 Conservation Measures are now characterized as "Environmental Commitments" without

26 clearly explaining whether the two have exactly the same components and would be

27 implemented in the same way, or explaining the differences between the two.

28 128. The Project description fails to identify the source and locations of the
supplemental water supplies that would be necessary to implement bypass flow and new spring

44
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

-

2 Delta outflow requirements. These supplemental supplies are integral to assumptions about

3 Project operations, impacts, and water supply yields. Reliance on supplemental water supplies

4 from areas north of the Delta would also cause groundwater substitution and lead to undisclosed

5 groundwater impacts in those areas; the EIR/S does not sufficiently address these environmental
impacts.

6

7 129. The EIR/S fails to provide a Project operations plan. The effects analysis provided

8 is merely a simulation of one possible of how the Project "might" be operated. The EIR/S

9 provides no definite plan showing how the Project will be operated.

10 130. The EIR/S relies on a "range" of Project operations and fails to identify specific or

11 particular operating criteria necessary for identifying and evaluating the Project's impacts.

12 DWR substantially changed the range of potential Project operations from the RDEIR/S to the

13 Final EIR/S. In the former, a single operating scenario, Alternative 4A, was evaluated. In the

14 a latter, a broader range of operational scenarios was presented as the proposed Project, but the

15 certified FEIR/S does not analyze the potentially significant impacts associated with the full
range of operational scenarios.

16

17 131. Operational changes throughout the environmental review process include

18 substantially reduced Delta outflows in late summer and fall months, which would cause

19 potentially significant impacts to water quality. These impacts include but are not limited to the
increased proliferation of HABs, such as toxic Microcystis. The EIR/S fails to disclose these
20 | ongoing changes.

21 132. The EIR/S discusses the importance of monitoring with respect to evaluating
22 operational impacts; however, it provides no information on the objectives, types, geographic
23

24 distributions, data management, assessment and reporting for the monitoring program.

25 133. The EIR/S fails to provide sufficient locations, maps, figures, boundaries, and
other site-specific information showing precisely where the extensive geotechnical and
26 environmental surveys (including borings, test-pits, cone penetrometer tests and other activities)
27

28 will be performed to gather construction design information and other construction and
implementation related information, nor does the EIR/S provide sufficient information

45
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

.)

1 describing the nature and extent of those surveys. As with the other omitted information, such

2 information is necessary to sufficiently disclose, analyze and mitigate the site-specific and

3 cumulative impacts from those surveys.

4 134. The EIR/S indicates that the Adaptive Management and Monitoring Program

5 ("AMMP") will serve as a means to change Project operations beyond permitted limits.

6 Pursuant to "new science," "appropriate agencies," within their "respective authorities" would

7 determine whether operational changes that fall outside of the operational ranges evaluated in

8 the Biological Opinion should be implemented. The EIR/S, however, does not indicate what the

9 "*appropriate agencies" might be, what are or will be the limits of their "respective authorities,"

10 or what type of "new science" may influence this decision-making.
11 135. The EIR/S does not indicate whether the Boundary scenarios evaluated by DWR
12 for the WaterFix Change Petition Proceedings at the SWRCB (known as Boundary 1 and
13 Boundary 2) represent "bookends" for proposed operations, or whether future operations may
14 fall outside of the range represented by Boundaries and 2. The impacts of such changed
15 operations are also not analyzed in the EIR/S.

16 136. The EIR/S fails to provide accurate information regarding the Project costs.
17 DWR, both in the EIR/S and in public statements made during the review process, has
18 repeatedly stated that all costs for the Project would be paid by Project beneficiaries. However,
19 DWR's validation action reveals that the Project would require billions of dollars in subsidies.
20 CEQA requires "government agencies at all levels to consider .. . economic and technical
21 factors." (Pub. Res. Code, § 21001, subd. (g).) DWR failed to do so by not disclosing the
22 Project's need for public subsidy.
23 The EIR/S Impermissibly Piecemeals Environmental Review of the Project
24 137. A lead agency must perform a comprehensive review of the full environmental
25 consequences of a project, referred to as the "whole of the action," prior to taking a necessary
26 first step toward that project. A lead agency under CEQA may not avoid including analysis of
27 smaller or related projects that actually comprise part of the larger project. This rule prohibiting
28 "piecemealing" is intended to assure "that environmental considerations not become submerged

46
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

A

1 by chopping a large project into many little ones, each with a potential impact on the

2 environment, which cumulatively may have disastrous consequences." (Burbank-Glendale-

3 Pasadena Airport Authority v. Hensler (1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 577, 592.) The EIR/S violated

4 CEQA by failing to analyze the whole of the action. Some examples of this deficiency are

5 described below.

6 138. Several remaining approvals would likely change the Project in ways that require
7 comprehensive review under CEQA. Approvals not yet completed at the time of EIR/S

8 certification include, but are not limited to: Section 401 of the Clean Water Act Water

9 certification by the SWRCB; Lake and Streambed Alteration Agreement by DFW; Clean Water
10 Act Section 404 fill permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ("USACE"); Clean Water
11 Act section 408 fill permit from the USACE; approval of a water rights change petition by the
12 SWRCB to permit diversion of water from the Sacramento River in the north Delta; review of
13 any appeal from consistency determination by the Delta Stewardship Council; issuance of
14 Biological Opinions by the USFWS and NOAA Fisheries, and numerous other state, regional
15 and local approvals. These remaining approvals will likely lead to new and different terms and
16| conditions, mitigation measures or project changes that have not yet been disclosed or analyzed
17 pursuant to CEQA.

18 139. Delaying analysis and mitigation of an impact until the permitting phase of a
19 project conflicts with CEQA's policy of integrated review (Pub. Resources Code, § 21003, subd.
20 (a)), and such deferral is therefore impermissible. (Banning Ranch Conservancy v. City of
21 Newport Beach (2017) 2 Cal.5th 918, 939-41.)

22 140. The EIR/S impermissibly segments and piecemeals environmental review of the
23 Project by separating environmental analysis of implementation of the 2008 and 2009 BOs,
24 EcoRestore, and other related projects in order to obscure the true extent of Project impacts.
25 These impacts include, but are not limited to, impacts from attempted "restoration" of areas that
26 have been in other uses, including farming, for 100 years or more.
27 141. The EIR/S segments and piecemeals environmental review of the Project by
28 omitting a description of the long-term operations of the CVP and SWP, actions required by the

47
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

O P

- 2008 and 2009 BOs, and other requirements of state and federal law that will be imposed on

2 Project construction and operation. Specifically, while DWR purportedly "recommitted" to

3 implement portions of the 2008 and 2009 BOs in approving the Project, including Reasonable

4 and Prudent Alternative Actions 1.6 and 1.7 from the 2009 BO, it has not adopted or certified an

5 environmental document for a project implementing those actions. DWR's approval of the

6 Project is therefore both premature and legally deficient under CEQA because it depends on
7 future habitat restoration in the Yolo Bypass such as the Yolo Bypass Salmonid Habitat

8 Restoration and Fish Passage project ("Yolo Bypass project") and other similar projects that

9 have been neither studied nor approved.

10 142. In addition, DWR has impermissibly deferred analysis of Project impacts to
11 flooding and flood control measures, indicating that analysis will occur following certification
12 of the EIR/S, without any commitment that independent CEQA review will be performed on
13 these impacts at that later date. DWR could have performed this analysis as part of CEQA
14 review of the Project and this constitutes an impermissible piecemealing of review of Project
15 impacts.

16 The EIR/S Fails to Adequately Define the Project's Baseline
17 143. In order to determine whether a project's impacts will be significant, CEQA
18 requires lead agencies to compare the impact of a proposed project to the "physical
19 environmental conditions in the vicinity of the project, as they exist at the time the notice of
20 preparation is published." These conditions serve as the project's "baseline." (CEQA
21 § Guidelines, § 15125.) The description of the project's baseline ensures that the public has "an
22 understanding of the significant effects of the proposed project and its alternatives." (CEQA
23 Guidelines § 15125, subd. (a). Accurately determining the baseline environmental conditions is
24 crucial to accurately evaluating a project's impact. (E.g., San Joaquin Raptor/Wildlife Rescue
25 Ctr. v. County of Stanislaus (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 713, 722-723.) The EIR/S failed to evaluate

26 the comparative merits of the alternatives in a manner that was reasonably calculated to inform
27 the public.

28

48
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

-

1 144.

2 The EIR/S's description of baseline conditions is alternatively incomplete and

3 inaccurate, infecting and invalidating the entirety of the EIR/S's environmental analysis. The

4 EIR/S' deficiencies include, but are not limited to, the following examples.
145.

5 The EIR/S relies on different baselines to analyze the impacts of the Project

6 alternatives, thereby not providing a meaningful comparison of impacts among project

7 alternatives. By relying on a Late Long term (2060) a baseline to evaluate the impacts of some

8 alternatives, such as Alternative 4, and relying on an Early Long Term (2035) baseline to

9 evaluate other alternatives, such as the proposed Project Alternative 4A, it is impossible to
compare the impacts of the alternatives.

10 146.

11 The EIR/S fails to comply with the requirement that the baseline must be

12 "realistic" and give the "most accurate picture possible" of the project's likely impacts.

13 (Neighbors for Smart Rail v. Exposition Metro Line Const. Authority (2013) 57 Cal.4th 439,

14 507.) Here the baseline fails to meet the required standard of realism and accuracy.
147.

15 The EIR/S fails to include an up-to-date description of the environmental baseline.

16 The EIR/S uses an environmental setting baseline that is tied to the February 13, 2009 NOP of

17 the EIR/S for the BDCP. This approach is not reasonable for the Project, which was not

18 8 approved by DWR until 8 years after publication of the NOP, and would not be operational until

19 2029 at the earliest, 20 years after publication of the NOP. As a result of using an outdated

20 baseline, the EIR/S does not consider the Central Valley Flood Protection Plan, though the

21 Project would have to coordinate with this plan throughout Project construction, and,

22 potentially, operations. The EIR/S also fails to discuss over-allocated water entitlements that

23 create unrealistic demands for Delta water, or "paper water." The SWP only supplies

24 approximately half of its entitlements to contract water per year. (Planning & Conservation

25 League V. Department of Water Resources (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 892, 899.) Courts have

26 criticized planning based on paper water, recognizing the "huge gap between what is promised

27 and what can be delivered." (Id. at 908, fn. 5.) The EIR/S baseline should have been adjusted to

28 include conditions existing close to the time of its release. Failure to use accurate and current

49
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

.

- data, including updated modeling and other information, constitutes a failure to proceed in the

2 manner required by law.

3 148. The EIR/S impermissibly treats the No Action Alternative, including actions that

4 must be taken pursuant to the 2008 and 2009 BOs, as the baseline condition. Yet many of the

5 actions required by the 2008 and 2009 BOs (such as 28,000 acres of habitat restoration now

6 called "Eco-Restore") have not yet been evaluated, approved, or implemented.
7 149. The baseline conditions fail to analyze how much water is needed to meet existing

8 obligations and priorities in the watershed. The EIR/S formulation of baseline environmental

9 conditions fails to provide accurate information regarding existing surface water and
10 groundwater supply and demand; it falsely cites ongoing unsustainable and illegal Delta water
11 exports to establish a baseline for future exports and fails to describe existing over-allocated
12 water entitlements. Further, it fails to describe how many water rights and diversions exist in
13 the Project area, and their locations.

14 150. The EIR/S fails to disclose baseline conditions for existing groundwater supplies,
15 uses and infrastructure in the vicinity of the proposed tunnels. (See Groundwater Wells in

16 Vicinity of Intakes and Tunnels, attached hereto as Exhibit G.) Standing alone, this failure
17 renders the EIR/S inadequate as an informational document.
18 151. The EIR/S description of baseline environmental conditions fails to disclose that

19 DWR and Reclamation consistently violate existing water quality standards in the South Delta.
20 152. The EIR/S concedes that most of the Project footprint has not been surveyed for
21 cultural resources, including architectural artifacts, So it is unknown what the baseline conditions
22 for those resources is; this renders the EIR/S deficient as an informational document.

23 153. The EIR/S fails to disclose the environmental baseline of soils and seismic

24 conditions for most of the Project footprint because DWR failed to access the private land
25 within the proposed Project footprint to perform drilling, boring, and petrologic analysis.
26 The EIR/S Uses Inadequate Thresholds of Significance to Analyze Impacts
27 154. The thresholds of significance used in the EIR/S fail to comply with CEQA.
28 Deficiencies include, but are not limited to, the following.

50
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

1 155. The EIR/S's impact analysis fails to use thresholds of significance tailored to the

2 impacts of this Project. For a project of this magnitude, it is critical that the lead agency adopt

3 thresholds of significance that account for the breadth and scale of potential impacts, rather than

4 blindly relying on the "cookbook" suggestions provided in CEQA Guidelines Appendix G. The

5 EIR/S therefore fails to provide decision-makers with sufficient disclosure and analysis of

6 numerous potential environmental impacts.

7 156. The EIR/S relied on Appendix G for its threshold of significance for a number of

8 resource areas. (FEIR/S 11-258 [fish and aquatic resources], 22-42 [relying on Appendix G for

9 air quality significance thresholds where local air district has not assigned a threshold].)
10 157. For example, in analyzing air quality, the EIR/S used the thresholds of
11 significance for construction projects adopted by the relevant air quality district to determine
12 whether the Project's emission of pollutants was significant. Where the air quality district had
13 not established a threshold for a particular pollutant, the EIR/S failed a to establish a threshold of

14 significance, and determined that any level of construction emissions would be less than

15 significant. This approach to designating thresholds of significance is unsupportable; air

16 districts develop thresholds of significance for construction to address the impacts of short-term
17 construction projects on the respective airshed's air quality, not the impacts of a massive
18 construction project that spans three air basins and requires 14 years of construction.
19 158. The EIR/S used a threshold of significance for surface water impacts based on an
20 "increase in highest monthly flows when flood potential is high in the Sacramento River,"
21 (FEIR/S, p. 6-48) but had no corresponding threshold that would analyze the significance of a
22 decrease in flow.

23 159. The EIR/S used thresholds of significance for agricultural resources that focused
24 only on situations where agricultural land is converted, either temporarily or permanently, to
25 non-agricultural uses. This ignores impacts that degrade the quality of the land or available
26 water that a require a change in farming practices or result in lower crop production or quality.

1 160. The EIR/S failed to adopt any thresholds of significance that account for how

2 from Project impacts in another resource area as Project impacts in one resource area may result
3 a result of the massive scale of the Project.

4 161. Various drafts of the EIR/S included changes in significance determinations for

5 several impacts without adequate substantiation. For instance, certain groundwater, water

6 quality and public health impact determinations were inexplicably changed from significant in

7 the DEIR/S and/or the RDEIR/S to less than significant in the FEIR/S.

8 The EIR/S Does Not Reflect DWR's Independent Judgment
9 162. CEQA requires a lead agency to prepare and circulate an EIR that reflects the lead
10 agency's independent judgment, and not the judgment of the applicant. CEQA also requires the
11 lead agency to independently review and analyze the EIR that is prepared for a project. (Pub.
12 Resources Code, § 21082.1.) DWR failed to prepare and circulate an EIR that reflects DWR's
13 independent judgment.

14 163. The entire formulation of the Project and the subsequent environmental review has
been tainted by improper influence from the water contractors that expect to receive water as a 15

16 result of the Project. DWR has allowed the water contractors to make decisions about how to

17 prepare the EIR/S and how to comply with CEQA and agreed to develop a project based on the
18 water contractors' decision-making, rather than DWR's own independent judgment. A lead
19 agency cannot delegate its own legal responsibilities under CEQA to a third party. (California
20 Clean Energy Committee v. City of Woodland (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 173, 194; Sundstrom v.
21 County of Mendocino (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 296, 307.) On information and belief, the EIR/S
22 reflects the water contractors' judgment and not DWR's independent judgment.
23 164. By failing to prepare, circulate, and certify an EIR reflecting its own independent
24 | judgment, DWR failed to proceed in a manner required by law.
25 DWR Failed to Adequately Analyze Alternatives to its Predetermined Tunnels Project
26 165. The EIR/S failed to include an adequate analysis of alternatives to the Project.
27 The EIR/S' deficiencies include, but are not limited to, the following examples.
28

52

P

1 166. DWR unreasonably constrained the initial formulation of alternatives to those

2 alternatives that included some form of new conveyance in the North Delta. While the Project

3 objectives changed over the course of the change from the preferred project being an HCP to

4 being a project permitted under Section 10 of the ESA, DWR never considered non-conveyance

5 alternatives that would reduce the potentially significant impacts of the Project as required by

6 CEQA in the initial formulation of alternatives. This predetermination that new conveyance
7 must be included in all alternatives unreasonably constrained the EIR/S alternatives analysis in

8 violation of CEQA Guidelines section 15004, subdivision (b)(2), which provides, "[P]ublic

o agencies shall not undertake actions concerning the proposed public project that would have a
10 significant adverse effect or limit the choice of alternatives or mitigation measures, before
11 completion of CEQA compliance."

12 167. Doubling down on its predetermination that the Project must include a new
13 conveyance, as early as 2008, DWR forced members of the public interested in participating in
14 the formulation of alternatives to:

15 agree[] that the most promising approach for achieving the BDCP conservation
16 and water supply goals involves a conveyance system with new points of diversion The new physical feature of this conveyance system includes the construction
17 and operation of a new point (or points) of diversion in the north Delta on the Sacramento River and an isolated conveyance facility around the Delta.
18 (2008 Memorandum of Agreement for Collaboration of Delta Habitat Conservation and
19 Conveyance Program, Planning Phase, p. 3.) The mandate that public participants agree to the
20 new conveyance was later reaffirmed in 2010: "We hereby confirm our support for a focused
21 analysis of the tunnel conveyance approach." (BDCP Steering Committee, February 11, 2010
22 Conveyance Approach for Effects Analysis for the BDCP.) Thus, DWR predetermined at least
23 nine years ago that it would consider only those alternatives including new conveyance, and also
24 attempted to condition public participation on acceptance of that predetermination. This
25 conduct violates CEQA's prohibition against "tak[ing] any action which gives impetus to a
26 planned or foreseeable project in a manner that forecloses alternatives or mitigation measures
27 that would ordinarily be part of CEQA review of that public project." (CEQA Guidelines, §
28 15004, subd. (b)(2)(B).)

53

1 168. The No Project Alternative is deficient because it is impermissibly speculative.
2 The EIR/S makes judgments about future conditions related to climate change and incorporates

3 those into the No Project Alternative. The EIR/S fails to adequately account for the fact that
4 future climate change impacts, and the timeline on which they may occur, are uncertain; nor

5 does the EIR/S adequately support incorporation of specific climate change assumptions into the

6 No Project Alternative.

7 169. The No-Project base case model runs were flawed because they included frequent

8 unlawful violations of SWRCB water quality standards. These violations would not be

o permitted to occur in actual Delta operations. The with-Project simulations also frequently
10 violated SWRCB standards rendering these water quality analyses unacceptable for disclosing
11 the environmental impacts of the proposed project. The Project proponents' use of monthly
12 Delta flows to simulate Delta operations that are regulated on a daily basis, and the use of a
13 combination of monthly and daily flow data as input to the water quality modeling, resulted in
14 unrealistic large spikes in salinity that also rendered the water quality modeling unacceptable for
15 disclosing the water quality impacts of the Project. The mismatch between monthly time steps
16 for the operations modeling and partial month closures of Delta flow barriers resulted in

17 unrealistically high Delta outflows in October which significantly underestimated the potential
18 water quality impacts of the proposed Project in the fall.

19 170. The No Project Alternative is also deficient for failing to incorporate the 2008
20 FWS BO and 2009 NOAA BO. DWR and BOR improperly separated the analysis of the
21 Project from BOR's incorporation of reasonable and prudent alternatives ("RPA") into its
22 coordinated Long Term Operation of the CVP and SWP ("LTO EIS"). The RPAs in the LTO
23 EIS are the specific parameters that the 2008 FWS BO and 2009 NOAA BO set to prevent harm
24 to sensitive species. The failure to account for these already-existing requirements established
25 in the BOs prevents adequate analysis of the No Project Alternative.

26 171. The EIR/S failed to include a reasonable range of alternatives and to provide
27 adequate detail about the alternatives to allow the public to assess those alternatives' ability to
28

54
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

1 meet Project objectives or to assess their respective environmental impacts. (Pub. Resources

2 Code, § 21002; CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15126.6, 15002.)

3 172. Because the only two alternatives to the new proposed Project included in the

4 RDEIR/S would not avoid or substantially lessen any of the proposed Project's significant

5 impacts, or were not practical or feasible from the technical and economic standpoint, the

6 RDEIR/S failed to satisfy CEQA's requirements that an EIR analyze a reasonable range of

7 alternatives.

8 173. The Project objective to "[r]estore and protect the ability of the [CVP and SWP] to

9 deliver full contract amounts" improperly constrained the identification and development of
10 Project alternatives. Among other deficiencies, this Project objective does not properly relate to
11 the environmental impacts of the Project and is therefore a non-basic Project objective that
12 cannot be used to reject any alternative.

13 174. Project alternatives that could reduce take of state and federally listed species werel

14 available, and have been suggested by Plaintiffs and others throughout the development of the
15 Project, but were not considered.

16 175. Reduced export alternatives would reduce take of state and federally listed species
17 and should have been considered. (See Habitat & Watershed Caretakers v. City of Santa Cruz
18 (2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 1277, 1304 [potentially feasible alternative that might avoid a
19 significant impact must be discussed and analyzed in an EIR so as to provide information to the
20 decision maker about the alternative's potential for reducing environmental impacts].)
21 176. The EIR/S failed to provide a good faith, reasoned response to commenters who
22 suggested the inclusion of alternatives that would mitigate significant environmental impacts
23 while achieving most Project objectives, including but not limited to: an alternative that utilized
24 conservation and desalination, an alternative location for intakes, alternatives that include
25 improvements to the South Delta diversions to reduce take of protected fish species, and an
26 alternative that would significantly increase Delta outflows.
27 177. The EIR/S failed to include an Alternatives Scoping Report in the RDEIR/S that
28 included necessary information about the newly included alternatives.

55
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

1 178. The EIR/S did not consider any alternatives that maintained and improved existing
2 infrastructure. The EIR/S considered only alternatives relying on new conveyance, as opposed

3 to consideration of any through-Delta conveyance alternatives that would reduce exports. The

4 NAS reviewed the draft BDCP in 2011 and commented on the fundamental lack of integrity in

5 DWR's approach: "[c]hoosing the alternative project before evaluating alternative ways to reach

6 a preferred outcome would be post hoc rationalization--in other words, putting the cart before
7 the horse. Scientific reasons for not considering alternative actions are not presented in the

8 plan." (National Academy of Sciences (May 5, 2011, Report in Brief, p. 2.)

9 179. Improvements to the existing South Delta export pumps could meet the Project
10 objectives relating to improved water supplies by facilitating export of water without take of
11 state and federally listed species. The EIR/S failed to include any alternative that included
12 improvements and/or fish screen installation at the South Delta export pumps without new
13 NDDs.

14 180. One of the primary stated purposes of the Project is "regulatory assurance and
15 stability"; several of the Project alternatives in the FEIR/S purport to comply with the
16 Endangered Species Act without an HCP/NCCP. Project alternatives lacking this element
17 provide no regulatory assurance, and therefore do not satisfy the Project's purpose and need not
18 and should not have been considered as viable Project alternatives.

19 181. The EIR/S' reasonable range of alternatives must be comprised of alternatives that
20 are legally and otherwise "feasible." Because, as explained elsewhere herein, nearly all of the
21 alternatives included in that range contain an isolated conveyance facility and other components
22 that are contrary to one or more laws and are otherwise infeasible, none of those alternatives
23 meets the requisite "feasibility" to be eligible for inclusion in that mandatory range. The

24 EIR/S's mandatory reasonable range of feasible alternatives is, accordingly, fatally deficient.
25 182. The EIR/S fails to integrate a discussion of other actions by agencies with
26 permitting authority over sensitive natural resources. When there is credible evidence that
27 sensitive natural resources, for instance, are within the project area, an EIR must discuss other
28 agencies' authority over those resources and discuss how the project alternatives have been

56
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

-

2 devised to anticipate that authority. (Banning Ranch Conservancy v. City of Newport Beach

3 (2017) 2 Cal.5th 918, 938.) This failure to integrate and disclose the ramifications of other

4 agencies' actions for the project alternatives renders the EIR/S discussion of alternatives
inadequate.

5

6 The FEIR/S Failed to Adequately Respond to Comments

7 183. The FEIR/S failed to respond in good faith to public comments raising

8 deficiencies with the document. Instead, the FEIR/S offers a litany of boiler plate language,
conclusory statements, and vague documentary references unsupported by specific reference to
9 explanatory information, that are insufficient to comply with CEQA's public participation
10 requirements. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15088, subd. (c).) The FEIR/S' deficiencies include, but
11 are not limited to, the following examples.

12 184.

13 Where experts disagree about an EIR's data or methodology, the EIR should

14 summarize main points of disagreement and explain why expert comments have been rejected.

15 (CEQA Guidelines, § 15151; see also Berkeley Keep Jets Over the Bay Comm. V. Bd. of Port

16 Commissioners (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1344, 1367, 1371.) The FEIR/S fails to include these

critical disclosures.

17

18 185. The FEIR/S failed to provide a reasoned, good faith response to comments

19 addressing the FEIR/S's failure to adequately analyze the Project's consistency with the Delta

Plan.

20 186.

21 The FEIR/S failed to provide a good faith response, as well as to comments

22 challenging the FEIR/S's characterization of the conversion of thousands of acres of Delta
agricultural land as "temporary".
23

24 187. The FEIR/S repetitively responded to specific technical comments with responses

25 that refer generally to an entire chapter or appendix. Given the size of the document and the fact

26 that some chapters and appendices are thousands of pages long, and the fact that the discussion

27 of impacts to a resource may be spread throughout an EIR, such a general response is a

28 insufficient to facilitate informed decision-making.

57
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

1 188. The FEIR/S responded to comments on the deficient analysis of noise impacts to

2 public schools by describing the results of supplemental analysis performed by DWR, but

3 expressly stated that this analysis was not part of the FEIR/S. By intentionally omitting the

4 supplemental analysis, the FEIR/S precluded interested stakeholders from assessing the validity

5 of its assumptions, calculations, and conclusions.

6 189. The FEIR/S' failure to adequately respond to comments renders it "fatally

7 defective." (People v. County of Kern (1974) 39 Cal.App.3d 830, 842.)

8 DWR Failed to Properly Consult with Local Agencies
9 190. DWR was required to consult with public agencies within, and adjacent to, the
10 area in which the Project would be located. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21104.) On information
11 and belief, DWR failed to consult as required by CEQA with public agency Plaintiffs herein

12 regarding their concerns about the Project, as required by Public Resources Code section 21104.
13 DWR Unreasonably Restrained the Public's Ability to Comment on the FEIR/S
14 191. On December 22, 2016, when DWR published the FEIR/S, it illegally restrained
15 public comment on the FEIR/S by permitting comment only until January 31, 2017, at which

16 point DWR announced that no further comments would be accepted, stating:
17 the end of the federal register notice period is intended by DWR to close the
18 period by which any person may submit to DWR any grounds for noncompliance with CEQA, CA Public Resources Code Section 21i77(a).
19 CEQA, however, does not authorize the exclusion of relevant information presenting grounds
20 for noncompliance months before a lead agency certifies an EIR and makes its decision on a
21 project. (See, e.g., Pub. Res. Code, §§ 21177 [exhaustion requirements]; 21167.6, subd. (b)
22 [describing administrative record contents].)

23 192. The FEIR/S failed to include redline changes to inform the reader of changes
24 made to the RDEIR/S. As a result, the a public had less than 45 days over the winter holidays to
25 scour some 80,000 pages to look for changes and new information.

26 193. When DWR finally approved the Project on July 21, 2017, DWR reversed course

27 and dropped its claim that letters received after the arbitrary and illegal January 31, 2017,
28

58
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

1 "deadline" for comments would not be considered, and included responses to many comments
2 received after January 31, 2017 and before July 21, 2017, in the FEIR/S.

3 194. DWR mislead the public as to what comments must be considered by the agency

4 and chilled public comment on the Project and the FEIR/S by stating it could limit public

5 comment on the Project prior to Project approval, contrary to CEQA.

6 195. DWR deprived the public of the ability to perform meaningful review of some

7 80,000 pages of analysis by not informing the public of what the revisions the RDEIR/were and
8 attempting to truncate the time period in which the public could comment to only 45 days.

9 196. DWR's actions constitute a failure to proceed in a manner prescribed by law.
10 The EIR/S Presents Information in a Fragmented and Incoherent Manner, Precluding the
11 EIR/S from Serving as an Effective Informational Document

12 197. EIRs must be organized and written in a manner that will make them "meaningful
13 and useful to decision-makers and to the public." (Pub. Resources Code, § 21003, subd. (b).)
14 EIRs must be written in plain language, and graphic means of presenting information should be
15 used to enhance an EIR's clarity. (CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15140, 15147.) An EIR must not be

16 written in a way that requires the reader "to sift through obscure minutiae or appendices" to find
17 important components of the analysis. (San Joaquin Raptor Rescue Ctr. v. County of Merced
18 (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 645, 649.)
19 198. The EIR/S is SO lengthy, poorly organized, and difficult to understand that it fails
20 egregiously to satisfy CEQA's most fundamental objective of informing decisionmakers and the
21 public of a project's potentially significant environmental effects. The EIR/S' organizational
22 deficiencies include, but are not limited to, the following.
23 199. The presentation of impact analyses across the 18 Project alternatives in the EIR/S

24 was fragmented to the point of being incomprehensible.
25 200. The EIR/S contains numerous contradictory and confusing statements that
26 obfuscate the Project's true impacts. For example, the EIR/S discussion of water transfer
27 impacts states both that "Alternative 4A would decrease water transfer demand compared to
28 existing conditions" and that "Alternative 4A would increase water transfer demand compared

59
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

1 to existing conditions." (EIR/S, p. 5-77 [discussion of "NEPA Effects" and "CEQA
2 Conclusion" respectively] [italics added].) The EIR/S also claims that Alternative 4A would

3 both "decrease conveyance capacity" and "increase conveyance capacity." (Ibid. [italics

4 added].) These contradictory statements create confusion and obscure Project impacts.

5 201. In addition to the fragmented presentation of the 18 Project alternatives, the EIR/S

6 was rendered unintelligible by the failure to integrate analyses of the Project's operational
7 boundaries as they differ under each alternative included in the FEIR/S.

8 202. The FEIR/S masks the impacts of the Boundary Scenario operations for

o Alternative 4A by incorrectly treating them as alternatives with Alternative 4A. (See FEIR/S,

10 Appendix 5E.) The Boundary Scenario operations of Alternative 4A would have significant
11 unavoidable impacts on water quality.

12 203. The EIR/S characterizes water supply impacts that would occur under the
13 - operational Boundaries 1 and 2 as falling within the "range" of alternatives analyzed in the
14 EIR/S modeling. However, the potential Project impacts to upstream reservoir operations and
15 water supply cannot be understood by general reference to the 18 different EIR alternatives and

16 the much broader range of "boundary conditions," and the differing modeling systems used for
17 the EIR/S and separate permitting processes. Project impacts can only be meaningfully
18 evaluated through distinct analyses of each alternative and its proposed operational boundaries.
19 204. The FEIR/S failed to include redline changes, thereby requiring the reader to sift
20 through some 80,000 pages of material to attempt to find new information and changes in the
21 analysis from the RDEIR/S.

22 205. Although commenters, including the DISB, strongly suggested use of readily
23 available means such as a clearer organizational structure, summaries and graphics, to improve
24 communication of Project alternatives and their impacts, DWR made no attempt to simplify its
25 presentation so that the public could comprehend the document.

26 206. DWR's actions constitute a failure to proceed in a manner prescribed by law.

2 DWR Failed to Recirculate the EIR/S after Adding Significant New Information to the RDEIR/S and to the FEIR'S

3

4 207. Recirculation under Public Resources Code section 21092.1 and CEQA

5 Guidelines section 15088.5, subdivision (a) was required due to the addition of "significant new

6 information" that "deprives the public of a meaningful opportunity to comment upon a

7 substantial adverse environmental effect of the project a or a feasible way to mitigate or avoid

8 such an effect after public review, but before certification of the EIR. (See also Pub. Resources

9 Code, § 21092.1; Laurel Heights Improvement Ass'n. V. Regents of University of California
(1993) 6 Cal.4th 1112, 1129-1130.)

10

11 208. DWR became aware of significant new information prior to certification of the

12 FEIR/S that mandated re-circulation, yet DWR refused to do so. This new information includes,
but is not limited to, the following.

13

14 209. After publication of the RDEIR/S, the public commented on the revelation that

15 SWP operations take significant risks with carryover storage to increase average deliveries, with

16 major impacts to water supply reliability and the ability to meet WQCP requirements. Because

17 SWP operations would be related to Project operations, this information disclosed new,

18 potentially significant impacts to water supply and water quality not disclosed in the EIR/S.

19 210. The FEIR/S disclosed for the first time that the Project may cause "[u]p to 5-foot

20 episodic lowering of groundwater levels beneath the Sacramento River due to lower flows in the

21 river as a result of diversions at the north Delta intakes that result in a reduction in river flows

22 and elevations." (FEIR/S, p. 7-88.) Expert comments on the FEIR/S groundwater explained

23 that application of the model actually showed up to 44 feet of reductions in groundwater. Yet

24 the EIR/S, without analysis, concludes that with Mitigation Measure GW-1, no additional
mitigation measures are required.
25

26 211. A 5- to 40-foot lowering of groundwater levels would impair the ability of newly
formed Groundwater Sustainability Agencies in the Project area to reach sustainability within 20
27 years of adoption of their Groundwater Sustainability Plans, as required by SGMA. In addition,
28 such changes in groundwater levels would cause a significant water supply and water quality

61
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

.

impacts to wells in the vicinity of the Project. (See Groundwater Wells in Vicinity of Intakes

2 and Tunnels, attached hereto as Exhibit G.) Without a localized assessment of scope of the

3 impacts on wells and identification of relevant, legally adequate mitigation measures, if

4 necessary, the public was deprived of a meaningful opportunity to comment on this potentially

5 significant impact and feasible mitigation.

6 212. Appendix 6A of the EIR/S reveals for the first time potential Project impacts
7 related to sedimentation, levee integrity, changes to drainage patterns, and risks of slope failure
8 during rainfall. (FEIR/S, 6A-32, 34.) This late and cursory discussion of potential new impacts

9 deprived the public of any meaningful opportunity to review, comment on, and receive

10 responses to comments on this material.

11 213. The June 2017 Biological Assessment ("2017 BA") and BOs introduce new and

12 different Project elements not analyzed in the EIR/S.

13 214. The 2017 BOs rely on spring Delta outflow criteria that was not disclosed or

14 analyzed in the CEQA process, and which could cause additional environmental impacts,
15 including impacts to groundwater in the Sacramento Valley that would be caused by
16 groundwater substitution if surface-water supplies upstream of the Delta must be relied upon to
17 meet Spring outflow criteria.

18 215. The 2017 BA deletes the Rio Vista 3,000 cfs minimum flow requirement. In
19 addition to providing protection to aquatic species, this requirement provided some protection
20 against salinity intrusion and other water quality impacts to agricultural, municipal and
21 industrial water users in the Delta, as well as related agricultural impacts. (See 2017 BA, p. 3-
22 97.) The 2017 BA also includes changes to the operations of the Delta Cross Channel that
23 would change the water quality impacts of the Project, in particular worsening water quality in
24 the South Delta from baseline conditions. (See 2017 BA, p. 3-95.) The Project proposed in the
25 RDEIR/S included Rio Vista Minimum Flow standards and no changes to the operation of the
26 Delta Cross Channel. (See, e.g., RDEIR/S, ES-18.) These and other Project changes in the
27 2017 BA, which are required to be implemented, required recirculation.

28

62
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

216. The 2017 FWS BO used a mixed standard/programmatic approach that delayed

2 the ESA permitting of critical Project elements, including the enormous intakes for the tunnels,

3 and of operation of the Project itself. (2017 FWS BO, p. 11.) By failing to permit all of the take

4 of endangered species associated with all Project components, and by deferring permitting of

5 operations, the 2017 FWS BO fundamentally changed the project description from that provided

6 in the EIR/S.

7 217. The 2017 NOAA BO reduces the total number of barge trips generated for Project

8 construction to 5,500, or about half of what the EIR/S disclosed. (2017 NOAA BO, p. 152.)

9 This drastic decrease in barge trips would require a corresponding increase in use of heavy

10 trucks to deliver Project construction materials. The impacts associated with this increase in
11 truck traffic have not been disclosed in any CEQA document and require re-circulation of the
12 EIR/S.

13 218. After release of the RDEIR/S, it was revealed that the Project was designed to
14 divert and export more Delta water during the summer months, rather than the spring and winter
15 months. This fact has been neither disclosed nor analyzed in any CEQA document for the

16 Project.

17 219. The EIR/S does not analyze changes to the export to inflow ratio of SWRCB

18 Decision 1641 ("D-1641") that are a part of the Project. The Project effectively eliminates D-
19 1641 the Export Limits (35% and 65% of Delta inflow, depending on the season) by excluding
20 any water diverted by the NDDs from being considered as exports. The Project would eliminate
21 D-1641 limits by allowing up to 9,000 cfs to be diverted at the NDDs while claiming "zero
22 exports". This change constitutes significant new information that must be disclosed and

23 analyzed in a recirculated EIR/S.

24 220. The FEIR/S includes new analyses of changes in conditions between Existing
25 Conditions and the proposed Project due to climate change and sea level rise at Years 2025-
26 2030 period. This change constitutes significant new information that must be disclosed and

27 analyzed in a recirculated EIR/S.

28

63
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

1 221. The FEIR/S identifies new significant and avoidable impacts, requiring new
2 analysis in a recirculated EIR/S. For instance, after previously designating the GW-9 (degrade
3 groundwater quality) as less than significant in the RDEIR/S, the FEIR/S and CEQA Findings

4 re-designate impact GW-9 as significant and unavoidable.

5 222. DWR released more than 300 pages of supplemental Project analysis and

6 numerous other documents concurrently with certification of the FEIR/S and Project approval.
7 Information included in the supplemental Project analysis constitutes significant new
8 information that must be disclosed and analyzed in a re-circulated EIR/S.

9 223. CEQA Guidelines section 15088, subdivision (b) requires that the lead agency
10 provide its written proposed response to a public agency on comments made by that public
11 agency at least 10 days prior to certifying an environmental impact report. DWR did not
12 provide the public agencies, including the public agency Plaintiffs herein, with proposed
13 responses to comments on the FEIR/S that were submitted within the noticed comment period
14 provided by DWR, prior to certifying the EIR/S. DWR's failure to comply with these
15 requirements prejudiced Plaintiffs in their ability to understand, and raise objections to, DWR's
16 responses to its comments, which raised substantial issues regarding the adequacy of the
17 RDEIR/S and the FEIR/S.

18 224. The scope of the Project's operations changed between the REIR/S and the
19 FEIR/S, increasing from the Alternative 4A scenario to the range between Boundaries and 2.
20 Boundary 1 would represent an increase in total average annual exports relative to the
21 established environmental baseline, and Boundary 2 would represent a reduction in total average
22 annual exports relative to the baseline. The FEIR/S does not explain or analyze impacts of the
23 Project under this wide range of operational scenarios. Evidence provided to DWR in
24 comments on the FEIR/S and in the SWRCB Hearing revealed the potential for new and
25 substantially more severe impacts to upstream reservoir operations and water supply. Those
26 impacts cannot be understood without a distinct evaluation of each alternative, including the
27 impacts of the full proposed range of operations from Boundaries 1 to Boundary 2, as they may
28 differ from Alternative 4A.

2 The EIR/S Distorts the Concept of Mitigation in Violation of CEQA

3 225. DWR failed to adopt all feasible mitigation measures and alternatives to reduce or

4 avoid significant impacts, in direct contravention of CEQA. (CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15126.6,

5 15126.4.) Moreover, the adopted mitigation measures and other measures deemed to be part of

6 the Project description--and included separately as "Environmental Commitments" and

7 Avoidance and Minimization Measures ("AMMs") in the MMRP-fail to meet basic legal
requirements of enforceability.

8

9 226. An EIR cannot incorporate "the proposed mitigation measures into its description

10 of the project and then conclude[] that any potential impacts from the project will be less than

11 significant." (Lotus V. Department of Transportation (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 645, 655-57.)

12 The failure to separately identify and analyze the significance of impacts without these
Environmental Commitments and AMMs "subverts the

13 purposes of CEQA by omitting material

14 necessary to informed decision-making and informed public participation." (Id. at 658.)

15 227. Here, between the DEIR/S and the RDEIR/S release, DWR mysteriously changed

16 several impact determinations to less than significant. For instance, previously significant

effects such as:

17

18 WQ-5: effects on bromide concentrations resulting from facilities operations and maintenance,

19 WQ-7: effects on chloride concentrations resulting from facilities operations and maintenance,

20 WQ-11: effects on electrical conductivity concentrations resulting from facilities operations and maintenance; GW-8: during operations, deplete groundwater supplies or

21 interfere with groundwater recharge, alter groundwater levels, or reduce the production capacity of preexisting nearby wells; and GW-9: degrade groundwater quality
22

23 were all changed to less than significant without mitigation. No substantiation for these
changes was included in the FEIR/S.

24

25 228. The EIR/S relied on Environmental Commitments to mitigate Project impacts

26 previously identified as significant, thereby avoiding the need to impose mitigation and/or make

27 a finding of a significant and unavoidable effect. DWR included Environmental Commitments
and AMMs in the MMRP without adopting them as enforceable mitigation. The MMRP is
28 unambiguous that Environmental Commitments are "project features" and not mitigation.

65
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

1 (MMRP, p. 1-2.) The MMRP goes on to describe Environmental Commitments as "design

2 features, construction methods, and other Best Management Practices ("BMPs") that have been

3 incorporated as part of the project." (MMRP, p. 3-1.)

4 229. The EIR/S impermissibly relies on these Environmental Commitments to

5 determine numerous Project impacts are less than significant, and therefore do not require

6 traditional mitigation. For example, in addition to the impacts listed above, impact AQUA-7:

7 Effects of Construction of Restoration Measures on Delta smelt, is considered less than

8 significant, therefore not requiring mitigation, based on the integration of Environmental

9 Commitments. (FEIR/S, p. 11-3199.) Indeed, the MMRP identifies more than half a dozen
10 Environmental Commitments as related to impact AQUA-7. (See MMRP, pp. 3-10, -19, -22,
11 24, -39, -41, and -52.) Absent from the EIR/S is any analysis of the scope or severity of AQUA-
12 7, or other Environmental Commitments-reliant impacts, without implementation of
13 Environmental Commitments.

14 230. The EIR/S fails to account for the potential undermining of mitigation
15 commitments due to (1) the project's potential cost overruns, far exceeding DWR's estimated
16 costs; and (2) major gaps remaining in the project's anticipated financing, including still absent
17 commitments of water contractor project beneficiaries, the federal government, and the outcome
18 of pending proceedings relating to the lawfulness and validity of DWR's proposed revenue
19 bonds.

20 231. The intentional shell game DWR plays with Mitigation Measures, Environmental
21 Commitments and AMMs in the EIR/S results in the EIR/S failing as an informational
22 document. Only by hours of careful study, all without the benefit of redline changes in the
23 40,000 plus pages within the FEIR/S, would it be possible for a member of the public to discern
24 DWR's basis for the impact determinations in the FEIR/S. The failure of the CEQA Findings to
25 include any findings with respect to hundreds of allegedly less than significant impacts

26 compounds this fatal error. Likewise, the MMRP fails to adequately inform the public of how
27 numerous impacts would be mitigated to less than significant levels.

28

66
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

1 232. The Project also impermissibly relies on Adaptive Management to address

2 impacts. Like the Environmental Commitments and AMMs referenced above, are not

3 enforceable mitigation, but are cast as Project components. One example of this is evident in the

4 EIR/S's treatment of Terrestrial and Biological Resources impacts. To mitigate impact BIO-56,

5 the EIR/S relies in part on Environmental Commitment 27, which includes the development of

6 Adaptive Management. The EIR/S contains no analysis of the extent of this impact in the

7 absence of Adaptive Management.

8 233. The EIR/S also systematically relies upon mitigation measures that are

9 impermissibly deferred, and, because they have not been adequately formulated, are

10 unenforceable. (CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15126.4, subd. (a)(1)(b); see also Sacramento Old City
11 Ass'n v. City Council (1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 1011, 1029 [performance criteria must be

12 articulated at project approval].) Mitigation in the EIR/S, however, does not articulate specific
13 performance criteria, and Appendix 3B describes numerous additional studies that must be
14 completed prior to formulating mitigation of Project impacts.

15 234. "Mitigation measures must be fully enforceable through permit conditions,

16 agreements, or other legally-binding instruments." (CEQA Guidelines, § 15126.4, sub. (a)(2).)
17 The EIR/S fails to sufficiently identify any such permit conditions, agreements or other legally-
18 binding instruments that would ensure adequate funding and other conditions are in place to
19 fully implement all of the adopted and/or deferred Mitigation Measures, Environmental
20 Commitments and AMMs.

21 235. As discussed above, the EIR/S fails to integrate a discussion of other actions by
22 agencies with permitting authority over other resources. As with the discussion of project
23 alternatives, when there is credible evidence that resources, including sensitive natural
24 resources, are within the project area, an EIR must discuss other agencies' authority over those
25 resources and discuss how mitigation measures have been devised to anticipate that authority.
26 (Banning Ranch Conservancy v. City of Newport Beach (2017) 2 Cal.5th 918, 938.) The full
27 scope of other agencies' permitting authority over the project is not disclosed in the EIR/S, nor
28 did DWR adequately consult with the agencies with responsibility for these resources. A

67
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

1 discussions or analysis of mitigation measures relating to a resource is inadequate if it does not
2 sufficiently integrate other agencies' authority and likely actions.

3 236. The EIR/S also relies on de facto mitigation disguised as a Project component.
4 Impact WQ-32 addresses HABs formation from facilities operations, while Impact WQ-11

5 addresses salinity increases. Mitigation Measure WQ-11e states that real-time operations of the

6 Project will be used to reduce water quality degradation. The EIR/S' discussion of Impact WQ-

7 32 finds the impact would be less than significant and that mitigation would not be required.

8 The EIR/S cites real time operations as a tool to manage HABs proliferation and accumulation,

9 but notably not as mitigation. The EIR/S does not explain how real-time operations would be
10 adjusted to prevent significant HABs impacts, not does it include any enforceable performance
11 standards for managing increased HABs as a result of the Project. As such, there is no way for

12 decision-makers or the public to determine whether this de facto mitigation would be effective
13 in reducing the HABs impacts of the Project to less than significant. The reliance on real-time

14 operations to manage HABs is improperly deferred mitigation under CEQA.
15 The EIR/S Includes a Flawed and Incomplete Analysis of Environmental Impacts and
16 Mitigation

17 237. The EIR/S fails to adequately disclose or analyze the project's impacts on the

18 environment. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21100; CEQA Guidelines, § 15126.)

19 238. Though the EIR/S purports to analyze the Project at a "project" level of review,
20 the EIR/S consistently fails to include the level of detail required to conduct project-level review
21 of its widespread and severe impacts, particularly in the Delta itself. Given the colossal scale of
22 the Delta Tunnels, this may be challenging. But with no further environmental review
23 contemplated, just like any project subject to CEQA, this EIR/S was required to meet applicable
24 project-level review requirements.
25 239. While DWR identified hundreds of environmental impacts from the Project, DWR

26 failed to analyze some impacts at all, and failed to adequately inform the public and decision-
27 makers about the impacts the EIR/S purports to analyze. In addition, DWR's impact
28

68
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

F

2 determinations (less-than-significant, significant and unavoidable, no impact) are contrary to law
and not supported by substantial evidence.

3 240.

4 The impact analysis in the EIR/S is inadequate across multiple resource areas due

5 to its unlawfully truncated scope of impact analysis. Direct and indirect significant effects of the

6 Project on the environment must be clearly identified and described, giving due consideration to

7 both the short-term and long-term effects. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15126.2, subd. (a).) The EIR/SI

8 unlawfully limits the scope of its analysis. Critical examples of such limitation include the

9 exclusion of an analysis of the direct and indirect impacts of the Project on areas to the west of

10 Suisun Marsh, including the San Francisco Bay and the Ocean, and in all of the upstream areas

11 whose water resources, via water transfers, exchanges or otherwise, are among the sources of

12 water that would be utilized in Project implementation.

13 241. Without limiting the scope of the claims regarding the inadequacy of the EIR/S to

14 provide an adequate assessment of the Project's potential impacts on the environment, the

15 following paragraphs provide examples of the inadequate analysis in the EIR/S. Plaintiffs have

16 organized the allegations by EIR/S chapter; by doing so, Plaintiffs do not limit the scope of

17 these claim to any particular impact area or chapter of the EIR/S.

18 Water Supply Impacts - EIR/S Chapter 5
242. The Project is designed to improve water supplies for export areas, but would
19 jeopardize the area of origin-protected needs of Delta farms, communities, cities and industries.

20 243.

21 Given the relationship of Delta channels to sea level, an adequate supply of water

22 in the channels supports all in-Delta beneficial uses, assuming adequate water quality. When

23 operation of the SWP and CVP unnaturally lowers channel water levels, the local in-Delta

24 diversions are impaired or prevented. The supply can also become unusable when the operation

25 of the projects increases salinity and other constituents in the water. This occurs both when the

26 constituents are added and when in-Delta flow patterns are altered to create stagnant or null
zones where constituents collect.

27 244.

28 The disclosure and analysis of the Project's water supply impacts during both
construction and operation in the EIR/S is inadequate.

69
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

1 245. The EIR/S fails to include a water availability analysis. Prior analyses of the Delta
2 water supply revealed that the in-basin needs of the Delta exceed the available water by millions

3 of acre-feet. The original development of the SWP and CVP guaranteed that in-Delta water

4 requirements would always be met prior to exporting flows to out-of-basin users. The EIR/S

5 does not take that statutory requirement into consideration in its analysis of impacts to in-basin

6 Delta water users.

7 246. The EIR/S provides no analysis of the Project's effect on local water supplies in

8 the water supply analysis. While the EIR/S identifies a number of impacts to water supply in

o export areas, it fails to consider whether water supply impacts may also occur in the Delta,
10 where the water would be taken.

11 247. The EIR/S water supply analysis is inadequate because it fails to evaluate and
12 mitigate potentially significant impacts to water supply for water users who rely on water stored
13 in project reservoirs. Changes in the amount of water delivered to a location constitute a
14 physical change to the environment. (See Pub. Resources Code, § 21060.5.) The EIR/S
15 wrongfully asserts that such physical changes "are not considered as water supply effects or
16 impacts" and did not evaluate their environmental impacts.
17 248. The EIR/S fails to analyze how the anticipated one-foot decrease in Sacramento

18 River water levels extending for more than 9 miles downstream of the proposed new diversions
19 would impact local water supply.
20 249. The EIR/S fails to analyze how changes in water levels caused by changes in the
21 operation of the HORB would impact water users in the South Delta. HORB is a rock structure
22 used to divert water down the San Joaquin River to facilitate the upstream and downstream
23 migration of Chinook salmon. The Project would increase the amount of time that HORB is in
24 place per year from three (3) months to over six (6) months. Increasing the duration of time that
25 flow to the South Delta is blocked would reduce water surface levels and impair water quality,
26 thus adversely impacting South Delta water supplies.

27 250. The EIR/S acknowledges that the Project would increase demand for Delta water
28 exports, including transfers, and also analyzes water supply impacts to transferee areas, but

70
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

1 performs inadequate analysis of those same impacts on the area from which the water would be

2 exported or transferred. The EIR/S also fails to disclose or analyze the impacts associated with

3 obtaining the supplemental water supply necessary to satisfy the spring Delta outflow

4 requirements. The Project description fails to identify how this supply would be obtained, and

5 where it would be obtained, making it impossible for the EIR/S to analyze or mitigate impacts

6 that may result from these water transfers or releases.

7 251. The EIR/S fails to analyze the quantity of Delta water available for export after

8 complying with in-Delta water provision requirements for fisheries, and under what

9 circumstances such water would be available.

10 252. The EIR/S fails to disclose that DWR recently reduced carryover storage for SWP
11 reservoirs in a way that will further stress water conditions in dry years, and, therefore, the
12 EIR/S water supply analysis is premised on incomplete information.
13 253. The EIR/S fails to adequately analyze Project impacts on water supply quality,
14 availability, and reliability for several classes of Delta water users, including domestic,
15 agricultural, and the wildlife habitat.

16 254. The EIR/S fails to identify additional water supply for the new mitigation
17 requirements defined for Alternative 4A for habitat restoration, which consumptively uses
18 almost twice as much water as most Delta crops. The EIR/S assumes restoration areas would

19 use the same amount of water as existing agriculture, which is incorrect.

20 255. The EIR/S fails to mitigate Project impacts arising from the fact that the Project
21 would not meet Water Quality Control Basin Plan Flow Criteria requirements for the
22 Sacramento River and for Delta Outflows

23 256. The EIR/S fails to adequately mitigate both Project-level and cumulative water

24 supply impacts.
25 257. The EIR/S fails to clearly segregate the Project's mitigation requirements from the

26 mitigation required by CVP and SWP operations, depriving decision-makers and the public of
27 the ability to discern whether the Project would mitigate its impacts.
28

71
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

1 258. DWR's determination that all water supply impacts would be mitigated to less
2 than significant levels is not supported by substantial evidence and DWR's own modeling work.

3 259. The water supply impacts of the Project, in combination with past, present and
4 reasonably foreseeable future projects, are cumulatively significant, and must be evaluated to

5 properly understand potential impacts.

6 260. DWR's failure to adequately analyze the Project-level water supply impacts

7 renders DWR's attempted cumulative impact analysis in adequate.

8 Surface Water Impacts - EIR/S Chapter 6
9 261. The scale of the proposed diversions is large enough to radically alter the
10 hydrodynamics of the Delta. For instance, the Project would fundamentally change the way
11 waters are conveyed through the Delta channels, which are part of the State's Plan of Flood

12 Control, interfere with operation of local water diversion and discharge facilities, and generally
13 disrupt surface water conditions throughout the Delta.

14 262. The EIR/S includes an inadequate disclosure and analysis of the Project's surface
15 water impacts during both Project construction and operation.

16 263. The EIR/S modelling shows an approximately to 2 foot decline in water levels

17 below the proposed NDDs as a result of the Project in the Early Long Term phase, as well as

18 decreased water quality in the Delta. This decrease in water levels would severely interfere with
19 local water supply infrastructure for agricultural and other uses; the EIR/S has failed to perform
20 an adequate analysis on the impacts related to this decrease in water levels.

21 264. DWR's hydraulic modeling data shows that though water level changes
22 downstream of the proposed NDDs may typically be one to two feet, water levels may be
23 lowered up to four feet downstream of the NDDs. This magnitude of reduction in water level

24 could lower the water level below the intakes of irrigators downstream of the diversions. The
25 EIR/S fails to analyze at what point water level reductions would impact diverters, yet the

26 significant water level decline was nonetheless determined to have no impact.
27 265. The EIR/S fails to adequately analyze Project impacts stemming from the low-
28 flow conditions that would be created during Project operation, creating flow levels typically

72
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

1 only seen during drought period, on the Sacramento River. These lower flows would be a

2 nearly continuous occurrence with the Project. The impacts of such conditions, especially

3 during the late summer period, which is a critical agricultural water use period, are not

4 adequately analyzed in the EIR/S.

5 266. The EIR/S fails to account for the effect of relatively small increases in applied

6 water salinity on soils and plant productivity in analyzing water quality impacts to Delta
7 agriculture. Small increases in surface water salinity (water which is applied to crops for

8 irrigation) can adversely affect soil salinity, which adversely affects agricultural plant growth

9 and crop production. Because of the unique soil characteristics of the Delta and high

10 groundwater tables, actions by agricultural water users to avoid or minimize these adverse

11 impacts, such as applying additional water, may not be practical or effective during the plant
12 growing season. The EIR/S analyzes only averages changes in applied water salinity and thus
13 not only fails to examine the short and medium-term effects of the Project, but also, therefore,
14 fails to examine how or if mitigation might be feasible or effective.
15 267. The EIR/S provides only a cursory description of flood-related impacts, deferring
16 both analysis and mitigation of these impacts until DWR must apply for a USACE Section 408
17 permit, which is projected to occur after Project construction on the Clifton Court Forebay
18 begins. This again follows the pervasive pattern of predetermination and ad hoc reasoning that
19 infects every aspect of this more programmatic than project-level EIR/S.
20 268. The EIR/S fails to disclose Project surface water impacts arising from construction
21 of sedimentation basins. The EIR/S fails to define the location of proposed sedimentation
22 basins, but states that they would be excavated to 30 feet. Excavation of this magnitude could
23 cause flooding and/or a potential levee failure during high water periods. The EIR/S
24 acknowledges that Project-related changes in water elevations would affect navigation and
25 beneficial uses of water, and analyzes impacts for those resource areas, but omits any analysis
26 which focuses specifically on how Project-related and cumulative changes to water levels may
27 impair flood control efforts.

28

73
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

1 269. The EIR/S fails to disclose and analyze how construction and presence of in-
2 channel facilities such as the Project's barge facilities and cofferdams would limit the volume of

3 water that the channel can hold, the related flood control impacts due to both the single channel

4 blockage and the cumulative impacts arising from similar Project-generated blockages

5 throughout the Delta.

6 270. The EIR/S similarly fails to disclose and analyze how construction of in-channel

7 Project facilities on Delta levees may damage levee integrity through pile-driving, seepage, and

8 erosion, and the related flood control impacts that may arise from this damage. The levees are
9 susceptible to compaction, subsidence, and liquefaction from vibrations from construction-
10 related activity. The EIR/S did not include an adequate analysis of the impacts the Project
11 would have on these levees.

12 271. The EIR/S fails to disclose and analyze flood control impacts that may occur due
13 to the lowered water elevations downriver of the proposed NDDs.
14 272. Contrary to what is claimed in the EIR/S, HORB would also increase the

15 frequency of reverse flow in the Old and Middle Rivers. This results in a decrease in water

16 quality, a reduction in flushing flow and longer residence times of the water in the river. The
17 longer residence time results in an accumulation of contaminants in the river and warming of the
18 water due to radiative heating, which then results in increased algal growth. Increasing the
19 frequency of use of HORB would exacerbate these surface water impacts.
20 273. The EIR/S does not disclose or adequately analyze how increased surface water
21 elevation due changes caused by operation of the Project could cause seepage and related
22 agricultural impacts throughout the Delta.
23 274. The EIR/S fails to analyze the surface water elevation changes that may occur
24 during construction due to the creation of coffer dams, gabions, and other in-river structures.
25 These features narrow the cross-section of the river or slough and raise the flood elevation,
26 potentially exceeding levee design requirements. These localized flood impacts are not
27 described in sufficient detail to understand potential impacts to levees, levee roads, docks,
28 bridges, and agricultural intakes. These construction-related in-channel elements would need to

74
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

a be in place for a significant amount of time. Yet the EIR/S performed no analysis to determine

2 the impact of any failure of these structures during a winter storm.
275. Project operations would change CVP and SWP reservoir operations, but the

4 EIR/S does not identify, characterize, quantify or disclose the significant impacts from those
altered reservoir operations.

6 276. The EIR/S fails to disclose and analyze the extent of the Project-created reverse

7 flows in the Sacramento River and their associated impacts. In addition, the EIR/S claims a

8 reduction in reverse flow in Old and Middle Rivers, but an evaluation of the detailed modeling

9 output shows an increase in the reverse flows in Old and Middle Rivers due to Project
10 operations.

11 277. The EIR/S also fails to identify, analyze or mitigate any Project-caused impacts to
12 upstream reverse flows on the Sacramento River at the Freeport Project intake. Modeling
13 indicates that the Project could cause a 16 percent increase in the frequency of reverse flow

14 events that are significant enough to shut down the Freeport Project intake in comparison to no
15 project conditions. Such Project-related events would be large enough to require Sacramento
16 Regional County Sanitation District ("Regional San") to cease discharging as well, given the
17 Freeport Project's proximity to Regional San's outfall. The increase in frequency and length of
18 discharge cessations would require Regional San to construct additional storage basins at the
19 Sacramento Regional Water Treatment Plant. In turn, these effects on the Freeport Project and
20 Regional San's operations would have an outsized impact on numerous other Delta water users.
21 The EIR/S includes a commitment, though not a mitigation measure, to work with Regional San
22 to develop operations protocols sometime in the future to address operational impacts. Notably,
23 the operations protocols are undefined, and the timeframe for development is indefinite. The
24 commitment is not a legally adequate mitigation measure for the Project's significant impact to
25 Regional San's operations or any impacts at the Freeport Project intake because it does not

26 commit DWR to specific performance standards and impermissibly defers formulation of
27 specific standards.

28

75
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

1 278. The EIR/S fails to adequately analyze how Project operations can be mitigated to

2 reduce the expected increase in surface water salinity.

3 279. The EIR/S fails to analyze surface water impacts that may occur due to operational

4 assumptions disclosed only in the Delta Habitat Conservation and Conveyance Program

5 Conceptual Engineering Report, including that (1) the Project must be able to deliver up to

6 9,000 cfs from NDDs at low water level in the Sacramento River; (2) the Project must be able to
7 deliver 9,000 cfs flow rate 99 percent (99%) of the time; and (3) the Project operating volume of
8 North Clifton Court Forebay is significantly less than existing Clifton Court Forebay.

9 280. The EIR/S fails to disclose or analyze Project impacts created by construction
10 activities would prevent RDs from performing inspections, operations, maintenance, and
11 improvements to levees and drainage systems for over a decade. Failure to perform standard
12 upkeep on these systems will increase flood risks.
13 281. The EIR/S assumes that compliance with permit design requirements will cause
14 impact SW-6 to be less than significant, but provides no data to support this conclusion, e.g.,
15 with respect to the sites where water will be discharged, the volumes that will potentially be
16 discharged, and the capacity of existing drainage facilities.
17 282. The EIR/S fails to adequately disclose or analyze how cumulative adverse impacts
18 disclosed in other EIR/S chapters, such as Groundwater, Water Quality, Soils, and Agriculture,
19 will result in significant surface water impacts, including increased flood risks for Delta water

20 users.

21 283. For example, the EIR/S fails to consider surface water impacts from reasonably
22 foreseeable future projects, such as the Yolo Bypass project. The Yolo Bypass project is
23 required under the 2009 NMFS BO and would divert 12,000 cfs from the Sacramento River for

24 five months out of the year, and 1,000 cfs for two additional months. None of the modeling
25 included in the EIR/S accounts for reductions in Sacramento River flows due to the Yolo Bypass
26 project. As a result, the EIR/S fails to provide accurate information regarding the Project's
27 cumulative surface water, water ality, and water supply impacts.
28

76
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

1 284. The EIR/S fails to adequately mitigate both Project-level and cumulative surface

2 water impacts.

3 285. The EIR/S fails to provide effective, enforceable mitigation that addresses Project-
4 generated changes in surface water levels.

5 286. For example, mitigation measure SW-4 is intended to implement measures to

6 reduce runoff and sedimentation by developing a plan that demonstrates that there is "no-net-
7 increase in runoff due to construction activities during peak flows." (MMRP, 2-1.) But the

8 MMRP does not describe how it will determine whether the Project complies with this standard.

9 It fails to describe how DWR will determine what part of runoff is the result of construction

10 activities or how it will measure net increases.

11 287. None of the three proposed surface water mitigation measures purports to mitigate
12 any impacts related to Project-generated low flows.
13 288. DWR's determination that all surface water impacts would be mitigated to less
14 than significant levels is not supported by substantial evidence.

15 289. The surface water impacts of the Project, in combination with past, present and

16 reasonably foreseeable future Projects are cumulatively significant. DWR's failure to
17 adequately analyze the Project-level surface water impacts rendered DWR's attempted

18 cumulative impact analysis in adequate.

19 Groundwater Impacts - EIR/S Chapter 7
20 290. The recent drought further strained the State's already overtaxed groundwater
21 supplies. The Project, with its massive ground disturbance and dewatering activities, and

22 removal of vast quantities of water from the Sacramento River, which recharges the aquifers in
23 and around the Delta, would forever impair the ability of areas in the Project path to sustainably
24 manage groundwater. While the EIR/S applauds the potential of the Project to possibly provide
25 water for recharge purposes to export areas of the state, the EIR/S fails to disclose the havoc this

26 Project would wreak on groundwater in and around the Delta.

27 291. The EIR/S includes an inadequate disclosure and analysis of the Project's

28 groundwater impacts during both construction and operation of the Project.

77
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

1 292. The EIR/S does not disclosure that the current Project would affect other planning

2 and implementation processes to manage groundwater in areas impacted by the Project.

3 293. Groundwater levels within the Delta are typically high, thus requiring a substantial
4 dewatering effort in order to construct Project components requiring large-scale excavation,
5 including proposed intakes, intermediate forebays and other work areas. For instance, the EIR/S
6 acknowledges that up to million gallons per day of dewatering would occur at the intake

7 construction sites.

8 294. Despite the availability of well information from DWR's own groundwater

9 programs, the EIR/S fails to disclose and analyze the impacts from construction and operation
10 on individual wells in the vicinity of Project components, such as the intakes, forebays and
11 tunnels. (See Groundwater Wells in Vicinity of Intakes and Tunnels, attached hereto as Exhibit
12 G.)

13 295. The EIR/S fails to disclose or analyze land subsidence that may occur in the Delta
14 as a result of dewatering activities that lower groundwater levels.
15 296. The EIR/S failed to fully account for the Project's impacts to groundwater in areas
16 upstream of the Delta by prejudicially excluding analysis of the Project's facilitation of
17 groundwater substitution transfer programs.

18 297. The EIR/S fails to analyze impacts to individual wells and regional groundwater
19 recharge from the construction of slurry walls. These walls are intended to act as permanent
20 impermeable barriers to groundwater flow, and the EIR/S does not consider how these barriers

21 will impact wells that rely on the shallow groundwater aquifers that the slurry walls would
22 purportedly block.

23 298. The EIR/S fails to disclose and analyze impacts on groundwater recharge from
24 chronically removing up to half the average flow of the Sacramento River in the vicinity of the
25 Project. The groundwater impacts analysis fails to fully analyze how the Project would alter
26 local groundwater levels in any clear manner that would provide for an understanding of the
27 groundwater impacts or thresholds. Though inadequate, the EIR/S focuses almost entirely on
28

78
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

-

2 the direct impacts on wells, which are only part of the water supply balance in the vast area of
the Delta that the Project would impact.

3 299.

4 In the FEIR/S DWR discloses an "[u]p to 5-foot episodic lowering of groundwater

5 levels beneath the Sacramento River due to lower flows in the river as a result of diversions at

6 the north Delta intakes that result in a reduction in river flows and elevations." (FEIR/S, p. 7-

7 88.) Other evidence provided to DWR using DWR's own model indicates that there may be up

8 to 44 feet of reductions in groundwater levels in the vicinity of and downstream from the
proposed intakes on the Sacramento River.

9

10 300. In addition to the groundwater wells in the vicinity of the Project components,
such as the intakes, forebays and other work

11 areas, the massive tunnels themselves would serve

12 as a barrier to groundwater flows and recharge throughout their 37-mile extent. DWR has made

13 no effort to identify, let alone assess the need for and feasibility of mitigation for these

14 groundwater users in San Joaquin, Yolo, Contra Costa, Solano, and Sacramento County.
301. DWR failed to use

15 best available science to determine the likely groundwater

16 impacts of the Project. In addition to the grossly out of date model parameters used in the

17 RDEIR/S, the groundwater data now are so far out of date (generally 1962-2003) that it can no

18 longer be used with any reliability. Use of this data biases the results, particularly since the last

19 four (4) years of the drought are not included. This error biases the effects by using the wettest

20 years and ignoring the drought and the overall trend to drier years.

21 302. The EIR/S failed to disclose that the Project would impair the ability of the South

22 American Subbasin and other areas to comply with the requirements of SGMA to reach

23 groundwater sustainability within 20 years of adoption of Groundwater Sustainability Plans,

24 which are now underway. Areas east of the proposed new intakes and other areas affected by

25 the construction and operation of the Project are experiencing overdraft, and any reductions in

26 recharge from the Sacramento River or other sources would exacerbate these overdraft

27 conditions, inconsistent with the goals and requirements of SGMA.

28 303. The EIR/S fails to adequately mitigate both Project-level and cumulative
groundwater impacts.

79
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

1 304. A 5 to 40-foot lowering of groundwater levels would cause a significant impact to

2 the water supplies of some well owners. DWR has improperly deferred the necessary localized
3 assessment of scope of the impacts on regional groundwater levels and individual wells.

4 305. The EIR/S provides inadequate mitigation for the 5-to 40-foot episodic lowering
5 of groundwater levels. Without providing any analysis, the EIR/S concludes that if Mitigation

6 Measure GW-1 is implemented, no additional mitigation measures will be necessary. GW-1
7 entails DWR determining the location of wells within the Project footprint that may suffer

8 dewatering and monitoring water levels in those wells during Project. Simply monitoring wells
9 does not provide mitigation. In addition, once wells become inoperable due to changed water

10 levels, it may be impossible to correct the problem.
11 306. The EIR/S attempts to use the same features as both Project elements and
12 mitigation of groundwater impacts. On one hand, slurry walls are included as an optional
13 element of mitigation measure GW-1. (MMRP, 2-5.) On the other hand, slurry walls intended
14 to protect groundwater levels during dewatering are included as a Project element,
15 Environmental Commitment 27. (MMRP, 3-80-81.) If these walls are already being built as
16 part of the Project, it is unclear how building these walls a is also a mitigation measure. The
17 EIR/S does not suggest that Environmental Commitment 27 slurry walls will be different from
18 Mitigation Measure GW-1 slurry walls.
19 307. The EIR/S failed to analyze fails to adequately analyze potential impacts resulting
20 from dewatering activities during Project construction including, but not limited to, the impacts
21 of installing slurry walls mentioned in Mitigation Measure GW-1. The EIR/S also assumes the
22 slurry walls would function perfectly and fails to address impacts that would occur if they do
23 not. While slurry walls could, if completely keyed into clay, reduce drawdown of local
24 groundwater outside the construction areas, slurry walls may also exacerbate groundwater
25 impacts during and after construction by blocking local wells from groundwater recharge
26 sources such as the Sacramento River, thereby impairing domestic, agricultural, and wildlife
27 habitat groundwater uses.

28

-

2 308. DWR's less than significant determination for Impact GW-1 is unsupported.

3 DWR's conclusion fails to consider that groundwater wells are screened to draw water at set

4 elevations and it cannot be assumed that those wells could be modified to continue to provide

5 water supplies after the entire groundwater character of the four-mile wide area DWR belatedly

6 disclosed in the Developments after Publication of the Proposed Final Environmental Impact
Report released on July 21, 2017. (See p. 66.)

7

8 309. Groundwater Mitigation Measures fail to meet basic CEQA mitigation standards.

9 GW-1, GW-5, and other mitigation measures impermissibly delegate the authority to DWR to

10 determine the approach to mitigation, without adequate performance standards. In response to

11 concerns about the impacts on regional groundwater elevations from reductions in surface

12 elevations of the Sacramento River, DWR modified GW-1 to include monitoring "for up to 5

13 years after commencement of conveyance operations." (Developments after Publication of the

14 Proposed Final Environmental Impact Report, pp. 42-43.) Given the likelihood of permanent

15 (1) reversals in groundwater gradients to be toward the Sacramento River, rather than away from

16 the river, and (2) reduced groundwater recharge, the an "up to 5 year" monitoring period is

17 wholly inadequate to mitigate the impact to less than significant.
310.

18 Mitigation Measure GW-1 will only apply up to five years into operation of the

19 Project. (Mitigation, Monitoring, and Reporting Program, pp. 2-4 to 2-6.) Proposed operation

20 of the Project, however, would occur indefinitely. As a result, ongoing operational impacts,

21 such as Impacts GW-1, GW-2, and AG-2 would not be adequately mitigated.

22 311. Mitigation Measure GW-5 impermissibly defers formulation of mitigation for the

23 Project' significant groundwater impacts. Under GW-5, mitigation measures to address seepage

24 will be developed in the future. Without additional detail on the impacts and the means to

25 address impacts, this is approach is impermissible and further defeats the purpose of the EIR/S

26 as an informational document for the public and decision-makers.

27 312. DWR's determination that all groundwater impacts other than GW-6, GW-7 and

28 GW-9 would be mitigated to less than significant levels is not supported by substantial evidence.

81
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

313. The groundwater impacts of the Project, in combination with past, present and

2 reasonably foreseeable future Projects are cumulatively significant.

3 DWR's failure to adequately analyze the Project-level groundwater impacts of the Project

4 renders DWR's attempted cumulative impact analysis inadequate.

5 Water Quality Impacts - EIR/S Chapter 8

6 314. The Delta is already an impaired water body under the Clean Water Act for a
7 variety of constituents, in large part due to operation of the SWP and CVP. The Project would

8 remove up to half of the average freshwater inflow from the Sacramento River. The largest

9 percent removals of fresh water are proposed for late summer, when water quality in the Delta is
10 already at its worst. Hydraulic modeling of the Project showed that the Project would
11 essentially create a permanent drought condition in some areas of the Delta during the late
12 summer period, further stressing the aquatic system.
13 315. As discussed above, the Project does not include a stable definition with respect to
14 operational boundaries. As a consequence of not succinctly defining Project operations, the
15 EIR/S does not adequate analyze or disclose Project impacts to water quality. The Project will
16 be operated under a range of scenarios, and yet the EIR/S relies on a single arbitrary scenario to
17 evaluate water quality impacts. This approach fails to present a full evaluation of the Project's

18 water quality impacts, and constitutes a failure to proceed in the manner required by law.
19 316. An analysis of water quality in the Central and South Delta under a "with Project"
20 I scenario showed that over 55 percent of the time the salinity levels would be higher than under
21 existing conditions. During drought periods, salinity levels would be higher than the existing
22 condition almost 80 percent of the time. Salinity, which is already at critical levels in some
23 areas of the Delta, directly impacts agricultural productivity and drinking water supplies. Any
24 increase in existing salinity levels would be a degradation of water quality in the Delta. While
25 the Project could potentially deliver better quality water to the water exporters for export to
26 areas south of the Delta, water quality for local in-Delta uses would worsen as a result of the

27 Project.

28

82
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

1 317. The EIR/S does not disclose the changing operational criteria from the RDEIR/S
2 to the FEIR/S, nor does it disclose the further changes included in the 2017 BiOps and ITP. The
3 changes in operational criteria would potentially cause significant impacts different from those
4 evaluated in the Final EIR/S. Not disclosing and analyzing these impacts constitutes a failure to

5 proceed in a manner required by law.

6 318. The EIR/S includes an inadequate disclosure and analysis of the Project's surface

7 water impacts during both Project construction and operation. An increase in turbidity due to

8 the construction of the intakes was not adequately evaluated. The potential destabilization, and

o potential failure, of the fragile Delta levees due to construction, as well as traffic by heavy
10 machinery on the levees, was not analyzed.

11 319. The EIR/S fails to analyze the potential for increased aquatic weeds as a result of
12 reductions in freshwater flows through the Delta caused by the Project.
13 320. The water quality modeling in the EIR/S fails to adequately analyze the Project's
14 impacts on water quality. The modeling used in the EIR/S does not accurately predict water
15 quality in the South Delta under existing conditions. Since the model cannot predict water
16 quality even under existing conditions, using that model to try to predict what would happen
17 under radically changed conditions is inappropriate. Under the existing conditions, the model
18 used in the EIR/S can be off by over 60 percent (60%) from the measured salinity. Even though
19 the accuracy level of the model is highly questionable, the model nonetheless showed an
20 increase in salinity throughout most of the Delta.
21 321. The model was not used to analyze Project compliance with all water quality
22 standards, and predicted salinity levels at only a few points, including only one point in the
23 South Delta. Nor did the modelling analyze the Project's impacts during a period of extended
24 drought like that recently experienced in the State. Additionally, modelling was not completed
25 for the ultimately selected Project; the EIR/S instead relies on modelling for Alternative 4.

26 322. The data sets used in screening and evaluating water quality impact analysis are
27 outdated, truncated, and prevent accurate assessment and disclosure of adverse project impacts.
28 Interior Delta sites for source water were not considered, and a number of priority pollutants

83
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

1 were infrequently or never sampled. This failure renders screening analysis technically
2 insufficient, and renders all subsequent assessments of water quality impacts invalid.
3 323. The water quality modeling for the EIR/S used a 15-minute time step, but most of
4 the flow data that was input to the water quality model were monthly data. The use of monthly

5 time step input flow data masked significant exceedances of daily and D-1641 salinity standards.

6 The input flow data needed to have been daily data in order to fully disclose both the severity

7 and frequency of these exceedances of the SWRCB water quality standards.

8 324. Further, DWR's own modeling shows that the Project would exceed D-1641

9 thresholds for both chloride and bromide under certain operating scenarios.

10 325. The Delta is a tidally driven system. Water movement and water quality in the
11 system responds on a time scale of the diurnal tide cycle. The EIR/S ignored the details of the

12 tidal system and evaluated the Delta on a mean monthly time-step averaged over multiple years,
13 as is typically done in a riverine system, or in a water supply analysis. That is totally
14 inappropriate and resulted in erroneous results. If California climate characteristics were

15 evaluated on a mean monthly basis, averaged over multiple years, one would conclude that
16 California has no droughts or floods. All of the highs and lows that show up on a shorter time

17 scale are averaged out, i.e., "masked" in order to conceal adverse impacts.
18 326. The FEIR/S changed operational assumptions that bear on Project impacts on
19 water salinity without performing modelling based on these new operational assumptions. For
20 example, the RDEIR/S assumed for the first time that Suisun March Salinity Control Gates
21 would continue operation, but did not perform modelling on how this assumption may affect
22 salinity levels. Instead, it performed a sensitivity analysis, which does not provide an adequate
23 basis to compare results of the two operational assumptions. The Delta responds to all changes
24 as a unified system. A change in one location could have adverse effects at another location
25 within the Delta. A full modeling analysis of any change is required to fully evaluate resulting
26 impacts. The EIR/S failed to provide such analysis.

27 327. Similarly, the EIR/S assumes that some water quality impacts in the form of D-

28 1641 salinity exceedances could be resolved through adopting different operating assumptions

84
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

1 than those used throughout the EIR/S, without performing any analysis that would disclose

2 whether that assumption is accurate, and what other impacts may arise from this alternative

3 means of operating the Project.

4 328. The EIR/S fails to sufficiently analyze water quality impacts to local water

5 supplies due to Project-related increases in a wide range of water quality constituents, including

6 chloride, bromide, nitrate, pesticides, increased temperatures, and the potential for increased

7 occurrence of HABs such as toxic Microcystis. Increases in these constituents would threaten

8 water users' ability to use their water supply, rendering it unusable under existing treatment

o technologies, and require implementation of additional water treatment processes at significant
10 costs. The EIR/S' characterization of changes as "minor" is inaccurate and fails to account for
11 the existing treatment processes used in the local areas reliant on Delta water supplies.
12 329. The EIR/S fails to adequately disclose or analyze water quality impacts due to
13 Project-related increases in selenium concentrations. The EIR/S concludes that selenium

14 impacts are unlikely to increase in the western Delta, but fails to analyze whether the Project
15 may cause these impacts where they are most likely to occur, the eastern Delta. The EIR/S

16 performs water quality modelling for a point at which the Project is unlikely to be operable.
17 330. The EIR/S analyzes operations for the year 2025; since Project construction would
18 likely take at least 10 years, the Project will not be operational then. The EIR/S must perform
19 modelling for the long term to adequately analyze Project water quality impacts. The Project is
20 designed to be in operation long past 2025.
21 331. The EIR/S's water quality modelling did not account for other water management
22 and environmental activities likely to occur in and upstream of the Delta that may influence
23 water quality impacts.

24 332. The EIR/S fails to adequately analyze how the Project may affect dissolved
25 oxygen levels in Delta aquatic habitat and drinking supplies; the EIR/S fails to analyze impacts
26 to dissolved oxygen levels in the Central, South, and East Delta caused by increased residence

27 time in these areas.

28

85
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

1 333. The EIR/S makes an unsupported determination that Project impacts due to

2 harmful algal blooms ("HABs") will be less than significant. On this issue, there is no

3 meaningful distinction between Alternative 4 (significant and unavoidable HABs) and

4 Alternative 4A (alleging less than significant HABs impact). The approach to evaluating HABs

5 centered on whether or not the mean channel velocity is capable of disrupting algal growth

6 development. Yet, algal blooms typically do not occur in the middle of the channel: they
7 develop and grow along the channel banks, where the channel velocity is much less than the

8 mean velocity. The EIR/S analysis ignores how algal growth occurs in the Delta channels, and

9 therefore fails to properly assess the true impacts to water quality from increased algal growth
10 and development.

11 334. The EIR/S also evaluates temperature change and its effect on algal growth.
12 Numerous studies have shown that an increase in temperature will increase algal growth rate.
13 The EIR/S's conclusion that there will not be an increase in temperature from the Project
14 leading to additional HABs formation in the Delta channels is unsupported. There will also be
15 reduction in flushing flow from the Sacramento River, resulting in longer residence times. Basic
16 thermodynamics demonstrate the longer the residence time, the greater the amount of radiant
17 energy will be absorbed from the sun. By miscalculating temperature and nutrient increases,
18 and relying inappropriately on modeled mean channel velocity, the EIR/S does not correctly
19 evaluate the impact from increased HABs.
20 335. The Project's removal of up to half of the flow of the Sacramento River will result
21 in higher nutrient concentrations, promoting more frequent formation of HABs. The EIR/S does
22 not include modelling for the areas where HABs are most likely to occur. It is undisputed that
23 both humans and animals can suffer health impacts due to consuming HABs-tainted water.
24 336. The EIR/S fails to adequately analyze the Project's effects on water temperature.
25 The EIR/S considers only one factor - flow rate - in concluding the Project would cause only
26 "minor changes" in water temperature. Many factors contribute to changes in water
27 temperature, including air temperature, humidity, wind speed, and turbidity, yet the EIR/S
28 ignores these factors in its very limited analysis of water temperature and related impacts. Thus,

86
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

-

2 the EIR/S conclusion that the Project will only result in "minor changes" to water temperature is
not supported by substantial evidence.

3

4 337. The EIR/S concedes that it did not account for requirements that may appear in the

5 WQCP update, and did not analyze whether modelled operations could comply with such new

6 requirements. Violation of those requirements would constitute a significant environmental

7 impact requiring CEQA disclosure and potentially mitigation.
338.

8 The EIR/S fails to adequately disclose or analyze Project water quality impacts

9 due to increased contaminants generally. The EIR/S concludes that impacts for a number of

10 water contaminants-including selenium, nutrients, total suspended solids, and pesticides-are

11 not significant, or are less than significant, without comparing expected Project levels to existing
levels, or protective standards for these contaminants.

12

13 339. The EIR/S fails to disclose or analyze Project water quality impacts generated by

14 increased traffic of heavy barges in shallow Delta channels, which are likely to agitate mud in

15 the channel, increasing water turbidity and releasing contaminants that had been sequestered in

16 the sediment. Some of the areas where this may occur have little flow, so impaired water
quality could persist until the next rainy season.
17

18 340. The EIR/S fails to analyze potential impacts due to increased methylmercury and

19 other carcinogens in Delta water supplies. The EIR/S fails to disclose or analyze how the

20 Project's water quality impacts may impair the use of public trust resources for protected public

21 trust uses such as swimming fishing, and boating.

22 341. As discussed elsewhere herein, the 1959 DPA's mandate that exports from the

23 Delta be taken from the "common pool" within the Delta, and not from the uppermost northern

24 tip of the Delta as enabled by the Project's tunnels, has ensured that the state and federal

25 government, as well as the millions of people who receive Delta export water and the owners

26 and operators of hundreds of thousands of acres of farmland that utilize such water, have a direct

27 stake in ensuring that the Delta water quality always remains adequately fresh. The Project's

28 tunnels are by design intended to precisely (and unlawfully) circumvent the common pool.

87
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

-

2 342. The EIR/S fails to adequately discuss, analyze and mitigate the environmental

3 impacts caused by circumvention of the common pool. Such impacts include, but are not

4 limited to, impacts to Delta water quality and flow from the bypass of freshwater through the

5 Project's tunnels that would have otherwise flowed through the Delta towards the existing South

6 Delta export pumps in the absence of the tunnels during events such as the following: (1)

7 declared drought emergencies leading to suspension of Delta water quality and flow

8 requirements, thereby enabling the bypass of such freshwater flows in lieu of utilizing those
flows to maintain Delta water quality for the existing South Delta export pumps; (2) individual
9 or widespread levee failures which draw sea water into the Delta, thereby motivating DWR to
10

11 divert available freshwater through the tunnels rather than allowing that water to flow through

12 the Delta to freshen and restore Delta water quality for the benefit of DWR's South Delta export

13 pumps; and (3) sea level rise, which may similarly motivate DWR to temporarily or otherwise

14 abandon its South Delta export pumps and, hence, abandon the preservation and restoration of

15 water quality within the Delta, in favor of diverting the available freshwater through its tunnels.

16 343. The EIR/S fails to adequately examine, and compare and contrast, how Delta

17 water quality, and all other aspects of the environment, will fare with and without the tunnels in

18 such events, and the EIR/S fails to adequately discuss, and DWR fails to ultimately adopt,

19 mitigation measures that will mitigate the environmental impacts that will result from the use of
the tunnels in such events.

20

21 344. Such impacts include impacts to the short and long-term operation, maintenance,

22 rehabilitation and improvement of levees within the Delta, which provide significant water

23 quality benefits by repelling the intrusion of salinity into the Delta for the benefit of DWR's

24 existing South Delta export pumps and all other beneficiaries of Delta water quality. Under

25 existing conditions, DWR has a strong interest in the operation, maintenance, rehabilitation and

26 improvement of such levees because of the significant water quality benefits they provide to

27 DWR's existing South Delta export pumps. The Project's tunnels, by design, will substantially

28 impair that interest by affording DWR the ability to entirely bypass the Delta, and, hence, the
water quality therein, via exports through the Project's tunnels.

88
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

I 345. The EIR/S fails to consider state and federal anti-degradation policies and neglects
2 to analyze whether the Project complies with those policies.

3 346. The EIR/S fails to adequately mitigate both Project-level and cumulative water

4 quality impacts.

5 347. The EIR/S does not provide specific, formulated, enforceable mitigation for water

6 quality impacts, but instead offers an "optional menu" approach, wherein no specific measure is

7 required for mitigating even the most serious water quality impacts.

8 348. System operators do have some flexibility to respond to unique or anomalous

o events that may occur in the Delta. However, the degradation of water quality shown in Project
10 modeling results not from a unique or anomalous event, but, rather, from the proposed
11 operations of the Project. Mitigation and Environmental Commitments in the EIR/S rely on
12 changes in Project operations to correct for anticipated water quality degradation. Prior to
13 certification of the EIR/S, a Project operations plan was required. Deferring future operations to
14 a future plan is not a proper mitigation.
15 349. Because the EIR/S makes the unsupported determination that Project water quality
16 impacts from HABs will be less than significant, it impermissibly fails to propose any mitigation
17 for these impacts. Reliance on a vague promise in the text of the FEIR/S to manage water flow

18 through Delta channels with "real-time operations" is unenforceable and not reflected in the
19 CEQA Findings or the MMRP.
20 350. DWR's determination that all water quality impacts other than WQ-14 would be
21 less than significant or would be mitigated to less than significant levels is not supported by
22 substantial evidence.

23 351. The water quality impacts of the Project, in combination with the impacts of past,

24 present and reasonably foreseeable future projects, are cumulatively significant.
25 352. The EIR/S fails to consider the additive and synergistic impacts of pollutants

26 mixing together as a result of the project. Constituents present together in water supplies can
27 combine to create adverse effects on water quality, yet the EIR/S includes only two brief
28

89
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

A

- sentences on how additive and synergistic interactions of constituents affect wildlife. The issue

2 is ignored with respect to impacts on water supply use.

3 353. DWR's failure to adequately analyze the Project-level water quality impacts

4 rendered DWR's attempted cumulative impact analysis inadequate.

5 Geology and Seismicity Impacts - EIR/S Chapter 9

6 354. Objectives of the Project include reducing perceived seismic risks to SWP and

7 CVP water supplies. Yet, the EIR/S includes an inadequate disclosure and analysis of geology

8 and seismicity impacts.

9 355. The EIR/S fails to adequately disclose and analyze Project seismicity impacts as a

10 result of the fact that it relies on geotechnical analysis which has not yet occurred. The EIR/S
11 claims that this analysis will occur prior to construction, but sufficient evidence has not been

12 gathered to support the claim that geology and soils impacts will be less than significant. Nor is

13 effective mitigation of potential impacts possible without this analysis.

14 356. The EIR/S fails to adequately disclose or analyze Project-generated seismic
15 impacts resulting from levees being compromised or weakened due to Project construction, and
16 therefore becoming more vulnerable to a seismic event that may occur during construction.
17 357. The EIR/S fails to adequately disclose and analyze how the intensive, long-term
18 dewatering and tunnel boring operations, and other construction and implementation activities
19 associated with the Project, may destabilize soils, farms and levees, resulting in sinkholes,
20 subsidence, levee failures and other impacts within and outside of the Project footprint.
21 358. The EIR/S fails to adequately disclose and analyze Project impacts resulting from
22 the vulnerability of Project components, including the tunnels and shafts, to seismic events that
23 occur during Project construction and operation. Nor does it analyze secondary impacts that
24 may occur if Project components suffer damage or fail completely during such an event.
25 359. The EIR/S fails to adequately disclose and analyze Project impacts to gas wells

26 and fields throughout the North Delta. Nor does it adequately mitigate such impacts. Tunnel
27 boring operations would potentially damage existing gas wells, which in turn would create
28 hazardous conditions. The Conceptual Engineering Report shows that the North Delta is replete

90
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

1 with oil and gas wells. (See Conceptual Engineering Report (2015) p. 155.) The EIR/S fails to

2 disclose and analyze these potential impacts.

3 360. The EIR/S fails to adequately mitigate Project-level and cumulative geology and

4 seismicity impacts.

5 361. DWR's determination that all geology and seismicity impacts would be mitigated

6 to less than significant levels is not supported by substantial evidence.

7 362. The geology and seismicity impacts of the Project, in combination with the

8 impacts of past, present and reasonably foresecable future projects, are cumulatively significant.
9 363. DWR's failure to adequately analyze the Project-level geology and seismicity
10 impacts renders DWR's attempted cumulative impact analysis inadequate.
11 Soils Impacts - EIR/S Chapter 10

12 364. The magnitude of the Project necessitates vast amount of soil movement, and the
13 operation of the Project changes Delta hydrology in a manner that will fundamentally affect the
14 soils in the Delta.

15 365. The EIR/S fails to include any disclosure or analysis of a number of soils impacts.
16 366. The EIR/S fails to disclose the characteristics of the tunnel muck (RTM) that will
17 be generated by the Project. The EIR/S concedes that it will perform soil borings to determine
18 strength, compressibility composition, and other characteristics at some point, but this
19 information is not included in the EIR/S. As a result, it is impossible to predict how much of the
20 muck may be reusable, and for what purposes.
21 367. Because to the EIR/S cannot predict how much of the muck will be reusable, is
22 also impossible to disclose or analyze impacts related to muck disposal. The EIR/S failed to
23 disclose or analyze how Project tunnel muck disposal may alter the natural soil profiles and
24 horizons and change soil type, drainage, range of usage and productivity of the soil. The EIR/S
25 also fails to disclose the impacts associated with the reuse of tunnel muck, which may require
26 trucking to various locations, conditioning it prior to use. Reuse may also generate habitat
27 impacts and changed flood risks.
28

91
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

1 368. The EIR/S did not adequately analyze how saltwater intrusion into the Delta as a

2 result of the Project, and subsequent application of water to lands via irrigation, as well as

3 natural seepage, will affect the salinity of soil and its agricultural productivity.

4 369. The EIR/S fails to adequately disclose and analyze Project-related soil erosion of

5 levees, which can result in decreased levee stability and increased seepage.

6 370. The EIR/S fails to adequately mitigate both Project-level and cumulative soils
7 impacts.

8 371. DWR's determination that all soils impacts other than SOILS-2 and SOILS-7

9 would be mitigated to less than significant levels is not supported by substantial evidence.
10 372. The soils impacts of the Project, in combination with the impacts of past, present,
11 and reasonably foreseeable future projects, are cumulatively significant.

12 373. DWR's failure to adequately analyze the Project-level soils impacts renders
13 DWR's attempted cumulative impacts analysis inadequate

14 Fish and Aquatic Resources Impacts - EIR/S Chapter 11
15 374. The Project interferes with the main migratory route for several listed fish species
16 and would kill some species (salmon, steelhead, sturgeon and lamprey) in an intentional tradeoff
17 to attempt to protect other aquatic species, such as the Delta smelt. The Project would harm
18 aquatic resources both directly (e.g., mechanical damage, impingement, predation at the NDDs)
19 and indirectly (reductions in flow leading to water quality impairment, increased formation of
20 HABs and other changes).
21 375. While the EIR/S attempts to discuss some 220 impacts on fish and aquatic
22 resources, the EIR/S includes an inadequate disclosure and analysis of Project impacts to fish
23 and aquatic resources during both Project construction and operation.
24 376. EIR/S fails to assess how Project impacts will affect the availability and suitability
25 of fisheries both upstream and downstream of the Project.
26 377. The EIR/S fails to analyze whether development of experimental shallow wetland
27 habitat is detrimental to salmon and other anadromous fish due to stranding and predation due to
28 the spreading of invasive weeds and other localized impacts.

92
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

378. The proposed NDDs include fish screens of unprecedented length which are still

2 in conceptual design. These experimental screens would kill fish by direct smashing against the

3 screen, and indirectly harm fish by entraining massive amounts of nutrients in system that is

4 already nutrient-deprived. There is no evidence that these experimental screens would function

5 properly at this scale in the proposed locations, which are subject to tidal influence.

6 379. The EIR/S fails to analyze how HABs exacerbated by the Project may affect fish

7 populations, and more generally, the aquatic food web.

8 380. The EIR/S fails to disclose and analyze how reverse tidal flows caused by the

9 Project would affect fish populations by bringing them repeatedly past the same massive fish

10 screens.

11 381. The EIR/S finds that impacts to CESA-listed fish species will be less than
12 significant, despite the fact that Project construction and operations could trap or otherwise
13 block fish passage, and fails to recognize that CESA continues to be violated at the South Delta

14 pumps. (See Watershed Enforcers v. Dep't of Water Res. (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 969, 977.)
15 382. The Delta is currently sediment-starved. The EIR/S estimates that the Project

16 would remove approximately 291,600 cubic feet, or over 7 tons per year of dry solids. The
17 EIR/S fails to analyze the impact on aquatic resources of removal of this volume of sediment

18 from the North Delta.

19 383. The EIR/S fails to adequately analyze impacts to fish, including Delta smelt, from
20 the Project's removal of a large quantity of sediment from the Delta, making them more
21 vulnerable to predators. Sediment impacts to existing wetlands from increased scour are also

22 undisclosed.

23 384. The EIR/S, in analyzing potential impacts to longfin smelt, ignores how variation

24 in population size over time affects long-term population survival. To the extent mitigation for
25 take of longfin smelt relies on unidentified sources of water to meet Spring outflow criteria,

26 DWR's less than significant determination is unsupported.

27

28

93
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

1 385. The EIR/S fails to adequately disclose and analyze how increased nutrient and
2 contaminant levels caused by the Project will affect bioaccumulation of those contaminants in

3 fish, and the related impacts to reproductive success and embryo and fry mortality.

4 386. The EIR/S fails to adequately analyze how operating Project intakes at an area

5 with a larger fish population than the area surrounding the existing South Delta intakes, as well

6 as a documented predator population, will affect loss of fish, eggs, and larvae.
7 387. The EIR/S admits that the Project would have a significant and unavoidable

8 impact on bass from impingement and entrainment in the newly proposed North Delta intakes.
9 (Impact AQUA-201.) The EIR/S provides no explanation for why these same conditions would
10 not also lead to significant and unavoidable impacts on state and federally listed fish species.
11 388. The EIR/S fails to adequately analyze Project impacts to aquatic species due to
12 Project-related increases in methylmercury. The EIR/S erroneously determines that these
13 increases will not have a significant impact because they will allegedly not be as significant as
14 the increases generated by alternatives in the DEIR/S. Impacts must be measured against the
15 baseline conditions, not the impacts generated by previously proposed alternatives. Further, the
16 EIR/S appears to rely on the fact that the increased accumulation of mercury in fish tissue is not
17 quantifiable to determine that the impact is less than significant.

18 389. The EIR/S fails to disclose and analyze how Project-related changes to operations
19 of reservoirs may affect Delta fisheries. The EIR/S fails to adequately mitigate both Project-
20 level and cumulative impacts to fish and aquatic resources.
21 390. The EIR/S proposes no mitigation that would address any impacts to native and
22 by increased cyanobacteria proliferation. listed fish that may be caused
23 391. In order to mitigate impacts to fish, the EIR/S proposes to use an experimental
24 design for the intake fish screens that has not been shown to be effective. Though the EIR/S
25 contends that the fish screen has a responsive design, it includes no dynamic plan to change
26 screen operations based on the presence of fish. The only available response is to stop operating|
27 the intake pumps, which would take significant time.

28

94
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

1 392. The EIR/S does not adequately mitigate impacts to fish due to pile driving and

2 other noise-generating activities because it fails to integrate feasible mitigation measures such as

3 noise dampening bubble curtains and fish avoidance measures.

4 393. To the extent the nonphysical fish barriers, such as that described in

5 Environmental Commitment 16 for Georgiana Slough, are necessary to mitigate for effects on

6 salmonid survival associated with the operation of the NDDs, those measures are not

7 enforceable and cannot be relied upon to mitigate salmonid impacts.

8 394. The EIR/S does not analyze the potential to reduce take of special status fish

9 species at the South Delta pumps by imposing mitigation measures or adopting alternatives that
10 would improve those facilities as contemplated in CALFED and the 2008 FWS BO.
11 395. DWR's determination that all fish and aquatic resources impacts other than
12 AQUA-201 would be mitigated to less than significant levels is not supported by substantial
13 evidence.

14 396. The fish and aquatic resources impacts of the Project, in combination with the
15 impacts of past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future projects, are cumulatively significant.
16 397. DWR's failure to adequately analyze the Project-level fish and aquatic resources
17 impacts renders DWR's attempted cumulative impacts analysis inadequate

18 Terrestrial and Biological Resources Impacts - EIR/S Chapter 12
19 398. The Project would cause widespread disruption of terrestrial wildlife throughout
20 the Project area during both construction and operation of the Project. While the EIR/S
21 implicitly acknowledges the scale of biological impacts in recognizing some 187 potential
22 impacts on biological resources, the EIR/S glosses over the profound impacts the Project would
23 have on the Delta's sensitive biological resources.

24 399. The EIR/S includes an inadequate disclosure and analysis of the Project's
25 terrestrial and biological resources impacts during both Project construction and operation.

26 400. The EIR/S fails to adequately disclose and analyze how increased traffic in the
27 Wildlife Refuge will affect populations of CESA-listed species, including the giant garter snake.
28 Increased traffic would cause mortality to individuals, limit movement to meet daily and

95
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

1 seasonal needs like feeding, sheltering, and reproduction; and cause species to avoid road-

2 adjacent habitat due to increased noise levels. The EIR/S failure to describe these impacts

3 renders it deficient as an informational document.

4 401. The EIR/S fails to disclose Project impacts to biological resources due to

5 emissions of hydrogen sulfide from tunnel muck, which can be fatal to wildlife. Although the

6 EIR/S analyzed the odor impacts related to this gas, it performed no analysis of the impacts to

7 wildlife that may occur at various concentrations of the gas.

8 402. The EIR/S fails to disclose Project impacts to biological resources from erosion in

9 wildlife habitat, damaging foraging and rearing habitat for the giant garter snake and other

10 species.

11 403. The EIR/S fails to adequately disclose and analyze impacts to the greater sandhill
12 crane, a Fully Protected Species under the Fish and Game Code, as well as CESA-listed birds

13 such as the tricolored blackbird. Among the Project components likely to create impacts to the
14 greater sandhill crane are: loss of a significant portion of the last remaining crane habitat in the
15 region both during Project construction and permanently; avian mortality due to collisions with

16 Project-serving transmission lines; impairment of normal crane activities due to increased noise

17 levels and stress. The EIR/S fails to adequately analyze these impacts.

18 404. The EIR/S fails to adequately analyze Project impacts to terrestrial and biological

19 resources due to the loss of wetlands habitat. Impact BIO-176 in the EIR/S contends that

20 impacts from the fill of nearly 700 acres of wetlands, arguably the largest wetland fill Project
21 ever seen in the state, would be reduced to less than significant levels during a future USACE

22 permitting process. A future permitting process cannot substitute for properly analyzing these
23 impacts in a CEQA document.

24 405. The EIR/S fails to disclose the Project's impacts to terrestrial and biological
25 resources due to the loss of agricultural and cultivated habitat. Appendix 12E states that the

26 Project will permanently impact 5,888 acres of cultivated land and temporarily impact 1,155
27 acres, totaling 7,043 acres of impacted cultivated land. The EIR/S fails to describe specifically
28 how these lands would be impacted and the resulting effect on native species that rely on

96
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

1 cultivated lands habitat. This lack of disclosure constitutes a failure to proceed in a manner

2 required by law.

3 406. The EIR/S fails to adequately mitigate both Project-level and cumulative terrestrial

4 and biological resources impacts.

5 407. The CEQA Findings fail to provide any evidence supporting less than significant
6| impact determinations for numerous biological impacts, including Impacts BIO-68 through
7 BIO-74. Thus, these less than significant impact determinations for these impacts are
8  unsupported and erroneous.

9 408. The Project purports to create over 11,000 acres of habitat through conservation
10 easements that would allegedly protect cultivated lands. The MMRP indicates that conservation

11 easements will be used as part of Environmental Commitments 3, 4, and 7-10 to mitigate over a
12 dozen impacts to biological resources. Use of conservation easements is not adequate mitigation
13 because development in the Delta is already limited by local and state land use restrictions.

14 409. Project mitigation for destruction of giant garter snake habitat is inadequate. The
15 EIR/S proposes to undertake habitat restoration after the destruction of habitat. This does not
16 provide displaced giant garter snake refuge in the interim between habitat destruction and
17 restoration. In addition, the current existing habitat provides a corridor for a species movement;

18 destruction of any portion of this corridor will strand some population segments and potentially
19 impair the species' genetic integrity.

20 410. The EIR/S fails to adequately mitigate impacts to the greater sandhill crane by not
21 including the undergrounding and removal of transmission lines as required mitigation.
22 411. DWR's determination that all biological resources impacts would be mitigated to
23 less than significant levels is not supported by substantial evidence.
24 412. The terrestrial and biological resources impacts of the Project, in combination with
25 the impacts of past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future projects, are cumulatively

26 significant.

27 413. DWR's failure to adequately analyze the Project-level terrestrial and biological
28 resources impacts renders DWR's attempted cumulative impacts analysis inadequate.

97
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

1 414. The EIR/S fails to integrate a discussion of how other agencies are expected to

2 exercise their permitting authority with respect to terrestrial biological resources. Lead agencies

3 must consult with other agencies that have authority over sensitive natural resources within the

4 project area. (Banning Ranch Conservancy v. City of Newport Beach (2017) 2 Cal.5th 918,

5 936.) By not integrating and disclosing these other agency actions, an EIR fails as an
6 informational document.

7 Land Use Impacts - EIR/S Chapter 13

8 415. The Project would fundamentally alter land uses in the Delta, contrary to the

9 careful planning of Delta counties and state and local agencies charged with Delta land use

10 planning.

11 416. The EIR/S fails to disclose or analyze all Project impacts to land use.
12 417. The EIR/S fails to adequately analyze the Project's consistency with the 2009
13 DRA, which requires that the coequal goals "shall be achieved in a manner that protects and
14 enhances the unique cultural, recreational, natural resource, and agricultural values of the Delta
15 as an evolving place." (Wat. Code, § 29702, subd. (a).)

16 418. The Project is inconsistent with the 2009 DRA in a number of ways, including, but
17 not limited to, the fact that it promotes increased reliance on the Delta, impairs Delta water
18 quality; impairs agricultural operations during Project construction; damages agricultural

19 infrastructure; fails to protect the a Delta as a place, and fails to use best available science in Delta
20 water management.

21 419. DWR's claim that it is not obligated to protect the Delta as a place beyond
22 mitigating significant impacts pursuant to CEQA is incorrect. DWR failed to analyze and
23 mitigate the Project's impacts on land use that relate to DWR's obligation to protect the Delta as
24 place.

25 420. The EIR/S fails to adequately assess whether the Project complies with the flow

26 criteria or biological objectives contained in the DFW document, "Quantifiable Biological
27 Objectives and Flow Criteria for Aquatic and Terrestrial Species of Concern Dependent on the
28 Delta Prepared pursuant to the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Reform Act of 2009."

98
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

L 421. The EIR/S provides an inadequate analysis of potentially significant impacts due
2 to Project construction and mitigation conflicting with ongoing habitat conservation plans and

3 the general plans of San Joaquin, Yolo, Solano, Contra Costa and Sacramento counties, and fails

4 to propose or require adequate mitigation for these impacts.

5 422. The EIR/S fails to adequately mitigate Project-level and cumulative impacts to

6 land use.

7 423. The EIR/s relies on mitigation measures and environmental commitments that may
8 themselves conflict with land use policies, but the EIR/S fails to disclose adequate information
o about the nature and location of these measures to determine what these impacts may be. For
10 instance, the Project includes components that have not yet been designed or sited. Without
11 knowing how and where these components would be constructed, the EIR/S cannot properly
12 disclose conflicts with existing land use designations.
13 424. DWR's determination that all impacts to land use other than LU-3 would be
14 mitigated to less than significant levels is not supported by substantial evidence.
15 425. Project impacts to land use, in combination with the impacts of past, present, and
16 reasonably foreseeable future projects, are cumulatively significant.

17 426. DWR's failure to adequately analyze the Project-level land use resources impacts

18 renders DWR's attempted cumulative impacts analysis inadequate.

19 Agricultural Resources Impacts - EIR/S Chapter 14
20 427. While Project proponents may argue that agriculture in other areas of the state
21 could potentially benefit from the Project, the Project only hurts Delta agriculture. The Delta
22 includes the largest contiguous acreage of Prime Farmland in the state. The Project would
23 directly destroy over 5,000 acres of farmland in the Delta and indirectly impact thousands of

24 additional acres of currently productive and sustainable Delta agricultural land by destroying or
25 degrading local water supplies, changing water levels such that local supplies become

26 inaccessible, interfering with agricultural operations, and blocking access to agricultural
27 markets--among other negative impacts.

28

99
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

428. The EIR/S includes an inadequate disclosure and analysis of both the Project's
2 construction and operational impacts to agricultural resources.

429. The Agricultural Impacts chapter never discloses either the total acreage of

4 agricultural land that will suffer permanent conversion as a result of the Project nor how many

5 acres will suffer indirect Project impacts.

6 430. Similarly, the EIR/S fails to disclose the location of habitat mitigation lands and

7 how that habitat mitigation will affect the ongoing productivity of agricultural lands. The EIR/S

8 proposes to layer or "stack" habitat restrictions on top of agricultural conservation easements

9 under the guise of mitigating habitat and farmland losses using the same conservation properties.
10 This approach improperly compromises the efficacy of agricultural mitigation by reducing the
11 long-term agricultural viability of affected parcels.

12 431. The EIR/S makes no attempt to analyze when "temporary" loss of agricultural
13 land may become permanent, or whether land returned to production after a temporary loss may
14 suffer permanent effects to productivity.
15 432. The EIR/S fails to analyze the effect on Delta agriculture of the recognized
16 significant and unavoidable impact from increased bird airstrikes under Impact HAZ-8 from
17 restoration. Among other impacts, bird airstrikes could interfere with farmers' ability to conduct
18 necessary aerial spraying.

19 433. The EIR/S fails to adequately analyze how Project construction's interference with
20 local surface and groundwater supplies would affect Delta agriculture, and fails to account for
21 the a fact that even a "temporary" interference can disrupt an entire crop season and/or destroy
22 permanent crops.

23 434. The EIR/S fails to meaningfully analyze the impacts associated with the thousands

24 of acres of farmland that would be lost, on either a temporary or permanent basis, due to Project
25 construction and operations.

26 435. The EIR/S fails to adequately analyze how Project-generated changes in
27 groundwater elevations-either by lowering them with groundwater pumping for construction
28

100
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

-

2 dewatering, or cutting off the seepage through cutoff walls at the intakes, or at shafts, etc. as the

3 Project proposes-will have both direct and indirect impacts on Delta agriculture.

436.

4 The EIR/S fails to adequately disclose and analyze localized impacts to drainage

5 and irrigation caused by the proposed tunnel muck disposal areas, including those on Andrus

6 Island, as well as impacts to the adjacent orchards caused by fugitive dust and other impacts
from the muck disposal sites.

7

8 437. The EIR/S fails to disclose or analyze how potential Project-related increases in

9 salinity of surface water and soils would impact agricultural resources. The EIR/S fails to

10 address the special vulnerabilities to salt loading of soils in the Delta, and the inability of many

11 areas of the Delta to manage salt loading through typical means such as water
application/leaching.

12 438.

13 The EIR/S fails to adequately disclose or analyze how Project impacts to water

14 reliability would affect the production of agricultural land and the quality of crops produced.
439.

15 The EIR/S acknowledges the importance of intricate Delta drainage systems,

16 which manage the interaction of surface water and groundwater through collaborative actions at

17 the farm and local scale, to agriculture in the Project area. Yet the EIR/S fails to adequately

18 disclose and analyze how the systems work; nor does it describe how Project disruption of these

19 systems could impact Delta agriculture in either the immediate or broader Project area.

20 440. The EIR/S fails to analyze how the anticipated one-foot decrease in North Delta

21 water levels would impact local agriculture, as this water level decline would interfere with

22 irrigating through existing water diversion systems designed for existing flow and water level

ranges.

23

24 441. The EIR/S fails to adequately analyze how the Project's impacts to water quality,

25 by promoting increased nutrient levels and therefore higher levels of toxic and non-toxic

26 organisms, including HABs and hyacinth, may impact Delta agriculture. Some organisms may

27 decrease agricultural intake efficiency, while others can harm livestock or diminish crop
economic values.

28

101
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

442. The EIR/S fails to adequately analyze or disclose how Project interference with

2 farm access and infrastructure over the 14-year or longer construction period will impact Delta
3 agricultural resources. The lack of disclosure constitutes a failure to proceed in a manner

4 required by law.

5 443. DWR's claim that it is not obligated to protect the Delta as a place beyond

6 mitigating significant impacts pursuant to CEQA is incorrect. DWR failed to analyze and

7 mitigate the Project's impacts on agriculture that relate to DWR's obligation to protect the Delta

8 as a place.

9 444. The EIR/S fails to adequately mitigate both Project-level and cumulative impacts

10 to agricultural resources.

11 445. The EIR/S does not propose adequate mitigation for Project impacts to agriculture
12 related to Delta drainage systems.

13 446. The EIR/S fails to adequately analyze potential impacts to agriculture created by
14 the "no spray" zones that the Project's open water restoration would create.
15 447. The EIR/S also improperly defers analysis and formulation of mitigation
16 measures. For example: AG-1 "develop an Agricultural Lands Stewardship Plan (ALSP) to
17 maintain agricultural productivity and mitigate for loss of Important Farmland and land subject

18 to Williamson Act contracts or in Farmland Security Zones" remains the primary mitigation

19 measure for agricultural impacts. Yet the ALSP is merely a conceptual idea and does nothing to
20 mitigate for the very real impacts of the Project on Delta farms. The ALSP lacks any

21 performance standards and defers determination of the feasibility of mitigation to a later,
22 undefined date. Mitigation measure AG-l is inadequate because the ALSP is not defined, not

23 feasible, enforceable, or funded.

24 448. Mitigation Measure AG-1 also contemplates mitigating the conversion of
25 agricultural land via conservation easements. Mitigation in the form of conservation easements,

26 however, would not help mitigate the severe Project impacts to Delta agriculture unless carried
27 out in a manner consistent with strict standards (including those set forth in many county
28 farmland conservation programs) relating to the soil quality, water resources, development

102
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

1 potential, and similar attributes relating to the suitability of conservation lands. Mitigation

2 Measure AG-1 does not incorporate any clear standards or otherwise assure that conservation

3 easements will effectively reduce the impacts of Project-related conversions of farmland.

4 449. The EIR/S fails to analyze the Project's cumulative impacts to agriculture. There

5 are impacts in nearly a dozen other resource areas that will also create negative impacts (e.g.,

6 surface water, groundwater, water quality, land use). To comport with CEQA's requirement of

7 facilitating informed decision-making, the EIR/S must analyze the compounding effects of these

8 impacts on agriculture.

9 450. DWR's determination that all impacts to agricultural resources other than AG-1
10 through AG-4 would be mitigated to less than significant levels is not supported by substantial
11 evidence.

12 451. Project impacts to agricultural resources, in combination with the impacts of past,
13 present, and reasonably foreseeable future projects, are cumulatively significant.
14 452. DWR's failure to adequately analyze the Project-level agricultural resources
15 impacts renders DWR's attempted cumulative impacts analysis inadequate.

16 Recreation Impacts - EIR/S Chapter 15
17 453. The Delta currently provides a wide array of recreational opportunities. A survey
18 of the Delta at every time of the year will find members of the public from locations near and far
19 enjoying the unique scenery, culture and environment of the Delta. Disruption caused by the
20 proposed Project would alter the character of the Delta during both construction and operation of
21 the Project, severely hindering the Delta's currently rich recreational offerings.

22 454. The EIR/S includes an inadequate disclosure and analysis of the Project's
23 recreational impacts during both construction and operation.
24 455. The baseline used in assessing recreational impacts improperly obscured the
25 significance of the Project's effects on recreation and access to recreational facilities by

26 including sea level rise a projected to occur as a consequence of climate change. The flawed
27 baseline diminished the actual significance of the Project's effects on recreation and access to
28 recreational facilities.

103
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

1 456. The EIR/S fails to adequately assess the impact on recreational activities of

2 increases in populations of mosquitoes and other vectors due to the introduction of
3 sedimentation basins, lagoons, and other temporary and permanent Project features.
4 457. The EIR/S fails to adequately disclose and analyze how Project operations may

5 affect water quality and quantity, including through promoting HABs and affecting salinity,

6 which will in turn cause impacts to recreational uses of the Delta such as swimming, fishing and
7 boating.

8 458. The EIR/S fails to adequately disclose and analyze how Project construction

9 impacts will affect water-based recreation. The EIR/S proposes to concentrate construction

10 activities during the spring and summer months, when people are most likely to use water
11 recreation. The impacts to air quality, increased noise, and the dramatically increased traffic on
12 the roads and in the rivers and channels of the Delta will interfere with use of Delta water bodies

13 for recreation.

14 459. The EIR/S fails to disclose or analyze how the Project's impacts may impair the
15 use of public trust resources for protected public trust recreational uses such as swimming
16 fishing, and boating.

17 460. Delta recreation includes agritourism activities, such as farm and winery tours and
18 special events. The EIR/S fails to disclose or analyze Project impacts to agritourism activities in
19 Delta towns that will be in the path of Project construction for more than a decade.
20 461. There are over 25 wineries in the Delta, many of which have tasting rooms for
21 visitors. There are over a dozen other Delta agritourism sites, including some located in Delta
22 legacy towns such as Isleton, Locke, Hood, Walnut Grove, and Courtland. These towns will
23 suffer Project impacts from increased traffic, diminished air quality, impacts to water supply and
24 water quality, and noise pollution. All of these will negatively impact agritourism activities,
25 which rely heavily on their natural setting to attract visitors.

26 462. The EIR/S fails to adequately disclose and analyze impacts to recreation by
27 limiting opportunities for wildlife viewing. The public uses the Wildlife Refuge and other
28

104
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

locations in the Delta as sites for viewing wildlife. Recreational uses of areas impacted by

2 Project construction and operation will be impaired by the Project.

3 463. DWR's claim that it is not obligated to protect the Delta as a place beyond

4 mitigating significant impacts pursuant to CEQA is incorrect. DWR failed to analyze and

5 mitigate the Project's impacts on recreation that relate to DWR's obligation to protect the Delta

6 a as a place.

7 464. DWR's determination that impacts to recreational resources REC-2 and REC-3

8 would be mitigated to less than significant levels is not supported by substantial evidence.
9 465. Project impacts to recreational resources, in combination with the impacts of past,

10 present, and reasonably foreseeable future projects, are cumulatively significant.
11 466. DWR's failure to adequately analyze the Project-level recreational resources

12 impacts renders DWR's attempted cumulative impacts analysis inadequate.

13 Aesthetics and Visual Resources Impacts - EIR/S Chapter 17
14 467. The Project would forever change the Delta, and, in particular, would mar
15 currently bucolic farming communities spanning the length of the Project. The scale of the

16 Project would dwarf area landmarks and scar the Sacramento River and other Delta waterways
17 where Project components were built.

18 468. The EIR/S includes an inadequate disclosure and analysis of the Project's

19 aesthetics impacts during both Project construction and operation.
20 469. The EIR/S fails to analyze whether Project construction or operation would
21 conflict with local guidelines on visual quality.

22 470. The EIR/S fails to adequately analyze the Project's security lighting would create
23 a new source of glare, especially at night.

24 471. The EIR/S fails to adequately analyze Project impacts to visual resources by
25 disrupting views in the Delta, including the Delta Scenic Loop, which brings visitors to many

26 marinas and harbors.

27 472. The EIR/S fails to adequately analyze the Project's impacts on visual resources

28 due to the construction of up to five facilities distributed over ten miles within view of

105
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

-

2 California Scenic Highway 160, which would re-route the highway during construction and
destroy the scenic view afterwards.

3 473.

4 The EIR/S fails to adequately analyze the Project's impacts on visual resources

5 caused by permanent Project components that would stand above the ground, including the

6 intakes, forebays, surge towers, tunnel shafts, and tunnel boring operations.

7 474. Surge towers would be located all along the Project route and two of the 40-foot

8 diameter, 100-feet high surge towers would be within one mile of the Wildlife Refuge. The

9 surge towers would become the most dominant visible feature in the region, creating extreme

10 visual conflict with area's existing wildlife habitat and farmland scenery.

11 475. The EIR/S fails to adequately mitigate both Project-level and cumulative impacts
to visual resources.

12 476.

13 DWR's determination that all aesthetics and visual resources impacts other than

14 AES-1 through AES-4 and AES-6 would be mitigated to less than significant levels is not
supported by substantial evidence.
15

16 477. The aesthetic and visual resources impacts of the Project, in combination with the

17 impacts of past, present and reasonably foreseeable future projects, are cumulatively significant.
478.

18 DWR's failure to adequately analyze Project-level aesthetic and visual resources

19 impacts renders DWR's attempted cumulative impacts analysis inadequate.

20 479. Cultural Resources Impacts - EIR/S Chapter 18

21 Through tunneling alone, the Project would disturb more than 2 million cubic

22 yards of "tunnel muck," along with disturbing hundreds of acres of work areas during a 10 to

23 14-year construction period. This process is likely to unearth cultural resources from throughout
the Delta's history.

24 480.

25 The EIR/S includes an inadequate disclosure and analysis of the Project's cultural
resources impacts during both construction and operation.

26 481.

27 The EIR/S fails to adequately disclose or analyze impacts to cultural resources due

28 to the potential to disturb cultural resources throughout the vast Project area, including Native

106
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

P

2 American remains, which are known to be buried in the vicinity of several of the Project
components.

3 482.

4 The EIR/S fails contains little or no site-specific information regarding cultural

5 resources and has inadequately disclosed how those resources may be impacted by Project
construction or operation.

6

7 483. The EIR/S fails to disclose or analyze Project impacts to historical Delta

8 resources. There are a number of nationally designated historic locations within the Project

o footprint, including the Chinese immigrant town of Locke, which is designated as National

10 Historic District, and the Walnut Grove Theater, which is on the National Register of Historic
Places.

11

12 484. The EIR/S recommends improper and inadequate mitigation measures for historic

13 structures in the North Delta, including but not limited to: the Mosher House, the Greene House,

14 and the Rosebud Rancho. The EIR/S recommends the Mosher and Greene Houses be moved

15 and the Rosebud Rancho be ignored as a historic cultural resource. Relocation would

16 substantially diminish lessen the historic and cultural values of the Mosher and Greene Houses.

17 485. The suggestion that the Rosebud Rancho is a not a historic resource and should be

18 delisted from the National Register due to past restoration efforts is incorrect and unsupported.

19 Rosebud Rancho is a 150 year old Italianate Victorian home, located between Freeport and

20 Hood, that is listed on the National Register. Contrary to the EIR/S, Rosebud Rancho has not

21 lost integrity. Following a fire in 1989, a painstaking restoration process restored Rosebud

22 Rancho to its prior state. In 1993, the State Historic Preservation Officer confirmed that no

23 action would be taken to delist the Rosebud Rancho. Also in 1993, Rosebud Rancho won the
California Preservation Foundation's award for craftsmanship due to the restoration and
24 preservation effort subsequent to the fire. The conclusions in the EIR/S regarding Rosebud
25

26 Rancho are unfounded, and the Project's impacts to this historic resource must be analyzed.

486. The EIR/S fails to disclose or analyze Project impacts to the character of Delta
27 communities. A number of Delta communities would be harmed by Project impacts to
28

107
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

1 agriculture, traffic, air quality, water quality, recreation, and other resources. Yet the EIR/S fails

2 to analyze how these impacts would impair the character of these communities.

3 487. DWR's claim that it is not obligated to protect the Delta as a placc beyond

4 mitigating significant impacts pursuant to CEQA is incorrect. DWR failed to analyze and

5 mitigate the Project's impacts on cultural resources that relate directly to DWR's obligation to

6 protect the Delta as a place.

7 488. The EIR/S fails to adequately mitigate both Project-level and cumulative impacts

8 to cultural resources.

9 489. DWR's determination that all cultural resources impacts other than CUL-1

10 through CUL-7 would be mitigated to less than significant levels is not supported by substantial
11 evidence.

12 490. The cultural resources impacts of the Project, in combination with the impacts of
13 past, present and reasonably foreseeable future projects, are cumulatively significant.
14 491. DWR's failure to adequately analyze Project-level cultural resources impacts
15 renders DWR's attempted cumulative impacts analysis inadequate.

16 Transportation Impacts - EIR/S Chapter 19
17 492. The Delta's levee roads and bridges are notoriously dangerous and lack capacity
18 for any increased industrial use. The Project's 10 to14-year construction period would tax these
19 already dangerous roads with thousands of new construction vehicle trips, many of which would
20 be taken in oversized vehicles that would endanger Delta drivers, hinder Delta agriculture and
21 damage Delta roads.

22 493. The EIR/S includes an inadequate disclosure and analysis of the Project's
23 transportation impacts during both Project construction and operation.

24 494. The EIR/S fails to adequately disclose or analyze Project construction impacts to
25 traffic, in part because DWR failed to prepare the intersection analysis necessary to determine

26 Project-level impacts. DWR's explanation that "[a]n intersection-level analysis was not
27 performed because sufficient information regarding construction traffic patterns is not available

28 for this level of analysis" (FEIR/S, Appendix 19A, p. 39) is insufficient.

108
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

I 495. The EIR/S improperly relies on a third party administrative draft analysis of

2 construction traffic and circulation impacts prepared in February 2013 (FEIR/S, Appendix 19A)
3 that directly states sufficient information regarding construction traffic patterns is not available

4 and that any analysis of the issue would be "speculative and potentially misleading." As a
5 consequence, the EIR/S fails to properly evaluate constructed-related traffic impacts and

6 impermissibly defers to the intersection analysis preparation of "site-specific" plans as part of

7 mitigation measure TRANS-1a. The EIR/S fails to adequately analyze Project impacts to road

8 safety created by a significant increase in heavy truck and commuter traffic on Delta roads

9 during the decade plus Project construction period, which may degrade pavement conditions and

10 generate additional traffic-related injuries and fatalities.

11 496. The EIR/S fails to adequately analyze how the increased heavy truck and
12 commuter traffic on Delta roads may affect levels of service on those roads. Many of these
13 Delta roads already experience near shutdown conditions during the harvest season, and the
14 EIR/S fails to account for these existing conditions in measuring traffic impacts.
15 497. The EIR/S fails to disclose the fact that Project-related traffic increases on Delta
16 roads would occur in large part on "levee roads" and, therefore, fails to analyze impacts to levee
17 stability caused by increased traffic and, especially, increased traffic from heavy trucks.

18 498. The EIR/S determines, without analysis, that the increase in traffic, including

19 heavy trucks carrying Project construction materials, would not necessitate bridge
20 improvements. In addition, the EIR/S fails to disclose whether the Project would require bridge
21 construction. If it did, that construction would generate significant additional impacts that must

22 be analyzed in the EIR/S.

23 499. The EIR/S does not evaluate impacts to navigation of commercial ships in the
24 Delta channels due to the construction of in-channel Project construction, including cofferdams,

25 which would significantly decrease the area for boat passage at a dozen Delta locations.

26 500. The EIR/S fails to disclose the Project impacts related to the routes of barges
27 containing Project construction materials. Delta channels are unique, and the types of impacts
28

109
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

P

- generated by barge traffic depends in part on the route used. Because the EIR/S fails to disclose

2 the barge routes, the EIR/S fails to disclose the impacts from barge traffic on Delta waterways.

3 501. The EIR/S fails to disclose the number of barge trips necessary to construct the

4 Project, alternatively stating that the Project would require 5,500 and 11,800 trips. Should barge

5 trips be reduced, as belatedly disclosed in the document released concurrently with Project

6 approval, the commensurate additional truck trips were required to be analyzed.

7 502. The EIR/S fails to analyze how the Project-generated traffic and road closures and

8 detours would interfere with the ability of large vehicles required to harvest Delta crops

9 throughout the year to serve Delta farms.

10 503. The EIR/S fails to disclose and analyze the Project's impacts on transportation by
11 increasing road hazards, both by causing the re-routing of Highway 160 in a manner that creates
12 sharp turns and the potential for increased frequency and severity of dense fog from
13 sedimentation basins and the intermediate forebay.
14 504. The EIR/S discloses that the Project would generate an additional 900 trips per
15 day on roads adjacent to the Wildlife Refuge, which is managed for the benefit of several
16 sensitive and special status species; the EIR/S fails to disclose the type of vehicles that will be

17 generating these trips, or the duration of peak traffic levels, both of which would affect the

18 severity of impacts caused by these increases.

19 505. The EIR/S fails to adequately mitigate both Project-level and cumulative traffic

20 and transportation impacts.

21 506. Transportation mitigation measures, including Mitigation Measures TRANS-1a

22 and TRANS-1c are unenforceable, impermissibly deferred mitigation. TRANS-la requires
23 DWR to "Implement Site-Specific Construction Traffic Management Plan," but development of
24 the plan is deferred to a future date. Although the MMRP lists several pages of potential
25 measures that the Plan may include, it provides no enforceable performance standards that the

26 Plan must satisfy, impermissibly deferring formulation of mitigation. TRANS-1c is also

27 inadequate, as it contains no enforceable measures, but merely requires DWR to "Make Good
28

110
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

-

2 Faith Efforts to Enter into Mitigation Agreements to Enhance Capacity of Congested Roadway

3 Segments." Thus, this "mitigation" measure is illusory and does not require mitigation at all.

4 507. Mitigation measure TRANS-1b suggests limiting the hours of construction per day

5 as an option to mitigate traffic impacts, but fails to disclose or analyze how doing so may extend

6 the period of Project construction beyond the current 14 years. Extending Project construction

7 would generate additional Transportation and other impacts that the EIR/S must disclose and
analyze.

8

9 508. Mitigation measure TRANS-2a through TRANS-2c are not effective, enforceable

10 mitigation because DWR cannot ensure that agreements or encroachment permits would be

11 obtained from the relevant transportation agencies.
509.

12 Mitigation measure TRANS-2 acknowledges impacts to road pavement from

13 increased traffic, but fails to provide any mitigation for the levees beneath the pavement that
may suffer Project impacts.

14

15 510. DWR's determination that all transportation impacts other than TRANS-1, -2, -3, -

16 6, and -10 would be mitigated to less than significant levels is not supported by substantial
evidence.

17

18 511. The transportation impacts of the Project, in combination with the impacts of past,

19 present and reasonably foreseeable future projects, are cumulatively significant.
512. DWR's failure to adequately analyze Project-level transportation impacts renders
20 DWR's attempted cumulative impacts analysis inadequate.
21

22 Public Services and Utilities Impacts - EIR/S Chapter 20

23 513. Project construction and operation would require a large array of public services a

24 and further burden already taxed local and state programs that provide necessary public services.

25 514. The EIR/S fails to adequately disclose and analyze Project public services and
utilities impacts.

26

27 515. The EIR/S fails to adequately disclose and analyze how disposal of tunnel muck

28 and other waste generated by the Project may require the construction of new landfills and/or
affect the life-span of local landfills.

111
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

1 516. The EIR/S fails to adequately disclose and analyze potential impacts resulting

2 from the need to construct or expand communications facilities, such as relay towers, to serve

3 the Project.

4 517. The EIR/S fails to adequately analyze how increased Project construction related

5 traffic would limit public safety routes and increase delay times for emergency services.

6 518. The EIR/S fails to adequately analyze how Project construction and operations

7 would generate increased calls and demands for emergency services that would strain local

8 emergency service providers, most of whom operate on a volunteer basis.

o 519. The EIR/S fails to disclose and analyze Project impacts to emergency services due
10 to possible re-routing of access roads and waterways used in emergency response. The EIR/S
11 discloses that such re-routing may occur, but fails to provide any more detail about which such
12 routes may be detoured, the duration of the detours, and impacts associated with using
13 alternative emergency routes.

14 520. The EIR/S also fails to perform a Water Supply Assessment, despite the fact that
15 the Project would have a potable water demand of over 165 million gallons over the
16 construction period. The EIR/S provides no description of how it would satisfy this demand,
17 nor what the impacts of such water supply projects may be. DWR has also failed to consult with

18 agencies responsible for permitting such facilities.

19 521. The EIR/S fails to adequately mitigate both Project-level and cumulative impacts
20| to public services and utilities.

21 522. DWR's determination that all public services and utilities impacts other than UT-6
22 and UT-8 would be mitigated to less than significant levels is not supported by substantial
23 evidence.

24 523. The public services and utilities impacts of the Project, in combination with the
25 impacts of past, present and reasonably foreseeable future projects, are cumulatively significant.

26 524. DWR's failure to adequately analyze the Project-level public services and utilities
27 impacts renders DWR's attempted cumulative impacts analysis inadequate.
28

1 Energy Impacts - EIR/S Chapter 21

2 525. The Project would require a substantial energy resources to construct and operate,
3 further stressing the state's energy supplies and undermining efforts to rely more fully on

4 environmentally sound energy sources.

5 526. The EIR/S includes an inadequate disclosure and analysis of the Project's energy

6 impacts during both Project construction and operation.

7 527. The EIR/S fails to disclose and analyze potential impacts due to construction of

8 transmission lines. The Project would include 20 miles of permanent new transmission lines

o and 38 miles of temporary transmission lines, but the EIR/S provides no Project-level detail
10 about where these lines would be constructed, so it is impossible to disclose location-specific
11 potential impacts.

12 528. The EIR/S fails to disclose and analyze Project impacts related to the Project's
13 increased energy demand as required by Public Resources Code section 21100, subdivision
14 (b)(3) and CEQA Guidelines Appendix F. Project energy demands are currently unknown
15 because a study evaluating the demand would take between five and seven years to complete.
16 a As a result, it is impossible to disclose and analyze whether existing and planned infrastructure

17 would accommodate the Project's energy demands, or whether additional construction, and

18 construction impacts, would occur.

19 529. The EIR/S fails to adequately mitigate both Project-level and cumulative energy
20 impacts as required by Public Resources Code section 21100, subdivision (b)(3) and CEQA
21 Guidelines Appendix F.

22 530. DWR's determination that all energy impacts would be mitigated to less than
23 significant levels is not supported by substantial evidence.
24 531. The energy impacts of the Project, in combination with the impacts of past,
25 present and reasonably foreseeable future projects, are cumulatively significant.

26 532. DWR's failure to adequately analyze the Project-level energy impacts renders
27 DWR's attempted cumulative impacts analysis inadequate.

28

1 Air Quality and Greenhouse Gases Impacts - EIR/S Chapter 22

2 533. The EIR/S minimizes the serious air quality and GHG implications of the 10 to
3 14-year intensive Project construction period across the Delta, as well as the ongoing air quality

4 and GHG emissions of operating the Project.

5 534. The EIR/S fails to connect the raw particulate numbers generated by construction

6 and operation of the Project and their effect on air quality with specific adverse effects on

7 human health.

8 535. The EIR/S includes an inadequate disclosure and analysis of the Project's air

9 quality and GHG impacts during both Project construction and operation.
10 536. The EIR/S fails to analyze all of the mechanisms by which the Project may cause
11 significant air quality impacts during construction and operation, including but not limited to,
12 concrete plants and increased barge activity.
13 537. The EIR/S fails to disclose and analyze air quality impacts that would occur from
14 hauling and disposing of large quantities of construction material and tunnel muck during 14
15 years of Project construction.

16 538. Though the EIR/S acknowledges that the Project would exceed thresholds of
17 significance for several pollutants, it fails to describe the severity of these impacts or to

18 contextualize them within the area. For example, during construction in 2025, the Project is

19 projected to emit up to 1,700 pounds per day of NOx, exceeding the Bay Area Air Quality
20 Management District's daily threshold of significance for NOx by 3048%. The EIR/S makes no
21 attempt to describe the impacts resulting from such an extreme violation of air quality standards.l
22 539. The EIR/S's health risk assessment fails to disclose significant health hazards due
23 to exposure of sensitive receptors to localized particulate matter concentrations resulting from
24 Project construction emissions in the Yolo-Solano Air Quality Management District.
25 540. The Project tunnels would operate during low-flow periods, which would create

26 anaerobic conditions in Tunnel water, generating air pollutant constituents and GHGs; no air
27 quality impacts from these conditions were disclosed or analyzed in the EIR/S.
28

114
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

541. The EIR/S fails to evaluate air quality impacts for all pollutants in all air areas
2 affected by Project construction emissions.

3 542. The EIS/EIR fails to consider the air quality impacts associated with decreased

4 water flow caused by the Project.

5 543. The EIS/EIR does not adequately analyze air quality impacts on sensitive

6 receptors.

7 544. The EIR/S fails to adequately analyze air impacts due to Particulate Matter 2.5

8 ("PM2.5") and Particulate Matter 10 ("PM10") emissions. The Project would require grading of

o about 5,500 acres of land, cut-and-fill of more than 20 million cubic yards of soil, and

10 excavation of about 5.7 million cubic yards of soil. The EIR/S acknowledges that windblown
11 dust would contribute to particulate matter emissions, yet fails to yet, it does not estimate PM10
12 and PM2.5 emissions from wind erosion of graded surfaces or storage piles.
13 545. The EIR/S fails to adequately analyze air quality and other impacts due to tunnel
14 muck storage. The Project would require the storage of approximately 31,000,000 cubic yards
15 of tunnel muck across approximately 2,570 acres. Tunnel muck storage creates the risk of PM
16 10 and PM2.5 emissions. The EIR/S does not disclose the emissions from tunnel muck storage.

17 546. The EIR/S fails to adequately analyze the Project GHG impacts resulting from the

18 power that must be generated over the life of the Project to satisfy the electricity demand on the
19 Project's massive pumps. Typically, this generation is from fossil fuels, causing significant
20 GHG emissions from combustion.

21 547. The EIR/S fails to adequately mitigate both Project-level and cumulative air

22 quality and GHG impacts.
23 548. The EIR/S impermissibly relies on the DWR Climate Action Plan ("CAP"), which
24 is not framed as mitigation, to mitigate both construction and operational GHG impacts. The
25 EIR/S determines that because the Project would not prevent DWR from complying with the
26 CAP, Project GHG emissions are less than significant. Though CEQA may allow lead agencies
27 to rely on compliance with existing plans for GHG mitigation, the CAP includes no enforceable
28

115
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

1 conditions. In particular, there are no monitoring or enforcement conditions for Project GHG

2 emissions to ensure that the reduction anticipated in the CAP would actually occur.

3 549. Mitigation Measure AQ-21, development of a GHG Mitigation Program, is
4 unenforceable and inadequate mitigation. There are no specific requirements for this program,
5 but merely a list of potential considerations to be used in development. One of the strategies

6 that mitigation measure AQ-21 relies on for mitigation is the purchase of GHG offsets, but it

7 does not require purchased offsets to be consistent with California GHG reduction goals and

8 policies

9 550. Neither the EIR/S's Environmental Commitments nor the proposed mitigation
10 measures ensure that Project construction emissions would be reduced to less than significant
11 levels, and the Environmental Commitments lack an enforcement mechanism to mitigate air
12 quality impacts to a less than significant level.

13 551. The EIR/S proposed Mitigation Measures AQ-la, AQ-3a, and AQ-4a, which are
14 intended to reduce emissions to net zero (0) for emissions in excess of General Conformity de
15 minimis thresholds and to quantities below the Bay Area Air Quality Management District's
16 applicable CEQA thresholds of significance. Each of these mitigation measures requires that the
17 DWR undertake a "good faith effort" to enter into a development mitigation agreement with the
18 respective air districts in order to reduce criteria pollutant emissions through the creation of

19 offsetting reductions of emissions occurring within the respective air basins. The EIR/S defers
20 any analysis of whether these measures may feasibly mitigate air quality impacts to less than
21 significant levels, despite having had several years to perform such an analysis.
22 552. DWR's determination that all air quality and GHG impacts other than AQ-23,
23 AQ-24, and AQ-27 would be mitigated to less than significant levels is not supported by
24 substantial evidence.

25 553. The air quality and GHG impacts of the Project, in combination with the impacts
26 of past, present and reasonably foreseeable future projects, are cumulatively significant.
27 554. DWR's failure to adequately analyze the Project-level air quality and GHG
28 impacts renders DWR's attempted cumulative impacts analysis inadequate.

116
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

1 555. The EIR/S fails to account for the possibility that the Bureau of Reclamation

2 ultimately may not participate in the Project, and the subsequent effect on applicable air quality

3 law. Should the Bureau not participate, the Project would not be a federal action, and the federal

4 Clean Air Act would not apply. In such an event, California state law would control, and

5 Regional Air Boards would have jurisdiction over the Project. The EIR/S fails to disclose how

6 the Project would conform to California air quality laws.

7 556. These failures to identify all of the Project's significant air quality effects

8 constitutes a failure to proceed in a manner required by law.
9 Noise Impacts - EIR/S Chapter 23
10 557. Construction and operation of the Project would bring a variety of new and
11 disturbing noises into currently peaceful and quiet areas of the Delta. The EIR/S fails to

12 squarely address these new impacts.

13 558. The EIR/S includes an inadequate disclosure and analysis of the Projects noise
14 impacts during both Project construction and operation.
15 559. The EIR/S improperly declined to analyze noise impacts using thresholds and
16 standards adopted by some jurisdictions affected by Project construction and/or operation,
17 including the City of West Sacramento and the Clarksburg Area General Plan (Yolo County), or
18 from rural California counties (including Madera and Fresno) with similar noise environments.

19 Instead, and contrary to its own agency practice with other recent projects, DWR developed its
20 own less restrictive noise thresholds. The resulting analysis obscures and minimizes the
21 significance of noise impacts in the predominantly rural setting of the Project.
22 560. The EIR/S includes an inadequate disclosure and analysis of the Project's noise
23 impacts during both Project construction and operation. For example:
24 The application of hourly Equivalent Continuous Sound Level ("Leq") noise standards
25 does not disclose the degree to which ambient noise levels would increase; Sole use of the hourly Leq standards does not inform readers about the level of noise
26 increases over the course of a construction day, or during the non-peak hours of the day. The extent of actual noise impacts is thus entirely missing from the EIS/R;
27 The EIR/S does not apply any noise standards based on a 24-hour metric; The EIR/S applies a "hard ground" attenuation rate in the analysis of construction noise
28 impacts that is too high for some noise-sensitive portions-including rural towns and communities-of the Project's actual environmental setting;

117
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

- The analysis does not address single-event noise levels, such as from trucks passing noise-sensitive receptors; and

2 The analysis applies the improper threshold in analyzing project-related traffic noise.

3

4 561. The EIR/S fails to evaluate the Project's noise impacts on the value of the Wildlife

5 Refuge, Staten Island and other publicly funded habitat for the greater sandhill cranes and other
species.

6 562.

7 The EIR/S fails to adequately evaluate impacts due to noise the Project would

8 generate during construction and operation at the intakes and pumps.

9 563. The EIR/S fails to adequately disclose and analyze potential impacts due to the
Project's permanent increase in ambient noise.

10

11 564. The EIR/S fails to adequately analyze impacts arising from noise generated by

12 Project construction, which is anticipated to result in changes to the rural qualities of nearby

13 communities during 10 to 14-year construction timeline. Several communities are in close

14 proximity to the Project's proposed water conveyance structures, including Clarksburg, Hood,

15 and Walnut Grove. The Project could indirectly cause impacts to gathering places that lie in the

16 vicinity of construction areas, such as high schools, libraries, and churches.

565.

17 impacts. The EIR/S fails to adequately mitigate both Project-level and cumulative noise

18

19 566. Mitigation Measures NOI-1a and NOI-1b are inadequate and fail to include

20 feasible methods of avoiding or minimizing Project-related noise, instead improperly deferring

21 the formulation of additional noise mitigation to DWR and its contractors at the time of Project
construction.

22

23 567. Mitigation Measure NOI-3 (relating to noise from fixed sources during operations)

24 is vague and unenforceable, and improperly deferred. It does not identify with specificity what

25 measures are required and, therefore, it is impossible to determine whether such measures wouldl

26 be effective at reducing operational noise impacts to less than significant levels.
568.

27 The EIR/S's proposed mitigation cannot reduce noise impacts to less than
significant levels. The construction is proposed to have nearly 2,500 construction workers in
28 place for over nine years. This is more than the combined populations of nearby Delta

118
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

1 communities Clarksburg, Hood, and Locke. A work force that outnumbers the population,

2 working with heavy, noise-emitting equipment would generate noise impacts that cannot be

3 mitigated at all, and certainly not with a "temporary noise barrier," as proposed by the EIR/S.

4 569. DWR's determination that all noise impacts other than NOI-1, NOI-2, and NOI-4

5 would be mitigated to less than significant levels is not supported by substantial evidence.

6 570. The noise impacts of the Project, in combination with the impacts of past, present

7 and reasonably foreseeable future projects, are cumulatively significant.

8 571. DWR's failure to adequately analyze the Project-level noise impacts renders

9 DWR's attempted cumulative impacts analysis inadequate.

10 Hazards and Hazardous Materials Impacts - EIR/S Chapter 24
11 572. This massive Project would entail numerous activities during construction and

12 operation that involve hazards. Yet the EIR/S's cursory analysis of potential hazards is
13 incomplete and ultimately uninformative about these hazards affecting workers and local
14 communities.

15 573. The EIR/S includes an inadequate disclosure and analysis of the Project's hazards
16 impacts during both construction and operation.

17 574. The EIR/S fails to adequately disclose or analyze hazardous material impacts of
18 the over 2 million cubic yards of "tunnel muck" anticipated to be generated by Project
19 construction. (August 24, 2015 DWR USACE Application.) The EIR/S fails to disclose what

20 chemical additives may exist in the muck. The EIR/S does not indicate what portion of the
21 muck may be hazardous, how much hazardous muck is likely to be generated by the Project, or
22 how the Project would transport and/or dispose of it, possible outcomes of a spill, or the muck's
23 distance from sensitive receptors.

24 575. The EIR/S similarly fails to adequately analyze impacts related to the local storage
25 and handling of these materials. It does not disclose what volatile compounds may be released

26 during drying and handling, and as a result, it is unknown what measures must be taken to
27 protect workers and the public.

28

119
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

L 576. The EIR/S also takes the unsubstantiated position that over 99 percent of the muck

2 would be suitable for reuse. Yet the EIR/S also indicates that storage sites may be for temporary

3 or permanent use. The EIR/S fails to adequately disclose and analyze how much of the muck

4 must be permanently stored or describe permanent storage solutions.

5 577. The EIR/S fails to adequately disclose or analyze health risks from potential toxic

6 constituents in borrow fill. The EIR/S does not indicate that testing for toxic constituents of

7 surface soils moved during excavation for borrow fill would occurr.

8 578. The EIR/S also fails to analyze the potential impacts of placing tunnel muck in
9 borrow pits. Placing the tunnel muck below the groundwater table creates potential risks of
10 spreading toxic constituents from the tunnel muck to groundwater.

11 579. The EIR/S fails to adequately disclose or analyze risks stemming from the
12 anaerobic and anoxic conditions in the Project tunnels that are likely to occur during non-
13 operational and low flow operational conditions. Such conditions can create arsenate

14 compounds which are harmful to human health and make the water unsuitable for drinking. The
15 EIR/S failed to identify, characterize, or quantify this risk or describe how such contaminated

16 water would be segregated and disposed.

17 580. The EIR/S failesto adequately analyze or disclose risks due to abandoned oil and

18 gas wells. Though the EIR/S admits that these wells may act as conduits for natural gas, and
19 that the location of these wells is largely unknown, it does not disclose what impacts may occur
20 if the Project does cause these wells to bring natural gas to the surface.
21 581. The EIR/S fails to adequately mitigate both Project-level and cumulative hazards
22 impacts.

23 582. DWR's determination that all noise impacts other than HAZ-8 would be mitigated

24 to less than significant levels is not supported by substantial evidence.
25 583. The hazards impacts of the Project, in combination with the impacts of past,

26 present and reasonably foreseeable future projects, are cumulatively significant.
27 584. DWR's failure to adequately analyze the Project-level hazards impacts renders
28 DWR's attempted cumulative impacts analysis inadequate.

2 Public Health Impacts - EIR/S Chapter 25
585. Ten to fourteen years of construction and permanent massive new water
3 infrastructure in the Delta threatens public health in a variety of ways not adequately addressed

4 in the EIR/S.

5 586.

6 587. The EIR/S fails to disclose and analyze all Project public health impacts.

7 The EIR/S fails to adequately analyze the Project's potential to cause an increase
in transmission of mosquito-borne diseases to humans caused by increased mosquito
8 reproduction in habitat restoration areas adjacent to Delta communities.

9

10 588. The EIR/S fails to disclose Project public health impacts related to emissions of

11 hydrogen sulfide. The EIR/S admits that anaerobic decay of organic matter, which may be in

12 the tunnel muck, can generate hydrogen sulfide, a gas potentially fatal to humans, and which is

13 flammable in certain concentrations. Although the EIR/S analyzed the odor impacts related to

14 this gas, it performed no analysis of the amount of hydrogen sulfide that may be generated by

15 the tunnel muck, how conditions in the muck storage area may affect concentration levels, or the
potential impacts that may occur at various concentration levels.

16 589.

17 The EIR/S provides inadequate analysis of the Project's risk of exposing Delta

18 populations to the pathogenic fungus Coccidioides immitis, which causes the respiratory illness
Valley fever, which can be fatal.
19 590. The EIR/S fails to adequately mitigate both Project-level and cumulative public
20 health impacts.
21 591.

22 DWR's determination that all public health impacts would be mitigated to less

23 than significant levels is not supported by substantial evidence.

24 592. The public health impacts of the Project, in combination with the impacts of past,

25 present and reasonably foreseeable future projects, are cumulatively significant. DWR's failure

26 to adequately analyze the Project-level public health impacts renders DWR's attempted
cumulative impacts analysis inadequate.

F Environmental Justice Impacts - EIR/S Chapter 28

2 593. The Project would bring significant construction and operation impacts into

3 environmental justice communities throughout the Delta. Though the EIR/S determined these
4 impacts adverse, it failed to do anything about very real effects of the Project on these

5 communities.

6 594. The EIR/S fails to disclose and analyze all Project-related environmental justice
7 impacts. The EIR's exclusion of consideration of environmental justice impacts from geology

8 and seismicity, hazards and hazardous materials, mineral resources, water supply, surface water,
9 groundwater, water quality, soils, fish and aquatic resources, terrestrial biological resources,

10 agricultural resources, recreation, transportation, energy, air quality, and paleontological

11 resources was improper.

12 595. The EIR/S process was inaccessible to environmental justice communities. DWR

13 failed to engage the Spanish-speaking and locally impacted Laotian, Hmong, Russian and
14 Ukrainian communities that live or work in areas either impacted by the Project or which rely on
15 Delta resources. The EIR/S organization and presentation is almost incomprehensible to
16 English speakers, let alone English-as-a-second-language communities.
17 596. The EIR/S fails to adequately disclose or analyze impacts Delta environmental
18 | justice communities in the rural areas, as well as towns such as Hood, Clarksburg, and

19 Courtland, and in cities reliant on the Delta for water supplies. For instance, educational
20 facilities such as the Delta Elementary Charter School, located in Clarksburg, which serves
21 children with learning disabilities, is located within 0.5 miles of the northernmost proposed

22 intake. The EIR/S does not adequately consider how construction noise and other Project
23 impacts would impact local schools, particularly those serving children who may have
24 heightened noise sensitivity. The EIR/S also does not address the effect of the Project on
25 environmental justice communities in cities such as Stockton, whose drinking water supplies

26 will become more polluted, and more expensive to effectively treat, as a result of the Project.
27 597. The EIR/S repeatedly states that impacts, such as groundwater loss and

28 contamination, would be dealt with by relocating individuals or providing an alternative water

122
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

-

2 supply, without explaining how DWR this would be implemented. The displacement of rural

3 environmental justice communities, however, requires extensive analysis and mitigation that is

4 calculated to address the unique concerns of environmental justice communities.

5 598. Minority farm workers would have greatest exposure and risk from mosquito

6 borne West Nile Virus compared to any population segment due to their greater exposure

7 outdoors in the immediate vicinity of increased West Nile Virus risk from the Project; as a

8 population, these individuals have insufficient economic resources to pay for protections such as

9 insect repellant. Project facilities and operations which generate mosquito populations are

10 adjacent to Delta communities and are upwind of large urban areas.

11 599. The EIR/S fails to provide adequate mitigation for the Project's identified adverse
environmental justice impacts.

12

13 Climate Change Impacts EIR/S Chapter 29

600.

14 The Project purports to be a response to future climate change, yet imposes an

15 outdated 19th Century "plumbing solution" that fails to provide the adaptability needed as

16 conditions change in the future. Instead of providing realistic climate change scenarios and
analysis, the EIR/S shamelessly exploits the threat of climate change to try to mask the
17 overwhelming negative impacts of the Project on the Delta environment.

18 601.

19 The EIR/S includes an inadequate disclosure and analysis of the Project's climate

20 change impacts during both construction and operation.

21 602. The EIR/S fails to analyze how the speed, magnitude, and intermittent nature of

22 climate change may alter Project outcomes and exacerbate other project impacts. The EIR/S

23 also fails to clearly and consistently analyze the hydrologic consequences of climate change.

24 The exclusion of such an analysis renders analysis of other resource areas inadequate, as they
are not based on all necessary information.

25

26 603. The EIR/S relies on flawed climate change assumptions in describing the baseline,
which obscures the Project's climate change impacts.

27

28 604. The EIR/S relies on unsupported climate change assumptions in describing the No
Project Alternative, and does not provide an alternative which does not include these

123
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

1 unsupported assumptions. As a result, the EIR/S does not adequately disclose the Project's

2 impacts because it compares Project impacts to a scenario that includes unsupported climate

3 change projections.

4 605. The flawed analysis of GHG impacts in the EIR/S results in an inadequate

5 disclosure and analysis of the Project's contribution to climate change. The EIR/S's contention

6 that the Project would be GHG-neutral is unsupported; the EIR/S must disclose the Project's
7 actual contribution to climate change.

8 606. The EIR/S fails to incorporate the best available science into its analysis of climate

9 change impacts by using the most recently available scientific information, including climate
10 extremes, computer simulations of ecological futures, and unprecedented drought risk.
11 607. The EIR/S fails to adequately mitigate both Project-level and cumulative climate

12 change impacts.

13 608. DWR's determination that all climate change impacts would be mitigated to less
14 than significant levels is not supported by substantial evidence.
15 609. The climate change impacts of the Project, in combination with the impacts of
16 past, present and reasonably foreseeable future projects, are cumulatively significant.
17 610. DWR's failure to adequately analyze the Project-level climate change impacts
18 renders DWR's attempted cumulative impacts analysis inadequate.
19 The EIR/S'S Cumulative Impacts Analysis Is Deficient
20 611. CEQA requires that the lead agency analyze cumulative impacts. (Pub. Resourcesl
21 Code, § 21083, subd. (b)(2); CEQA Guidelines § 15064, subd. (h)(1).) A cumulative impact is
22 an impact created as a result of the project when evaluated together with other past, present, and
23 reasonably foresecable future projects causing related impacts. In performing a cumulative
24 impacts analysis, an EIR must assess the significance of the incremental addition of a project to
25 the combined individual effects of one or more separate projects. The analysis must provide
26 sufficient data to ensure that the cumulative effects are identified and disclosed, and must make
27 a good faith and reasonable effort at disclosing all cumulative impacts.
28

124
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

1 612. The EIR/S includes an inadequate disclosure and analysis of the Project's

2 cumulative impacts during both construction and operation. The EIR/S's deficiencies include,

3 but are not limited to, the following examples.

4 613. The EIR/S fails to include a single, unified section that addresses cumulative

5 impacts.

6 614. The EIR/S fails to acknowledge the scale of the Project in proportion to all other
7 past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future projects causing related impacts. The Project

8 proposes to fundamentally change the flow of the Sacramento River and the hydrology of the
9 Delta. Project impacts dwarf impacts from all other cumulative projects for several resource

10 areas. The EIR/S thus fails to disclose the significance of the Project's incremental impacts in
11 relation to cumulative projects.

12 615. The cumulative analysis in the EIR/S provides only a cursory summary of the
13 elements of the California Water Plan, which includes the Delta Plan, EcoRestore, and other

14 projects in addition to the Delta Tunnels. The Project, in combination with restoration projects
15 already required, or necessary as mitigation for Project impacts, was not cumulatively analyzed.
16 For instance, critical water quality, agricultural, water supply and other impacts of restoration
17 projects were not adequately analyzed in the EIR/S. The specific restoration acreages associated
18 with the Project were not analyzed, and the EIR/S instead relied on outdated and incomplete
19 analyses of Alternative 4 (the BDCP). This flaw masked critical water quality and other
20 cumulative impacts.

21 616. The EIR/S fails to adequately analyze cumulative impacts to Delta agriculture
22 from the combined impacts from land conversion, seepage damage, water quality degradation,
23 soil contamination, blocked access to parcels, and reduced water elevations from the Project.
24 617. The EIR/S omits the Coordinated Long Term Operations of the SWP and CVP
25 from any cumulative impacts analysis, even though it was already foreseeable at the beginning
26 of the Project CEQA process, and bears on both the need for the Project and Project impacts.
27 618. The EIR/S fails to adequately analyze cumulative impacts due to climate change,
28 including changed rainfall patterns and sea level rise; the limited discussion of these impacts

125
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

- ignores, among other issues, changing snowpack, increased water temperature, increased

2 evapotranspiration, flood flows, and upstream fishery habitat.

3 619. The EIR/S does not analyze the planned changes to operations of the Yolo Bypass

4 under the Yolo Bypass project as a cumulative project that may cause related impacts; the Yolo
5 Bypass project would divert additional water from the Sacramento River, further limiting

6 freshwater flows through the Delta. The Project, in combination with planned changes to
7 operations of the Yolo Bypass would contribute to cumulative impacts to water supply, surface

8 water, water quality, aquatic resources, and other environmental resources. These impacts must

9 be assessed cumulatively with the Project impacts.

10 620. Use of the NDDs to facilitate additional water transfers is a reasonably foreseeable

11 outcome of the Project, and would cause additional surface water impacts, yet the EIR/S fails to

12 perform a cumulative analysis of surface water impacts that would result from these additional
13 transfers. Increased water transfers would cause additional groundwater, agricultural and other
14 impacts in transferor areas, such as the Sacramento Valley and in the American River
15 Watershed, yet the EIR/S fails to perform a cumulative analysis of groundwater, agricultural and
16 other impacts that would result from these additional transfers.

17 621. The EIR/S fails to adequately mitigate the Project's contribution to significant
18 cumulative effects.

19 DWR's CEQA Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations Are Not Supported by Substantial Evidence 20

21 622. A thin veil for DWR having predetermined the outcome and having utilized an
22 otherwise legally deficient process, DWR's CEQA Findings violate CEQA, and are not
23 supported by substantial evidence. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15091, subd. (b).)
24 623. The Findings improperly conclude without substantial evidence that hundreds of
25 Project impacts have been mitigated to less than significant levels.

26 624. Where a project for which an EIR has been certified has a significant a
27 environmental effect, an agency may not carry out that project unless the agency makes findings
28 for each of those significant effects. (Id. at subd. (a); Pub. Resources Code, § 21081, subd. (a).)

126
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

1 One possible finding is that "[c]hanges or alterations have been required in, or incorporated into,

2 the project which avoid or substantially lessen the environmental effect." (Pub. Resources

3 Code, § 21081, subd. (a)(1).) The CEQA Findings do not include any findings for numerous

4 impacts that were potentially significant, but later determined to be less than significant for

5 reasons including but not limited to reliance on Project features deemed "Environmental

6 Commitments" or "Avoidance and Minimization Measures" by DWR. These types of impacts
7 are squarely within Guidelines section 15091 as the type of impact for which the agency must

8 make CEQA Findings describing what has been done to reduce the impact.
9 625. Required findings regarding critical Project impacts are entirely absent. For

10 example, impact GW-3 "degrade groundwater quality during construction and operation of
11 conveyance facilities" is considered less than significant, and there is no Finding for this impact.
12 But this impact is less than significant based on the integration of Environmental Commitments
13 3.3, 3.8, and 3.27 into the Project; MMRP, pp. 3-3, -10, and -80; see also GW-1, GW-2, GW-4,
14 GW-8, WQ-1, WQ-3, WQ-5, WQ-7, WQ-9, WQ-13, WQ-15, WQ-17, WQ-19, WQ-21, WQ-23,
15 WQ-25, WQ-27, WQ-29, WQ-31, WQ-32, WQ-34, BIO-68, BIO-69, BIO-70, BIO-71, BIO-72,

16 BIO-73 and BIO-74 [other example impacts with no CEQA findings to support less than
17 significant determinations].)

18 626. The failure to include findings to support impact determinations prevents the

19 public from understanding the full range of Project impacts, and critically, the reasons why the
20 agency has determined the impacts are less than significant. DWR's omission of findings for
21 these impacts constitutes a failure "to bridge the analytic gap between the raw evidence and
22 ultimate decision." (Topanga Ass 'n for a Scenic Cmty. V. County of L.A. (1974) 11 Cal.3d 506,
23 515; see also Pub. Resources Code, § 21081, subd. (a)(1).)

24 627. While the EIR/S argues that the "appropriate Delta flow criteria" based on the
25 SWRCB's 2010 public trust flow criteria are infeasible due to preliminarily modeled impacts on
26 reservoir operations (FEIR/S, pp. 3I-9 to 10; see also p. 3A-68), DWR's CEQA Findings fail to
27 provide support for rejection of SWRCB's 2010 public trust flow criteria. DWR's statements in
28 the FEIR/S may not substitute for proper SWRCB notice and consideration of the "appropriate

127
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

- Delta flow criteria" within in the WaterFix Change Petition hearing. (Wat. Code, § 85086, subd.
2 (c)(2).)

3 628. To the extent that DWR's CEQA Findings do discuss particular impacts, DWR's
4 determination that these impacts would be less than significant is unsupported by substantial

5 evidence.

6

7 629. DWR's statement of overriding considerations for 43 significant and unavoidable

8 impacts is not supported by substantial evidence and furthermore fails to demonstrate that

9 mitigating Project impacts to less than significant levels is not feasible.

10 630. Feasible mitigation is available to reduce impacts from the 43 significant and
unavoidable impacts.

11

12 631. DWR failed to properly determine that economic, legal, social, technological, or
other benefits of the

13 program were overriding considerations that permitted approval of the Plan

14 Project despite significant and unavoidable impacts on the environment. (CEQA Guidelines, §
15091.)

15 632.

16 DWR's reliance on the alleged Project benefits of protecting state water supplies

17 through CVP/SWP system upgrades, protecting and benefitting the economy, protecting
endangered species and improving SWP project operational flexibility during critically dry
18 years, is unsupported by substantial evidence.

19 633. DWR's adopted project, Alternative 4A, is not consistent with the stated Project
20 objectives.
21 634.

22 For instance, though the Project objectives include reductions in take of state and

23 federally listed species, DWR offers no substantial evidence that the Project would reduce that

24 take for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to: (1) the Project fails to incorporate any

25 meaningful modifications to the existing diversions in the South Delta, which, according to

26 Project modeling, would continue to be operational about half of the time; (2) the Project would

27 increase take of State and Federally protected species in the vicinity of the NDDs; (3) the fish

28 screen designs for the NDDs are incomplete and experimental and are therefore likely to lead to
take of state and federally listed species; (4) it is not clear how many water contractors will

128
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

-

2 choose to participate in the Project, and reduced contractor participation would result in less

3 water being diverted through the NDDs than assumed in the EIR/S, thereby reducing any

4 claimed benefits from reductions in pumping (and commensurate take) in the South Delta.

5 635. As explained by the EPA and others, the Project would not be likely to "[r]estore

6 and protect the ability of the [CVP and SWP] to deliver full contract amounts." Full contract

7 amounts are significantly higher than the amount of water actually exported in the last 50 years.

8 Export of full contract amounts would also be contrary to the 2009 DRA mandate to reduce
reliance on the Delta (Wat. Code, § 85021).

9

10 636. The objective of restoring full contract amounts and the predetermination that new

11 conveyance was a necessary component of the Project, among other Project objectives,

12 unreasonably restrained the formulation and analysis of alternatives considered by DWR,
rendering DWR's alternatives analysis flawed.

13

14 637. No substantial evidence supports DWR's findings in support of the Statement of

15 Overriding Considerations that the Project's purported benefits outweigh its unavoidable
significant adverse environmental impacts.

16 638.

17 No substantial evidence supports DWR's findings that no feasible alternatives or

18 mitigation measures exist to eliminate or reduce the Project's unavoidable significant adverse
environmental impacts.

19 639. No substantial evidence supports DWR's findings that Alternative 4A is the
20 environmentally superior alternative.

21 640.

22 No substantial evidence supports DWR's findings that alternatives to the Project

23 are not feasible due to costs associated with these alternatives.

641.

24 To the extent the findings rely on Delta Vision to support the selection of

25 Alternative 4A as the preferred Project, that is not substantial evidence. Governor

26 Schwarzenegger's Delta Vision a process was a purely political, not scientific, process.
Moreover, the views of the local entities and individuals that participated in the Delta Vision
27 process were not ultimately reflected in the Delta Vision Committee Implementation Report.

1 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

2 VIOLATION OF CALIFORNIA ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT
(Against DFW)

3 642. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained in

4 Paragraphs 1 through 641 as though fully set forth herein.

5 643. Under CESA, Fish and Game Code section 2050 et seq.: "No person shall .

6 take . any species, or any part or product thereof, that the commission determines to be an

7 endangered species or a threatened species, or attempt any of those acts, except as otherwise
8 provided in this chapter . . . ." (Fish & G. Code, § 2080.)

9 644. As used in Fish and Game Code section 2080, "take" is a defined term which,
10 under Fish & G. Code, § 86, means: "hunt, pursue, catch, capture, or kill, or attempt to hunt,
11 pursue, catch, capture, or kill."

12 645. The broad definition of "take" in Fish and Game Code section 86 ensures that

13 DFW can maintain legal control over actions interfering with threatened, endangered and fully
14 protected species even where those actions may not have been intended to kill or hurt any bird
15 or animal.

16 646. Under CESA, impacts of a take must be minimized and fully mitigated. (Fish &
17 G. Code, § 2081, subd. (b)(2).)

18 647. Further, under CESA mitigation measures must be capable of successful
19 implementation, which may include measures without an established track record of success
20 only as long as there is a "reasonable basis for utilization and a reasonable prospect of success."
21 (Fish & G. Code, § 2081, subd. § (a)(2); 14 Cal. Code Regs., § 783.4(c).)
22 648. Fish and Game Code section 2081, subdivision (c) authorizes DFW to permit the
23 take of "endangered species, threatened species, and candidate species" if the take is incidental
24 to an otherwise lawful activity and the impacts of the take are minimized and fully mitigated.
25 The conservation measures required to meet that standard "shall be capable of successful

26 implementation." (Fish & § G. Code, § 2081, subd. (b)(2).) In addition, the permit applicant must
27 ensure adequate funding to implement the required conservation measures, and for monitoring
28 compliance with, and effectiveness of, those measures. (Fish & G. Code, § 2081, subd. (b)(4).)

130
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

l 649. Section 2081, subdivision (c) of the Fish and Game Code provides that DFW may

2 not issue an Incidental Take Permit ("ITP") if "issuance of the permit would jeopardize the

3 continued existence of the species." DFW must make this determination "based on the best

4 scientific and other information that is reasonably available, and shall include consideration of

5 the species' capability to survive and reproduce, and any adverse impacts of the taking on those

6 abilities in light of (1) known population trends; (2) known threats to the species; and (3)

7 reasonably foreseeable impacts on the species from other related projects and activities. (Fish &

8 G. § Code, § 2081, subd. (c).)

9 650. Acting on an Application submitted by DWR, on or about July 26, 2017 DFW

10 issued Incidental Take Permit No. 2081-2016-055-03 under CESA for the Project, under which
11 DWR is the Permittee. Unless renewed by DFW, the Project ITP will expire on December 31,

13 651. The Project ITP allows incidental takes of the following species, all of which are
14 listed as endangered or threatened or as a "candidate" species: giant garter snake (Thamnophis
15 gigas-Threatened); California tiger salamander (Anbystoma californiense--Threatened);

16 Tricolored blackbird (Agelaius tricolor-Candidate); Swainson's hawk (Buteo swainsoni-

17 Threatened); Delta smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus Endangered); Longfin smelt (Spirinchus

18 thaleichthys--Threatened); Spring-run Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha-

19 Threatened); and Winter-run Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha- -Endangered).
20 652. In its Project ITP, DFW acknowledges that the Project is expected to result in the

21 "incidental take of individuals of the Covered Species" identified above. The Project activities

22 likely to cause the take of said covered species are generally described in the Project ITP to
23 include: geotechnical exploration; construction of safe haven work areas (including clearing and
24 grading); NDDs intake construction and barge landing construction and operation (including site
25 clearing and grading, cofferdam installation, levee clearing and grading, riprap installation,

26 dredging, and pile driving); operation of barges; construction of tunneled conveyance facilities
27 (including site clearing and grading); Clifton Court Forebay modifications (including relocating
28 transmission towers, expansion and dredging of South Clifton Court Forebay, construction of

131
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

1 divider wall and east/west embankments, dewatering and excavation of North Clifton Court

2 Forebay construction of outlet canals and siphons, construction of a South Clifton Court

3 Forebay intake structure and a North Clifton Court Forebay emergency spillway); construction

4 and maintenance of power supply and grid connections; construction and operation of the

5 HORB; muck placement and storage; construction or improvement of access roads; maintenance

6 of transmission lines; construction of a new connection canal between the Clifton Court Forebay

7 and Banks pumping plant; and other activities with the Project Area as described in the Project

8 Description section of the Project ITP.

9 653. DFW acknowledges in the Project ITP that impacts of the authorized take also

10 include adverse impacts to Covered Species related to temporal losses, increased habitat
11 fragmentation and edge effects, and the Project's incremental contribution to cumulative

12 impacts, referred to in the Project ITP as "indirect impacts."
13 654. DFW failed to ensure that the negative impacts of the take permitted by the Project
14 ITP are minimized and fully mitigated.

15 655. DFW failed to ensure that the conservation measures required by the Project ITP

16 are capable of successful implementation.

17 656. Neither DFW nor the permittee, DWR, has ensured that adequate funding exists to

18 implement the conservation measures required by the Project ITP.

19 657. DFW has not ensured that the issuance of the Project ITP would not jeopardize the
20 continued existence of the Covered Species listed herein above.
21 658. DWR's FEIR/S fails to demonstrate that the take of the above-listed species would
22 be fully minimized and mitigated, as required under CESA before an ITP may issue. (Cal. Codel
23 Regs., tit. 14, §§ 783.2, subd. (a)(8), 783.4, subd. (a)(2).) For example, Project traffic impacts to
24 the giant garter snake are not fully mitigated, nor is that species minimized. The giant garter
25 snake, a CESA-listed species, uses the Project area as habitat and would experience take due to

26 Project construction and operation. Roads and high traffic volumes reduce landscape

27 connectivity, which affects wildlife populations, including the giant garter snake, in the

28 following ways:

132
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

- Roads and traffic limit the regular movement of animals to different habitats (e.g.,

2 wetland to grassland) to meet daily, seasonal, and basic biological needs such as reproduction, feeding, and sheltering.

3 Roads and traffic affect use of habitats adjacent to roadways, with some species having a higher degree of aversion to traffic and associated noise.

4 Roads and traffic limit the species' ability to recolonize areas, as well as the ability of young to find and establish new territories.

5 Roads and traffic increase wildlife mortality due to collisions, which can affect

6 reproduction success. At sufficiently high rates of mortality, areas become population sinks, which can then affect regional populations.

7 659.

8 Though DWR's Project ITP application partially recognizes and mitigates traffic

9 impacts to species by requiring slower rates of speed on access routes for construction activities

10 with it flexible locations, it does not explain why it exempted public roads and fixed location

11 construction from this requirement. Nor does the Project ITP itself impose the slower speed
requirement on public roads and fixed location construction.

12

13 660. Noise impacts on CESA-protected species have not been adequately studied, much

14 less fully mitigated. Evidence exists to support the conclusion that noise levels above 60

15 decibels (*dBA"), which are expected during construction, may interfere with communication
among birds and other wildlife.

16

17 661. Project proponents have conceded that construction noise above background noise

18 levels (greater than 50 dBA) could extend 1,900 to 5,250 feet from the edge of construction

19 activities. The greater sandhill crane and other bird species likely to be present in the area,
including the CESA-listed Swainson's hawk and tricolored blackbird, are likely to suffer
20| adverse impacts caused by this noise level over the prolonged construction period. In addition,
21

22 the Project ITP includes no consideration of noise impacts on these species.
662.

23 Further, DFW failed to minimize the take of Swainson's hawk caused by the

24 construction and operation of the powerlines necessary to construct and operate the Project. The

25 proposed mitigation is insufficient to ensure that take of Swainson's Hawk is minimized.

26 Among other deficiencies in the proposed mitigation, DWR's ITP Application relies upon the

27 use of unproven and inadequate methods to prevent take of Swainson's hawk. In order to

28 minimize take of the Swainson's hawk due to construction and operation of transmission lines,
the lines must be undergrounded.

133
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

P 663.

2 The lead agencies were also derelict in their duty to minimize take of covered fish

3 species, including the Delta smelt, longfin smelt, and spring and winter-run Chinook salmon.

4 Among other defects, the Project relies on an experimental and as-yet unproven fish screen

5 design without the dynamic baffling requested by NOAA Fisheries in a constantly changing

6 tidal environment that would not minimize take of these species.

7 664. Although DFW attempted to quantify some of the expected permanent and

8 temporary losses of habitat for the Covered Species listed hereinabove, DFW failed to

9 adequately quantify the take of the Covered Species likely to result from the Project-i.e., the

10 expected take of the giant garter snake, the California tiger salamander, the tricolored blackbird,

11 the Swainson's hawk, the Delta smelt, the longfin smelt, the spring-run Chinook salmon, and the
winter-run Chinook salmon.

12

13 665. DFW's determination that issuance of the Project ITP is not likely to jeopardize

14 the continued existence of the Covered Species is not based on the best scientific and other
information reasonably available.
15

16 666. The Project ITP fails to promote or even adequately consider the recovery of the

17 Covered Species. To the contrary, the takings authorized by the Project ITP are likely to hinder

18 recovery of the Covered Species, and DFW has not ensured that this impact is minimized or
fully mitigated.

19 667. In issuing the Project ITP, DFW abrogated its affirmative duty to protect public
20 trust resources, including the protected species covered in the Project ITP.
21 668.

22 For the foregoing reasons, DFW failed to act in the manner required by law and

23 prejudicially abused its discretion in issuing the Project ITP.
THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

24 VIOLATION OF CALIFORNIA ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT

25 (Against DWR)
669. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained in
26 Paragraphs 1 through 668 as though fully set forth herein.
27 670. DWR's compliance with CESA is essential in assuring that the legal protections
28 provided to endangered and threatened species in California, as well as to "candidate" species,

134
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

-

2 are realized promptly and to eliminate threats posed to the Covered Species listed in the Project
ITP.

3 671. In its Application for the Project ITP, its approval of the Project, and its
4 certification of the Project FEIR/S, DWR abrogated its affirmative duty to protect public trust

5

6 resources, including, but not limited to, the protected species covered in the Project ITP.

7 672. The Project would jeopardize the continued existence of several species. The ITP

8 describes temporal losses, habitat fragmentation, and other cumulative "indirect" impacts as
threats to covered species.

9

10 673. The Project would result in "take" of covered species, but the mitigation offered is

11 ineffective and inadequate. DWR failed to demonstrate that its proposed mitigation and

12 conservation measures are capable of successful implementation.

13 674. The Project would cause traffic and noise impacts that would harm terrestrial

14 covered species, including the giant garter snake and Swainson's hawk.

675.

15 The Project would harm covered fish species, and the proposed fish screen
mitigation at the North Delta intakes is unproven.

16

17 676. For the reasons set forth hereinabove, DWR Project activities and approvals -

18 including, without limitation, its Project ITP Application, its approval of the Project, and its

19 certification of the Project FEIR/S-violate the requirements of CESA.
677. For the foregoing reasons, DWR failed to act in the manner required by CESA and
20| prejudicially abused its discretion.

21 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

22 VIOLATION OF CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT

23 (Against DFW)
678.

24 Plaintiffs incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained in

25 Paragraphs 1 through 677 as though fully set forth herein.

679.

26 As a responsible agency pursuant to CEQA, DFW was required to consider the

27 proposed Project's environmental effects prior to issuing the Project ITP. Despite its reliance on

28 the lead agency's environmental document, the responsible agency must decide for itself how to
respond to those significant effects that would directly or indirectly result from the responsible

135
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

-

2 agency's own decision to carry out, finance or approve an aspect of a project, focusing on its
area of expertise.

3 680.

4 DFW abdicated its responsibilities under the CEQA Guidelines when it approved

5 the flawed EIR/S. Instead of exercising its independent judgment as a trustee and responsible

6 agency under CEQA, DFW accepted DWR's inadequate and improper analysis of the Project's

7 potentially significant impacts in the EIR/S. On information and belief, the impact assessments
in the EIR/S relating to the resources within DFW's jurisdiction do not reflect DFW's own
8 decision-making or independent judgment.

9

10 As a responsible agency pursuant to CEQA, DFW must make findings that support its decision.

11 The findings must be supported by substantial evidence. Findings are legally inadequate if they

12 fail to present some explanation that supplies the logical step between the ultimate finding and

13 the facts in the record. (See CEQA Guidelines, § 15096; see also Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, §§
780, 780.5.)

14

15 681. DFW relied upon the EIR/S to make its conclusions in the ITP. Therefore, DFW's

16 findings are unsupported by substantial evidence because the EIR/S analysis is itself inadequate
under CEQA.

17

18 682. DFW failed to adequately support its decision to rely on the EIR/S for issuance of

19 the Project ITP with adequate findings, to support its findings with substantial evidence, and to
act as required by law or regulation, which constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion.
20 Therefore, Plaintiffs pray for the relief requested below.
21

22 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

23 VIOLATION OF FULLY PROTECTED SPECIES PROVISIONS OF
FISH AND GAME CODE SECTION 3511
(Against DWR)

24 683. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained in
25 Paragraphs 1 through 682 as though fully set forth herein.

26

27 684. Under Fish and Game Code section 3511, and subject to exceptions not applicable
in this case:

28 [A] fully protected bird may not be taken or possessed at any time. No provision of this code or any other law shall be construed to authorize the issuance of a

136
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

- permit or license to take a fully protected bird, and no permit or license previously

2 issued shall have any force or effect for that purpose.
685.

3 "Fully protected" birds subject to the prohibition of Fish and Game Code section

4 3511 include the greater sandhill crane (Grus canadensis tabida) and the white-tailed kite
(Elanus leucurus). (Fish & G. Code, § 3511.)

5

6 686. Greater sandhill cranes are winter residents in the Project area, and are found

7 primarily in open freshwater wetlands, including shallow marshes and wet meadows. The most

8 significant current threat to the greater sandhill crane is habitat degradation and destruction,
especially on their wintering grounds.

9

10 687. The white-tailed kite, another fully protected species found in the Project area,

11 uses low-elevation grasslands, agricultural areas, wetlands, and oak woodlands as habitat.

688.

12 The greater sandhill crane and white-tailed kite are Fully Protected Species, and

13 any "take" of the greater sandhill crane and white-tailed kite is strictly prohibited. (Fish & G.

14 § Code, § 3511, subd. (b)(8).) Consequently, the Project must meet a zero-"take" performance

15 standard for greater sandhill cranes and the white-tailed kite to avoid running afoul of their Fully
Protected Species status. (Ibid.)

16

17 689. Nothing in the Project ITP authorizes the take of any fully protected species. As

18 explained in the Project ITP, take or possession occurring in the conduct of Covered Activities

19 that is otherwise prohibited under the Fish and Game Code is not authorized by the Project ITP,

20 and is subject to enforcement pursuant to the Fish and Game Code, or any other provision of
law. (Project ITP, p. 103.)

21 690.

22 If allowed to proceed, the Project would result in take of greater sandhill cranes

23 and white-tailed kites, DWR assertions to the contrary notwithstanding.

691.

24 The lead agencies have not adequately supported their determination that

25 modifications to greater sandhill crane habitat on the northern portion of the Wildlife Refuge

26 would prevent "take" in the form of range reduction. The proposed protective measures are still

27 experimental, and that there exists no previous example of such measures having succeeded in

28 keeping cranes from abandoning the geography of their current roost site and complementary

137
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

1 foraging areas within two miles of that roost site. There is insufficient evidence to support a

2 finding that these modifications would result in zero take of greater sandhill cranes.

3 692. Moreover, the northernmost roost site for the greater sandhill cranes in the

4 Wildlife Refuge is already constrained by urban development to the north and to the east. The

5 additional constraint of a large-scale construction project slated to take more than a decade could

6 well be the final pressure that results in abandonment, even with a new roost site and enhanced a
7 foraging provided as a protective measure. Again, there is insufficient evidence to support a

8 finding that modifications proposed to address this threat would result in zero "take" of greater
9 sandhill cranes.

10 693. Furthermore, construction and operation of powerlines planned as part of the
11 Project would cause a take of both the greater sandhill crane and the white-tailed kite. DWR's

12 determination that installing flight diverters on existing power lines meets the zero-take
13 performance standard is unsupported. DWR previously concluded that the new powerlines
14 erected as part of the BDCP's tunnel component (virtually identical to the Project tunnel
15 component) would cause approximately forty-eight crane deaths per year. Later, DWR claimed

16 that installation of flight diverters would reduce bird strike risk by at least 60 percent. There is
17 no credible evidence, however, that flight diverters are effective at preventing bird strikes.

18 Moreover, even if the proposed flight diverters were to reduce strike risk by 60 percent for

19 greater sandhill cranes and white-tail kites, this reduction would not meet the zero take standard

20 of Fish and Game Code section 3511.

21 694. The EIR/S estimate of bird strikes from existing power lines with flight diverters
22 is unreasonable because it fails to account for the increased possibility of strikes due to

23 unexpected, inadvertent, or unavoidable construction-related disturbances. More activity on the
24 ground increases the likelihood of flushing, which in turn increases the risk of bird strikes with

25 existing powerlinesparticularly at night and in foggy conditions. The proposed Project habitat
26 modifications would exacerbate the risk by enticing greater sandhill cranes to remain in the
27 vicinity of the construction so as not to abandon an existing roost site. Even if installing flight
28 diverters were to minimize the increase in strikes due to construction-related flushing, the

138
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

-

2 Project proponents have provided no analysis demonstrating that flight diverters would prevent
strikes altogether.

3 695. The lack of certain funding for the removal of transmission lines referred to as
4 "temporary" in the EIR/S indicates bird strikes would continue indefinitely. Although the

5

6 FEIR/S asserts generally that all Mitigation Measures and "Environmental Commitments" will

7 be funded, it contains no enforceable requirement, mechanism or funding for the eventual

8 removal of the transmission lines now labelled as "temporary".

9 696. In approving the Project and certifying the Project EIR/S, DWR has taken actions

10 that will result in take of Fully Protected Species in violation of the Fish and Game Code, as

11 well as in the permanent and temporary destruction of habitat critical to the continuing existence
of Fully Protected Species.

12

13 697. For the foregoing reasons, DWR failed to act in the manner required by law and

14 prejudicially abused its discretion in approving the Project and certifying the Project EIR/S,
thereby violating Fish and Game Code section 3511.

15

16 SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION
VIOLATIONS OF THE 1959 DELTA PROTECTION ACT

17 WATER CODE SECTION 12200 ET SEQ.
(Against DWR)

18

19 698. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained in
Paragraphs 1 through 697 as though fully set forth herein.

20 699.

21 In 1959, the Legislature found and declared that:

22 [TJhe maintenance of an adequate water supply in the Delta sufficient to maintain and expand agriculture, industry, urban, and recreational development in the Delta

23 and to provide a common source of fresh water for export to areas of water deficiency is necessary to the peace, health, safety and welfare of the people of the State . . . .

24

25 (Wat. Code, § 12201, emphasis added.) Providing that "common source of fresh water" within

26 the Delta for both water users within and outside of the Delta is not optional for DWR. Water
Code section 12205 provides:

27

28 It is the policy of the State that the operation and management of releases from storage into the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta of water for use outside the area in

139
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

P

1 which such water originates shall be integrated to the maximum extent possible in order to permit the fulfillment of the objectives of this part.
2 (Emphasis added; see also, Wat. Code, § 107 ['all . . . declarations of policy in this

3 [Water] code shall be given their full force and effect"].)

4 700. Because one "of the objectives of this part" is the provision of a "common source

5 of fresh water" within the Delta for water users both within and outside of the Delta, DWR has

6 a mandatory duty to integrate its "releases from storage into the [Delta] of water for use outside

7 the area in which such water originates . . to the maximum extent possible in order to permit

8 the fulfillment of [that] objective[]." (Wat. Code, §§ 12201 & 12205.)
9 701. The hallmark of the proposed Project, however, is the circumvention of that duty.
10 The Project's central feature is the proposed export of water that would otherwise flow into the
11 Delta (i.e., water that DWR releases from storage into the Delta) by diverting that water into
12 tunnels located in the northernmost tip of the Delta before that water reaches that "common
13 source of fresh water" within the Delta and, hence, before that water provides a common source
14 of fresh water for both water users within and outside of the Delta.

15 702. Such export of water from the northernmost region of the Delta therefore
16 constitutes a direct violation of DWR's duty under Water Code section 12205 to "integrate [its
17 releases of storage water into the Delta for export from the Delta] to the maximum extent

18 possible in order to permit the fulfillment of the objective" of providing that "common source of
19 fresh water." DWR's Project is manifestly intended to do just the opposite, i.e., to avoid
20| integrating its releases from storage into the Delta to provide that supply. Instead, the Project is
21 designed to impermissibly segregate some or all of those releases from that common supply.
22 Because such segregation is directly prohibited by Water Code section 12205, the Project
23 conflicts with, and would violate, the 1959 DPA.

24 703. Additional objectives of the 1959 DPA include "the provision of salinity control
25 and an adequate water supply for the users of water in the [Delta]." (Wat. Code, § 12202; see

26 also, Wat. Code, § 12201.)
27 704. Under Water Code section 12205, DWR therefore has an additional duty to
28 integrate its "releases from storage into the [Delta] of water for use outside the area in which

140
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

such water originates to the maximum extent possible in order to permit the fulfillment of

2 the objectives" of providing that "salinity control and an adequate water supply for the users of

3 water in the [Delta]." (Wat. Code, § 12202.)

4 705. As proposed, however, the Project would breach that duty by exporting water
through the tunnels project in the northern Delta that is needed to maintain that "salinity control

6 and an adequate water supply for the users of water in the [Delta]." (Wat. Code, § 12202.)

7 706. Examples of the Project's unlawful intent and effect include DWR's planned
deprivation of such salinity control and an adequate water supply via the export of Sacramento

9 River fresh water through the Project's tunnels in the event of extended droughts, individual or

10 widespread levee failures, and sea level rise. When the Delta is experiencing degraded water
11 quality (i.e., high salinity levels) as a result of those events, in lieu of allowing Sacramento Riven
12 fresh water to flow into the Delta to provide salinity control by restoring that water quality,
13 DWR's plan under the Project is, instead, to export that water through the Project's tunnels,

14 thereby depriving the Delta of that water and, hence, depriving it of that salinity control.
15 707. This abrogation of Delta salinity control constitutes a direct violation of DWR's

16 duty in Water Code section 12205 to "integrate[ its releases of storage water into the Delta for
17 export from the Delta] to the maximum extent possible in order to permit the fulfillment of the

18 objectives" of providing "salinity control and an adequate water supply for the users of water in
19 the [Delta]." (Wat. Code, § 12202.) For this reason, also, the Project, as proposed, fails as a
20 matter of law and cannot be allowed to proceed.

21 708. Additionally, the Project, as proposed, violates DWR's duties under Water Code
22 section 12204, which provides:

23 In determining the availability of water for export from the Sacramento-San
24 Joaquin Delta no water shall be exported which is necessary to meet the requirements of Sections 12202 and 12203 of this chapter.
25 709. Water Code section 12202, as discussed, requires DWR to provide "salinity
26 control and an adequate water supply for the users of water in the [Delta]." Water Code section
27 12204, accordingly, prohibits DWR from exporting water through the Project's tunnels that is
28 necessary to provide that salinity control and an adequate water supply.

141
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

1 710. Notwithstanding that duty, the Project would, by design, violate that duty by

2 exporting water through the tunnels that is needed to provide that salinity control and an

3 adequate water supply. As discussed above, examples of such instances include DWR's

4 planned deprivation of the statutorily required salinity control and an adequate water supply in
5 the event of extended droughts, individual or widespread levee failures, and sea level rise.

6 When the water quality is (i.e., salinity level) in the Delta is substantially degraded as a result of

7 those events, DWR's proposed Project would export Sacramento River fresh water through the

8 tunnels that is needed to restore that water quality and provide that adequate water supply. Such

9 planned exports therefore directly violate Water Code section 12204 and cannot lawfully
10 proceed.

11

12 SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION VIOLATIONS OF THE 1992 DELTA PROTECTION ACT
13 PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE SECTION 29700 ET SEQ. (Against DWR)
14 711. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained in
15 Paragraphs 1 through 710 as though fully set forth herein.

16 712. In the 1992 DPA, the Legislature makes numerous findings and declarations for
17 the protection of the Delta, including the following set forth in Public Resources Code sections
18 29701 and 29702, respectively:

19 "[T]he Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta is a natural resource of statewide, national,
20 and international significance, containing irreplaceable resources, and it is the policy of the state to recognize, preserve, and protect those resources of the delta
21 for the use and enjoyment of current and future generations." (Wat. Code, § 29701, emphasis added.)
22 "[T]he basic goals of the state for the delta are the following: (b) Protect,
23 maintain, and, where possible, enhance and restore the overall quality of the delta environment, including, but not limited to, agriculture, wildlife habitat, and
24 recreational activities." (Wat. Code, § 29702, emphasis added.)

25 713. DWR's compliance with the policies and goals in the 1992 DPA is mandatory.
26 (See e.g., Klajic v. Castaic Lake Water Agency (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 987, 995 [*The trial court
27 reviews an administrative action pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 to determine

28 [among other things] whether the agency's action was .. . contrary to established public policy"]

142
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

P

H (Klajic).) "Generally, a writ [under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085] will lie when there is

2 no plain, speedy, and adequate alternative remedy; the respondent has a duty to perform; and the

3 petitioner has a clear and beneficial right to performance." (Pomona Police Officers' Ass'n v.

4 City of Pomona (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 578, 584, quoting Payne v. Superior Court (1976) 17

5 Cal.3d 908, 925 (Pomona Police).)

6 714. As is the case with the 2009 DRA, which contains substantially similar findings

7 and declarations (and which is discussed below), far from "preserv[ing]," "protect[ing],"

8 /"maintain[ing]," much less "enhance[ing]" the Delta's "irreplaceable resources" and the
"overall quality of the Delta environment," the EIR/S confirms that the Project's construction
10 and operation would substantially impair, and in many cases permanently destroy, those
11 resources and qualities, in direct contravention of the policies and goals set forth in the 1992

12 DPA.

13 715. The construction and operation of the Project is also contrary to the co-equal
14 goals set forth in Public Resources Code section 29702 (which are also set forth in the 2009

15 DRA and also discussed below). Public Resources Code section 29702, subdivision (a),
16 provides:

17 The Legislature further finds and declares that the basic goals of the state for the
18 Delta are the following: (a) Achieve the two coequal goals of providing a more reliable water supply for California and protecting, restoring, and enhancing the
19 Delta ecosystem. The coequal goals shall be achieved in a manner that protects and enhances the unique cultural, recreational, natural resource, and agricultural
20 values of the Delta as an evolving place.

21 716. The Project's noncompliance with these co-equal goals includes the Project's
22 failure to "provid[e] a more reliable water supply for [Delta exporters]" "in a manner that
23 protects and enhances the unique cultural, recreational, natural resource, and agricultural values
24 of the Delta as an evolving place." (Pub. Resources Code, § 29702.)
25 717. The Project seeks to provide a more reliable water supply for Delta exporters
26 during events such as extended droughts, levee failures, and sea level rise by depriving the
27 Delta of fresh water flows needed to maintain salinity control and an adequate water supply for
28 water users within the Delta during such events, should they occur. Improvements to the

143
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

-

2 reliability of the water supply for Delta exporters during such events would therefore be

3 achieved by directly impairing the reliability of the water supply for water users within the

4 Delta during those events. Such impairment harms, rather than "protects [much less] enhances
the unique cultural, recreational, natural resource, and agricultural values of the Delta as an
5 evolving place." Such impairment directly contradicts Public Resources Code section 29702

6

7 and, for this reason as well, the Project, as proposed, cannot proceed.

8 EIGHTH CAUSE OF ACTION

9 VIOLATIONS OF THE WATERSHED PROTECTION ACT WATER CODE SECTION 11460 ET SEQ.

10 (Against DWR)
718.

11 Plaintiffs incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained in
Paragraphs 1 through 717 as though fully set forth herein.

12 719.

13 Water Code section 11460 of the Watershed Protection Act provides:

14 In the construction and operation by the department [i.e., DWR and USBR] of any project under the provisions of this part a watershed or area wherein water

15 originates, or an area immediately adjacent thereto which can conveniently be supplied with water therefrom, shall not be deprived by the department directly or

16 indirectly of the prior right to all of the water reasonably required to adequately supply the beneficial needs of the watershed, area, or any of the inhabitants or property owners therein.
17 720.

18 Despite this prohibition against operating the Project in a manner that "directly or

19 indirectly" deprives the Delta of its "prior right to all of the water reasonably required to

20 adequately supply the beneficial needs of the [Delta] or any of the inhabitants or property

21 owners therein," DWR intends to operate the Project in a manner that does precisely that.

22 Instances of such deprivations include DWR's planned use of the Delta Tunnels to export

23 Sacramento River fresh water away from the Delta that is "reasonably required to adequately

24 supply the beneficial needs" of the Delta and its inhabitants during events that result in

25 substantial degradation of the water quality in the Delta, such as extended droughts, levee
failures, and sea level rise.

26 721.

27 It is during and after such events, that the Delta and its inhabitants would require

28 that fresh water the most. Yet, in direct contravention of its duties under Water Code section
11460, the Project would deprive the Delta and its inhabitants of such fresh water. Such

144
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

deprivations would be unlawful under the Watershed Protection Act and, therefore, the Project,

2 as proposed, cannot proceed. Additionally, the anticipated adverse impacts to surface water and

3 groundwater quality and quantity within the Delta and other areas of origin that would result

4 from the construction and operation of the Project, as proposed, likewise would result in direct

5 and/or indirect deprivations of those areas' prior rights to that water, and to the unimpaired

6 quality of that water, in violation of Water Code section 11460.

7
NINTH CAUSE OF ACTION
VIOLATIONS OF THE 2009 DELTA REFORM ACT PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE SECTION 29700 ET SEQ. (Against DWR)

10 722. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained in
11 Paragraphs 1 through 721 as though fully set forth herein.

12 723. The 2009 DRA provides comprehensive protections for the Delta. As with the

13 other acts, DWR's approval of the Project and its certification of the EIR/S violate the 2009

14 Delta Reform Act in numerous substantial respects.
15 724. The 2009 DRA sets out numerous policies of the State of California that apply to
16 the management of the Delta. These policies constitute the "coequal goals" of the 2009 Delta
17 Reform Act, and are generally applicable provisions of the Water Code.
18 725. The 2009 DRA also directs the Delta Stewardship Council to adopt a Delta Plan
19 for long-term management of the Delta. The Delta Plan is the mechanism by which the Council
20 may reviews covered actions. (See Wat. Code, § 85059.) The Council evaluates covered

21 actions for consistency with the Delta Plan when a party challenges an agency's certification of
22 consistency. (Wat. Code, §85225.10.) This review process pertains specifically to the Delta
23 Plan and is separate from the 2009 DRA's policies.

24 726. The 2009 DRA defines the coequal goals of Delta water management as "the two

25 goals of providing a more reliable water supply for California and protecting, restoring, and
26 enhancing the Delta ecosystem. The coequal goals shall be achieved in a manner that protects
27 and enhances the unique cultural, recreational, natural resource, and agricultural values of the
28 Delta as an evolving place." (Wat. Code, § 85054.) As the policies of the State of California,

145
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

-

2 the coequal goals apply generally to the Project and are not exclusively the purview of the

3 Council. The coequal goals are judicially enforceable. (See e.g., Klajic, supra, 90 Cal.App.4th
at 995; Pomona Police, supra, 58 Cal.App.4th at 584.)

4

5 727. DWR's approval of the Project and certification of the EIR/S conflict directly with

6 the 2009 DRA's co-equal goal of creating a more reliable water supply in California. No water

7 availability analysis has been performed to determine the Project's impacts to water supply; had

a

8 water availability analysis been performed, it would have disclosed the fact that the Project

9 relies on "paper water," i.e., water that exists only on paper.

10 728. DWR's approval of the Project and certification of the EIR/S also violate the 2009

11 DRA's co-equal goal of protecting, restoring, and enhancing the Delta ecosystem. The Project

12 simply relocates impacts from the export of Delta water to a different region of the Delta and

13 includes no protective, restoration or enhancement measures in excess of mitigation required to

14 reduce project impacts pursuant to other laws, e.g., CEQA, and, as alleged elsewhere herein,

15 even those measures are themselves deficient as a matter of law and/or when reviewed under a

16 substantial evidence standard. Operation of the Project, if implemented, would also significantly

17 degrade water quality, thereby impairing or precluding development of other habitat restoration
projects.

18

19 729. DWR's approval of the Project and certification of the EIR/S also conflict directly
with the 2009 DRA's requirement that Delta water be managed in a manner that protects and
20 enhances the unique cultural, recreational, natural resource, and agricultural values of the Delta.
21

22 (Wat. Code, § 85054.) The Project would instead cripple the Delta's sustainable and wildlife-

23 friendly agricultural operations, destroy special status species Delta habitat in and out of the

24 water, and plague the Project area with overwhelming and lengthy construction activity. Project

25 operations would impair or destroy currently reliable local surface and groundwater supplies

26 and, eventually, the Delta communities that depend on those supplies.
730. "The policy of the State of California is to reduce reliance on the Delta in meeting
27 California's future water supply needs through a statewide strategy of investing in improved
28 regional supplies, conservation, and water use efficiency." (Wat. Code, § 85021.) The Project §

146
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

F directly conflicts with the policy of reduced reliance because it would export growth inducing

2 water supplies from the Delta that increase-rather than decrease--reliance on the Delta to

3 meet present and future water supply needs outside the Delta.

4 731. In the 2009 DRA, the Legislature declared State policy, in pertinent part, as

5 follows: "The policy of the State of California is to reduce reliance on the Delta in meeting

6 California's future water supply needs through a statewide strategy of investing in improved
7 regional supplies, conservation, and water use efficiency ...." (Wat. Code, § 85021.) The

8 Project does precisely the opposite. In addition to increasing reliance on Delta water, the

9 Project's enormous cost would also reduce availability of funding for projects that actually
10 would reduce reliance on Delta water. The participating water contractor agencies are
11 considering issuing bonds to finance Project construction. Incurring this increased public debt
12 from the bonds would impair the ability of water contractor agencies to secure funds for other
13 water projects that improve regional water self-reliance and reduce reliance on the Delta. The

14 EIR/S fails to adequately disclose and analyze the full nature and extent to which the Project
15 would directly and indirectly increase reliance upon the Delta, nor does it identify and analyze
16 upon the Delta. measures to mitigate or avoid that increase in reliance
17 732. In approving the Project and certifying the EIR/S, DWR abrogated its affirmative
18 duty to comply with the mandates and promote the express objectives of the foregoing

19 enactments and laws.

20 733. For the foregoing reasons, DWR failed to act in the manner required by law and
21 prejudicially abused its discretion in approving the Project and certifying the EIR/S.
22 TENTH CAUSE OF ACTION
VIOLATION OF THE COMMON LAW PUBLIC TRUST DOCTRINE 23 (Against DWR and DFW)
24 734. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained in
25 Paragraphs 1 through 733 as though fully set forth herein.

26 735. The State of California, as a sovereign entity, owns "all of its navigable waterways
27 and the lands lying beneath them 'as trustee of a public trust for the benefit of the people.'*
28 (Colberg, Inc. V. State of California ex rei. Dept. Pub. Wks. (1967) 67 Cal.2d 408, 416.) The

147
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

State acquired title as trustee to such lands and waterways upon its admission to the union. (City
2 of Berkeley v. Superior Court (1980) 26 Cal.3d 515, 521.)

3 736. The public trust doctrine in California encompasses all navigable lakes and

4 streams, and protects navigable waters from harm caused by diversion of non-navigable

5 tributaries, including those diverted and harmed by the Project. The public trust doctrine also

6 applies to extractions of groundwater that adversely affect navigable waterways.

7 737. The public trust doctrine provides for protecting people's common interest in

8 California's streams, lakes, marshlands and tidelands, and DWR has "an affirmative duty to takel
9 the public trust into account in the planning and allocation of water resources, and to protect
10 public trust whenever feasible." (National Audubon Society v. Superior Court of Alpine County
11 (1983) 33 Cal.3d 419, 446.) DFW is the state's trustee for fish and wildlife resources.

12 738. The Legislature has acknowledged that "[t]he longstanding constitutional principle
13 of reasonable use and the public trust doctrine shall be the foundation of state water

14 management and are particularly important and applicable to the Delta." (Wat. Code, § 85023). §
15 739. The people's interests under the public trust include the right to fish, hunt, bathe,
16 swim, to use for boating and general recreation purposes the navigable waters of the state.

17 Preservation of public trust resources in their natural state is also essential to the public trust
18 doctrine. (See National Audubon Society v. Superior Court of Alpine County (1983) 33 Cal.3d
19 419, 434-35.)

20 740. An agency's duty to perform public trust analysis prior to approving a project is
21 not necessarily discharged by virtue of performing CEQA review. (S.F. Baykeeper, Inc. V. State
22 Lands Com. (2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 202, 242.) Instead, public agencies have an independent
23 duty to perform a public trust consistency analysis, based on substantial evidence in the record,

24 as part of an adequate CEQA review. (Ibid.)

25 741. In its CEQA Findings, DWR attempts to claim that to not build the tunnels would

26 be an unreasonable use of water, and somehow run afoul of the public trust doctrine. DWR
27 further distorts the public trust doctrine by attempting to characterize concerns about the impacts
28 of the Delta Tunnels as arguments for "private or local advantage." The public trust doctrine

148
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

-

2 protects public waterways in their natural state for use by all people, and does not countenance
removal of water from waterways for use elsewhere.

3 742.

4 The Project EIR/S does not contain any water availability analysis that would

5 show, at a minimum, what water will be available to satisfy existing obligations, including

6 protection of the public trust, in addition to Project-facilitated exports. The EIR/S also fails to

7 includes sufficient analysis of how Project groundwater extraction activities during construction

8 and diversions during operations would affect public trust resources.

9 743. Defendant DWR rejected multiple comments from various groups to develop a

10 public trust analysis to satisfy the California Supreme Court's holding that the state must protect

11 the public trust in water supply planning decisions. The Project approval documents fail to
adequately address DWR's public trust duties.

12 744. DFW failed to include

13 any public trust analysis in its responsible agency CEQA

14 Findings or in the Project ITP, and otherwise failed to perform the requisite public trust analysis.

15 745. Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereon allege, that DWR's and DFW's

16 failure to adequately consider and analyze the public trust in approving the Project will harm

17 trust resources and the Plaintiffs' and the people's rights and interests in those resources-

18 including fishing, hunting, bathing, swimming, boating, and preserving navigable waters of the
state--and thus violates the public trust doctrine.

19 746. Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that by failing to
20 adequately consider, analyze and protect the public trust, DWR and DFW violated the state's

21 duty to protect public trust resources.

22 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

23

24 WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray for relief as follows:
1.

25 2. Vacate DWR's Notice of Determination for the Project;

26 Issue a peremptory writ of mandate commanding DWR to vacate and set aside its

27 certification of the FEIR/S, its approval of the Project, and any and all approvals rendered

28 pursuant to and/or in furtherance of all or any part of the Project;

149
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

1 3. Vacate DFW's issuance of the ITP in reliance on the inadequate EIR/S when it

2 acted as a CEQA responsible agency.

3 4. Vacate DFW's issuance of the ITP authorizing take of species protected under the

4 CESA and the public trust doctrine;

5 5. Preliminarily and permanently enjoin Defendants from taking any action in
6 furtherance of constructing or operating the Project unless and until Defendants comply with the
7 requirements of CEQA, the Fish and Game Code, the 1959 DPA, the 1992 DPA, the Watershed

8 Protection Act, the 2009 DRA, and the public trust doctrine.
9 6. Award Plaintiffs the costs of this action, including their reasonable attorneys' fees;
10 and

11 7. Grant other such relief as the Court deems just and proper.
