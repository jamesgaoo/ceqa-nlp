20 Petitioner California Clean Energy Committee, by and through its attorney, alleges as

23 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

24 1. The Sacramento Arca Council of Governments (SACOG) is a joint powers authority

25 formed by agreement among six member counties and 22 member cities in the Sacramento region

26 pursuant to the Joint Exercisc of Power Act (Gov. Code, § 6500 § et seq.). SACOG is the federally-

27 designated metropolitan planning organization (MPO) for the six-county region consisting of Yolo,

28 Sacramento, Yuba, Sutter, Placer, and El Dorado counties (SACOG region), and it is the regional

Petition for Writ of Mandate -

transportation planning agency (RTPA) for Sacramento, Sutter, Yolo and Yuba counties.

2 2. Petitioner California Clean Energy Committee (CCEC) is a nonprofit corporation

3 incorporated under the laws of the State of California maintaining its principal place of business in

4 the City of Davis, California. CCEC has advocated on behalf of the gencral public throughout the

5 State of California for cnergy conservation, the devclopment of clean energy resources, reduced

6 greenhouse gas emissions, smart growth, more efficicnt transportation systems, farmland

7 prescrvation, and related issues in connection with numerous projects and issues since 2008. CCEC

& actively supports the application of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) to energy
conservation and related issues.

10 3. CCEC's supporters in Davis and in the surrounding areas will be directly and

11 adversely impacted by the implementation of the project described herein, by the failure of SACOG

12 to adequatcly identify and evaluate the impacts of the project on the physical environment, and by

13 the failure to identify feasible mitigation for those impacts as required pursuant to CEQA. Petitioner

14 brings this action as a represcntative of the general public in the six-county SACOG region who will

15 be affected by the project.

16 4. Without a representative organization such as CCEC, it would be impractical and

17 uneconomic for individual members of the public to enforce CEQA with respect to the project

18 discussed herein. Without a representative action such as this one, the violations of CEQA described

19 in this petition would remain immune from judicial review. No governmental agency is prepared to

20 cvaluate the environmental issues or to enforce the public rights that arc at stakc.

21 5. Venuc for this action is proper in this court because the environmental impacts of the

22 actions alleged herein will cause direct and substantial impacts within the County of Sacramento and

23 becausc the principal office of the respondent agency is situated within the County of Sacramento.

24 6. Concurrently herewith petitioner is filing a declaration of prior service by mail upon

25 SACOG of written noticc of intent to commence this action in compliance with the requiremenis of

26 Public Resources Code section 21167.5.

27 7. Petitioner is further filing and serving hercwith noticc of its election to prepare the
28 administrative record in this matter pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.6.

Petition for Writ of Mandate - 2

8. The true names and capacities of the respondents and real parties in interest sued

2 herein under California Code of Civil Procedure section 474 as Does 1 tbrough 100, inclusive, are

3 presently unknown to petitioner, Does through 100 include agents of the county, state, and federal

4 government who are responsible in some manner for the conduct described herein and real parties in

5 interest presently unknown to the petitioner who claim some legal or cquitable interest in the project

6 who petitioner therefore sues by such fictitious names. Petitioner will amend this petition to include

7 these Doe respondents' true names and capacities when they are ascertained. Each of the fictitiously-

8 named respondents is responsible in some manner for the conduct alleged herein.

9 9. CCEC's action herein will result in the enforcement of important rights affecting the
10 public intcrest and confer substantial benefits on the general public. The necessity and financial

11 burden of private cnforcement justify an award of attorney fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure

12 scction 1021.5.

13 I0. The public comment period on the draft environmental impact report (DEIR)

14 extended through November 7, 2019. Despite the extensive comments received, SACOG has

15 nevertheless prepared and relied on an EIR that falls well below CEQA's minimum standards. If the

16 agency is allowed to proceed with the project, irreparable harm will result to the environment and to

17 the public. No adequate remedy, other than that prayed for herein, exists by which the rights of the

18 petitioner and the class it represents may be protected.

19 11.CCRC has cxhausted all administrative remedies by submitting written comments on

20 two occasions requesting compliance with CEQA and a full and adequate environmental review. All

21 issues raised in this petition were raised with SACOG by CCEC or by other members of the public

22 or public agencics prior to the certification of the final EIR. SACOG has made its final decision.

23 This petition is timely filed in accordance with Public Resources Code section 21167 and CEQA

24 Guidelines section 15112.

25

26 PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

27 12. On September 23, 2019, SACOG released a draft 2020 Mctropolitan Transportation

28 Plan/Sustainable Community Strategy (MTP/SCS or plan). The MTP/SCS is a long-range

Petition for Writ of Mandate - 3

• transportation plan and sustainable communities strategy for the SACOG region through the year

2 2040.

13. The plan provides a future vision statement, a four-part aspirational discussion, and a

4 $34.9 billion transportation investment strategy. The vision statement calls for building vibrant
places, fostering new transportation technologies, adopting new taxes and fecs, and building a safe

6 and reliable transportation system. The supporting actions include securing funding, developing

7 plans, providing technical assistance, helping to find ways to pilot new services, leading vision
collaboration, developing new programs, partnering to find new services, supporting efforts to

9 secure funding, finding solutions, and building new roadway capacity,

10 14. Concurrently with the relcase of the draft MTP/SCS, SACOG distributed a Draft

11 Environmental Impact Report (DETR) and a Notice of Availability, which provided a public

12 comment period running from September 23, 2019 to November 7, 2019. The DEIR addressed the

13 MTP/SCS, which it described as a long-range comprchensive transportation plan for the region's

14 multi-modal transportation system. The DEIR indicated that the Sustainable Communities and

15 Climate Protection Act (Stats. 2008, ch. 728) (SB 375) required that a sustainable communities

16 strategy (SCS) be included in the regional plan. The DEIR referred to a compact growth pattern that

17 would be implemented through local plans and individual development applications, resulting in a

18 reduction in vehicle miles travelled (VMT).

19 15. Several governmental agencies, members of the public, and non-profit organizations

20 reviewed and commented on the DEIR. CCEC submitted comments on November 7, 2019, during

21 the public comment pcriod. SACOG published its Final Environmental Impact Report for the 2020

22 Metropolitan Transportation Plan/Sustainable Communitics Strategy (FEIR)' on November 14,

23 2019. The FEIR consisted of comments and responses to comments along with revisions to the

24 DEIR. On November 18, 2019, CCEC submitted comments addressing the FEIR.

25 16. On November 18, 2019, the SACOG Board of Directors met and approved (i)

26 Rcsolution No. 64-2019 certifying the FEIR and adopting findings of fact, a statement of overriding

27 considerations, and mitigation, monitoring and reporting program and (ii) Resolution No. 65-2019

28 "EIR" refers to the DEIR as supplemented by the FEIR.

PROJECT DEFINITION 3

4 17. Land Use Projections Included in Project. CLQA provides that local agencics shall

A prepare and certify an environmental impact report on any project that they intend to carry out or

6 approve. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21151.) CCEC notified SACOG during the public comment

7 period that the agency does not have the authority to carry out or to approve a land use plan for the

8 SACOG region (Gov. Code, § 65080(b)(2)(K)) and that the MTP/SCS only forccasts land use
patterns and offers incentives for projects that have not yet been proposed, about which no specific

10 information is known, and over which SACOG has no approval authority. The nature and extent of

11 development that will take place within the region over the next 20 years is not controlled by, and

12 cannot be determined from, the MTP/SCS. SACOG'S purported analysis of the environmental
impacts that would result from undefined future projects based upon a hypothetical growth forecast 13

14 was entirely speculative. "[T]he proposed M'TP/SCS does not create the forecasted growth.' (DEIR,

15 16-46.) Nevertheless, SACOG generally treats the land use forecast as if it were part of a project

16 that it intends to approve and carry out. CEQA does not apply to planning studies that will not have

17 legally binding effect on later activitics. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15262; see Pub. Resources Code, §§

18 21102, 21150.) Morcover, SACOG's analysis includes as part of the so-called project, not just cvcry

19 building to be constructed in the region over the next 20 ycars but also cvery pre-existing building

20 and transportation facility in the SACOG region. The result is that the effects of the transportation

21 planning decisions being made by SACOG have been obscured by mixing together all the projected

22 and cxisting land use and transportation development over a six-county region. The scope of the

23 cvaluation has reduced the EIR to a meaningless generality which fails to inform the public or
24 || decisionmakers concerning the effects of SACOG's decisions. The project definition is shifting and

25 unclear.

26

CLIMATE CHANGE 27

28 18. Comments on GHG Analysis. CCEC's comment letter advised SACOG at length that at

Petition for Writ of Mandate - 5

the agency had failed to provide a cumulative analysis of the climate impacts of the project and that

2 cvaluating the MTP/SCS for consistency with the 2017 Scoping Plan was not sufficient for that

3 purpose. (DEIR 3-51.) SACOG was advised that the scoping a plan is not a sct of regulations or

4 requirements that could ensure the mitigation of the projcct's climate change impacts. CCEC stated

5 that further information should be provided concerning how GHG emissions were calculated, how

6 the proposed project would impact GHG emissions, what the agency's conclusion was, and how the

7 conclusion was reached. CCEC urged that the EIR evaluate the impact to climate change based
upon the extent to which the project would increase GHG emissions compared to the existing

environment.

10 19. GIIG Analysis. SACOG's EIR is unlawful under CEQA bccause it analyzes climate

11 impacts based on whether the proposed plan would "[s]ubstantially interfere with achievement of the

12 state's long term climate goals, as set forth in CARB's 2017 Scoping Plan" and because it fails to it

13 includc sufficient detail to enable those who did not participate in its preparation to understand and

14 consider meaningfully the plan's GHG impacts. The EIR fails to identify specific goals set forth in

15 the scoping plan that would constitute a supposed standard of significance and fails to show how any

16 goal contained in the scoping plan could be supported as a standard of significance. The EIR does

17 not explain how or to what extent the proposed MTP/SCS would impact the goals of the scoping

18 plan. Rather the EIR simply states that the MTP/SCS has been propared pursuant to SB 375 and that

19 SB 375 is "a nccessary component" of achieving the emission reductions mandated by SB 32. (DEIR

20 8-21.) SB 32 calls for the adoption of rules and regulations ensuring the reduction of statewide GHG

21 emissions to at least 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030. (Health & Safcty Code, § 38566.) The

22 EIR then cites a staff report that identifies 2030 target of decreasing per-capita "passenger vehicle

23 GUIG emissions" in the region by 19 percent and states that a 19 percent decreasc would not be

24 sufficient to meet the goals of the 2017 Scoping Plan, demonstrating that the usc of the scoping plan

25 as a standard of significance is unsupported. a The EIR cites a "target re-setting report" for the

26 proposition that the scoping plan would need to reducc emissions 25 percent by 2035 to meet SB 32

27 goals. SACOG concludes that the impact as significant. SACOG failed to conduct a lawful

28 cumulative analysis of climate impacts by failing to clearly identify a threshold of significance,

Petition for Writ of Mandate - 6

failing to support a threshold, and by purporting to rely upon the 2017 Scoping Plan, which does not

2 does not constitute a set of regulations or requirements.

3 20. Historic Bascline. The EIR used a 2005 baseline to analyze emissions from

4 passenger vchiclcs. It awkwardly states that "consistent with slatutory direction pursuant to SB 375

5 a GHG baseline year was used to compare the per capita reductions achieved from the proposed

6 MTP/SCS for which 2005 was selected." (DEIR 8-16.) It states that CARB assigned SACOG a

7 target of 19 percent reduction in per capita GHG emissions from cars and light trucks to be achieved

8 by 2035 and then reports that the MTP/SCS meets that target. (DEIR 8-22.) During the public

9 comment period, CCEC advised SACOG that 2005 cmissions would not be an appropriate bascline

10 and did not reasonably refloct conditions at the time the notice of preparation was published. (FEIR

11 3-51.) The bascline normally consists of environmental conditions in the vicinity of the project as

12 they exist at the time the environmental analysis is commenced, (CEQA Guidelines, § 15125(a).)

13 The EIR fails to identify any reason or to provide any substantial evidence showing that an existing

14 conditions bascline would not provide relevant information or would otherwise be misleading,

15 SACOG responded that a 2005 baseline was necessary to evaluate compliance under SB 375 (FEIR

16 3-83), but compliance with SB 375 does not accurately reflect whether the MTP/SCS makes a

17 substantial contribution to global climate change. Without an accurate determination of baseline

18 conditions, the EIR could not provide an accurate analysis of project impacts or formulate

19 mitigation.

20 21. 2030 to 2040 GHG Impact Analysis. The MTP/SCS is a long-range transportation

21 plan for the SACOG region covering a 20 year planning period running from 2020 to 2040. (DEIR

22. 2-2.) The EIR purports to analyze GHG cmissions by determining whether the MTP/SCS would

23 substantially interfere with achicvcment of the state's long term climatc goals as set forth in CARB's

24 2017 Scoping Plan. (DEIR 8-20, 8-25.) Nevertheless SACOG acknowledges in the EIR that the

25 scoping plan extends only to 2030 and provides no guidance for the second decade of the plan

26 running from 2030 to 2040. (DEIR 8-24.) Morcover, CCEC notified SACOG during the public

27 comment period that under the plan, mobile source emissions would remain essentially unchanged

28 during the 2030-2040 decade. CCEC informed SACOG that the failurc to rcduce emissions during

Pctition for Writ of Mandate - 7

the 2030 to 2040 time period constituted a significant adverse impact and informed the agency that

2 the MTP/SCS was inconsistent with the scoping plan. (FEIR 3-52.) SACOG responded that there

3 was a 7 percent reduction in mobile source emissions over that decade (FEIR 3-83), and CCEC

4 replied that the scoping plan data called for a 35% reduction in GHG emissions between 2030 and

5 2040 (Supplement 2). SACOG's analysis of GHG emissions based upon compliance with the 2017

6 Scoping Plan fails to address the full planning horizon of the MTP/SCS which runs to 2040.

7 SACOG's analysis of climate impacts for the 2030 to 2040 period is unsupported and fails to comply

8 with CEQA disclosure requirements.
a 22. EMFAC Invalid. According to the EIR, SACOG used a "travel demand mode!"

10 known as SACSIM to forecast daily vehicle activity that could be expected under the proposcd

11 MTP/SCS including a forecast of vehicle miles travelled (VMT). The resulting computer output,

12 known as "vchicle activity files," was then fed into a sccond computer program known as EMFAC,

13 which estimated the GIIG and air quality emissions that would result from the travel activity

14 expeeted, making various assumptions such as the fucl efficiency of the motor vehicle flcct. (FEIR,

15 3-84 - 3-85.) EMFAC currently assumes that California's Advanced Clean Cars (ACC) program

16 and its ZEV mandate will continue to operate, improving average vehicle milcage and reducing air

17 quality and GHG emissions from mobile sources. (CALCOG 1.) Howcver, on September 27, 2019,

18 the U.S. EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) adopted The Safer

19 Affordablo Fuel-Efficient (SAFE) Vehicles Rule Part One: One National Program. (84 Fed.Reg.

20 51310.) The SAFE rule, which became effective on November 26, 2019, withdrew the fedcral

21 waiver previously provided to California that allowed the state to adopt the ACC program and the

22 ZEV mandate, and made it cxplicit that state-level programs to limit or prohibit tailpipe GHG

23 emissions or to establish ZEV mandates are preempted. a As a result, the current version of EMFAC,

24 which assumes that ACC and the ZEV mandate will continue to opcratc in California, was rendered

25 invalid. (CALCOG 1.) The rollback of the ACC program and the ZEV mandate will increase GHIG

26 emissions in California by as much as 15 million mctric tons per year by 2025 and increase the

27 cmission of nitrogen oxides, kcy smog-forming pollutant, 430 tons by 2030. (CALCOG 2.) The

28 ZEV mandatc is an integral part of California's long-term requirements to improve air quality and

Pctition for Writ of Mandate - 8

reduce the state's impact on climate changc. (CARB Fact Sheet 1.) During the public comment

2 period, CCEC advised SACOG that EMFAC was invalid because it forecast emissions based on the

3 assumption that vehicles in California will achieve the higher, California-specific mileage standards,

4 which is no longer the case under the SAFE rule. CCEC further adviscd SACOG that invalidation of

5 the ACC programs and the ZEV mandate will result in increased health risks in the SACOG region

6 due to worse air quality which should be evaluated. SACOG has failed to meet the disclosure

7 requirements of CEQA and the air quality emissions data, the GIIG emissions data, health impact

8 data, the conclusions, and the findings and mitigation based on that data are unsupported.

9 23. Mitigation Measure TRN-1 Infeasible. The mitigation sct forth in the EIR for climate

10 and transportation impacts is vague, unenforceable, and lacks specific performance critcria.

11 Mitigation measure TRN-1, which was incorporated into the climate section as mitigation measure

12 GHG-1, concludes "that additional state policy action and funding would be required" to mitigate

13 impacts and that "the state must initiate these additional actions and funding programs" to further

14 reduce VMT and mitigate the expected impacts. It provides that SACOG will collaborate with other

15 agencies in the policy development proccss. (DEIR 16-54 - 16-55.) SACOG's assertion that

16 additional state action would be required to develop mitigation is unsupported. Morcover, SACOG's

17 findings expressly conclude that mitigation measure TRN-I, as drafted, is speculative and infcasible.

18 (Findings 19, 98.) This does not constitute a credible discussion of climate mitigation. SACOG has

19 failed to set forth feasible mitigation in the EIR. SACOG has failed to comply with CEQA's

20 disclosure requirements. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15126.4.)
21 24. Mitigation Measure TRN-1 Lacks Performance Standard. TRN-I provides that

22 implementing agencies shall comply with state guidance on VMT reductions and identifies a number

23 of project modifications that "would reduce VMT effects in a manner consistent with state

24 guidance.' (DEIR, 16-55.) However, the EIR fails to identify a performance target that the

25 implementing agencies would comply with. Where an agency defers determining the exact content

26 of a mitigation mcasure, the EIR shall identify a performance standard which will be achieved and

27 by which that standard can be achieved. Mitigation mcasure TRN-1 lacks a performance the means

28 standard and is unlawful under CEQA.

• Petition for Writ of Mandate - 9

• 25. Findings. SACOG adopted all of the mitigation measures identified in the EIR.

2 (Findings 22.) However, SACOG's findings concluded that where the implementation of the

3 mitigation measure was within the control and jurisdiction of another agency, SACOG could not

4 determine whether the mitigation would be feasible. (Findings 19.) SACOG concluded that with

5 respect to such mitigation measures, it could not find that the project would mitigate the significant

6 effect under CEQA Guideline § 15091 (a)(1) nor could it find that the implementing agency can and
should adopt the measure under CEQA Guideline § 15091(a)(2). (Findings 19.) SACOG elected for

8 such impacts to make the finding under CEQA Guidelinc 15091(a)(3), which must be
accompanied by a statement of the "specific reasons for rejecting identified mitigation mcasures."

10 (CEQA Guideline, $ 15091(c).) (Findings 19.) Such a finding was not supported. SACOG was

11 authorized and obligated to discuss feasible mitigation and to find that it can and should be adopted

12 by other agencies. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15091(a)(2).) SACOG's conclusion that mitigation was

13 infeasible because it was within the jurisdiction of another agency to implement was unsupported.

14 To the extent that the mitigation measurcs identified in the EIR were infeasible, SACOG failed to

15 comply with its obligation to sct forth feasible mitigation in the EIR. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15126.4.)

16 26. Commercial Solar. CCEC recommended that SACOG facilitate the devclopment of

17 rcnewable energy to offset GHG impacts including the provision of technical support and funding

18 that would allow local agencies to evaluate and require rooftop and parking lot solar gencration.

19 (DEIR 3-56, 3-62.) SACOG responded that Mitigation Measure GHG-2 would require SACOG to

20 work with counties and cities to develop GHG reduction plans. (FEIR, 3-94, 3-103.) Mitigation

21 mcasure G1IG-2 only states that SACOG will work with local agencics to develop GHG-reducing

22 plans and policies which can include a variety of policies including incentivizing the development of

23 renewable energy resources. (FEIR 4-9.) CCEC pointed out to SACOG that measure GHG-2 does

24 not require any action by SACOG that would actually mitigate the GHG impacts of the project.

25 Mitigation measure GHG-2 would leave the specific details of the measure to be developed after

26 project approval. Mitigation measure GHG-2 does not comply with CEQA because nothing

27 demonstrates that it would be impractical or infcasible to includc those details in the BIR and

28 because SACOG has failed to adopt specific performancc standard that the mitigation would

3 ENERGY

4 27. Energy Analysis. Using data from various government data sources, the EIR

5 cstimated total cnergy usage of the entire SACOG region for 2016, brcaking it down by clectrical

6 energy, natural gas, gasoline, and diesel fuel usage. SACOG then forecast regional energy usage for

7 2027, 2035 and 2040. (DIER 8-18 - 8-19.) The analysis of energy included a short statement about

8 typical energy uses (DEIR 8-32) and a table showing that per capita energy consumption in the

9 region is expected to bc lower in 2040 than in 2016 (DEIR 8-33). Based on that, SACOG concluded

10 that the MTP/SCS would not result in any energy impact, defining an encrgy impact as the wasteful,

11 incfficient or unnecessary use of energy. (DEIR 8-33.) When it responded to comments, SACOG

12 added that the declinc in clectricity consumption would be the result of stricter building codes, and

13 the decline in gasoline consumption would result from electrification of the transportation sector.

14 (FEIR 3-95.)

15 28. Scope of Energy Analysis. The scope of the energy analysis is so broad that it

16 provides no useful disclosure concerning the MTP/SCS. CCEC pointed out that an analysis of total

17 regional energy consumption does not address the energy impact of the proposed transportation

18 system investments. (FEIR 3-57.) The project is not every building and transportation facility in the

19 six-county region to be constructed over the ncxt 20 years. The project does not include every

20 public policy and technology innovation that will impact energy consumption in the SACOG region

21 over the ncxt 20 years. The project does not include the energy consumption of every building and

22 transportation structure standing in the region. The project is a specific program of transportation

23 investments. The EIR uses an inaccurate, uncertain and varying project description. The

24 information generated docs not inform the public concerning the impact of the transportation plan

25 that has been proposed. The agency has failed to collect the relevant data and failed to evaluate the

26 potentially significant impact to energy.

27 29. Energy Efficiency Analysis Is Unsupported. As was pointed out above, SACOG

28 concluded that the entirc region, including currently existing homes and buildings, would be energy

Petition for Writ of Mandate - 11

efficient in 2040. That conclusion is clearly erroneous and unsupported. Nothing demonstrates any

2. decline in per capita energy usage in the region over the ncxt twenty ycars. Nothing demonstrates

3 that the region will no longer usc cnergy in an inefficient manner. A varicty of factors impact per

4 capita energy efficiency and may obscure significant inefficiencies. For example, many buildings in

5 the region were built before the adoption of California's building energy efficiency standards. Those

6 older buildings are often very energy inefficient by modern standards, being poorly insulated and
served by inefficient ductwork, lighting, appliances, and HVAC units. It is speculative to conclude
based upon a regional decline in per capita energy usage that the region would become energy

9 efficicnt. Morcover, if there wcre a declinc in per capita energy usage in the region, nothing

10 demonstrates that the transportation investments under the MTP/SCS would be encrgy efficicnt. The

11 conclusion that the investments proposed in the MTP/SCS would be energy efficient is unsupported.

12 30. Modal Analysis. CCEC advised SACOG during the public comment pcriod to

13 address the daily vehicle trips and vehicle miles travelled (VMT) generated by the project and to

14 identify the additional energy consumed per trip for cach mode. (FEIR, 3-57, 3-63.) SACOG
15 rejected that suggestion, asserting that such information was not relevant to the analysis and instead

16 relied on total regional encrgy consumption. (FEIR 3-96, 3-105.) Understanding how the plan

17 affects mode choice is critical to understanding how the plan impacts cncrgy bccause some modes of

18 travel are more energy efficient than others, e.g., transit, cycling, etc. (CEQA Guidelines, App. F, §

19 II.A.5.) The energy analysis is unsupported and fails to comply with the disclosure provisions of

20 CEQA.

21 31. Construction Impacts. CCEC notified SACOG during the public comment period

22 that its analysis of construction energy impacts was insufficient. (FEIR 3-59.) The analysis consists

23 of the statement that as compared to operational energy demand, construction energy demand would

24 be short-term in nature. (DEIR, 8-32.) CCEC pointed out that construction energy usage would

25 extend over the lifetime of the project and that it should be analyzed. (DEIR 3-59.) Neither the

26 assertion that construction cnergy usage would be "short term in naturc" nor the assertion that cncrgy

27 usage in the region is expected to decline on a per capita basis constitutes substantial evidence that

28 cnergy would be used efficiently in the construction of the proposed improvements or that the

Petition for Writ of Mandate - 12

impact would be less than significant on construction energy. The analysis of construction energy

2 falls below CEQA disclosure standards, and the conclusion that there would be no significant impact

3 to construction energy is unsupported.

4 32. Standard of Significance. The EIR describes the threshold of significance for energy

5 impacts as the "wasteful, inefficient or unnecessary consumption of encrgy resources." (DEIR 8-32.)

6 CCEC pointed out during the public comment period that the EIR should define and quantify what

7 that standard means; that without further definition the standard for an energy impact remained

8 hopelcssly subjective, unsupported, and arbitrary; and that using such a standard would result in an

9 EIR that provides no meaningful disclosure of energy impacts. (FEIR 3-59.) SACOG declined to do

10 SO and reiterated that it found the impact less than significant because regional per capita energy

11 consumption would decrease by comparison to baseline conditions. (FEIR 3-97.) The EIR does not

12 include information that would enable the readcr to evaluate the significance of the impacts to

13 energy. SACOG's significance standard-that any amount of reduction in per capita energy usage

14 over the next 20 years demonstrates energy efficiency- is unsupported. The agency's choice of a

15 threshold must be based to the extent possible on scientific and factual data. Selection of a threshold

16 of significance requires an exercise of reasoned judgment. Here the agency fails and refuses to

17 define or discuss what constitutes the wasleful, inefficient or unnecessary consumption of energy.

18 The determination of whether a project may have a significant effect on the environment calls for

19 careful judgment based to the extent possible on scientific and factual data. (CEQA Guidelines, §

20 15064(b).) Without a discussion that enablcs the reader to evaluate the significance of the energy

21 impact, the analysis is meaningless and fails to meet the disclosure requirements of CEQA.

22 33. SAFE Rule. CCEC notified SACOG that California's ZEV mandate and its

23 Advanced Clean Cars program, both of which would require more energy efficient vehicles,

24 demonstrate that more cnergy officient vehicles are technologically feasible. However, under the

25 SAFE Rulc, which was adopted on Scptember 27, 2019, motor vehicics sold in California will no

26 longer be required to comply with the ZEV mandate or with the Advanced Clean Cars programs.

27 (FEIR, 3-57 -3-58.) The roll-back of those two programs under the SAFE Rule is substantial

28 evidence that cars operating in the SACOG region will not be energy efficient. SACOG's EIR fails

Petition for Writ of Mandate - 13

to identify and analyze this substantial evidence of energy inefficiency. The energy analysis states

2 that the EIR does not attempt to characterizc or predict how adoption of the Safer Affordable Fuel

3 Efficient (SAFE) Vehicle Rule or revocation of California's waiver will affect GHG emissions.

4 (DEIR, 8-19.) SACOG should provide a discussion of the impact of SAFE Rule on GHG emissions,
energy conscrvation, air quality emissions, and public health. SACOGs forecast of health effects, air

6 quality emissions, GHG emissions, and encrgy usage-which assumc the continued operation of void
California standards--is speculative and unsupported.
34. Internal Combustion Engines. The total cost of ownership for an electric car is
typically lower than the total cost of ownership for a gasoline powered car. As a result it is cnergy

10 inefficient to operate a gasoline powered car. The EIR should identify and evaluate the proposed

11 plan using gasoline and diesel-powered cars over the duration as a significant adverse impact to

12 cnergy. The impact should bc addressed with feasible mitigation or by a supported statement of

13 overriding considerations. The EIR should address the project's cost-effectiveness in terms of its

14 energy requirements over the project lifetime with attention to how various modes and systems

15 contribute to thosc requirements.

16 35. Per Capita Gasoline Consumption. The energy analysis concludes that the proposed
17 plan would not conflict with state or local plans for renewable energy or cnergy efficiency. (DEIR 8-

18 34.) CCEC pointed out during the public comment period that the EIR shows that over the lifc of

19 the proposed plan, per capita gasoline consumption in the SACOG region will decline only by 5

20 percent, falling from 400 gallons per capita in 2016 to 380 gallons per capita in 2040. (DEIR 8-33.)

21 CCEC advised SACOG that such an outcome was inconsistent with state policy. The Clean Encrgy

22 and Pollution Reduction Act of 2015 (Senate Bill 350) established widespread electrification of the

23 transportation scctor as statewide policy. (ZEV Action Plan, 6.) The Legislature found in SB 350

24 that advanced clean vehiclcs and fuels are needed to reduce petroleum use, to meet air quality

25 standards, to improve public health, and to achieve greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals and

26 that widespread transportation elcctrification is needed to achieve the goals of the Charge Ahead

27 California Initiative. (Pub. Utilitics Code, § 740.12(a)(1).) The goal of the Charge Ahead California

28 Initiative is placing in scrvice at least 1,000,000 zero-cmission and near-zero-cmission yehicles by

ctition for Writ of Mandate - 14

January 1, 2023, and establishing a self-sustaining California market for zero-emission and near-

2 zero-emission vchicles. (Health & Safety Code, § 44258.4.) The 2017 Scoping Plan calls for policy

3 achieving 100 percent ZEV sales in the light-duty vehicle sector. (Scoping Plan, 77.) The EIR's

4 conclusion that the proposed plan would not conflict with state policy including the SB 350 goals for

5 widespread transportation electrification (FEIR 3-100) is unsupported.

6 36. Grid Impacts. The EIR forecasts that under the proposed MTP/SCS plan, the total

7 daily vehicie milcs traveled (VMT) by households in the SACOG region would increase from 42

8 million to 49 million miles. (DEIR, 16-46.) Under the ZEV Action Plan, SB 350, and the 2017

9 Scoping Plan, it is anticipaied that residents would travel a large portion of those miles by electric

10 vehicle. (Pub. Util. Code, §$ 237.5, 701.1, 740.3, 740.8, 740.12, 9621, 9622.) The increased

11 operation of clectric cars and trucks over the lifctime of the MTP/SCS has the potential to impose

12 increased demand on electric generation facilities, clectric transmission infrastructure, energy

13 storage systems, and electric distribution facilities serving the SACOG region. During the public

14 comment period, CCEC notified SACOG that the EIR should address the energy impact of the

15 electrical demand of thousands of new electric vehicles and the potential risk that increased demand

16 will adversely impact electricity demand at times when the grid is under peak load. CCEC notified

17 SACOG that it should recognize that the electricity demand of a largely electrified vehicle flect

18 would be substantial and could impact public policy under SB 100, which calls for increasing zero-

19 carbon content on the grid to 60 percent by 2030 and 100 percent by 2045. CCEC pointed out that

20 the per capita analysis of energy impacts failed to disclose the impact on the regional grid of the

21 gross increase cnergy usage. (FEIR, 3-60 -- 3-61.) SACOG failed to comply with CEQA by not

22 identifying and analyzing the grid impacts of the project, and SACOG's conclusion in the EIR and its

23 finding that energy impacts are less than significant arc not supported by substantial evidence.

24 37. Renewabie Energy. During the public comment period, CCEC notified SACOG that

25 it should evaluate the extent to which the projects and policies included in the MTP/SCS would lead

26 to increased reliance on renewable cnergy resources and the extent to which they would lcad to

27 continued reliance on fossil fuel resources. CCEC suggested breaking down travel by mode and

28 cvaluating the extent to which each modc would rely on renewable energy and the extent to which

Petition for Writ of Mandate - 15

4 the MTP/SCS would foster development of and reliance on more rencwably-powered modes. CCEC

2 urged SACOG to address the extent to which Sacramento RT light rail could be transitioned to 100

3 percent renewable energy. (FEIR 3-62.) SACOG failed to undcrtakc any evaluation of the extent to

4 which the proposed plan would rely on fossil fuels or the extent to which it would use renewable

5 cnergy. SACOG failed to comply with CEQA by not identifying and analyzing the reliance of the

6 proposed plan on renewable energy, and its conclusion and finding that the energy impacts are less

7 than significant are not supported by substantial evidence.

8 38. Vchicle Charging and Fueling. Successful electrification of California's

9 transportation fleet depends on a widesprcad network of charging stations. (TakeCharge, 2.) During

10 the public comment period CCEC pointed out that the energy analysis should consider whether the
11 truck and automobile transportation systems proposed under the MTP/SCS would be accompanied
12 by sufficient electric vchicle charging and hydrogen fueling infrastructure to ensure that the

13 development and operation of new transportation facilities would not be accompanied by an adverse

14 impact to energy and a failure to achicve the region's fare share of eleciric vehicle deployment.

15 (DEIR 3-62.) CCEC urged SACOG to consider the availability of charging facilities for cach mode

16 of transportation and pointed out the lack of recharging and hydrogen fueling for trucks in

17 Sacramento region as well as the persistent lack of sufficient charging facilities at apartments and

18 condominiums. (DEIR 3-63.) SACOG failed to comply with CEQA by not identifying and

19 analyzing the adversc impact on electric vehicle deployment resulting from the implementation of

20 the MTP/SCS without ensuring adequate fuel cell and clectric vehiclc infrastructure. The

21 conclusions and findings that cnergy impacts are less than significant are not supported by

22 substantial evidence. The EIR does not meet the disclosure requirements of CEQA.

23 39. Inefficiency of Cars. CCEC pointed out that there should be a discussion of the

24 energy efficiency of devcloping and operating freeways and surface street systems under the

25 proposed plan as opposed to developing and operating other more encrgy-efficient modes such as

26 transit systems and transportation demand management programs. The considerable rcliance which

27 the plan would place on strects and highways to facilitate single-occupant vehicles should be

28 identified and analyzed as an cnergy inefficient practicc. Whatever the merits of travelling by

Petition for Writ of Mandate - 16

private car may be for the public, cars use vastly more energy per milc of travel than other modes.

2 Private cars are not an cnergy cfficient mode, and the decision to develop and operate large and

3 costly transportation facilities which facilitate travel by private car is not an energy efficient design.

4 The EIR failed to identify and address the significant adverse impacts to encrgy, and SACOG's

5 conclusions and finding that the transportation system (or the region) arc cnergy efficient are not

6 supported.

7 40. Traffic Congestion, CCEC pointed out that there should be an identification and

8 discussion of the significant impact to transportation energy efficiency of allowing unlimited

9 numbers of vchicles to routinely access freway lanes simultaneously at rush hour thereby jamming

10 traffic on the freeway, separatcly from any toll lancs. (FEIR 3-64.) This practice leaves vchicles

11 idling in traffic jams, accelerating and stopping, and generally operating in an energy inefficient

12 manner. Whatever the justification or necessity of this practice may be, it is plainly not an cnergy

13 cfficient practicc (not to mention being a highly inefficient use of public infrastructure investment).

14 This inefficiency should be disclosed to the public and to decisionmakers and discussed. The LIR

15 failed to identify and address this significant adversc impact to energy, and SACOG's conclusion
16 that the transportation system is energy efficient is not supported.

17 41. Transportation Demand Management. CCEC pointed out that the EIR should

18 evaluate the extent to which transportation demand management (TDM) programs have not been

[9 implemented in the region and identify the shortfall as energy inefficient practice. (FEIR Comment

20 6-96.) TDM programs implement cost-effective programs, serviccs, projects and policies that

21 encourage transportation behavior that reduces vehicle trips and VMT. (DEIR 8-23.) SACOG

22 currently provides funding for TDM programs, but the MTP/SCS does not ensure or require that

23 TDM be implemented to the fullest extent feasible, which is an energy inefficient design. The EIR

24 failed 10 identify and address this significant advorse impact to energy, and SACOG's conclusion and

25 finding that the transportation system is cnergy efficient is not supported.

26

27 GOODS MOVEMENT

28 42. Climate and Energy Setting. SACOG was informed that a considerable portion of the

Petition for Writ of Mandate - 17

G11G emissions and energy consumption under the regional plan are the result of freight

2 transportation, which is increasing dramatically due to internet shopping. (FEIR 3-65, 16-19, 16-26.)

3 The EIR recognized that freight vehicle miles travelled in the region are expected to increase by 26

4 percent over the 2016 to 2040 time horizon of the MTP/SCS. (FEIR 3-109.) SACOG was advised

5 during the public comment period that the EIR should discuss the efficicncy of medium and heavy-

6 duty trucking in the plan area. (FEIR 3-65.) Nevertheless, SACOG failed and refused to include

7 such a description in the EIR. (FEIR 3-109.) The failure to address the cfficiency of the freight

8 hauling system as it exists in the SACOG region at the time of the preparation of the EIR was
9 unlawful under CEQA, which requires a discussion of the environmental conditions in the vicinily of

10 the projcct sufficient to give the public and decision makers the most accuratc and understandable

11 picturc practically possiblc of the project's likely impacts. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15125.)

12 43. Impact to Goods Movement, CCEC pointed out that the increase in freight
13 movement under the MTP/SCS would result in a potentially significant increase in energy
14 consumption and GHG emissions and urged SACOG to evaluate the impact on goods movement

15 under the MTP/SCS. (FEIR 3-52, 3-65.) CCEC urged SACOG to consider the energy efficiency of

16 various freight modes and whether the proposed plan implemented efficient freight transportation

17 systems. (FEIR 3-65.) SACOG failed to do so and pointed instead to its analysis of the potential for

18 disruption of goods movement and asserted that reducing automobile travel distances would reduce

19 truck travel distanccs. (FEIR 3-109.) SACOG failed to identify and analyze the impact of increased

20 medium and heavy-duty trucking under the proposed plan.

21 44. Consistency with Scoping Plan. CCEC notified SCOG during the public comment

22 period that its analysis of GHG emissions addressed only cars and light trucks and pointed out thai

23 such an analysis ignores the considcrable GHG emissions that result from goods movement. (FEIR

24 3-52, 3-65.) SACOG's analysis of GIIG cmissions considered whether the proposed MTP/SCS (1)

25 would conflict with SB 375 or (2) would conflict with the 2017 Scoping Plan. Since SB 375 takes

26 into account only emissions from cars and light trucks, the analysis for conflicts with SB 375 does

27 not take into account emission impacts from medium and heavy-duty trucking. (DIER, 8-2 - 8-22.)

28 The second analysis-for conflicts with the 2017 Scoping Plan-repeats the SB 375 analysis and notes

Petition for Writ of Mandate - 18

1 -

2 that the SB 375 target is insufficient to meet the 2017 Scoping Plan goals. (DEIR 8-21 - 8-24.) The

3 second analysis also reports regional GHG emissions for 2016, 2030, 2040 and 2050. (DEIR 8-24.)

4 It notes emissions could "conceivably be reduced" further in future ycars, that the 2017 Scoping Plan

5 does not cover the same time period as the MTP/SCS, and that future projects would be subject to

6 energy codes. It concludes that the impact is potentially significant because the MTP/SCS may

7 interfere with the climate goals of the 2017 Scoping Plan. (DEIR 8-24 -- 8-25.) The discussion does

8 not amount to an analysis of consistency with the 2017 Scoping Plan nor does it analyze GHG
emissions from trucking. Nothing from the 2017 Scoping Plan is cited showing that operational

10 emissions from the project would be consistent with the 2017 Scoping Plan. Nothing demonstrates

11 that compliance with that plan would render emissions less than significant. Such an analysis fails to

12 comply with CEQA. The California Legislature has recognized that GHG emissions are a severe a

13 threat to the public health and well-being and SACOG is reporting a failurc to meet state targets. A

14 bare conclusion that an impact is significant without an explanation of its factual and analytical basis
fails to meet the information disclosure requirements of CEQA.

15

16 45. Consistency with Statewide Goals. According to the California Sustainable Freight

17 Action Plan, reducing cmissions in the freight sector is "critical" to meeting the SB 32 and 2017

18 Scoping Plan goal of rcducing statewide GHG emissions to at least 40 percent below 1990 levels by

19 2030. (Sustainable Freight Action Plan I.) CCEC advised SACOG that it should evaluate the

20 consistency of the MTP/SCS with statewide goals for freight efficiency. (FEIR 3-65.) SACOG

21 responded that its analysis showed a reduction of travel distances for cars and that therefore the

22 MTP/SCS would reduce travel distances for trucking and was consistent with state plans. However,

23 SACOG forecasts a 23 percent increase in dicsel fuel consumption over the life of the plan-

8 (DEIR 8-9.) Moreover, SACOG forccasts a 57 percent increase in per capita diesel fuel
consumption over the lifc of the MTP/SCS. (DEIR 8-33.) That data demonstrates a significant

10 conflict with SB 32, which calls for a reduction of statewidc GHG emissions to at least 40 perccnt

11 below 1990 lcvels by 2030. It demonstrates a conflict with the Sustainable Freight Action Plan,

12 adopted in July, 2016, which calls for transporting freight with zero-emission cquipment everywhere

13 feasible and near-zcro cmission equipment everywhere clse. (Sustainable Freight Action Plan 8.) lt

14 conflicts with the 2017 Scoping Plan, which calls for accelerated use of clean vchicle equipment and

15 fuels in the freight sector. (Scoping Plan 77.) SACOG has violated CEQA by failing to include a

16 detailed discussion of the potentially significant adverse impacts on energy and climate. (Pub.

17 Rcsources Code, $ 21100(b)(1).) An EIR must demonstrate that the potentially significant

18 environmental impacts werc adequately investigated and discussed. (CEQA Guidelincs, 85

19 15125(c).) SACOG's conclusions and findings are not supported by substantial evidence.

20 46. Logistics Sprawl. During the public comment period, CCEC pointed out that the

21 location of warchousing and online fulfillment centers in the region will influence the distances that

22 trucks travel 1o delivor goods to commercial sites and to consumers within the region. Optimizing

23 the location of warchousing requires long-term planning that Jocates warehouse zoning where it

24 rcduces the distance which freight must be shipped. (DEIR 3-65 - 3-66.) Reducing shipping

25 distances is essential to mitigating GHG emissions. The plan is cnergy inefficient because it fails to

26 plan warchousc locations. Without affirmative land usC and transportation planning, new

27 warehouses and fulfillment centers will be pushed to locate on the urban periphery where large

28 parceis and lower land prices will bc available. This tendency, commonly reforred to as logistics
sprawl, over time results in an over-extended and inefficient froight transportation network where

etition for Writ of Mandate - 20

- goods must be hauled greater distances, a freight network that is not efficiently interconnccted with

2 other freight modes, and overall a less efficient transportation system. CCEC recommended that

3 warehouse locations be discussed and recommended to implementing to cities and counties to foster

4 an cfficient freight delivery system and mitigate adverse impacts to climate and air quality. The

5 proposed plan is inconsistent with the 2017 Scoping Plan and with the California Sustainable Freight

6 Action Plan, which call for planning of modern freight corridors, reduced air quality emissions, and

7 an accclcrated transition to a more efficient and less polluting transportation system. SACOG failed

8 to comply with CEQA by failing to identify and analyze potentially significant adverse impacts to

9 energy. The EIR failed include a detailed statement setting forth feasible mitigation to minimize the

10 significant GHG and transportation impacts of the MTP/SCS.

11 47. Logistics Parks. Logistic parks are intermodal freight hubs that anchor distribution

12 centers and allow freight rail and trucking companies to partner and provide streamlined and

13 efficient supply chain solutions. Warehouses located in logistic parks substantially lower

14 transportation costs as well as reducing fucl costs, VMT, congestion, and carbon emissions. CCEC

15 recommended that the EIR recommend geographic areas that could be zoned for logistic parks to

16 mitigate project impacts. The EIR failed include a detailed statement setting forth mitigation to

17 minimize the significant effects on the environment.

18 48. Transit Pass Subsidies. CCEC recommended that the EIR provide for reduced farc

19 transit passes to mitigate the significant impacts to transportation and GHG emissions. (FEIR 3-67.)

20 Reducing or climinating transit fares would increase transit mode share, reducc VMT, and mitigate

21 GHG impacts. CCEC further rccommended that the EIR address increased funding for programs of

22 the Sacramento Transportation Management Association as mitigation for the impacts. SACOG

23 responded that transit pass subsidies were included in mitigation measure TRN-1. (FEIR 3-111.) As

24 discussed above, under CEQA that measure is unlawful as drafted. The EIR failed include a detailed

25 statement setting forth feasible mitigation to minimize the significant effects on the environment.

26 49. Amtrak Scrvicc to Lake Tahoe. CCEC notified SACOG that the EIR should address

27 Amtrak servicc to Lakc Tahoe as mitigation for project impacts, including impacts to transportation

28 and GHG emissions. There is frequently congested traffic at various locations on 1-80 between

Petition for Writ of Mandate - 21

Davis and Truckce. Those conditions will become worse with population growth over the timeframe

2 projected in the MTP/SCS. They could be alleviated in part through increased use of Amtrak service

3 along that route. Many resorts at Lake Tahoc have shuttle service that could cover the last mile and

4 would support Amtrak servicc during the travel season. State Route 89 south of Truckec and State

5 Route 267 south of Truckee arc both within the SACOG region and experience considerable traffic

6 congestion that could be reduced if fewer visitors came by car. The EIR failed include a detailed
statement setting forth mitigation to minimize the significant effects on GHG cmissions, air quality,

8 health, and transportation.

10 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

11 (Failure to Comply with CEQA)

12 50. Petitioners incorporate by reference each and cvery allegation sct forth abovc.

13 51. CEQA requires that lead agencies prepare an EIR that complics with the requirements

14 of the statute. The lcad agency must also provide for public revicw and comment on the project and

15 the associated environmental documentation. An EIR must providc sufficient environmental

16 analysis such that decision-makers can intelligently consider environmental consequences when

17 acting on the proposed project.

18 52. Respondent violated CEQA by certifying an EIR for the project that is inadequate and

19 fails to comply with CEQA and approving the project on that basis. Among other things,

20 respondent:

21 a. Relied upon an inaccurate and unstable description of the projcct and the project

22 setting;

23 b. Failed to adcquately disclose and analyze the project's significant environmental

24 impacts including but not limited to the project's impacts on climate, air quality,

25 health, transportation and cnergy;

26 C, Failed to provide a consistent and appropriate environmental bascline for analysis

27 of the project's environmental impacts;

28 d. Failed to adequately analyze the significant cumulative impacts of the project;

Pctition for Writ of Mandate - 22

c. Improperly deferred impact analysis and mitigation measures:

2 f. Failed to discuss potentially feasible mitigation measures; and

g. Failed to adopt and make cnforceable fcasible mitigation for project impacts.

4 a 53. As a result of the foregoing defects, respondent prejudicially abused its discrction by

5 certifying an EIR that does not comply with CEQA, by adopting unsupported and erroneous

6 conclusions, and by approving the project in reliance thereon. Accordingly, respondent's
certification of the EIR and approval of the project must be set aside.

9 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

10 (Inadequate Findings)

11 54. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference each and cvery allegation set forth above.

12 55. CEQA requires that a lead agency's findings for the approval of a project be

13 supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record. CEQA further requires that a lead

14 agency provide an explanation of how evidence in the record supports the conclusions the agency
15 has reached.

16 56. Respondent violated CEQA by adopting findings that are inadequate a as a matter of

17 law in that they are not supported by substantial evidence in the record, including, but not limited to

18 the following:

19 a. The determination that certain impacts would be less than significant and/or that

20 adopted mitigation measures would avoid or lessen the project's significant effects on

21 the environment;

22 b. The determination that certain mitigation was infeasible;

23 C. The determination that overriding economic, legal, social, technological, or other

24 benefits of the project outwcighed its significant impacts on the environment.

25 57. As a result of the forgoing defects, respondent prejudicially abused its discretion by

26 adopting findings that do not comply with the requirements of CEQA and approving the project in

27 reliance thereon. The findings do not provide adequate reasoning or the analytic route from facts to

28 conclusions. The findings of fact and statement of overriding considcrations arc not supported by

2 substantial evidence in the record. As a result of the forcgoing defccts, respondent has prejudicially

3 abuscd its discrction by cortifying an EIR that does not comply with the requirements of CEQA and
precluded informed decision-making. Accordingly, the agency's certification of the EIR and
approval of the project must be set aside.

6 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

7 (Failure to Recirculate the EIR)

8

C 58. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference each and every allegation set forth above.

10 59. CEQA requires that if significant now information is added to an EIR after a draft

11 EIR is prepared, but before certification of the final EIR, the BIR must be recirculated for public
revicw and comment.

12

13 60. Comments submitted to respondent after the draft EIR was circulated provided

14 significant new information within the meaning of Public Resources Code section 21092.1 and

15 CEQA Guidelines scction 15088.5 including, but not limited to, information about greenhouse gas

16 cmissions, cnergy conservation, and feasible mitigation for project impacts.

17 61. Despite the availability of this significant now information, respondent failed to

18 recirculate the EIR, or any portion of the EIR. As a result of respondent's failure to recirculate the

19 EIR, the public and other public agencies were deprived of any meaningful opportunity to review

20 and comment on the project, its substantial adverse environmental consequences, and the new
information regarding other unanalyzed environmental effects of the project.

21

22 62. Respondent's failure to recirculate the EIR is not supported by substantial cvidence
and represents a failure to proceed in the manner required by law.

23 WHEREFORE, petitioner respectfully requests the following relief:

24 1. An alternative and a percmptory writ of mandate commanding that:

25

26 a. Respondent vacatc and sct aside its certification of the EIR, approval of the

27 projcct and the related approval of the Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Plan,

28 b. Respondent withdraw the notice of determination;
