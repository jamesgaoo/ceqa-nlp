INCLUSIVE Date Action Filed: December 13, 2018
Trial Date:

1. Petitioner Plaintiff Marc Bruno, an individual residing in San
Francisco, and Save North Beach, a non-profit association, hereby petition
this Court under California Code of Civil Procedure ("CCP") Section 1094.5
for issuance of a Writ of Administrative Mandamus to Respondent City and
County of an Francisco ("City" or "CCSF"), Respondent Board of
Supervisors for the City and County of San Francisco ("Board"), et al..

1

2. Petitioners intend to show that Respondent - Defendants' reports, plans, investigations and statements to the Board of Supervisors and to the Recreation and Parks Commission and to the Historic Preservation Commission conclusively prove that approval of the CEQA Categorical Exemption Determination proposed by the San Francisco Planning Department for the Washington Square Water Conservation Project (2018- 003700PJR) and issuance of such categorical exemption illegally exempts the Project from review under the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Pub. Res. Code ("PRC") § 21000, et seq.

3. Petitioner Plaintiff allege that the most rudimentary public disclosure
requirements under CEQA and under local, state and national environmental
ordinances will be violated should the Categorical Exemption at-issue here not be
set aside.

Petitioners ask the Court to also take notice that should underlying project be
permitted to move forward the taxpayers of San Francisco shall be asked to pay
$3.05 million for a project that by the City's own reports may be done for less than
$200,000.

4. Petitioner Plaintiffs further allege that the City's Ethics Code and the Political
Reform Act of 1974 (a.k.a. the California Governmental Conduct Code) shall be

2

violated should the Board of Supervisors' decision to uphold the Categorical
Exemption not be overturned by this court, due to a conflict of interest on the part
of some government officials that lobbied for the project before the Board.

5. Petitioner Plaintiff also notes that should the project be allowed to proceed,
incalculable damage shall be done to the businesses of North Beach, businesses
that already are suffering the consequences of recent fires and other impediments
in the neighborhood.

PARTIES

6. Petitioner Marc Bruno, an individual citizen residing in San Francisco, has
lived at his current address in North Beach since April, 1986. He is a community
organizer who regularly works with the homeless and poor.

7. Petitioner Save North Beach is a non-profit association for which corporate
501(c)(4) status is pending. Members of the organization live in, work in, own
property in and/or own a business or business-es in the Telegraph Hill North
Beach Special Use District and San Francisco Supervisorial District 3. The
organization is dedicated to preserving the cultural wealth and environmental
integrity of the neighborhood by serving the poorest of the poor and by serving

3

those who face eviction from their apartments and homes. The organization also
serves a as a policy forum in favor of environmental justice.

8. The CCSF, at all times pertinent herein, was and is a municipal corporation
organized and existing under the laws of the State of California and the municipal

charter.

9. The Board of Supervisors, at all times pertinent herein, was and is now a legally
constituted body of the CCSF organized under Article 2 of the City Charter.
Pursuant to § 21151(c) of the Public Resources Code, CEQA Guidelines
§§15061(e) and 15704(f), the Board as the duly decision making body and acting
in quasi-judicial capacity, is responsible for hearing and acting on appeals
challenging the issuance of an approved Categorical Exemption.

10. The Recreation and Parks Department for the City and County of San
Francisco, was and is now a legally constituted body of the CCSF duly organized
under the City Charter.

11. The Planning Department for the City and County of San Francisco, was and
is now a legally constituted body of the CCSF duly organized under the City

Charter.

12. Petitioner is ignorant of the true names and capacities of DOES I through XX,
inclusive, and of the true names and capacities of ROES I through XX, inclusive,
and therefore sues said Respondents by such fictitious names. Petitioner will
amend this Petition to allege their true names and capacities when ascertained.

4

JURISDICTION
13. This court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to § 1094.5 of the
California Code of Civil Procedure.

14. Venue is proper because the Respondents and the proposed Project Site are
located in the City and County of San Francisco.

STANDING
15. Petitioner Plaintiff Marc Bruno, an individual citizen residing in San
Francisco, is a "person" entitled to file an action under CEQA. "Person" includes
any person, firm, association, organization, partnership, business, trust,
corporation, and limited liability company. (CEQA Guidelines § 15376).

16. Petitioner Save North Beach, a non-profit association doing business in North
Beach, is a "person" entitled to file an action under CEQA. "Person" includes any
person, firm, association, organization, partnership, business, trust, corporation
and limited liability company. (CEQA Guidelines § 15376).

17. There is an accepted public policy in this state, encouraged by elected
officials, administrative agencies and the courts "guaranteeing citizens the
opportunity to ensure that no governmental body impairs or defeats the purpose
of legislation establishing a public right." (Green v. Obledo (1981) 29 Cal.3d
126, 144.)

5

18. The "basic purposes of CEQA" include the following, according to CEQA
Guidelines §15002:

A. Inform government decision-makers and the public about the potential,
significant environmental effects of proposed activities.
B. Identify the ways environmental damage can be avoided or reduced.
C. Prevent significant, avoidable damage to the environment by requiring
changes in projects through the use of alternatives or mitigation measures when
the governmental agency finds the changes to be feasible.
D. Disclose to the public the reasons why a governmental agency approved a
project in the manner the agency chose if significant environmental effects are
involved.

19. The question in this action is one of public right and sound public policy.
20. Petitioners are an interested self-identified group of citizens and an
individual citizen committed to having public laws including CEQA properly
executed.

21. Petitioners are interested as an association of citizens and taxpayers, and as an
individual citizen and taxpayer, in having all public resources including those
designated for this project properly used and not wasted.

22. Petitioners have a genuine and continuing interest in and concern for the
environment, including the effect on the environment of governmental activities
such as those from which Petitioners seek relief in this action.

6

23. Petitioner Plaintiff Marc Bruno has standing as an individual to bring this
action, because the interests of the Petitioner are adversely affected by the
governmental decisions and actions from which relief is requested.

24. Prosecution of this action as a citizen's suit by Petitioner does not conflict with
other competing legislative or public policies.

25. Petitioners complied with Public Resource Code §§ 21177(a) and (b) by filing
the Objections herein attached. (Exhibit B)

26. Based on the foregoing, Petitioners have standing.

STATEMENT OF FACTS

27. Pursuant to California Public Resources Code § 2166(c) and § Title XIV
of the California Code of Regulations, § 15162, Respondents are requested
to produce a supplemental and subsequent Environmental Impact Report.

As Respondents are proceeding with the project based on a defective EIR
that has never been fully vetted by the citizens most directly affected by the
impact of the project, Respondents also are requested to produce a
programmatic or "Master" EIR.

28. Petitioner Plaintiffs face on-going and permanent harm should
Respondents be permitted to move forward with their project in North

7

Beach. Petitioners do not have a plain, speedy and adequate remedy at law
other than to prey for injunctive relief and the other remedied requested
herein.

In addition, the following facts regarding the Respondents' defective CEQA
Categorical Exemption are alleged:

"Per San Francisco Administrative Code §31.16(e)(1), this Appeal of C.E. 2018-
003700PRJ, consequent to the proposed closure of Washington Square, a park ftn San
Francisco, California and a "known a Historic resource" located at Block Lot 1020001, is
hereby submitted to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors.
The at-issue Categorical Exemption ("C.E.") was inadequately researched and
inadequately promulgated, offering no opportunity until this appeal for those members of
the public most likely to be affected by the underlying project to suggest changes or
otherwise comment on it. The conclusions drawn in the C.E. are flawed, and those flawed
conclusions are detrimental to the very reasons given by the City for its so-called
"conservancy project." Bruno & Macchiarini Appeal to the Board of Supervisors

EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES, TIMELINESS
29. Pursuant to Public Resource Code §§ 21177 (a) and (b), Petitioner has
exhausted his administrative remedies.

30. Furthermore, the failure to disclose significant information, known to the
Respondent Planning Department and Respondent Board of Appeals, withheld
from the public, may only be remedied by now permitting the Petitioner Plaintiffs
to sue on behalf of the public to remedy the harm caused by such non-disclosure,
as noted herein.

8

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

31. Board of Supervisors Motion M18-156, upholding the above referenced
Categorical Exemption mischaracterizes the proposed permit application that
is cited in the Motion. It also fails to take into account the detrimental effects
such construction project as described in the "Washington Square Water
Conservattion Project" shall have on the environement, the culture, and
residents of North Beach.

32. By mischaracterizing the nature of he work proposed for the project, the
Board of Supervisors misunderstood the outright contradiction between the
proposed project and their own legislative mandate prohibiting excessive
harm to the environment.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

33. WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for all of the following:
A. A judgment that the so-called Washington Square Water Conservation Project
shall not proceed until this court or an administrative body assigned by this court
shall examine a less envromentally harmful alternative to acheive the same water
conservation goal set forth in the Project; namely, 2/3 of the water currently used
to irrigate the park;

B. A judgment that the so-called Washington Square Water Conservation Project
shall not proceed until this court or an administrative body assigned by this court

9

shall examine a less financially costly alternative to acheive water conservation
goals set forth in the Project;

C. A peremptory writ of mandate directing Respondents to set aside all
decisions and actions corresponding to the Categorical Exemption;

D. A peremptory writ of mandate directing Respondents to set aside all
decisions and actions corresponding to the Categorical Exemption;

E. A preliminary injunction prohibiting the Respondents from executing those
actions, including but not limited to removal of all soil from the City park at Block
Lot Number 102/0001, otherwise known as "Washington Square."
F. An administrative stay order, temporary restraining order, and/or preliminary
injunction enjoining the Respondents, and the Real Parties in Interest, and their
agents and employees from any and all physical actions in furtherance of the
project;

G. Costs of this action;

H. Attorneys' Fees;

I. For other such relief as the Court may deem just and proper.
