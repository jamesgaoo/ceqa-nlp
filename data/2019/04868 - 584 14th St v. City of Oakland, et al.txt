PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 Petitioner and Plaintiff 584 14th Street, LLC, by and through its attorneys, Zacks,
2 Freedman & Patterson, PC, alleges as follows:
GENERAL ALLEGATIONS 3

4 1. Petitioner and Plaintiff 584 14th Street, LLC (*Petitioner") is a Delaware a

5 limited liability company, registered in the State of California. Petitioner is the owner of

6 the real property commonly known as the Sutter Hotel, situated at 584-588 14th Street,

7 Oakland (the "Property"). The Property is located within Alameda County.

8 2. The Property consists of a pre-1960 building located in the Downtown

9 Oakland area.

Dd 'NOSHALIVI NVWAATHJ 'SXOVZ 10 3. Respondent and Defendant City of Oakland (the "City") is and at all
11 +01+6 VINOHITVO *ODSIONVAH NVS 00 ALINS 'LAEALS AUEIWODINON SEZ relevant times was a political and legal subdivision of the State of California, duly

12 organized and existing under and pursuant to the laws of the State of California and its
13 own Charter.

14 4. Respondent and Defendant Oakland City Council (the "Council") is, and
15 at all relevant times was, inter alia, the duly organized legislative body of the City
16 existing under and by virtue of the laws of the State of California and the City's
17 Charter. The Board is, and at relevant times was, the local body charged with
18 proposing, drafting, amending and passing legislation governing land use and the City's
19 municipal affairs, subject to, and in a manner complying with, all applicable federal,
20 state, and local law.
21 5. Respondent and Defendant City of Oakland Planning and Building
22 Department is an administrative agency of the City, charged with administering the
23 Oakland Planning Code and the Amendments (as defined infra). The City, Council, and
24 City of Oakland Planning and Building Department are referred to herein collectively
25 as "Respondents."

26 6. Venue is proper in this Court because the entire controversy occurred in
27 this jurisdiction.

28

-2:
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

P 7. This action challenges the approval by the City of an ordinance (File No.

2 18-0963, Ordinance No. 13509) amending the Oakland Planning Code in a number of a

3 material respects (the "Amendments"), which ordinance was finally passed by the

4 Council on December 4, 2018. On December 10, 2018, the City filed a CEQA Notice

about the loss of 5 of Determination and Notice of Exemption with the Alameda County Clerk.
response to concerns 8. The Amendments were enacted in 6

7 Residential Hotel units in the City, and they impose unprecedented restrictions on the

8 rights of owners of businesses deemed Residential Hotels to operate their businesses.

9. Prior to the Amendments, the Oakland Planning Code allowed

10 Residential Hotel owners to rent rooms to individuals who have another, primary

00Y ALINS 'IGEIS ANIWODLNOW SEZ Id 'NOSHALIVI  NVWAHIN! 'SYOVZ 11 residence, and to rent rooms on a weekly basis. The Amendments fundamentally +OT+6 VINIONIIVO *ODSIONVAH NVS 12 change this lawful business model into something different and substantially less
13 profitable. a The Amendments redefine a Residential Hotel as a building containing guest
14 rooms that are, inter alia, "intended or designed to be used, or which are used, rented, or
15 hired out, to be occupied, or which are occupied, for sleeping purposes by guests, which
16 is also the primary residence of those guests . . . ."
17 10. The Amendments terminate Residential Hotel Owners' right to engage in

18 their existing business model. In particular, the Amendments:
19 a. Ban Residential Hotel owners from renting rooms to individuals who

20 have another, primary residence, and

21 b. Restrict the ability of Residential Hotel owners to freely sell their
22 properties.

23 11. The Amendments single out the owners of pre-1960 Residential Hotels in

24 the Downtown area for disparate treatment not accorded to similarly situated property
25 owners, including owners of residential hotels that were built after 1960, residential
26 hotels located outside the Downtown area, and hotels and motels renting rooms to low-

27 income occupants for residential use.
28

-3-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 12. Despite the fact that the Amendments constituted a discretionary project,

2 substantially rezoning the City and affecting the use and occupancy of land and

3 structures (including, but not limited to, the Property), and having the potential for

4 reasonably foreseeable and potentially significant adverse physical changes to the

5 environment, the City enacted the Amendments without undertaking the environmental

6 review required by the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"; Pub.

7 Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.) and its implementing CEQA Guidelines (14 Cal.
8 Code Regs, § 15000 et seq.).

9 13: The City's enactment of the Amendments also facially, and without
Dd 'NOSHELIVIY NVWAIHIIH 'SYOVZ 10 legally adequate notice, effected a taking without compensation of valuable vested
11 VOTV6 VINMONIIVO *ODSIONVMH NVS 00+ ELINS 'LHHAIS ANEWOSINOI SET property rights including, but not limited to, existing rights and uses long permitted
12 under the Planning Code prior to the Amendments, all in violation of substantive and
13 procedural due process protections, equal protection, and the takings clauses of the
14 federal and state constitutions. (U.S. Const. 5th Amend.; Cal. Const. Art. I, § 19.)

15 14. Although Respondents informed Petitioner in a January 4, 2019 letter that
16 Petitioner's proposed Renovation Project is not subject to the Amendments,
17 Respondents' letter states that "the property itself, the Sutter Hotel, and any new
18 projects at this property are still subject to the [Amendments]." (Emph. original.)
19 15. Petitioner brings this action inter alia as a private attorney general to

20 vindicate its legal and constitutional rights and those of other City residents and

21 property owners.

22 16. The City's actions described herein and the Amendments are unlawful,

23 invalid, and unenforceable. Petitioner therefore requests that this Court issue a writ of
24 mandate invalidating the Amendments and declaring them, and any actions taken
25 thereunder or pursuant thereto, unlawful, null, and void. Petitioner also seeks
26 declaratory relief regarding the parties' respective legal rights and obligations and
27 temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief prohibiting enforcement of the
28 Amendments in any manner.

-4-
PETITION FÖR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

P 17. An actual and substantial controversy exists between the parties, relating

2 to the legal rights of the respective parties. The controversy is well-defined and

3 imminent in nature, such that the need for, and appropriateness of, judicial

4 determinations at this time is warranted.

5 18. Petitioner has no adequate remedy at law for the violations and conduct

6 described herein, which threaten to deprive it of lawful, long-standing, and vested

7 property rights, including Petitioner's operation of its existing, lawful business, which
8 necessarily includes renting rooms to individuals who have another, primary residence.

Respondents)
POLTG VINOULIVO *OOSIONVAH NVS 00+ HLINS 'LHENLIS ANIWODINON SEZ Id 'NOSHALIVI NVWIHII 'SNOVZ 11
19. Petitioner incorporates the above allegations as if set forth fully herein. 12
20. The City failed to complete proper review of the Amendments under the 13
14 California Environmental Quality Act, Pub. Res. Code § 21000 et seq. ("CEQA"),

15 including an analysis of the urban decay and blight that will likely result from a land-

16 use restriction limiting the routine maintenance and upgrade of Residential Hotel

17 facilities.

21. Section 8 of the Amendments found "that the potential environmental 18

19 effects of the actions authorized by this ordinance fall within the scope of a number of

20 previously adopted California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) documents . . . ."

21 Yet none of the cited CEQA documents considered "the potential environmental

22 effects" of the proposed Amendments or of substantially similar restrictions. The

23 Amendments are an unprecedented restriction on the use of land in Oakland, and their

24 impacts must be studied.
22. Notwithstanding its acknowledgment of "potential environmental 25

26 effects," Section 8 also contradictorily claimed an exemption asserting that the

27 Amendments are "not a project" for CEQA purposes, "as [the proposed ordinance] is a

28 municipal code revision that does not involve any commitment to a specific project,"

-5-

F and "there is no possibility that the activity in question may have a significant effect on

2 the environment."

4 future building permits would be required, environmental review must be undertaken 23. Where zoning amendments.do not authorize any particular project, but

before the ordinance is adopted. Rosenthal v. Bd. of Supervisors (1975) 44. Cal.App.3d

6 815.

7 Furthermore, zoning ordinances like the Amendments are "projects" as a

8 matter of law for CEQA purposes because they authorize changes in the use of land. 24.

9 (Rosenthal, supra, 44 Cal.App.3d at 824; Pub. Res. Code § 21065; see Rominger v.

10 County of Colusa (2014) 229 Cal.App.4th 690.) They cannot escape review simply
00+ ELINS 'IHENIS ANIWOSLNOW SEZ 11 because future projects might have their own effects: "[T]he 'significant effect on the †OL+6 VINHOUIIVO *OOSIONYAH NVS DI 'NOSHALIVI Y NVWIANII 'SNOVZ 12 environment' to which section 21151 refers is the effect to which enactment of the

13 ordinance amendment may ultimately lead, not the de minimis effect of the
14 'governmental paper-shuffling' which mere enactment of an ordinance entails."
(Heninger v. Bd. of Supervisors (1986) 186 Cal.App.3d 601, 606-07, emph. added;
16 accord City of Carmel-By-The-Sea V. Board of Supervisors (1986) 183 Cal.App.3d 15

17 229) "CEQA cannot be avoided by chopping up proposed projects into bite-size pieces
18 which, when taken individually, may have no significant adverse effect.
19 This is doubly true when dealing with Amendments such as these, where
20 the proposed zoning ordinance prohibits rather than authorizes future development. The 25.

21 prohibition of future projects means that there will be no future building permits subject
22 to CEQA review; the CEQA review must take place now, during consideration of the
23 Amendments, or else the environmental impacts will escape review.

24 26. The proposed Amendments are a project because they "may cause either a
25 direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foresecable indirect physical
26 change in the environment." (Pub. Res. Code § 21065.) By prohibiting reasonable
27 upgrades and reconfigurations of Residential Hotels in order to increase quality of life
28 and desirability and maintain financial viability, the Amendments remove the economic

-6-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

capacity for Oakland's Residential Hotels to afford necessary life-safety and code-

2 compliance upgrades.

3 27. As evidenced by an economist's report presented to the Council,
Oakland's Residential Hotels rely on the ability to upgrade their facilities to finance
5 necessary capital improvements. Without that ability, Residential Hotels will be forced 4

to close, causing significant blight and urban decay. Importantly, under the
7 Amendments' terms, there is no viable way to lawfully convert a Residential Hotel to 6

8 any other use, as the following prerequisite is imposed:
9 Add to the City's housing supply replacement Residential Hotel rental units that are affordable to extremely low or 10 very low income households, as those terms are defined in
00 ELINS 'IEENIS NEWOD.LNON SET Id 'NOSHALLVIY NVNIHINI 'SNOVZ 11 California Health and Safety Code Sections 50079.5, 50093, +0IT6 VINHONIIVO *ODSIONVAH NVS 50105 and 50106, and equivalent in number, size, services 12 and facilities offered to each Residential Hotel unit
c proposed for Demolition or Conversion, and within two (2) miles of the subject facility, that must obtain a certificate of 14 occupancy for such new Residential Hotel units prior to the proposed Demolition or Conversion taking place. 15
(Amendments § 17.153.050(A).) 16
28. In other words, a Residential Hotel's owner must first build a new a 17

18 Residential Hotel in order to qualify for conditional use authorization to convert an
existing, economically infeasible Residential Hotel to another use. The owner must 19

20 purchase or build a code-compliant (higher cost) building in order to convert a

21 noncompliant (lower cost) building to an economically viable use. This would deprive
the owner of substantially all economic value of the property, which means that such 22

23 properties will be abandoned. The results will be blight and urban decay.
29. Further, the City's notice of the November 27 hearing was fatally 24

25 defective. The City's Charter requires an item on the agenda to be "sufficiently clear

26 and specific to alert a person of average intelligence and education whose interests are

27 affected by the item that he or she may have reason to attend the meeting or seek more
information on the item." (Oakland Charter, Sec. 2.20, Art. II, § 2.20.030.) §
28

-7-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

P 30. The agendized notice for the November 27, 2018 meeting stated, in its

2 entirety:
Recommendation: Conduct A Public Hearing And Upon 3 Conclusion Adopt An Ordinance (1) Amending The
4 Oakland Planning Code To Adopt A New Section 17.153 Regulating The Demolition, Conversion And Rehabilitation 5 Of Residential Hotels And Make Related And Conforming
6 Amendments To Other Planning Code Sections, And (2) Determining That The Actions Authorized By This
7 Ordinance Were Both The Subject Of Adequate Previous
8 Analysis Under The California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") And Are Exempt From CEQA Pursuant To 9 CEQA Guidelines Sections 15061(B)(3) And 15183
10 31. This description was not "sufficiently clear and specific." To wit, the
11 †OT+6 VINNOJIIVO 'OOSIONVAH NVS 00+ ELLINS 'LHELIS ANEWODINON SEZ II 'NOSHALIVI  NVWCHTHH 'SXOVZ description states that there was previous analysis of the actions authorized by the
12 Amendments under CEQA and that these actions are not subject to CEQA. This is
13 contradictory and confusing. If there are potential environmental impacts subject to
14 study under CEQA, then the Amendments could not be exempt from CEQA.
15 32. Moreover, the description did not mention that an entire category of
16 existing lawful business - the rental of rooms to individuals who have another, primary
17 residence - would be eliminated by the proposed Amendments, nor does the description
18 mention that a Residential Hotel conversion to another use would be prohibited unless
19 the owner builds (or buys and converts) another, new Residential Hotel in the vicinity,
20 at extraordinary expense. These changes to the Planning Code, among others in the
21 Amendments, go far beyond merely "regulating" Residential Hotels.
22 33. While no exhaustion of administrative remedies is required by CEQA to
23 challenge the Amendments here, due to the legally-inadequate and defective public
24 notices provided by Respondents (Pub. § Resources Code, § 21177(e); see, Defend Our
25 Waterfront v. State Lands Com. (2015) 240 Cal.App.4th 570, 582-586), Petitioner has
26 nonetheless exhausted all administrative remedies made available to them to address
27 Respondents' unlawful conduct to the extent required. Petitioner has no plain, speedy,
28 and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law to challenge the Amendments, and a

-8-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

r writ of ordinary mandamus under Code of Civil Procedure § 1085 is the prescribed

2 remedy for violations of this type.

3 34. Petitioner is filing and serving on Respondents herewith its election to

4 prepare the administrative record pursuant to Public Resources Code § 21167(b)(2) and

5 all other applicable laws. Petitioner has also performed all other conditions precedent

6 to issuance of a writ of mandate, including service of written notice of the

7 commencement of this action on Respondents in accordance with the requirements of
8 Public Resources Code § 21167.5, and mailed service of the petition on the California

9 Attorney General concurrently with its filing (see Code Civ. Proc., § 388).

13 35. Petitioner incorporates the above allegations as if set forth fully herein.
14 36. Petitioner brings this cause of action pursuant to the takings clause of
15 Article I, Section 19, of the California Constitution.
16 37. The California Constitution prohibits the government from taking or

17 damaging private property for the public use unless just compensation is paid.
18 38. When a government entity eliminates an otherwise lawful nonconforming
19 use, it may only do so by providing just compensation or a reasonable amortization
20 period.
21 39. Petitioner has beneficial interests that have been, and will further be,
severely injured and adversely affected if the Amendments are not set aside and
23 invalidated, if Respondents' decision to enact the Amendments is allowed to stand, and 22

1 the expensive maintenance required to meet state and local code requirements (e.g.,

2 repairing a non-operational elevator and performing related structural upgrades) if they

3 are prohibited from recouping their costs by upgrading their residential facilities. The

4 result is an unconstitutional regulatory taking.

5 41. Residential Hotels in Oakland have always been allowed by law to rent

6 rooms to occupants who have another, "primary residence." The proposed Amendments

7 fundamentally change this lawful business model into something different and less

8 profitable. The Amendments redefine a Residential Hotel as a building a containing guest

9 rooms that are, inter alia, "intended or designed to be used, or which are used, rented, or

(Amendments § 17.153.020, emph. 00+ TLLINS IIELIS ANEWODINOW SEZ DI 'NOSHILIVI  NVWIHINI 'SYOVZ 10 hired out, to be occupied, or which are occupied, for sleeping purposes by guests, which

†OTDG VINNOJIIVO *OOSIONVIH NVS 11 is also the primary residence of those guests

12 added.) ("Commercial Hotel" is likewise defined as the opposite, thereby distinguishing
13 and separating these two uses.) In other words, the Amendments terminate Residential
14 Hotel Owners' right to engage in their existing business model.

15 42. This immediate termination of a non-nuisance business, without
16 compensation or a reasonable amortization period, constitutes an unreasonable,
17 unjustified, and unconstitutional exercise of the City's police power.
18 43. The Amendments unlawfully terminated Petitioner's lawful business by
19 prohibiting rentals to individuals who have another, primary residence, and did provide
20 a I just compensation or a reasonable amortization period. The Amendments do not fulfill
21 this requirement.
22 44. The Amendments further amended the Planning Code to include a 90-day

23 notice period before a Residential Hotel Owner may sell its property. (It appears
24 Council intended to specify a different time period and compel Residential Hotel
25 Owners to negotiate with the a City (or a nonprofit of the City's choosing) to sell their
26 properties to the City, but this was omitted from the promulgated copy of the
27 Ordinance.) This confers on the City right of first refusal to purchase any Residential

2 City (or a nonprofit chosen by the City) for this time-period

3 45. This mandatory right of first refusal constitutes an unlawful taking under

4 Constitutional law. The California Supreme Court has ruled that a purchase option is a

5 "sufficiently strong interest in ... property to require compensation if the government

6 takes it in eminent domain," and that compelling a developer to give a city a purchase

7 option is an "exaction." (Sterling Park, L.P. v. City of Palo Alto (2013) 57 Cal.4th

8 1193, citing County of San Diego v. Miller (1975) 13 Cal.3d 684, 691-693.) The
Supreme Court's reasoning applies with equal force to the right of first refusal here. By
10 eliminating the ability of Residential Hotel Owners to freely sell their property, the City 9

THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION 16
Violations of Cal. Const. Article I, § 7(a) 17 (Declaratory or Injunctive Relief -

19 47. Petitioner incorporates the above allegations as if set forth fully herein.
20 48. Petitioner operates lawfully in accordance with the Oakland Planning
21 Code, and has done so for many years.
22 49. Petitioner has statutorily-conferred benefits existing by virtue of its long-
23 standing, and ongoing, lawful operation and usage under the terms of the Planning
24 Code. These benefits include, but are not limited to, the right to rent rooms to
25 individuals who have another, primary residence, and to sell the Property without being
26 required to first offer it to the City.

1 50. Respondents' enactment of the Amendments violated the Petitioner's due
2 process rights insofar as it failed to offer any meaningful process whereby Petitioner

3 could seek redress for deprivation of its statutorily-conferred benefits.
51. Respondents also failed to satisfy due process requirements in their acts of 4

5 failing to provide sufficient notice of the substance of the proposed Amendments before

7 owners, precluding ordinary exemption from due process requirements applicable to

12 52. Petitioner incorporates the above allegations as if set forth fully herein.
13 53. Petitioner brings this cause of action pursuant to the Equal Protection

15 54. : The California Equal Protection Clause guarantees that a person may not

18 legal operation of Residential Hotels, including the Property. Among other things, these
19 regulations prohibit Petitioner from renting rooms to individuals who have another,
20 primary residence, and to sell the Property for a period of 180 days, during which time
21 period Petitioner must first offer the Property to the City.

22 56. In enacting the Amendments, the City chose not to affect other properties

23 (and their owners) that are functionally similar to Residential Hotels such as the Property
24 owned by Petitioner.
25 57. Petitioner's units, to the extent they have lawfully operated for decades

26 under the Planning Code, are the functional equivalent of other, non-Residential Hotel
27 units. Among other reasons, the Petitioner has paid, and does pay, taxes for any tourist-
28 based usage.

P 58. The Amendments single out the owners of pre-1960 Residential Hotels in

2 the Downtown area for disparate treatment not accorded to similarly situated property

3 owners, including owners of residential hotels that were built after 1960, residential

4 hotels located outside the Downtown area, and hotels and motels renting rooms to low-

5 income occupants for residential use.
59. Further, Respondents have offered no valid justification for the
7 Amendments, or for the manner in which they discriminate between Residential Hotel 6

8 owners and other hotel owners.

9 60. Petitioner's operation of the Property, in compliance with the pre-existing

10 Planning Code and other generally applicable land use restrictions, does not violate other
laws or constitute a nuisance. § 11 †OTT6 VINJOALIVO *OOSIONVILI NVS Ia 'NOSHALIVI 8 NVWAHIHH 'SHOVZ ELINS 'LAELIS ANEWODINON SEZ 12 61. Respondents, however, are arbitrarily and capriciously discriminating
13 against Petitioner without any rational basis for doing so. The manner in which
14 Respondents have done so is not reasonably tailored to any legitimate end.

FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION 15

16 (Injunctive Relief Under 42 United States Code Section 1983 -
17 Violation of Federal Civil Rights - Against All Respondents)
18 62. Petitioner incorporates the above allegations as if set forth fully herein.
Petitioner brings this cause of action pursuant to 42 USC Section 1983 for 19 63.
20 violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution.
21 64. Respondents acted under color of state law in enacting the Amendments.
Respondents intentionally selected the type of buildings owned and operated by

same 22

23 Petitioner while not subjecting other buildings of the same functional type to the
24 restrictions.
25 65. By failing to give sufficient notice of the Amendments, Respondents
26 deprived Petitioner, and similarly-placed property owners, of adequate notice of a
27 substantial (and unconstitutional) change to the laws applicable to their property and
28 violated their right to procedural due process.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 66. By intentionally selecting hotels of the kind owned by Petitioner while not

2 affecting functionally equivalent hotels owned by other persons, the City has violated

3 Petitioner's rights to equal protection of the law.

4 67. The above-described deprivation of Petitioner's vested rights to operate

5 their Property as historically permitted, without notice or an opportunity to be heard, and

6 without regard to the severe economic impact of the Amendments on Petitioner's hotel
7 | operations, violates its rights to due process of law under the 5th and 14th Amendments to

8 the United States Constitution. The Amendments, on their face, constitute a taking of

9 Petitioner's property without just compensation. The impact of the Amendments

10 amounts to a physical and regulatory taking under the standards enunciated in the case
11 +01+6 VINHOIIVO *OOSIONVIH NVS 00F ELLINS 'LAGAIS XNEWODINON SEZ Id 'NOSHALIVI  NVWIHTHA 'SMOVZ law. (Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV (1982) 458 U.S. 419; Penn Central v.

14 SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION
15 (Administrative Mandamus - CCP § 1094.5; Govt. Code §65589.5 - Against All
Respondents) 16

17 68. Petitioner incorporates the above allegations as if set forth fully herein.
18 69. The Brown Act (Gov. Code § 54950 et seq.) regulates the conduct of
19 public meetings, including the right of members of the public to address government
20 agencies. It provides that the public must be given an opportunity to comment at a public
21 hearing on matters relevant to the agenda, and that public agencies "shall not prohibit
22 public criticism of the policies, procedures, programs, or services of the agency, or of the
23 acts or omissions of the legislative body." (Gov. Code § 54954.3.)
24 70. At the November 27 hearing, the City Council Clerk prevented Mr. Gene
25 Hazard' a member of the public, from exercising his First Amendment right to address

- City Council regarding the Amendments. He began to speak in support of Petitioner's
him from 2 position during the allotted time for public comment, but the Clerk stopped
3 filled out a speaker card. By preventing a member a of the speaking because he had not
4 public form speaking, the City violated the Brown Act.

71. Similarly, at the December 4 hearing, Council prevented Petitioner's
6 counsel, a member of the public, from exercising her First Amendment right to address
7 City Council regarding the Amendments, on the basis that she had not filled out a
8

9 speaker card. The need to speak did not arise until after public comment had begun, and

10 the Council Clerk refused to accept additional speaker

+0T+6 VINMONIIVO *ODSIONVAH NVS ELINS 'IAMAIS ANIWODINOI SEZ 12 Council President confirmed on the record that he possessed discretionary power to

13 allow Petitioner's counsel to speak without first filing a speaker card. Nevertheless, he

14 then arbitrarily declined to allow her to speak.

15 72. The City's policy of requiring a speaker card to be completed before a
16 person is allowed to speak violates the Brown Act. Nothing in the Brown Act authorizes

17 City Council to condition the right to speak on completion of a speaker card.

such document "shall state clearly that the 20 otherwise fulfilling any condition. Any
21 signing, registering, or completion of the document is voluntary." (Govt. Code

23 Stratton.(2002) 536 U.S. 150; Thomas v. Collins (1945) 323 U.S. 516, 539.) The courts
24 construe "provisions calling for open meetings and public participation broadly to
25 effectuate the important purposes of the Brown Act." (Galbiso v. Orosi Public Utility
26 Dist. (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1063, 1080.)
