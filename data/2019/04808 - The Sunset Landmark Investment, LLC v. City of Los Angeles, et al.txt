4 27. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations of
5 Paragraphs 1 through 26, inclusive, of this petition.

6 28. The record contains substantial evidence to support a fair argument that the
7 Project may cause significant, unmitigable impacts to the environment, including but not
8 limited to land use, transportation, traffic, circulation, emergency response times, parking,
9 pedestrian safety, noise, air quality, GHG, health risks, historic resources, shade/shadow,

Pasadena, 14 30. The record also contains substantial evidence showing that the City illegally
15 piecemealed the Project in violation of CEQA.

16 31. By adopting the MND, the City has prejudicially abused its discretion and

19 Entitlements that rely on the illegal MND.

20 32. Petitioner is further informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that

25 to prepare an Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") or further study any of the issues
