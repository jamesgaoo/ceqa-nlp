23 1. Plaintiff SAVE HISTORIC ROSEVILLE, (Plaintiff) is a California nonprofit

24 public benefit corporation formed to promote civic improvements with emphasis on advocating for

25 saving the Historic Roseville parking lot in order that it may continue to be used for municipal

(Exhibit 1).
24

25 7. Proof of Service upon CITY per PRC 21167.5 is attached (Exhibit 2) (All Code references

26 lare to Public Resources Code unless noted otherwise).

27 8. Plaintiff brings this action as a Petition for Writ of Mandate pursuant to Code of Civil

1

a 1 21168.5; and as a Complaint for Declaratory relief pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section

2 1060. The Court has jurisdiction over these claims.
3
9. Vernon Street and Historic Old Town are on opposite sides of the tracks. Prior to 1950,

5 they were physically connected by Lincoln Street. When the Lincoln Street crossing was closed,

6 Historic Old Town entered a period of economic decline. In response to the decline, in 2009 the
7 CITY created the Downtown Specific Plan, Downtown Code, and accompanying Environmental

8 Impact Report. (The Downtown Specific Plan provided for improvements on both the Historic Old
9 Town side of the tracks as well as the Vernon Street - Royer Park side of the tracks. Since these
10 pleadings deal with the Historic Old Town portion of the Specific Plan, for convenience, when
11

12 referring to the Specific Plan, the reference pertaining to Historic Old Town). The Historic Old

13 Town was also identified as the Entertainment District. It comprises approximately 4 blocks.

14 10. The Downtown Code was adopted in conjunction with the Specific Plan and incorporated
15 the zoning changes provided for in the Specific Plan. These zoning changes increased densities,
16 reduced, and often eliminated, on-site parking requirements. The Specific Plan acknowledges that

17 these zoning changes in the Historic District would result in the need for 965 parking space in
18

19 addition to the approximate 233 spaces that existed at the time of the adoption of the Specific Plan.

20 To accommodate the increased parking demand, the Specific Plan called for the creation of

21 additional public parking.

22 11. The additional parking was to be provide in phases. The first was the construction of 199
23 surface spaces on Union Pacific property, the second was the construction of a 400 space Parking
24 Structure which is the subject of this suit (*Pacific Street Garage"). Neither the 199 space Union
25 Pacific lot nor the 400 space Pacific Street Garage have been constructed. Both were identified as
26 two of the five key elements in the Specific Plan.
27

28

3

1 12. As a stop-gap measure, in 2010, the CITY built 150 parking spaces on the Town Plaza site

2 under a 5-year lease. The Town Plaza site is a privately owned 70,000' property adjacent to the
3 Historic Fire Station on Lincoln Street. The Specific Plan designated the Town Plaza as an
4

5 Opportunity Site. The Specific Plan envisioned the site to include the public square, approximately

6 105 housing units and 3500 feet of commercial development.

7 13. When the Town Plaza lot lease expired, public parking signage was removed and private

8 parking signage installed. Since then the property has been privately maintained (water, lighting,
9 cleanup) by the property owner. Notwithstanding its private ownership, the public continues to rely
10 on it as if it were public parking. In the past six month, on occasion, the lot has been closed to the
11 public removing any available public parking from the Historic District.
12

13 14. The Downtown Specific Plan provides for three new parking garages, the Pacific Street

14 Garage, the Train Depot Garage, and the Oak-Washington Garage. The Specific Plan EIR required
15 the CITY to build 580 additional spaces, above what was otherwise planned for in these three
16 garages or in the alternative to provide the 580 spaces elsewhere. Neither the Train Depot Garage,

17 hor the Pacific Street Garage nor the additional 580 spaces have been built.
18 15. The SPECIFIC PLAN established 5 key concepts for the implementation of the Specific
19

20 Plan:(1) Constructing a pedestrian plaza adjacent to the Fire Department Museum at the intersection

21 of Main Street, Church Street and Lincoln Street.[this is on private property known as Town Plaza

22 site] (2)Creating a pedestrian courtyard at the rear of the buildings that are located adjacent to the
23 east side of Church Street, that can be accessed via the alleyways. [nothing has been done] (3)
24 Securing and constructing additional at-grade parking on the land currently owned by Union Pacific
25 [nothing has been done] (4) Providing a joint public/private development on the existing public
26 parking lot accessed from Pacific Street that would include construction of a public parking
27

28 structure and a private development project, [this is the subject of the suit] (5) Redevelopment at a

4

1 higher intensity on prime opportunity sites located at: a) Washington Boulevard and Lincoln
2 Street, [property for sale - no development] b) Main Street and Washington Boulevard both north
land south sides;[Main Street Lofts under construction] and, c) property at the terminus of Main

5 Street and Lincoln Street on the east side of Lincoln Street. [Town Plaza site is currently being used

6 for parking]

7 16. At the present time, parking in Historic Old Town is inadequate. It is not only insufficient

8 accommodate daily parking demands, it is also inadequate to provide for the parking required for
9 the growth envisioned in the Specific Plan. Without parking development as provided in the
10 Specific Plan is not feasible.
11

12 17. There have been changed Circumstances since the adoption of the 2009 Specific Plan: (1)

13 In 2016, California enacted legislation which reduced developer requirements to provide parking

14 when building low income housing within 1/2 mile of a major transit hub. The CITY has taken the
15 position that the Old Town Train Depot is a major Transit Hub despite it only providing only one
16 round trip commuter train per day and only sporadic bus service. While the Major Transit

17 designation may technically qualify for a reduction in developer require parking, it does nothing to
18

19 reduce the actual parking demand generated by housing projects. This reduction in required housing

20 would reduce the developer required parking for Junction Station by 40 spaces and approximately

21 Main Street Lofts by 38 spaces. These reductions would place corresponding addition demand on

22 the limited existing parking in the Historic District. In addition, street abandonment in conjunction
23 with the Main Street Lofts will result in the loss of approximately 19 spaces; (2) Approximately

24 additional 53 spaces are needed for the renovated Bank of America Building and Owl Club; (4) The

25 Capitol Corridor provides rail service from Roseville to Sacramento and then on to San Jose. It is
26

27 operated under the direction of Capitol Corridor Joint Powers Association ("CCJPA"). Currently

28 there is one round-trip commuter train from Roseville. It leaves Roseville at approximately 7:00 am

5

1 land returns at about 7:00 pm. The Train Depot lot holds 71 vehicles and weekday parking spills
2 over daily into the Pacific Street Parking lot by about 20 or so vehicles. The CCJPA plans to
3 expand commuter train service to 10 round trips per day. With Phase One there will be an increase

5 of two round trips per day and parking space demand associated therewith is estimated to be

6 between 177 and 280 spaces. At 10 trains, 500 or so parking spaces would be needed. Phase One

7 has been estimated to begin in 2020. As part of the Third Rail Project, an EIR was prepared. The

8 Third Rail EIR requires CCJPA and ROSEVILLE to be in agreement that there is adequate parking

9 in OLD TOWN before increasing beyond the current one train round trip. "Adequate" parking is
10 defined as parking within a 5-minute walk of the Roseville Train Depot which is in OLD TOWN;
11

12 (5) The Third Rail Project will require a layover yard for the additional trains. The location of the

13 yard and it impact on Old Town parking is uncertain. The yard is currently approved on the Union

14 Pacific property where the main east west line from San Jose to Omaha intersects with the northern
15 line going to Seattle. In Historic Roseville the yard is between the Boxing Donkey and the Crooked

16 Bridge. It would require the removal of almost all of the spaces in two public parking lots, one
17 adjacent to the Boxing Donkey and the other between the Moose Lodge and the Crooked Bridge. If
18 the layover yard were to be located where currently approved, it would require the remove
19

20 lapproximately 74 parking spaces from the Historic District; (6) Removal of the privately owned

21 Town Plaza parking from parking inventory..

23
FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
24 Declaratory Relief - Violation of CEQA

25 Against CITY and DOES 1-10

26 18. Plaintiffs re-allege, as if fully set forth herein, each and every allegation contained in the

27 preceding paragraphs.

28

6

1 19. The California Environmental Quality Act (Pub. Resources Code, Â§ 21000 et seq.)

2 (CEQA) and the regulations implementing it (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, Â§ 15000 et seq.) embody
3 California's strong public policy of protecting the environment. "The basic purposes of CEQA are
4

5 (to: (1) Inform governmental decision makers and the public about the potential, significant

6 environmental effects of proposed activities. (2) Identify ways that environmental damage can be
7 avoided or significantly reduced. (3) Prevent significant, avoidable damage to the environment by
8 requiring changes in projects through the use of alternatives or mitigation measures when the

9 governmental agency finds the changes to be feasible. (4) Disclose to the public the reasons why a
10 governmental agency approved the project in the manner the agency chose if significant
11 environmental effects are involved.
12

13 20. To achieve these goals, CEQA and the implementing regulations provide for a three-step

14 process. In the first step, the public agency must determine whether the proposed development is a
15 *project," that is, "an activity which may cause either a direct physical change in the environment,
16 or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment" undertaken, supported, or

17 approved by a public agency. (Â§ 21065.) An EIR is required of any project that "may" have a
18 significant effect on the environment. ($ 21065.)
19

20 21. The Sale and Disposition Agreement is a de facto removal of the parking structure from

21 lpotential development as required by the Specific Plan. Without the parking structure, the Historic

22 District would be unable to realize the anticipated commercial development envisioned in the

23 Specific Plan.

24 22. The Public Resources Code (PRC) defines a project as "an activity which may cause
25 either a direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical
26 change in the environment, and which is any of the following: (a) An activity directly undertaken
27

28 by any public agency. (b) An activity undertaken by a person which is supported, in whole or in

7

-..-.

N

1 part, through contracts, grants, subsidies, loans, or other forms of assistance from one or more

2 public agencies. (c) An activity that involves the issuance to a person of a lease, permit, license,

3 certificate, or other entitlement for use by one or more public agencies.
23. After establishing the existence of a "project", the public agency must then decide whether

6 is exempt from compliance with CEQA under either a statutory exemption (Â§ 21080) or a

7 categorical exemption set forth in the regulations (Â§ 21084, (a); Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, Â§ 15300).

8 The activities of the Sale and Disposition agreement are not listed as categorically exempt.

9 24. If the project is not exempt, the agency must determine whether the project "may" have a
10 significant effect on the environment. If the agency decides the project will not have such an effect,

11 lit must "adopt a negative declaration to that effect." (Â§ 21080, (c); see Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, Â§
12 af an

13 Utherwise, tle

14 lenvironmental impact report before approval of the project. (SÂ§ 21100, (a), 21151, (a). [underlining

15 added] Tomlinson V. County of Alameda. (2012) 54 Cal.4th 281.

16 25. The CITY did not adopt a negative declaration therefor it must prepare and Environmental

17 Impact Declaration.

18 26. Other than the objections, (Exhibit 2) the only document provided to the City Council
19 prior to the January 9, 2009 hearing was the Council Communication (Exhibit 3) which included
20

21 attachments of an appraisal, Sale and Development Agreement, and Proposed Resolution (Exhibit

22 4). The only reference to CEQA is found in the last paragraph of the Council Communication:

23 "The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) does not apply to activities that will

24 not result in a direct or reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the

25 environment (CEQA Guidelines Section15061(b)(3). Execution of this agreement does

26 include the potential for a significant environmental effect and therefore is not subject to CEQA. CEQA review for the Roseville Junction Crossing project [sic] occurs
27 separately through the planning review process."
28
8

1 27. The last sentence "CEQA review for the Roseville Junction Crossing project [sic] occurs

2 (separately through the planning review process" implies that the CEQA review will be conducted
3 lat some future date. Post approval CEQA review would be contrary to the CEQA which requires

5 Ithe environmental review prior to public agency action. (Â§ 21065.)
28. Assuming arguendo, that the project could not have a potential environmental impact, a
7 Fthe negative declaration shall be prepared for the proposed project". (21080(c) The preparation of

8 Ithe Negative Declarations is necessary to appraise the public agency and the public of potential
9 environmental issues prior to the agency taking action. While it is clear that the project "may" have
10 lan impact on the environment requiring an EIR, if it could not have an impact, the project would
11
|then require a Negative Declaration.
12

13 29. The Negative Declaration or Environmental Impact Report are required to be prepared

14 prior to public agency action. "Time of Preparation: (a) Before granting any approval of a project
15 subject to CEQA, every lead agency or responsible agency shall consider a final EIR or negative
16 declaration or another document authorized by these guidelines to be used in the place of an EIR or

17 negative declaration". (Â§ 15004).
18 30. No EIR or Negative Declaration were prepared. The CITY did not comply with Calif
19

20 Code of Regulations Â§15075 and Â§15094 which provides for the filing and posting of the Negative

21 Declaration.

22 31. Irreparable injury will occur if the CITY and JUNCTION STATION proceed without

23 CEQA compliance. The EIR insures a systematic evaluation of the project's environmental
24 consequences, followed by the balancing of the need for project approval with mitigation measures
25 lvis a vis project rejection. No evaluation nor consideration of mitigation measures will occur
26 without the EIR. The CITY abused its discretion by failing to prepare an EIR or Negative
27

28 Declaration in the manner required by law. (21168.5)

9

1 32. There is a present and actual controversy between Plaintiffs and CITY as to the legality of
2 Ithe CITY practices mentioned herein. The CITY has prejudicially abused its discretion and not
3 proceeded in a manner required by law in that it repeatedly and as a policy, practice, and/or ongoing

5 conduct is moving forward with the development without conducting proper CEQA review.

6 33. Plaintiffs desire a judicial determination of the rights and obligations of the respective

7 parties concerning the allegations in this Complaint. An action for Declaratory Relief under

8 California Code of Civil Procedure section 1060 "is an appropriate means of challenging an alleged

9 overarching policy or practice of an agency where there is an actual and present controversy over
10 the policy". Such a declaration is necessary and appropriate at this time in order that Plaintiffs may
11

12 ascertain the right to require CITY to act in accordance with environmental degradation of the

13 public resources of this state due to its failure to evaluate, the obligations of CEQA to ensure that

14 the development will not be harmful to the public. Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy in the
15 ordinary course of law to obtain relief from the consequences of CITY's actions. Plaintiffs lack an
16 adequate remedy because monetary damages cannot be ascertained and Plaintiffs cannot be

17 compensated for the damage caused by CITY's actions in violation of CEQA.
18

19 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

20 Failure to Comply with CEQA - Injunctive Relief

21 34. Plaintiffs re-allege, as if fully set forth herein, each and every allegation contained

22 in the preceding paragraphs.

23 35. The CITY abused its discretion by failing to conduct an environmental review and
24 leither preparing an environmental impact report, or negative declaration. A writ of mandate should

25 lissue setting aside Resolution 19-04 enjoining any further action with respect thereto.
26 36.
27 Plaintiffs lack an adequate remedy at law because monetary damages cannot be

28 lascertained and Plaintiffs cannot be compensated for the environmental damage caused by the

10

1 b. Commanding the City of Roseville and Junction Station LP to immediately

2 suspend all activities in furtherance of the Project, including but not limited to closing

C.
5 Commanding the City of Roseville to fully comply with CEQA, California
Government Code and Roseville Municipal Code in any subsequent action taken

13 reasonable attorney fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure 1021.5, the common

14 benefit theory, Government Code section 800, or as otherwise provided by law or

5 Against CITY and DOES 1-10

6 37. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained in
7 the preceding paragraphs.
8
38.
9 The CITY has entered into an agreement to sell the Parking Lot to Junction Station

10 LP without having determined the property surplus, a violation of Roseville Municipal Code

11 J4.12.110. Roseville Municipal Code 4.12.110 requires the City to offer property for competitive
12 bid, or under section B to publish the terms of sale in local newspaper prior to the sale. Neither

13 procedure was followed. The process used by the City was not authorized by statute or municipal

14 code.
15 39. The removal of the parking lot is inconsistent with the Specific Plan and would
16

17 require and amendment of the Specific Plan consistent with Gov Code 65351 et sec.

18 40. Notice for Resolution 19-04 is defective. Gov. Code 65094 requires the notice to
19 include "a general explanation of the matter to be considered". No mention of the removal of the
20 parking structure was made.

City Council Meeting: 1/9/19
Objections to proposed RESOLUTION NO. 19-04
APPROVING A DISPOSITION AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT, BY AND BETWEEN
JUNCTION STATION, LP AND THE CITY OF ROSEVILLE, AND AUTHORIZING THE CITY
MANAGER TO EXECUTE IT ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF ROSEVILLE

The removal of the Parking Garage would be Inconsistent with
Specific Plan

Old Town Specific Plan: Key Zoning Components:

1. Constructing a pedestrian plaza adjacent to the Fire Department Museum at the intersection of Main Street, Church Street and Lincoln Street
2. Creating a pedestrian courtyard at the rear of the buildings that are located adjacent to the east side of Church Street, that can be accessed via the alleyways
3. Securing and constructing additional at-grade parking on the land currently owned by
Union Pacific
4. Providing a joint public/private development on the existing public parking lot
accessed from Pacific Street that would include construction of a public parking
structure and a private development project
5. Redevelopment at a higher intensity on prime opportunity sites located at: 1)
Washington Boulevard and Lincoin Street, 2) Main Street and Washington Boulevard
both north and south sides; and, 3) property at the terminus of Main Street and Lincoln
Street on the east side of Lincoln Street.

The sale and disposition agreement constitute a project. Combined they allow the City parking lot
to be converted to a private apartment project. There has been no environmental determination
and no CEQA compliance.

The conversion of the parking lot into a 400 space parking structure was the primary project
envisioned in the Specific Plan. All of the Old Town elements of Specific Plan, including zoning
and property use, were dependent upon the creation of the 400 unit parking garage.

The proposed development is inconsistent with the 2009 Specific Plan. It deviates significantly from the Specific Pian, the Downton Code, and their EIR. It would result in the transfer of
ownership of the City Parking Lot to private ownership and the construction of housing. As a
result, it would eliminate the 400 space Parking Structure which is the central element of the
Specific Plan. The loss of the Parking Structure would remove the ability of the Specific Plan area
to achieve the goals of the Specific Plan.

1 :

The City is attempting to ignore the Specific Plan. With a significant change, the City is required to go through a Specific Plan amendment process. Reference is made to the Governor's Office,
Planners Guide to Specific Plans ( ). The Specific Plan is primary zoning regulation and is equated to the "Constitution" of the City. A modification requires notice and public hearings. The Governor's Guide cites Government Code Section
65453 which provides that "A specific plan shall be prepared, adopted and amended in the same manner as the general plan..." as such, opportunities for the involvement of citizens, public agencies, public utilities, civic education, and other community groups must be provided
pursuant to Section 65351.

Roseville Ordinances also require Specific Procedures to be followed when amending a Specific
Plan.. Section 9.2.4 of the Specific Pian provides for Amendments as follows:
The Specific Plan and Downtown Code may be amended by the same procedure as
they were originally adopted. Each amendment shall include all sections or portions of
the Specific Plan or Downtown Code that are affected by the change.

Addition Objection
Violation of California Constitution
Due Process Violation
There has been no determination the Parking Lot is surplus, a requirement that must be made
before it can be disposed of. There has been no Open Bid for the property. The proposed sale was not open to the public. The Parking lot is being offered to a selected buyer without any offer,
opportunity or notice to others to participate. There has been no noticed hearings given to the public that reside or own property in the Specific
Plan area. The City fails to comply with its own requirements for disposition of property RMC
4.12.110. There was no compliance with Cal Gov Code 54222 et sec. The ERN was between the
City of Roseville and St. Anton Communities, LLC whereas the proposed sale is to a new entity a JUNCTION STATION, LP that was not a party to the ERN.

Changed circumstances.
When there have been Changed Circumstances the California Law requires the Specific Plan must
be amended to reflect the new reality prior to development. There have been significant changed
circumstances since the implementation of the Specific Plan. The Specific Plan stated the new
zoning would create a demand for 965 additional parking spaces in Old Town. At present total public parking in Old Town is approximately 233.
The Specific Plan provided for an interim increase in public parking of 199 spaces to be
constructed on leased Central Pacific Land. This construction never occurred.

Since the Specific Plan was created, CCJPA has committed to increase train service from
Roseville. The service will go from the current one train per day to 10 round trips per day. The
executive director of CCJPA, James Allison, estimated that "500 or so"additional parking spaces would be needed to accommodate the increased ridership.

Objection to Resolution 19-04
2

The train service requires a layover yard. This Yard, as currently approved, requires a layover yard between the Boxing Donkey and the Moose Parking lot. This would result in the loss of 74 space.

ROSEVILLE COUNCIL COMMUNICATION

CC #: 9727
Flle #: 0709-03-02
Title: HOUSING SUCCESSOR - Junction Crossing Project - 120 Pacific Street - Disposition and Development Agreement
Contact: Trisha Isom 916-746-1239

Meeting Date: 1/9/2019 Item #: 10.2.

RECOMMENDATION TO COUNCIL
Staff recommends that the City Council, acting as the Housing Successor: 1) Hold the public hearings required by Health and Safety Code Â§33431 and Â§33433; 2) Adopt the attached resolution authorizing the City Manager to execute the attached Disposition and Development Agreement (DDA) with Junction Station, LP, which is owned and controlled by developer St. Anton Communities, for the property owned at 120 Pacific Street, to be sold to Junction Station, L.P, for the development of an affordable housing project, Roseville Junction Crossing Project, subjeot to the conditions of the DDA; and 3) Authorize the City Manager or his designee to execute any associated documents, including escrow documents, to carry out the
land sale, loans, and the affordable housing development.

BACKGROUND

This Council Communication serves as the summary report required by the Califomia Health and Safety Code Â§33433.
In April 2010, City Council approved an Exclusive Right to Negotiate Agreement (ERN) with MSR Properties, LLC for the development of a catalyst site in the Downtown Specific Plan proposed at the Pacific and Church Streets site in Historic Old Town. In April 2011, MSR Properties, LLC requested that the previous ERN be terminated to allow the Agency to enter into negotiations with Pacific & Church Partners, LLC., a new development team. A new ERN was finalized on June 15, 2011 between the former City of Roseville Redevelopment Agency and Pacific and Church Partners, LLC. A subsequent ERN was approved on July 15, 2015 with Pacific and Church Partners, LLC after the previous agreement expired. The purpose of this ERN was to assist in the development of an affordable housing project, referred to as Roseville Junction Crossing. Part of the basis for utilizing this developer is their option to purchase a neighboring property, which will be combined with the City parcels to yield a site able to accommodate the proposed 80- unit affordable project. H 648 On April 20, 2016, the City Council, acting on behalf of the City and in its role as the Housing Successor, approved funds totaling $4.36 million to assist in developing the proposed 80-unit affordable housing community. The Roseville Junction Crossing project is planned as a 100 percent affordable housing community offering 80 studio and one-bedroom units to accommodate very-low and low- income households, with a focus on members of the local workforce. The ERN that was executed in 2015 expired on December 31, 2016. As it was necessary to revise the parties and terms of the document, the City entered into an updated ERN with St. Anton Communities on November 1, 2017 which was further amended earlier this year to accommodate processing of the project map as part of the overall planning application process.
The development consists of a four-story building with 80 apartment units. Sixty (60) units are designed to be one bedroom units and the remaining 20 units will be studio units. The project includes 86 on-grade parking spaces that are distributed about the site for resident, guest and public parking access. Specifically, three parking spaces are designated to the business located at 127 Church Street, 36 parking spaces are reserved for public parking use; and the remaining 47 parking spaces are set-aside for residents, consistent with Govemment Code 65915 (p)(3)(B). On site amenities include community kitchen, technology center, gym space, management offices, and laundry facilities.
ExeÃ§ution of the recommended DDA allows St. Anton to pursue state and federal financing for the affordable housing project, which require documented site control as part of their application thresholds. Timing of this DDA is necessary for current state applications under review, Approval of the DDA will support St. Anton proceeding with the proposed Junction Crossing development that will provide for a $16 million investment into the Historic Old Town area and the provision of much-needed workforce and affordable housing. As the City Council is aware, this project is the subject of a lawsuit. However, since no injunction has been issued by a court preventing the project from proceeding, it is within the Council's discretion to approve the DDA. St. Anton is aware of the risks in proceeding before final disposition of the lawsuit, including the possibility that further environmental review might be ordered by a
court.

FISCAL IMPACT

httnaliracauilla nuueananda comianandonthlieiC nuerQheat aenvPitemin=A7A3&MeatinnIN=ARR 1/3

1/24/2919 Coversheet
No General Fund resources will be used for this project. The City Councll, acting as Housing Successor to the Redevelopment *Agency, previously approved Resolution 16-127 approving $400,000 from the Low and Moderate Income Fund and $200,000 from the Housing Taxable Bonds. The City Council also approved Resolution 16-126 committing $3.76 million from City Affordable Housina Funds. Together, these commitments represent a total of $4.36 million of local housing funds from the City to assist in the development of Junction Crossing. These funds will be provided as 3% per annum loans with 55-year terms and will be repaid through residual receipts, based on the cash flow of the project.
Additionally, the DDA requires St. Anton to repay the City for the value of the land being transferred. Once received, this $178,155 payment will be credited to the General Fund.

APPRAISAL

In determining the purchase price, an appraisal was prepared by Integra Realty Resources on April 25, 2018 for: Assessor's Parcel Numbers (APNs): 012-200-001 (portion), 012-200-014, 012-200-015, 012-200-017, 012-200-022, 012-200-023, 012-200-024, and 012-200-025., Section 33433 of the Health and Safety Code requires that the City identify the fair market value of the Interests being conveyed at the highest and best use allowed.
An appraisal was prepared which determined the highest and best use based on adjacent zoning. Using a comparable land sales approach, the appraisal determined that the square footage valuation ranged from $3.81 to $11.58 a square foot, which after adjustment is narrowed to $4.81 to $8.33 a square foot. After the appraiser removed properties from the comparable list that are either still under negotiation, in a superior area, were outdated, or were larger contiguous properties, the appraisal determined : market value estimate of $5.75 per square foot for the subject property. With just under 31,000 square feet of City property combined in its multiple parcals, the value was determined to be $178,155.
The law also requires an estimated reuse value of the property to be determined. The fair reuse value can be defined as the fair market value of the interests to be conveyed, less the economic value of any development restrictions placed on the project by City, environmental, and other property development constraints. As a condition of this project, an Affordable Housing Regulatory Agreement will be recorded against the property which restricts the use of the property for affordable housing purposes for a period of at least 55 years. Thus. a it is a fair assumption that the fair reuse value of the property is less than the fair market value of the property in its current, unrestricted condition.

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT /JOBS CREATED

This Disposition and Development Agreement does not result in the creation of jobs, but development of an affordable housing project will result in the creation of construction jobs. After completion of construction, there will be on site property management and maintenance jobs that will be necessary for operation of the apartments. Completion of this project would represent an approximately $16 million dollar investment in Historic Old Town.

Estimates of total employment created can be based on expenditure data, consistent with guidance from the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA): Total employment not only includes direct and indirect jobs, but also induced jobs. CEA estimates that total employment is increased by one job-year for every $92,000 in direct government spending. Therefore, this project has the potential to generate 174 job years overall, including 47 job years with expenditure of the City's housing funds committed to this project.

ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW

The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) does not apply to activities that will not result in a direct or reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment (CEQA Guidelines Section 15061(b)(3). Execution of this agreement does not include the potential for a significant environmental effect, and therefore is not subject to CEQA. CEQA review for the Roseville Junction Crossing project occurs separately through the planning review process.
