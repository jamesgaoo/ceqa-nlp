RE: Notice to Attorney General of Filling of Amended Petition against the City of Lincoln

To the Attorney General of the State of California:
Please take notice, under Public Resources Code section 21167.7 and Code of
Civil Procedure section 388, that on August 10, 2018, Scheiber Ranch Properties, LP and
Albert Scheiber filed its First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate ("First
Amended Petition") under the provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act,
Public Resources Code section 21000 et seq. ("CEQA"), against the City of Lincoln
("City") and Real Party in Interest Richland Developers, Inc. The petition challenges the
City's December 12, 2017 certification of the Environmental Impact Report and various land use approvals for the Village 5 project, a residential and commercial development on approximately 4,775 acres located outside the City's city limits, in its sphere of influence (*Project"). The lawsuit is based on violations of CEQA, as discussed more fully in the Project's administrative and environmental review proceedings. The exact nature of the allegations and relief sought is described in the First Amended Petition, and is attached to
this notice as Exhibit A.

Very truly yours,

INTRODUCTION

2 1. Plaintiffs SCHEIBER RANCH PROPERTIES, LP and ALBERT SCHEIBER
3 (collectively, "Plaintiffs" or "Scheiber") petition this court for a Writ of Mandate ("Petition"),

4 directed to Defendant CITY OF LINCOLN ("City") and Real Party in Interest RICHLAND

5 DEVELOPERS, INC. ("Real Party"). Plaintiffs challenge the City's December 12, 2017

6 certification of the Environmental Impact Report (EIR") and various land use approvals for the

7 Village 5 project, a residential and commercial development on approximately 4,775 acres

8 located outside the City's city limits, in its sphere of influence ("Project").

9 2. In certifying the EIR and approving the Project, the City prejudicially abused its
10 discretion and failed to proceed in the manner required by law, including but not limited to its

11 failure to comply with the substantive and procedural mandates of the California Environmental
12 Quality Act ("CEQA"), the State CEQA Guidelines, Title 14, California Code of Regulations,

13 section 15000 et seq. ("CEQA Guidelines"), and other applicable regulations and policies.

14 3. The conclusions reached in the EIR are not supported by substantial evidence.

15 The EIR does not provide adequate analysis of, or identify adequate mitigation measures for, the
16 Project's individual and cumulative impacts, including but not limited to its impacts on
17 agricultural resources, biological resources, hydrology and water quality, water supply,

18 transportation and circulation, and human health impacts from air emissions.

19 4. The City also failed to comply with its duty to prepare, circulate and certify an

20 EIR that reflects its independent judgment.

21 5. Finally, the City prejudicially abused its discretion and failed to proceed in a

22 manner required by law by not providing a fair hearing and procedurally fair decision-making
23 process on the Project and its EIR.

24 6. Because the City prejudicially abused its discretion and failed to proceed in a
25 manner required by law, Plaintiffs request that the Court direct the City to set aside its actions to

26 approve the Project and certify the EIR.

PARTIES

2 7. Plaintiff SCHEIBER RANCH PROPERTIES, LP is a California Limited

3 Partnership that owns and operates agricultural land within the boundaries of the Project.

4 Plaintiff ALBERT SCHEIBER ("Mr. Scheiber") is a general partner of SCHEIBER RANCH

5 PROPERTIES, LP (collectively, "Plaintiffs"). Plaintiffs reside and engage in agricultural

6 activities on property they own within the boundaries of the Project. Plaintiffs' goal is to ensure

7 the long term viability of agriculture in Placer County and governmental compliance with

8 CEQA and other laws of the State designed to protect the public and environment. The

9 Project's unanalyzed impacts will adversely affect the Plaintiffs' existing agricultural operations

10 as well as agricultural operations surrounding the Project. Plaintiffs are within the class of

11 persons beneficially interested in and aggrieved by the acts of the City and Real Party, as alleged
12 herein. Plaintiffs have a direct and substantial beneficial interest in ensuring that the City

13 complies with the laws relating to environmental protection, particularly CEQA, and Plaintiffs

14 are affected by the City's failure to prepare adequate environmental review of the Project.

15 Plaintiffs brings this petition on behalf of all others similarly situated that are too numerous to

16 be named and brought before this court as plaintiffs.

17 8. Defendant CITY OF LINCOLN ("City" or "Defendant") is a municipal

18 corporation, organized under the laws of the state of California, and exercising local government

19 power. The City is the CEQA "lead agency" for the Project. As lead agency for the Project, the

20 City is responsible for preparation of an environmental document that describes the Project and

21 its impacts, and, if necessary evaluates mitigation measures and/or alternatives to lessen or avoid

22 any significant environmental impacts.

23 9. Plaintiffs are unaware of the true names and capacities of Defendants DOES

24 through 10, and sue such respondents by fictitious names. Plaintiffs are informed and believe,

25 and on the basis of such information and belief allege, that the fictitiously named respondents

26 are also responsible for the actions described in this Petition. When the true identities and

27 capacities of these respondents have been determined, Plaintiffs will amend this Petition, with
28 leave of court if necessary, to insert such identities and capacities.

5 informed and believe, and on the basis of such information and belief allege, that the fictitiously

6 named Real Parties are also directly and materially affected by the actions described in this

7 Petition. When the true identities and capacities of these Real Parties have been determined,

8 Plaintiffs will amend this Petition, with leave of court if necessary, to insert such identities and

10 BACKGROUND FACTS
11 The Project and Its Impacts

12 12. The Project is located within unincorporated Placer County. Placer County has

13 embraced carrying its agricultural heritage into the future, having adopted "right-to-farm"
14 ordinance providing in relevant part, "It is the declared policy of the County of Placer to

15 preserve, protect and encourage the development and improvement of its agricultural land for

16 the production of food and other agricultural products." (Placer County Code, § 5.24.040.)

17 Consistent with Placer County's agricultural heritage, the area encompassing the Project consists
18 overwhelmingly of agricultural properties.

19 13. The Project represents typical suburban sprawl development that is more

20 appropriate for the 1970s than the 21st century. Of the 4,775 acres comprising the Project site,
21 approximately 3,640 acres, or 76.2 percent, is farmland that will ultimately be eliminated for the

22 Project. More than half of this farmland, or 2,002.95 acres, is admittedly "important farmland."
23 A significant amount of this farmland operates under existing Williamson Act contracts.

24 14. These thousands of acres of prime and important farmland would be destroyed in
25 favor of constructing approximately 8, 200 residential dwelling units and 4.6 million square feet
26 of commercial space. In addition to the direct elimination of this massive amount of farmland,

27 Placer County explains that the Project "overtly plans for incompatible uses (intensive

28

SOLURI
MESERVE 4
A LAW
CORPORATION First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

residential development and commercial agricultural production) in close proximity," which will

2 result in significant environmental impacts.

3 15. Consistent with an antiquated suburban sprawl model of development, the City
4 failed to require any meaningful transit planning with the Project. As Placer County notes, "The

5 Draft EIR does not include a transit service plan for the Village 5 Specific Plan Area. A transit
6 plan for the area is considered to be a vital element to a mobility package, in addition to
7 | pedestrian, bicycle and NEV. . . Further, the Specific Plan documents are absent any mention of

8 future transit to the Specific Plan area.'
16. As recognized by Placer County, the Project's planning ignores transit in favor of
10 reliance on automobile circulation. The EIR correctly notes that the Project will trigger the need
11 for extensive improvements to roadway facilities throughout the area, and relies heavily as
12 mitigation on so-called "fair share" financial contributions by the Project.

13 17. Despite Placer County's repeated requests, the City refused to disclose in the EIR
14 the Project's "fair share" contributions to various roadway improvements, either in terms of an

15 estimated dollar number or even percentage of overall cost. As a result, the decision makers and

16 the public do not have adequate information available to determine whether the Project's "fair

17 share" contributions are likely to result in actual construction of the many identified
18 transportation improvements mitigating the Project's transportation impacts. The effectiveness
19 of the City's "fair share" mitigation strategy is unassessed and undisclosed.

20 18. Consistent with attempts to construct suburban development in existing rural

21 areas, water supply for the Project is speculative at best and, at worst, completely inadequate-

22 often described as "paper water" that will negatively impact existing active agricultural

23 operations relying on such water. Although the EIR claims that surface water supplies from

24 Placer County Water Agency and/or Nevada Irrigation District are more than adequate to supply

25 the Project, neither agency provided, nor can they, written confirmation that they will be able to

26 provide water necessary for buildout of the Project.

27 19. In light of the Project's questionable surface water supplies, the EIR claims that

28 water supply for the Project will purportedly consist of a combination of surface and ground

SOLURI
MESERVE 5
A LAW
CORPORATION First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

F water. However, the City and Real Party have made shifting and inconsistent representations

2 regarding Project water supplies throughout the City's administrative review process.

3 20. Since surface water supplies are inadequate, the Project includes as a component

4 the City's construction of six (6) new city-operated ground water wells to supply the Project in

5 addition to the City's existing five (5) wells. Thus, one critical element of the Project is to more

6 than double the City's ground water extraction wells. And yet, the EIR fails to demonstrate the

7 City's right to pump additional ground water and in fact indicates the City has no additional

8 rights to pump ground water.

9 21. In an attempt to allay reasonable concerns that additional ground water extraction
10 will negatively impact ground water supplies, the City it suggested that it would limit the Project's
11 ground water use to 10 percent, without any explanation to how that arbitrary percentage relates

12 to actual physical conditions or impacts. What is more, Real Party contradicted this

13 representation, asserting publicly that the Project's ground water supply would likely be 25
14 percent. Further, the EIR suggests that the Project might need to rely on ground water for up to

15 75 of its water supply during dry years in accordance with the City's prior practice, which in the

16 past has led to over pumping of the aquifer. This express reliance on ground water to serve the
17 Project is made in the context of the City's failure to adequately document baseline ground

18 water conditions.

19 22. It is now universally acknowledged that surface and ground water are not distinct

20 but rather connected hydrologically. For example, reducing the ground water table may reduce

21 surface flows; and similarly, reducing the flow of a river or stream may reduce ground water

22 recharge. Here, the Project proposes to pave over thousands of acres of prime farmland that
23 currently enable ground water recharge and, by extension, surface flows within both Auburn and
24 Markham Ravines. The EIR conclusively asserts that storm water basins proposed as elements

25 of the Project will enable ground water recharge at the same rate as the existing thousands of

26 acres of agricultural land within the boundaries of the Project. However, no study or analysis
27 whatsoever supports this bare assertion.
28

SOLURI 6 MESERVE
A LAW First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate CORPORATION

23. Through increased ground water pumping and reducing opportunity for ground

2 water recharge, the Project will result in reduced flows to both Auburn and Markham Ravines,

3 which provide habitat for both steelhead and chinook salmon. The EIR fails to adequately

4 document baseline conditions, much less analyze the Project's impact or identify all feasible

5 mitigation.

6 24. Similarly, the Project is predicted to result in construction activities within

7 streambeds within the jurisdiction of the California Department of Fish and Wildlife ("CDFW"),

8 CEQA responsible agency for the project. In fact, the EIR's analysis of Project impacts to

9 salmon and steelhead is generally limited to construction impacts. As a CEQA responsible
10 agency with authority for issuing a streambed alteration agreement authorizing such activities,
11 the CDFW criticized the EIR's failure to document Project activities affecting streambeds,

12 aquatic and riparian habitats, stating, "The CEQA Analysis should state what, if any,
13 Department-jurisdictional features will be removed, disturbed, or otherwise altered by the

14 Project.. The CEQA document should address direct (temporary and permanent), indirect,

15 and cumulative impacts expected to adversely affect biological resources."
16 25. CDFW also criticized the EIR's reliance on deferred mitigation for impacts to
17 biological resources. Rather than set forth specific mitigation, the EIR deferred such analysis

18 through reliance on future approvals or agreements with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the

19 U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and CDFW. The CDFW explained that this approach is circular
20 logic: "The Department cannot issue Notice of Determination based on a CEQA document,
21 which in turn relies on the Agreement for mitigation; it is circular logic."

22 26. In addition to water supply and biological impacts, the Project will result in the

23 direct elimination of approximately 3,640 acres of prime and important farmland. Yet the EIR
24 fails to meaningfully mitigate for the loss of agricultural land based on the City's legally-flawed
25 position that it has no duty to mitigate for loss of agricultural land separate from how that land
26 supports biological resources. Thus, other feasible mitigation measures for loss of agricultural
27 land, independent from biological impacts, are ignored.

28

SOLURI
MESERVE 7
A LAW
CORPORATION First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

27. The City's flawed strategy for mitigating impacts is based on a "working draft"

2 habitat conservation plan, the Placer County Conservation Plan (*PCCP"), that is unapproved,

3 and indeed has not even been released for public review.

4 28. CDFW sharply criticized the City's reliance on the "working draft" PCCP as the

5 extent of the City's duty to mitigate, explaining: "It is also incorrect to assume that if the PCCP

6 is adopted, the participation shall satisfy ALL mitigation requirements under CEQA."

7 Procedural History

29. The City released a notice of preparation ("NOP") for the Project in May of 2014.

9 The City received numerous comment letters raising concerns about the availability of water to

10 supply the Project, environmental impacts associated with water supply, impacts and mitigation

11 related to elimination of agricultural lands, compatibility issues associated with allowing urban

12 uses in close proximity to the remaining agricultural lands outside the Project area, and impacts

13 to biological resources, including wetlands and sensitive species.

14 30. The Draft Environmental Impact Report ("DEIR") was released on August 26,
15 2016, for the statutory minimum 45-day public comment period that ended on October 11, 2016.

16 CDFW identified numerous deficiencies in the DEIR's analysis and mitigation of biological

17 impacts. The Placer County Air Pollution Control District ("PCAPCD") raised concerns about

18 the DEIR's analysis and unsupported finding regarding the potential health risk impact to future

19 sensitive receptors within the Project due to emissions of toxic air contaminants, and
20 recommended mitigation measures to address the impact that the City rejected. Placer County,

21 the City Open Space Committee and California Farm Bureau Federation submitted comments
22 regarding the DEIR's failure to set forth adequate mitigation for agricultural impacts. Plaintiffs

23 also submitted public comments in these areas.

24 31. The City, its consultants, and Real Party held one or more meetings to discuss how

25 to respond to public comments on the Draft EIR. On information and belief, Real Party was a

26 decision-maker on whether to perform additional environmental review in response to requests

27 for additional study by the City of Rocklin, Placer County, CalTrans and other commenters.

28

SOLURI
MESERVE 8
A LAW
CORPORATION First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

Real Party was also a decision-maker on whether to impose additional mitigation for traffic
2 impacts and, if so, how to structure such mitigation.

3 32. On information and belief, the City and Real Party held numerous other meetings

4 regarding how to address other comments on the Draft EIR, as well as many other prior

5 meetings regarding the preparation and content of the Draft EIR. On information and belief,

6 Real Party was a decision-maker on issues including, but not limited to: whether and how to

7 analyze Project impacts, whether to identify impacts as significant, how to analyze mitigation

8 measures and project alternatives, and other substantive decisions concerning the approach to

9 the environmental review process required by CEQA.

10 33. On information and belief, neither the Draft EIR, nor Final EIR reflected the

11 City's independent judgment. The City released a Final EIR on July 19, 2017. The Final EIR
12 failed to respond in good faith to public comments made by Placer County, CDFW, PCAPCD,

13 the City Open Space Committee, California Farm Bureau Federation and Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs

14 submitted extensive comments detailing how the Final EIR's responses to comments were
15 inadequate and, in fact, reinforced the flaws in the DEIR's analyses.

16 34. On December 12, 2017, the City Council certified the EIR and approved the
17 Project. The City filed a Notice of Determination ("NOD") on December 14, 2017.

18 35. On information and belief, the City's certification of the EIR and the Project
19 approvals did not reflect the City's independent judgment.

20 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

21 36. This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this Petition pursuant to
22 Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5, and Public Resources Code sections 21167,

23 21168 and 21168.5.

24 37. Venue for this action properly lies in the Superior Court for the State of
25 California in and for the County of Placer pursuant to section 394 of the Code of Civil

26 Procedure.

27 38. This Petition is timely filed in accordance with Public Resources Code section
28 21167, subdivision (c). The City filed a NOD for the Project on December 14, 2017.

SOLURI
MESERVE 9
A LAW
CORPORATION First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

39. Plaintiffs have complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.5 in serving

2 notice of this action to the City on January 11, 2018. (Exhibit 1).

3 STANDING

4 40. Plaintiffs have standing to assert the claims alleged in this Petition because it is

5 beneficially interested in this matter, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 1086.

6 Plaintiffs live, work, and/or conduct business within unincorporated Placer County and will be

7 directly impacted by the Project. Unless the relief requested herein is granted, the environment

8 will be adversely affected and injured by the City's failure to comply with CEQA in approving

9 the Project and certifying the EIR.

10 41. Plaintiffs also actively participated in the administrative process conducted by the

11 City to determine the Project's environmental impacts and to ensure the City complied with

12 CEQA and all other applicable laws in processing the application for the Project.

13 IRREPARABLE HARM

14 42. The City's failures, set forth in this Petition, constitute a prejudicial abuse of

15 discretion within the meaning of the Code of Civil Procedure and CEQA. (See Code Civ. Proc.,

16 §§ 1085, 1094.5; Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21168, 21168.5.)

17 43. Plaintiffs have no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.

18 If the City's actions regarding the Project are effectuated, Plaintiffs and the environment will be

19 irreparably harmed. No money damages could adequately compensate for that harm.

20 PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL DOCTRINE

21 44. Plaintiffs bring this action as a private attorney general pursuant to Code of Civil

22 Procedure section 1021.5, and any other applicable legal theory, to enforce important rights

23 affecting the public interest.

24 45. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will confer a significant benefit on
25 the general public by requiring the City to carry out their duties under CEQA before approving

26 the Project.

27 46. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will also result in the enforcement

28 of important rights affecting the public interest by compelling the City to engage in a fair, a

CORPORATION First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

objective, and legally adequate analysis of the Project's environmental impacts, and to ensure

2 a that the public has a meaningful opportunity to review and comment on these impacts and

3 mitigation measures for that Project.

4 REQUEST TO PREPARE ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD

5 47. Plaintiffs elect to prepare the administrative record in this action pursuant to

6 Public Resources Code, section 21167.6, subdivision (b)(2).

7 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

8 Violations of CEQA

9 (Public Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.)

10 48. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained in

11 Paragraphs 1 through 47 as though fully set forth herein.

12 49. The City prejudicially abused its discretion in certifying the EIR. The City did not

13 proceed in the manner required by law and its decisions in approving the Project and certifying

14 the EIR are not supported by substantial evidence. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21168.5; Vineyard

15 Area Citizens for Responsible Growth v. City of Rancho Cordova (2007) 40 Cal.4th 412, 426.)
16 These legal deficiencies include, without limitation, the following:

17. The Project Description Is Vague, Incomplete, and Unstable

18 50. CEQA requires that an EIR include an accurate project description, and that the
19 nature and objective of a project be fully disclosed and fairly evaluated in an EIR. (San Joaquin

20 Raptor Rescue Center v. County of Merced (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 646, 655.) An EIR should

21 contain a "sufficient degree of analysis to provide decision-makers with information which

22 enables them to make a decision which intelligently takes account of environmental
23 consequences." (CEQA Guidelines, § 15151.)

24 51. The EIR's project description is deficient because numerous details of the
25 proposed Project are missing, inconsistent, or shifting throughout the administrative review

26 process, including, without limitation, the following:

27 a. The EIR claims that the proposed Agricultural Overlay Zone ("AG

28 Overlay") allows existing agricultural uses to continue. However, the EIR fails to

SOLURI
MESERVE 11
A LAW
CORPORATION First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

explain what existing uses will continue, or what constitutes a "new" agricultural use that

2 would require a discretionary use permit from the City.

b. The EIR fails to explain the compensatory ratio used to mitigate for the
elimination of agricultural land.

5 C. The EIR provides a shifting and legally inadequate description of the

6 sources of water supply for the Project and the infrastructure necessary to supply that

water.

d. The EIR provides inadequate description of those elements of the Project

9 requiring streambed alteration agreement from CDFW.

10 The EIR Fails to Adequately Define the Project's Baseline

11 52. In order to determine whether a project's impacts will be significant, CEQA

12 requires lead agencies to compare the impact of a proposed project to the "physical

13 environmental conditions in the vicinity of the project, as they exist at the time the notice of

14 preparation is published." These conditions serve as the project's "baseline." (CEQA
15 Guidelines, § 15125.) The description of a project's baseline ensures that the public has "an
16 understanding of the significant effects of the proposed project and its alternatives." (CEQA

17 Guidelines, § 15125, subd. (a).) Accurately determining the baseline environmental conditions

18 is crucial to accurately evaluating a project's impact. (E.g., San Joaquin Raptor/Wildlife Rescue

19 Ctr. V. County of Stanislaus (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 713.)

20 53. The EIR's description of baseline conditions is alternatively incomplete and

21 inaccurate, infecting and invalidating the entirety of the EIR's environmental analysis. These

22 flaws include, without limitation, the following:
23 a. The EIR fails to adequately describe the City's, PCWA's and NID's water

24 rights in sufficient detail to allow meaningful discussion of whether adequate supply

25 exists and the environmental impacts associated with supplying surface water to the

26 Project.

27 b. The EIR fails to adequately analyze and document existing ground water

28 conditions, including how susceptible the aquifer is to overdraft. In fact, the EIR

SOLURI
MESERVE 12
A LAW
CORPORATION First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

misleads the public by stating that ground water is stable when authoritative sources

2 provide that ground water levels in the area have been steadily declining over the past 40
0, years.

C. The EIR fails to adequately document and disclose the hydrologic
un connection between ground water in the area and Auburn and Markham Ravines.
o d. The EIR fails to adequately analyze and document the presence of special
NJ co status species and associated critical habitat in the area potentially impacted by the
Project.

9 The EIS/EIR Fails to Adequately Analyze Significant Environmental Impacts

10 54. CEQA requires that an EIR describe the proposed project's significant

11 environmental effects. Each must be revealed and fully analyzed in the EIR. (Pub. Resources

12 Code, § 21100, subd. (b), CEQA Guidelines, § 15126.2, subd. (a).)

13 55. The EIR fails to provide decision makers with sufficient analysis in numerous
14 respects including, without limitation, the following:

15 a. The EIR fails to adequately analyze and disclose the Project's impact on
16 loss of agricultural lands and production, including both direct conversion of agricultural

17 land and indirect interference with existing agricultural operations including the

18 prohibition on agricultural spraying, conflicts with Williamson Act contracts, and

19 cumulative agricultural impacts.

20 b. The EIR fails to adequately analyze whether water supplies exist to serve

21 the Project, including how those water supplies may be reduced as a result of global

22 climate change.

23 C. The EIR fails to adequately analyze the various environmental impacts
24 associated with supplying surface and ground water for the Project.

25 d. The EIR notes the need for groundwater modeling to determine impacts on

26 the aquifer from additional groundwater pumping due to the project, but defers such
27 modeling to a future undisclosed date.

9 h.

10 The EIR fails to adequately analyze the Project's operational human health
risk impacts resulting from exacerbating TAC emissions.

11 The EIS/EIR's Mitigation Measures are Legally Inadequate

12 56.

13 "An EIR shall describe feasible measures which could minimize significant
adverse impacts." (CEQA Guidelines, § 15126.4, subd. (a)(1).) An EIR may not defer the
14 formulation of mitigation measures to a future time, but mitigation measures may specify
15 performance standards that would mitigate significant effects and may be accomplished in more
16 than one specified way. "Impermissible deferral of mitigation measures occurs when an EIR

17 puts off analysis or orders a report without either setting standards or demonstrating how the
18 impact can be mitigated in the manner described in the EIR." (Preserve Wild Santee v. City of

19 Santee (2012) 210 Cal.App.4th 260, 280-281.)

20 57.

21 The EIR fails to set forth, and the City fails to adopt, all feasible mitigation

22 measures for significant impacts, including but not limited to the following:

a.

23 Project-level and cumulative loss of agricultural lands and indirect impacts
to agricultural operations.
24 b.

25 Biological impacts, due to the EIR's flawed assumption that compliance

26 with the "working draft" PCCP would satisfy all mitigation requirements under CEQA.

C.

27 Operational air quality impacts associated with exacerbating TAC-related
health risks to sensitive receptors located within the Project.

28 d. Impacts associated with supplying water to the Project.

MESERVE
A LAW 14

CORPORATION First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

58.

2 For example:
u The EIS/EIR improperly defers analysis and formulation of mitigation measures.

a. The EIR improperly relies on an unapproved and undisclosed "working

resources.

O draft" habitat conservation plan to mitigate for impacts to biological and agricultural

b. The EIR improperly relies on obtaining various future approvals and
agreements with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,
and CDFW to mitigate various biological impacts.

C.

10

11 The EIR improperly relies on merely obtaining a streambed alteration
agreement as mitigation for Project implementation actions requiring a streambed

12 alteration agreement.
d.

13

14 The EIR fails to adequately disclose all information necessary to assess the

15 effectiveness of the Project's reliance on "fair share" mitigation for various transportation
impacts.

e.

16 Since the City could not obtain firm written commitments from water

17

18 suppliers to provide water supply for the full Project, the City is instead deferring the

19 requisite analysis and commitment of water supply to future subdivision approvals.

59. Failure to Recirculate the EIR Due to Significant New Information
CEQA requires a lead agency to recirculate an EIR whenever the addition of
20 information, after the close of public comment, would deprive the public and public agencies

21

22

23 with the ability to comment "upon a substantial adverse environmental effect of the project or a

24 feasible way to mitigate or avoid such an effect (including a feasible project alternative) that the

25 project proponents have declined to implement." (CEQA Guidelines, § 15088.5, subd. (a);

26 Laurel Heights Improvement Ass'n v Regents of Univ. of Cal. (1993) 6 Cal.4th 1112.) Plaintiffs

27 submitted comments demonstrating that: (a) the Project's agricultural impacts were more

28 significant than disclosed in the EIR, and (b) the EIR failed to identify feasible mitigation
measures for admittedly significant agricultural impacts, including measures that had been

SOLURI
MESERVE
A LAW
CORPORATION 15
First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

adopted by other public agencies. The City violated CEQA by not recirculating the EIR upon

2 receipt of this information.

3 Failure to Adequately Respond to Comments

4 60. The FEIR offers conclusory statements, unsupported by specific reference to

5 explanatory information, that are insufficient to adhere to CEQA's public participation

6 requirements. (See CEQA Guidelines, § 15088, subd. (c); People v. County of Kern (1976) 62

7 Cal.App.3d 761.)

8 61. In particular, responses to comments including but not limited to Response A9-1,
9 A9-2, A9-3, A9-4, A9-5, A9-6, A9-7, A9-13, 11-3, 11-7, 11-11, 13-3, 13-6, 13-8, 13-9, 13-10,
10 13-11, 13-14, 13-23, 13-39, 13-40, 14-2, 14-3, 14-4, 14-5, 14-8, 14-914-11, 14-12, 14-13, 14-13,

11 14-14, 14-15, 14-16, 14-17, 14-18, 110-7, fail to meet CEQA standards for reasoned
12 consideration of public input.

13 Findings Not Supported By Substantial Evidence

14 62. The City's Findings violate the requirements of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines.

15 For example, the Findings fail to identify the changes or alterations that are required to avoid or
16 substantially lessen the Project's significant environmental effects (CEQA Guidelines, §15091,

17 subd. (a)(1); the Findings are not supported by substantial evidence (CEQA Guidelines, §

18 15091, subd. (b).) These deficiencies include, but are not limited to, the following:

19 a. The City's finding that the Project's impact on important farmland is

20 unavoidable.

21 b. The City's finding that the Project's conflict with Williamson Act contracts
22 is less than significant without the need for any mitigation.

23 C. The City's finding that the Project's impact on farmland is less than
24 significant without the need for any mitigation.

25 d. The City's finding that the Project's cumulative impact on important

26 farmland is unavoidable.

27 e. The City's finding that the Project's cumulative impact on farmland is

28 unavoidable.

5 The City's statement of overriding considerations for the Project.

6 63: EIR Does Not Reflect the City's Independent Judgment

7 CEQA requires a lead agency to prepare and circulate an EIR that reflects the lead
agency's independent judgment, and not the judgment of the project applicant. CEQA also
8 requires the lead agency to independently review and analyze the EIR that is prepared for a

9 project. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21082.1.) Even where an EIR is prepared by a project
10 applicant, the lead agency "is responsible for the adequacy and objectivity of the draft EIR."
11 (CEQA Guidelines, § 15084, subd. (e).)

12 64. The City failed to prepare and circulate an EIR that reflects the City's independent
13 judgment. The City allowed the Real Party to make decisions about how to prepare the EIR and
14 how to comply with CEQA, including, without limitation, whether and how to analyze Project

15 impacts, whether to identify impacts as significant, whether and how to structure mitigation for
16 significant impacts, and how to respond to public comments. On information and belief, the

17

18 EIR reflects the Real Party's judgment and not the City's judgment.
65.

19 By failing to prepare, circulate, and certify an EIR reflecting the City's

20 independent judgment, the City failed to proceed in a manner required by law.
WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray for relief as set forth below.

24 66. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1085, 1094.5.)
Plaintiffs incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained in
25 Paragraphs 1 through 65 as though fully set forth herein.

26 67. A writ of mandate must issue to correct a prejudicial abuse of discretion. A public
27 agency prejudicially abuses its discretion when it fails to hold a fair hearing or is otherwise

28 procedurally unfair. A fair hearing requires, at minimum, neutral and unbiased decision-makers.

CORPORATION First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

68. The City failed to proceed in a manner required by law, and abused its discretion,

2 by failing to hold a fair hearing and otherwise ensure that its decision-making for the Project

3 was procedurally fair.

4 69. On information and belief, the City was not neutral and unbiased in its decision-

5 making on the Project.

6 70. Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereon allege, that the City's decision-

7 making was based on undue and improper influence by Real Party outside the public record.

8 71. As just one example of Real Party's improper influence over the City's decision-
making for the Project, Real Party made substantive decisions regarding preparation and content

10 of the Project's EIR, which prevented the EIR from reflecting the City's independent judgment

11 regarding the Project, its environmental impacts, feasible mitigation measures and Project

12 alternatives, and other substantive and procedural requirements of CEQA.

13 72. The actions of the City as set forth herein constituted a prejudicial abuse of

14 discretion, denied Plaintiffs and other members of the public a fair hearing, and were in excess

15 of the City's authority and jurisdiction. The City failed to proceed in a manner required by law.
16 Plaintiffs are entitled to issuance of a writ of mandate, or other relief deemed appropriate by the

17 Court, to set aside the City's actions and approvals.

20 WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request the following relief and entry of judgment

21 as follows:

RE: Notice of Commencement of Action against the City of Lincoln

Dear Ms. Scanlon:

Please take notice, under Public Resources Code section 21167.5, that Scheiber
Ranch Properties, LP and Albert Scheiber intend to file a petition for writ of mandate under the provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code section 21000 et seq. ("CEQA"), against the City of Lincoln ("City") and Real Party in Interest Richland Developers, Inc. The petition challenges the City's December 12, 2017
certification of the Environmental Impact Report and various land use approvals for the
Village 5 project, a residential and commercial development on approximately 4,775
acres located outside the City's city limits, in its sphere of influence ("Project"). The lawsuit will be based on violations of CEQA, as discussed more fully in the Project's administrative and environmental review proceedings. The exact nature of the allegations and relief sought is described in the Petition for Writ of Mandate that Plaintiffs plan to file on January 12, 2018.

Very truly yours,
