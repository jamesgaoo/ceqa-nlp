22 Plaintiffs/Petitioners, R. Morgan Holland, and Save our Nipomo Neighborhoods

23 (collectively, "Petitioners"), allege upon information and belief as follows:

24 INTRODUCTION

25 1. Through this action, Petitioners challenge the County of San Luis Obispo and

26 San Luis Obispo Board of Supervisor's (collectively, "County") approval of a Conditional

VERIFIED PETITIONER FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

P Use Permit ("CUP") to SLO Cultivation, Inc. to establish an indoor cannabis cultivation

2 nursery and a non-storefront dispensary in the community of Nipomo. Petitioners also
3 challenge the County's reliance on and adoption of a Categorical Exemption. Petitioners
4 contend the County's decision to the Project is not exempt from CEQA because (1) the
5
County approved the Project in reliance on mitigation measures whose efficacy is highly 6
uncertain and (2) owing to special circumstances, the Project may cause significant 7

8 environmental impacts.

II. THE PARTIES

10 2. Save our Nipomo Neighborhoods or SONN, is an unincorporated association

11 that was formed after the Board approved the Project. SONN is dedicated to the protection of

12 the environment and thoughtful planning in the Community of Nipomo in San Luis Obispo

13 County. Some members of SONN live and/or work in Nipomo, in San Luis Obispo, in the
14 vicinity of the proposed Project. Some members of SONN appeared and opposed the Project
15 at the San Luis Obispo County Board of Supervisors ("the Board") where the Project was
16 discussed and finally approved.
17
3. R. Morgan Holland, is an individual who lives in the vicinity of the proposed 18

19 Project. Mr. Holland appealed the Planning Commission's approval of the proposed Project

20 to the Board, filed written comments in support of the appeal and thereafter, appeared at the

21 Board hearing to oppose the Project.

22 4. Respondent and Defendant County of San Luis Obispo ("the County") is a

23 local governmental agency and subdivision of the State of California with the authority to

24 regulate and administer land use and development within its territory, but only in compliance

25

26

VERIFIED PETITIONER FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 2

with the duly adopted provisions of its zoning ordinances, General Plan and all applicable

2 provisions of state law, including the Subdivision Map Act.

3 5. Respondent and Defendant San Luis Obispo Board of Supervisors or "the
4 Board" is the legislative body and highest administrative body of the County. The Board has
5
the ultimate authority to approve or disapprove subdivision maps, CUPs and other land use
6
I entitlements.
7
6.
8 Petitioner is informed and believes and, on that basis, alleges that the SLO

9 Cultivation, Inc. is the Real Party in Interest.

10 7. Does 51-100, inclusive, are persons, firms and/or entities that are presently

11 unknown to Petitioner who claim an interest in the subject matter of this action sufficient to

12 render their participation necessary for adjudication of issues raised in this lawsuit.

13 Petitioners are currently informed and believe that there are no such parties, but will amend

14 the Petition/Complaint as required to show their true name and capacity if any become
15 known.

16
III JURISDICTATION AND VENUE
17
8. The Superior Court has unlimited jurisdiction because Petitioner seeks
18

19 equitable and declaratory relief.

20 9. Venue is proper in San Luis Obispo County because the real property at issue

21 is located in San Luis Obispo County.

22 10. In pursuing this action, which involves enforcement of important rights

23 affecting the public interest and a large subsection of the population, Petitioners will confer a

24 substantial benefit on the general public and residents of San Luis Obispo County and

25 therefore will be entitled to attorneys' fees and costs pursuant to, inter alia, C.C.P. §1021.5.

VERIFIED PETITIONER FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 3

1 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

2 11. The proposed Project consists of the establishment of an indoor mixed-use

3 cannabis cultivation operation, an indoor cannabis nursery, cannabis processing operations,

4 and a non-storefront cannabis dispensary with the easterly 2.5-acre (108,900 square-foot)
5
section of an existing 5-acre greenhouse structure a and a new 3,000 square-foot prefabricated
6

7 building at 1808 Willow Road, in the northwest of the community of Nipomo.

8 Approximately half of the greenhouse would remain vacant and be separated from the

9 cannabis operations by a vinyl greenhouse partition wall. The westerly half of the greenhouse

10 is allegedly currently occupied and used for the cultivation of cucumbers.

11 12. The site currently includes the 5-acre greenhouse, as well as some vacant

12 portions, an avocado grove with a single-family residence, and two storage sheds located on

13 the northern-most parcel.

14 13. Surrounding land uses include active agriculture to the north, agriculture and

15 rural residential development to the east and west, and Willow Road and some rural
16 residential development to the south.
17
14.
18 The application for the CUP was processed using a relocated

19 Cooperative/Collective registration (CCM2016-00363) under Urgency Ordinance 3334.

20 Odor

21 15. Cannabis operations, including cultivation of mature plans, as well as drying

22 and processing of cannabis products, are known causes of potential nuisance odor. San Luis

23 Obispo County Cannabis Ordinance requires all cannabis operations to be operated in a

24 manner that ensures odors are not detected off-site. Structures used for cannabis activities are

25

26

VERIFIED PETITIONER FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 required to be equipped and/or maintained with sufficient ventilation controls, such as carbon

2 scrubbers, to eliminate nuisance odor emissions from being detected off-site.

3 16. According to the Staff Report, the Project will address cannabis odor by

4 deploying "carbon scrubbers on the existing greenhouse facility and 3,000 square-foot
5
processing and dispensary building", as well as by "using vapor phase technology to prevent
6
cannabis nuisance odors from drifting off-site."
7
17.
8 To address potential nuisance odor, this Project will employ a vapor odor

9 management system designed and manufactured by Byers Scientific. According to the Staff

10 Report, the system will include 6-inch diameter pipes around the perimeter of the easterly

11 half of the greenhouse rook, approximately 25 feet above ground level, which will

12 continuously release non-toxic vapor at each vent. In theory, as cannabis odor rises from the

13 indoor operations and exists through nursery vents, it will pass through the carbon scrubbers

14 and "through an invisible curtain of the non-toxic vapor" that is intended to neutralize the

15 cannabis odor.

16
18. The Staff Report claims the Byers Scientific system been successfully
17
implemented and has been demonstrated to be effective at eliminating cannabis odor from
18

19 indoor cannabis operations in Santa Barbara County. The Staff's contentions, however, are

20 misleading and not supported by substantial evidence. Members of the public, including

21 members of SONN, submitted credible evidence to the County that substantially rebuts the

22 Staff's contentions regarding the Byers Scientific system's track record and efficacy. This

23 evidence established that in many locations in Santa Barbara County, the Byers system has

24 been ineffective in addressing nuisance odor problems associated with cannabis operations.

25 This evidence further established that neither Santa Barbara County nor Santa Barbara

26

VERIFIED PETITIONER FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 County Air Pollution Control District (SBAPCD) has ever required the deployment of the

2 Byers system or made a formal finding or determination establishing that the Byers system is

3 effective in addressing nuisance cannabis odor.
4 19. The County concluded the Project's participation in an ongoing cannabis
5
inspection and monitoring ogram and expected investigation of neighbor complaints
6

7 regarding potential violations of the County Code or conditions of approval, "will help ensure

8 air quality is protected and odors are confined to the project site."

9 Parking

10 20. According to the Project application, the operation will "share" approximately

11 20 full-time employees with a company called Ocean Breeze international, Inc. to work on

12 both the cannabis and cucumber operations. The nursery, cultivation and processing
13 operations will occur between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., while the retail delivery

14 service will operate between 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m.

15 21. The applicant is required to provide 25 parking spaces on site. According to
16 the County's regular parking requirements, which are set forth in County Land Use
17

18 Ordinance §22.18.050, cannabis cultivation is considered a "Nursery Specialty" which

19 requires one parking space per 500 square feet of indoor floor area. The applicant, however,

20 requested a reduction of the parking requirement from 120 spaces to 25 spaces, which the

21 applicant claims will accommodate the actual number of employees associated with the
22 purposed cannabis use. The County granted this request because it concluded that cannabis
23 nursery is less labor intensive than other "nursery specialties", and also because the Project
& approval limits the number of potential employees to 20. 25

Procedural Allegations

2 22. The Planning Commission approved the CUP on November 8, 2017.

Petitioner R. Morgan Holland timely appealed the Planning Commission's approval to the

4
Board.

23. The Board conducted a public hearing on April 19, 2019, and after receiving
oral and written comments and objections, denied the appeal and approved the CUP on a vote
of 4-1. The Board also agreed with the Staff's recommendation that the Project was exempt

9 from review under CEQA pursuant to CEQA Guidelines §§ 15301 and 15303.

10 24. The County issued a Notice of Exemption on April 24, 2019. This Petition

11 was timely filed on May 29, 2019.

12 CEOA Mandates

13 25. CEQA was enacted to require public agencies and decision-makers to

14 document and consider the environmental implications of their actions before formal
15 decisions are made. Public Resources Code ("Pub. Res. C.") §21000, and to "[e]nsure that
16 the long-term protection of the environment shall be the guiding criterion in public
17
decisions." Pub. Res. C §21001(d). "CEQA was intended to be interpreted in such a manner
18

19 as to afford the fullest possible protection to the environment within the reasonable scope of

20 the statutory authority." 14 California Code of Regulations, (hereinafter cited as

21 "Guidelines") §15003(f), citing Friends of Mammoth v. Board of Supervisors, (1972) 8 Cal.
22 3d 247. "[T]he overriding purpose of CEQA is to ensure that agencies regulating activities

23 that may affect the quality of the environment give primary consideration to preventing
24 environmental damage. CEQA is the Legislature's declaration of policy that all necessary

25 action be taken "to protect, rehabilitate and enhance the environmental quality of the state."
26

VERIFIED PETITIONER FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

F Save our Peninsula v. Monterey County Board of Supervisors (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 99,

2 117, citing Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. v. Regents of University of California, (1988)

3 47 Cal.3d 373, 392; and Pub. Res. C § 21000.

4 26. The California Supreme Court "has repeatedly observed that the Legislature
5 intended CEQA to be interpreted to afford the fullest possible protection to the
6
environment within the reasonable scope of the statutory language." Sierra Club v. County of 7

8 Sonoma, (1992) 6 Cal. App. 4th 1307, 1315

27. 9 The lead agency must identify all potentially significant impacts of the Project,

10 and must therefore consider all the evidence in the administrative record, not just its initial study.

11 Pub. Res. C. §21080 (c), (d), §21082.2. CEQA Guidelines direct lead agencies to conduct an

12 Initial Study to "determine if the Project may have a significant on the environment.»

13 §15063(a). "All phases of the Project planning, implementation, and operation must be

14 considered in the Initial Study". CEQA Guidelines §15063(a)(1). Besides the direct impacts, the
15 lead agency must also consider reasonably foreseeable indirect physical changes in the
16 environment in the area in which significant effects would occur, directly or indirectly. See
17
CEQA Guidelines §15064(d) & §15360, see, also, Laurel Heights Improvement Assn, supra, 47
18
Cal. Ed at p. 392. 19
28. Where the CEQA environmental process is procedurally or substantively 20

21 defective, reviewing courts may find prejudicial abuse of discretion even if proper adherence to

22 CEQA mandates may not have resulted a in a different outcome. Pub. Res. Code §21005(a). For

23 example, the court in Citizens to Preserve Ojai v. County of Ventura (1985) 176 Cal.App.3d 421,

24 428 held that the certification of an EIR that had not adequately discussed the environmental

25 impacts of the Project constituted a prejudicial abuse of discretion even if strict compliance with

26

/ERIFIED PETITIONER FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 8

1 the mandates of CEQA would not have altered the outcome. Resource Defense Fund v. LAFCO

2 (1987) 191 Cal.App.3d 886, 897-8, went so far as to declare that failure to comply with CEQA

3 procedural requirements was per se prejudicial. Kings County Farm Bureau v. City of Hanford
(1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 692 explained that an agency commits prejudicial error if "the failure to
5
include relevant information precludes informed decision making and informed public
6
participation, thereby thwarting the statutory goals of the EIR process." Id., at p. 712. 7

29. The environmental review process under CEQA is intended assure the public that 8

9 "the agency has, in fact, analyzed and considered the ecological implications of its actions."

10 Laurel Heights Improvement Ass. v. Regents of the University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3rd

11 376, 392. The function of the environmental review is not merely to result in informed decision

12 making on the part of the agencies, it is also to inform the public so they can respond to an action

13 with which they disagree. Id.

14 30. In limited circumstances, an agency project approval may be exempt from
15 CEQA if it falls within one of 33 classes of exemptions enumerated under the CEQA
16 Guidelines. Guidelines 15061, subd. (b)(2), §§ 15300-15333. These "categorical
17
exemptions" are intended to apply to agency project approvals that clearly fall within a
18

19 predefined, specific type of activity that has been carefully analyzed and categorically found

20 to not have an individual or cumulative significant effect on the environment. Pub. Res. Code

21 21084, subd. (a); Guidelines §15061, subd. (b)(3) ("Where it can be seen with certainty that

22 there is no possibility that the activity in question may have a significant effect on the

23 environment, the activity is not subject to CEQA") (Emphasis added.)

24 31. In general, categorical exemptions are applicable to routine agency approval

25 actions, such as those affecting an individual residence or business with no consequence on
26

VERIFIED PETITIONER FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

F the surrounding community and environment. See Friends of Mammoth v. Board of

2 Supervisors (1972) 8 Cal. 3d 247 (1972) ("common sense tells us that the majority of private

3 projects for which a government permit or similar entitlement is necessary are minor in
4 scope- e.g., relating only to the construction, improvement, or operation of an individual
5
dwelling or small businessand hence, in the absence of unusual circumstances, have little or
6
no effect on the public environment."). If there is any "reasonable possibility" that a project or 7

8 activity may have a significant effect on the environment, an exemption is improper.

9 Guidelines § 15300.2, subd. (c); Wildlife Alive v. Chickering, (1976) 18 Cal. 3d 190, 205-06.

10 32. CEQA does not require public agencies to follow any particular procedure in

11 approving exempt projects, or to provide notice to the public or other agencies regarding its

12 determination that the activity is exempt. Nor is the agency required to provide an opportunity

13 to review and comment on the project, or to conduct a public hearing before on its

14 I determination that the project is exempt from review. San Lorenzo Valley Comm. Advocates

15 for Responsible Ed. v. San Lorenzo Valley Unified School District (2006) 139 Cal.App.4th
16 1356, 1358. The agency is not required to make any findings in support of an exemption
17 determination. CalBeach Advocates v. City of Solana Beach (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 529. 18
33. When an agency determines that a project is exempt, it may, but is not required 19

20 to, file a notice of exemption or NOE. Pub. Res. Code §21108, 21152, Guidelines $ 15062.

21 Filing an NOE triggers: 35-day statute of limitations on challenges to the agency's exemption
22 determination. An NOE must be filed, if at all, after the agency approves the project.

23 Guideline 15061.

24 34. Pursuant to Pub. Res. Code §21108(b) and Guidelines § 15062(a), an NOE

25 must contain the following elements:

26

VERIFIED PETITIONER FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

(1) A brief description of the project,
(2) The location of the project (either by street address and cross street for a project in an urbanized area or by attaching a specific map, preferably a copy of a U.S.G.S. 15'or 7-1/2'topographical map identified by quadrangle name).
(3) A finding that the project is exempt from CEQA, including a citation to the State Guidelines section or statute under which it is found to be
exempt, and
(4) A brief statement of reasons to support the finding.
35. Where, as here, the agency relies on a categorical exemption, the exemption
must be narrowly construed. Dehne v. County of Santa Clara (1981) 115 Cal.App.3d 827, 842.

36. According to the NOE, the County concluded that the Project was exempt from
10 environmental review under CEQA Guidelines §15301:
11
Section 15301. Existing Facilities
12 Class 1 consists of the operation, repair, maintenance, permitting, leasing,

13 licensing, or minor alteration of existing public or private structures, facilities, mechanical equipment, or topographical features, involving negligible or no
14 expansion of use beyond that existing at the time of the lead agency's determination. The types of "existing facilities" itemized below are not
15 intended to be all-inclusive of the types of projects which might fall within Class 1. The key consideration is whether the project involves negligible or no
16 expansion of an existing use.

17 37. Categorical exemptions are not absolute. A project that might otherwise be

18 categorically exempt must be denied if one of the following three exemptions apply:
19
There is a reasonable possibility of a significant effect on the 20

21 environment due to unusual circumstances (Guideline 15300.2(c));

22 Significant cumulative impacts from projects of the same type will

23 result (Guideline 15300.2(b));
24 In some cases, the project will have impacts on a uniquely sensitive

25 environment.

26

VERIFIED PETITIONER FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (Violation of CEQA)
c 38. Petitioners refer to and incorporate herein by this reference all preceding
V paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.
5
39. Petitioners contend that the San Luis Obispo Board of Supervisors abused its
6
discretion when it concluded the Project is exempt from CEQA review pursuant to CEQA
7
Guideline §15301. 8
40. 9 The Project does not fall within the scope of the exemption because there are

10 significant differences between cannabis cultivation and other types of indoor cultivation,

11 such as cucumber. Converting the facility to grow cannabis does not amount to mere

12 continuation of an existing operation. Moreover, the odor associated with cannabis is capable

13 of causing a significant impact not associated with any previous uses. The examples provided

14 in §15301 demonstrate that the use of this exemption is limited to circumstances where the

15 new project proposed for the "existing facility" will cause impacts that are the same or
16 substantially similar to the previous projects. Here, the odor problem potentially caused by
17
the new project (i.e. cannabis operations) is not similar to the impacts caused by previous
18
operations at the site. Moreover, the previous use of the site (i.e. cucumber or similar 19

20 cultivation) had never undergone any environmental review.

21 41. The County's determination that the project is categorically exempt was an

22 abuse of discretion and in violation of CEQA because "there is a reasonable possibility of a

23 significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances (Guideline 15300.2(c)).

24 See, Pub. Res. Code § 21084, subd. (a); Guidelines §15061, subd. (b)(3) ("Where it can be

25 seen with certainty that there is no possibility that the activity in question may have a

26

VERIFIED PETITIONER FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 12

1 significant effect on the environment, is the activity is not subject to CEQA").

2 42. Substantial evidence shows the Project can potentially a cause significant or

3 nuisance odor problem, which is considered a significant impact on the environment. This
4 potentially significant impact is caused by special circumstances which consists of the fact
5 that the Proposed Project (i.e. cannabis operations) is capable of causing substantially
6
different impacts compared to previous cultivation operations at the site.
7
43.
8 Another special circumstance is the fact that the County's regulatory

9 framework for approving this Project, i.e. the Cannabis Ordinance, itself was never reviewed

10 pursuant to CEQA. As such, the County has never considered the (a) effectiveness of the

11 blank regulation prohibiting cannabis cultivation operations from causing nuisance odor or

12 (b) the efficacy and feasibility of the Byers Scientific vapor system as mitigation for cannabis

13 odor. See, Azusa Landfill Reclamation Co. v. Main San Gabriel Basin Watermaster (1997)

14 52 Cal.App.4th 1165. Petitioners contend substantial evidence does not support the County's
15 implicit finding that the Project's potentially significant odor will be mitigated to a less than
16 significant level.
17
44. The County/Staff Report's claim that the Byers Scientific system has been
18

19 proven to be effective in addressing cannabis odor issues is not supported by substantial

20 evidence. This contention has been credibly contradicted by testimony of individuals who

21 live near cannabis operations in Carpentaria that use the same system. Evidence in the record

22 supports a conclusion nuisance odor from the cannabis operation in Carpentaria persist

23 despite the operator's use of the Byers system. Accordingly, Staff's conclusion that use of the

24 Byers Scientific system would adequately address the odor problem is contradicted by

25 credible evidence.

26

VERIFIED PETITIONER FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 13

1 45. The County's conclusion that the Project is exempt from review under CEQA

2 was abuse of discretion also because the County's conclusion that the Project would not

3 result in any significant environmental impacts is based on certain mitigation measures
4 whose efficacy and feasibility has not been established. These include use of the Byers
5 Scientific vapor system, and the County's monitoring and inspection program, which as of
6
the date of the Project approval, has not been formally adopted.
7
46. In any event, where, as here, the agency's approval relies on mitigation 8

9 measures or specific conditions for addressing potentially significant environmental impacts,

10 the project cannot be approved based on an exemption.

11 WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for judgment against Respondents and each of them

12 as explained below.

13 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

14 WHEREFORE, PETITIONERS pray:

15 (1) For declaratory judgment, stating that the County's approval of the SLO
