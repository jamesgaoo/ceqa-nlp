To Plaintiffs and Others Filing First Papers.

19 I. INTRODUCTION
20 1. This action challenges the December 5, 2018 decision of the City of Roseville and the
21 City of Roseville's City Council (collectively, the "City") to approve the Proposed "Campus 22 Oaks Commercial Project," HPCO PCL Co-21, -31, -41, -42, - Campus Oaks; PL 18-0080 (the
23 "Project"), located at 1495 Blue Oaks Boulevard, and approving the Addendum to the Hewlett- 24 Packard Master Plan Environmental Impact Report/Initial Study, and related findings of fact 25 and revisions to land use designations. The Project would allow, among other things, the 26 development of a 230,000 square foot of commercial space, and includes changing the land use 27 designation of approximately 10 acres from Business Professional to Community Commercial. 28 Respondents' approval was in violation of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"),

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Public Resources Code $ 21000 et seq., the CEQA Guidelines, Title 14 California Code of

2 Regulations, § 15000 et seq., and the State Planning and Zoning Law, Government Code §

3 65300 et seq.
4 2. The City's decision relies on an Addendum to the EIR and findings of fact that fails to

5 meet the minimum standards required under CEQA. Petitioners believe there will be a multitude

6 of unavoidable environmental impacts as a result of the Project.

7 3. The Addendum also failed to adequately analyze the significant impacts on
8 transportation/traffic, water quality, GHG emissions, urban decay, and health, and failed to
9 analyze California's goals of energy conservation, and the cumulative impacts of the Project on
10 the environment in violation of CEQA.

11 4. Petitioners Roseville Solidarity and David Turner ("Petitioners") request that this Court
12 vacate and set aside the Project and related approvals because the City failed to comply with
13 CEQA and applicable State Planning and Zoning Laws.

14 II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

16 Procedure sections 1085, 1094.5, 187, and 526 of the California Code of Civil Procedure, and

18 of mandate directing Respondents to vacate and set aside its approval of the Project under the

19 Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5.

20 6. Venue for this action properly lies in the Superior Court of Placer because Respondents

16 IV. STATEMENT OF FACTS

17 A. Project Background, Environmental Review, and Approvals
18 17. The subject of this action is the proposed "Hewlett Packard Commercial" Project, a
19 large commercial located at 1495 Blue Oaks Boulevard in Roseville, California. The Project
20 contemplates the development of a 230,000 square foot of commercial space with change in
21 land use designation for approximately 10 acres from Business Professional to Community
22 Commercial.

23 18. The original EIR for the Hewlett-Packard Master Plan ("EIR") was certified on June 5,
24 1996. At that time, the City acknowledged that the project had significant environmental
25 impacts, and adopted a Statement of Overriding Considerations which found that short term
26 emissions of NOx, ROG, SO2, and CO would be significant and unavoidable, as well as several
27 other environmental issues. The assessment was based solely on qualitative evidence and not
28 based on any quantitative data.

4

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

] 19. In 2001, the City approved revisions to the original Hewlett Packard Master Plan which

2 included designation and rezoning of 28.5 acres of land that were originally designated as

3 commercial/retail land use to light industrial use. The 2001 amendments eliminated commercial

4 uses altogether.

5 20. In 2015, the City prepared the Hewlett-Packard Campus Oaks Master Plan Amendment

6 ("HPCO"). The 2015 HPCO redesignated 198 acres of industrial land to a mix of residential,

7 business profession, community commercial, and tech/business park - light industrial, parks,

8 and recreation, open space, and public/quasi-public. The HPCO contemplated 948 dwelling

9 units, 60,000 square feet of office space on 53.54 acres 170,000 square feet of commercial space
10 on 19.29 acres, 30,000 square feet of tech/business park development on 32.85 acres,
11 1,2000,000 square feet of light industrial use on 129.24 acres, and 71.01 acres of parks, open
12 space, and public uses. The HPCO was approved in 2015.
13 21. The first amendment to the HPCO was approved in 2016. The 2016 Amendment
14 reconfigured the type of residential units available, but also and most importantly changed
15 parcel CO-21 from residential to Business Professional.

16 22. Neither the HPCO nor Addendum analyzed EO B-30-15, or analyze whether it would be

17 consistent with the reduction goals set forth in AB 32 or EO S-3-05.

18 23. The Project at issue concerns the redesignation of CO-21 and CO-31 from Business

19 Professional to Community Commercial.

20 24. The City did not prepare a supplemental or subsequent EIR, but rather prepared another
21 Addendum. The Addendum The 2018 Addendum to the EIR is dated October 16, 2018, was

22 published to the public on October 19, 2018, and was approved by the City Council on

23 December 5, 2018.

24 25. The City concluded that regardless of the more than twenty years that had passed since
25 the original EIR, the Project did not warrant a Supplemental or Subsequent EIR, stating that
26 CEQA did not require anything more than an Addendum regardless of the fact that the Project
27 will change the Campus Oaks Town Center from a mix of office and retail uses, to a complete
28 retail center.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

26. The Addendum determined that there

2 27. Despite substantial evidence to the contrary, the Addendum found no new impacts

3 potentially significant, new information requiring analysis, or new circumstances involving

4 significant impacts, including impacts to air quality, land use compatibility, noise,
5 transportation, utility systems, and crime, among others.
28. Petitioners submitted copious written comments on the Addendum identifying the

7 inadequacies of the documents, including, but not limited to:

8 a. Failure to acknowledge and/or analyze the new significant impacts from
9 redesignation of the parcels from Business Professional to Commercial on air
10 quality.

12 redesignation of the parcels from Business Professional to Commercial on
13 greenhouse gas emissions and the relationship to California's statewide GHG
14 reduction goals as set forth in AB 32 and executive orders.

15 C. The City failed to acknowledge and/or analyze the new significant impacts from
16 redesignation of the parcels from Business Professional to Commercial, and the
17 cumulative impacts of the change in designation on the environment to any
18 degree. There is absolutely zero discussion of the impact of a solely commercial
19 project on the area in conjunction with surrounding approved developments.
20 d. The City failed to acknowledge and/or analyze the new significant impacts from
21 redesignation of the parcels from Business Professional to Commercial on land

22 use, instead acknowledging the Project is includes drastic changes, but relying on
23 a vague assertion that the "changes introduced by the Project and/or new
24 circumstances relevant to the project would not, as compared to the 1996 EIR
25 and its Addendums, result in a new significant impact or significant impacts that
26 are substantially more severe than significant impacts previously disclosed." The

9 h. The City failed to acknowledge and/or analyze the new significant impacts from
10 redesignation of the parcels from Business Professional to Commercial on urban
11 decay caused by the Project.

12 29. Petitioners submitted comments prior to and after the Addendum was published,
13 highlighting the requirement that the City prepare a Supplemental or Subsequent EIR in an
14 effort to avoid costly litigation. Petitioners set forth that the Addendum included an inadequate
15 analysis of the Project's impacts on air quality, traffic, urban decay, congestion, land use, water
16 quality and water resources, greenhouse gas emissions, among other things, in an effort to avoid
17 the need to prepare an SEIR.

18 30. On October 25, 2018, the City of Roseville Planning Commission held a hearing on the

19 Project and recommended approval of the proposed Project to the City.

20 31. The Planning Commission received testimony in opposition to the approval of the
21 Project based on potentially significant environmental impacts from the redesignation of the
22 parcels from Business Professional to Commercial, including, but not limited to, impacts from
23 traffic, urban decay, air quality, land use compatibility, and impact on public services.
24 32. The Planning Commission was presented with new substantial evidence that the land use
25 approvals could result in significant environmental effects that had not been adequately

26 analyzed or mitigated in the Addendum, and for the fact the Addendum wholly failed to include
27 a cumulative impacts analysis.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- 53. Respondents have abused their discretion and failed to act as required by law in the

2 following ways:

3 VI. FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

4 (VIOLATION OF CEQA: Approval of the Addendum Does Not Comply with the
5 Requirements of CEQA: Process)

6 54. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth above.
A00 55. All no-exempt discretionary projects are subject to eh substantive and procedural
requirements of CEQA.
9 56. The City did not satisfy the minimum requirements of CEQA prior to approving the
10 • Project.

11 57. The City did not prepare and certify a supplemental or subsequent EIR which analyzed
12 the Project pursuant to PRC section 2116 and section 15162 or 15163 of the CEQA
13 Guidelines prior to approving the Project.
14 58. Or, alternatively, the City did not comply with the requirements of section 15152 of the
15 CEQA Guidelines which authorizes a "tiering process" for environmental review.
16 59. Or, alternatively, the City did not comply with the requirements of section 15153 of the
17 CEQA Guidelines which allows use of an EIR from an earlier project where the
18 circumstances of the projects are essentially the same.
19 60. CEQA requires a lead agency for project to comply with the requirements of the
20 CEQA statute, including the requirement to provide the Project and associated environmental
21 documentation for public review. The lead agency must provide sufficient environmental
22 analysis such that decision-maker can intelligently consider environmental consequences when
23 acting on proposed projects.
24 61. Respondents violated CEQA by approving an Addendum for the Project that is wholly
25 inadequate and fails to comply with CEQA, rather than preparing a SEIR. Among other things,
26 Respondents:

27 a. Failed to disclose, analyze, and/or mitigate the Project's significant impacts on
28 the environment, including but not limited to, the Project's impacts on global

10

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

F warming, urban decay, water quality and water resources, biological resources,
land use, air quality, aesthetics and public services and utilities;
0 t b. Failed to adequately analyze the significant cumulative impacts of the Project;

C. Failed to adequately analyze and mitigate the Projects impacts on traffic,

5 transportation, and congestion.

6 62. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by

7 approving the Project without preparing an SEIR in contravention of the requirements of

8 CEQA, and approving the Project in reliance on an inadequate Addendum. Accordingly,
9 Respondents' approval of the Addendum and approval of the Project must be set aside.

10 VII. SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

11 (VIOLATION OF CEQA: Traffic)

12 63. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth above.

13 64. Traffic and transportation impacts are recognized environmental effects to be considered
14 in an EIR, supplemental EIR, Addendum or negative declaration.

15 65. The traffic analysis prepared for the Project set forth data for vehicle trips based on land

16 use designation and supports Petitioners claims that a Commercial designation requires an

17 immense increase in the number of vehicle trips compared to the Business Professional land use

18 designation. The data suggests that there is an increase of 389% vehicle trips when the land use
19 is designated Commercial.

20 66. The City failed to evaluate potentially significant traffic impacts on its own, and instead

21 relied upon the analysis set forth by the project proponent that clearly shows an increase in

22 vehicle trips due to the land use change, yet wrongly concludes that the increase in traffic does
23 not trigger a need for an SEIR.

24 67. The City has substantial evidence that the Project has the potential to create significant

25 traffic impacts not adequately addressed in a CEQA analysis for the Project, including that the

26 City utilized out dated studies, had underestimated traffic impacts from the Project, and relied

27 upon otherwise inaccurate information that changing the land use from Business Professional to
28

11

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Commercial would have no effect on traffic, while simultaneously ignoring the data that shows

2 the tremendous increase in vehicle trips due to the land use change..

3 68. The City's decision to approve the Project is not supported by substantial evidence, and

4 the City abused its discretion by not preparing an SEIR to analyze the new significant
5 impacts/circumstances and/or substantially more severe impacts of the Project on the

6 environment without first complying with CEQA in addressing individual and cumulative

7 traffic impacts from the Project.

8 VIII. THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

9 (VIOLATION OF CEQA: Urban Decay)
10 69. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth above.
11 70. Urban decay is a physical changed caused by an economic effect and is recognized as an
12 environmental effect to be considered in an EIR or negative declaration.
13 71. The City did not adequately evaluate the Project's potential to cause urban decay in
14 Roseville and surrounding communities.

15 72. The City's decision to approve the Project is not supported by substantial evidence and

16 the City abused its discretion and acted in excess of its jurisdiction by approving the Project
17 without first complying with CEQA in addressing the individual and cumulative urban decay
18 impacts from the Project.

19 IX. FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

20 (VIOLATION OF CEQA; the City Failed to Adequately Respond to Comments)
21 73. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth above.
22 74. Respondents failed to comply with CEQA by failing to adequately and meaningfully
23 respond to comments submitted by Petitioners, the public, and other agencies and groups.
24 Respondents responses to the numerous comments provided related to the inadequacy of the
25 Addendum, the impacts air quality, hydrology and water quality, noise, transportation, urban
26 decay are conclusory, confusing, non-responsive, and wholly fail to meet the requirements of
27 CEQA.

28

12

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- 75. Respondents' failure to adequately respond to comments represents a failure to comply

2 with CEQA. Further, Respondents' inadequate responses are not supported by substantial

3 evidence.

4 X. FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

5 (Violations of State Planning and Zoning Law)

6 76. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth above.

7 77. Government Code section 65300 requires the legislative body of a city to adopt a

8 general plan for the physical development of the city. The general plan is essentially a document

9 for all future development to which all other land use decisions must conform. "Affected

10 citizens may challenge a permit that has been issued in violation of law." See Neighborhood

11 Action Group v. County of Calaveras (1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 1176, 1186.

12 78. The Project is inconsistent with the City's General Plan and required the City to amend

13 the General Plan to change the land use designation for the Project site from Business

14 Professional to Commercial.

15 79. The General Plan amendment, as approved, conflicts with policies and objectives of the

16 General Plan.

17 80. The Project is inconsistent with the City's zoning laws and required the City to change

18 the zoning from Business Professional to Commercial.

19 81. The Project is wholly inconsistent with the City's General Plan and related zoning laws

20 because the proposed Project conflict's with General Plan policies including, but not limited to,
21 the following: the Project may create patterns of transportation and circulation that conflict with

22 General Plan goals; the Project contains land uses that conflict with General Plan goals the

23 Project conflicts with design goals and policies; the Project may result in urban decay that
24 conflicts with economic and development goals; the Project will cause adverse air quality
25 impacts in contravention of air quality goals; and the Project may result in a lack of
economy, among other things, in conflict with 26 maintenance of : diverse and sustainable local

27 the General Plan's sustainability goals and policies.

28

13

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

F 82. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents did not proceed in the manner required

2 by law, and their decision to approve the Project was not supported by substantial evidence.

3 Accordingly, approval of the Addendum and approval of the Project must be set aside.
4 XI. SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION
(Violation of Due Process)
83. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations contained in

7 Paragraphs 1 through 126, above.

8 84. In carrying out and approving the Project, the City relied upon an Addendum and related
9 I documentation that was voluminous in nature and was provided to Petitioners less than a week
10 prior to the hearing held by the Planning Commission.
11 85. Roseville Solidarity and its members and other members of the public were not afforded

12 Due Process regarding the Project in that they did not have sufficient time to review and analyze
13 the Addendum and the underlying data prior to the vote by the Planning Commission.

14 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

15 WHEREFORE, the Petitioners pray for relief as follows:
