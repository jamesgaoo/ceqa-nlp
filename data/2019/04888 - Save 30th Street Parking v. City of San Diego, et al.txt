24 eliminating vehicle traffic lanes and parking spaces for the creation of special bike boulevards
25 on both sides of 30th Street in the City of San Diego. City's project also violates general plan
26 consistency doctrine due to direct conflicts with the North Park Community Plan, Bicycle

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

F (*Save 30th") brings this action to enforce both environmental and planning laws to demand

2 and ensure City's compliance.

3 2. On May 16, 2019, City, by and through its mayor Kevin Faulconer ("Mayor
4 Faulconer"),' committed to design and implementation of fully protected Class IV bikeway in

6 Juniper St. in the City of San Diego. Said project is hereafter referred to as "30th Street Bike
7 Boulevard Project" or "Project." Save 30th contends Mayor Faulconer's decision for the

8 Project violates state and local laws and should be ordered rescinded and set aside, and the

10 and only if, the laws and procedures regarding legislatively adopted plans and CEQA
11 environmental review are strictly followed.

2 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

3 4. Petitioner SAVE 30TH STREET PARKING ("Petitioner" or "Save 30th") is a

4 registered California Corporation in the State of California and County of San Diego that is

5 comprised of directors, officers, members, and supporters whom reside within the City of San

6 Diego and in and around the Project area. Save 30th has collectively formed and is currently

7 united for the purpose to monitor and ensure that laws are fully and faithfully complied with

8 during the planning, approval, and implementation of City actions such as the Project.

9 Petitioner has standing to enforce the laws alleged herein that are designed to provide for sound

10 planning and control of development to protect and not degrade community values, and enforce

11 laws that require the evaluation and minimization of adverse environmental impacts resulting

12 from the same. The process and decisions of City to select and approve the Project will have

13 detrimental impacts on Petitioner, its members, and the general public, who reside in and

14 around the Project site.

15 5. Respondent City of San Diego ("City") is a charter city form of a local public

16 government agency and subdivision of the State of California that is charged with complying

17 with applicable provisions of state law, including the California Environmental Quality Act
18 ("CEQA"), the general laws of this State, the California Constitution, and the city charter,
19 municipal code and other regulations of the City of San Diego. For the purposes herein, the
20 "City" includes all of its departments, officers, city council members, city council president,

21 mayor, and other appointed and/or elected persons charged with the duties and obligations as

22 alleged herein. City made the final approval and commitment of City to the Project through the

23 May 16, 2019 decisional memorandum of mayor Kevin Faulconer.

24 6. Respondent Kevin Faulconer is the mayor of the City of San Diego ("Mayor

25 Faulconer") and is sued herein in his official capacity as the City official who approved and

26 committed City to the Project and directed City staff to implement the Project through a May

27 16, 2019 decisional memorandum.

12 written notice to City on May 29, 2019 (requesting rescission and compliance with laws) prior

13 to filing this action, giving further written notice about this specific CEQA action being filed,
and has no other remedy other than to bring this action.

14 IL.

15 FACTUAL, LEGAL, AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND GIVING RISE TO THIS ACTION

16 A. Legal Doctrine Regarding General and Community Plans

17 10.

18 A general plan, as may be encompassed and more specifically delineated in an

19 adopted community plan, is required to adopted and followed by City for all planning and

20 development approvals according to Cal. Government Code 8 65300. The legislatively adopted

21 land use and circulation designations sits atop the hierarchy of local government law regulating

22 all development and decision-making - whether public or private projects. A community plan
and general plan governs any further development within a city or county such that any and all
23 development must be consistent with the adopted community and general plans.

24 11.

25 City recently adopted the North Park Community Plan on October 25, 2016, as
the most specific and applicable general plan document that sets forth specific land and
26 circulation designation and uses, with affiliated land use and circulation maps, for the Project

27 area.

2 City adopted a Bicycle Master Plan on or about December 2013 to designate,
plan and implement City's bicycle network and overall roadway and bikeway infrastructure.

13.

4 The Project is not included or otherwise contemplated by the General Plan,
North Park Community Plan, or Bicycle Master Plan.

5 B. Legal Doctrine Regarding CEQA

6 14.

7 In 1970, the California Legislature enacted the California Environmental Quality

8 Act ("CEQA") (Public Resources Code §21000, et seq.), along with the authorized agency-

9 adopted CEQA Guidelines (14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15000 et seq.), as a means of requiring public

10 agency decision-makers such as City to document and consider the environmental implications

11 of approving or implementing any "project" or "action" as defined by the legislature or clarified
by the courts of this state. CEQA's fundamental goal is to fully inform and provide full
12 participation of the public, other agencies, and decision-makers as to the environmental
13 consequences of an agency's actions and to assure members of the public and other agencies that

14 elected officials are following state laws and making informed decisions. CEQA requires
15 governmental authorities, such as City to use all feasible means to reduce or avoid significant
16 environmental damage that otherwise could result from its actions. CEQA forbids agencies from

17

18 approving projects with significant adverse impacts when feasible alternatives can reduce,
eliminate, or otherwise lessen such impacts.

19 15.

20 The cornerstone of the CEQA process is the preparation of an environmental
impact report (EIR) which is designed identify, study, and discloses all potential adverse
21 environmental impacts which may result from the proposal or approval by a lead agency such

22

23 as City. The primary function of the environmental impact report is to discuss the important

24 environmental consequences and to inform decision-makers, responsible agencies and the

25 general public of additional or alternative mitigation measures, project elements, or project

26 designs to the project that would lessen adverse environmental consequences.

16.

27 Under CEQA, where there is no reasonable probability (or "fair argument") that any

28 adverse impacts may result from an agency action, the preparation of a Negative Declaration or
Mitigated Negative Declaration is appropriate. The California Supreme Court and the Legislature

- 5 -

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

have clearly spoken and ruled that where a project may have a significant effect on the

2 environment, an EIR must be completed before a project is approved. When any question, doubt or

3 uncertainty is present about potential significant effects, there is a strong presumption in favor

4 of requiring preparation of an EIR.

5 17. The procedure required to be followed for subsequent projects under a program

6 or master plan or program tiered EIR requires a formal CEQA environmental determination

7 whether the subsequent project was examined at a sufficient level of detail in the prior and

8 tiered EIR. To do this, an initial study is required to list and disclose potential impacts and an

9 environmental determination must be made whether a later project may cause significant

10 effects on the environment that was not examined in the prior EIR.

11 18. Any attempt or effort of City to exempt the Project from CEQA must be strictly

12 construed and exemptions are not to be unreasonably expanded through implied exemptions.

13 C. Factual Background

14 19. The Project was conceived and promoted by City councilmember Chris Ward

15 who, on March 12, 2019, tweeted out a plan to create new designated bike lanes on 30th Street.

16 (See https://twitter.com/ChrisWardD3/status/1105559361760387072, last accessed August 13,

17 2019.) Councilmember Ward's tweet included a pamphlet with a range a of possible

18 development options for consideration and decision.

19 20. On May 14, 2019, City and councilmember Ward noticed and directed the North
20 Park Planning Committee (NPPC) to consider and recommend one of Ward's three options for

21 the 30th Street Bikeways Project. The NPPC voted 7-6 vote to recommend the Option A -

22 which included two segments of protected bikelane for 30th Street as being from (a) Howard

23 Ave. to Upas St. and (b) from Upas St. to Juniper St.).

24 21. Two days later, on May 16, 2019, Mayor Faulconer decided that Option A would

25 be the plan for development for City and directed City staff to proceed with final design.

26 22. Prior to May 16, 2019, no notice was given about the Project by City about any
27 intent to disclose or approve the Project pursuant to CEQA.

2 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION - PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

3 Violation of the California Environmental Quality Act
(Cal. Public Resources Code § 21000 et seq.; 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15000 et seq.)

5 23. Petitioner hereby realleges and incorporates by reference 11 1-22 above as

6 though fully set forth herein.

7 24. City is the decision-making body that approved the Project. Whether City

8 approves a project through its staff, mayor, or elected body, a project must comply with CEQA

9 and the general/community plan consistency legal requirement.

10 25. The Project may result in both direct and reasonably foreseeable indirect

11 physical changes in the environment because of the impacts of the elimination of

12 approximately 500 parking spaces, traffic lane reduction/elimination, along with the placement

13 of cone or other lane dividers, prevention of pedestrian and vehicular access, and with the

14 effects of said changes including but not limited to increased street and intersection traffic

15 congestion, parking in nearby residential areas, public safety, pollution, and greenhouse gases.

16 26. The Project may also result in additional direct and reasonably foreseeable

17 indirect significant adverse impacts but Petitioner, members of the public, other agencies, and

18 City decision-makers themselves may not know of them because City has undertaken no study

19 and made no decision about possible environmental impacts arising from the Project. Where
20 no CEQA study and/or determination is made, the duty to identify and disclose potential

21 impacts the City's; not Petitioner's or the public's responsibility.

22 27. The Project qualifies as a "project" subject to CEQA pursuant to Public

23 Resources Code section 21065.

24 28. At the time of the approval of the Project on May 16, 2019, or subsequent

25 thereto, City has not noticed, conducted, or made any CEQA determination for the Project.

26 29. City violated CEQA by committing itself to a definite course of action when the

27 Mayor approved "Option A" and directed City staff to proceed with final development plans
