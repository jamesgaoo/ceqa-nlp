24 Petitioner Placer County Residents for Legal Compliance (*Petitioner") petitions this Court
25 for a Writ of Mandate, directed to Respondents Placer County and the Placer County Board of

26 Supervisors ("County" or "Respondents"). Petitioner challenges Respondents' May 28, 2019,
27 certification of an Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") and approval of PLN16-00298: the Placer

28 County Retirement Residence Minor Use Permit and Zone Reclassification ("Project"). Petitioner

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief
Placer County Residents for Legal Compliance v County of' Placer, et al. Placer County Superior Court

contends that Respondents' approvals for the Project violate the California Environmental Quality

2 Act, Public Resources Code section 21000 et seq. ("CEQA"). Also, the Project is inconsistent with

3 the Granite Bay Community Plan and the Zoning Ordinance contrary to the State Planning Laws.

4 (Government Code § 65300 et seq.) Petitioner alleges as follows:

5 PARTIES

6 Placer County Residents for Legal Compliance ("PCRLC") is an unincorporated association

7 with members who live within the immediate vicinity of the Project. PCRLC is dedicated to
8 preventing environmental degradation and to the improvement of the environmental quality in the
9 neighborhoods in Placer County. PCLRC members participated in the administrative process leading

10 up to the County's approval of the Project, objecting to the Project and warning the County of the

11 illegalities defined in this lawsuit. The maintenance and prosecution of this action will confer a

12 substantial benefit on the public by protecting the public from environmental harms alleged herein

13 and by ensuring that the County abides by the procedures required under the law in approving

14 development projects like the one at issue here. PCRLC is beneficially interested in this matter

15 because it has a direct interest in ensuring that Respondents fulfill their duties to comply with CEQA,

16 State law, and the County's own ordinances. PCRLC has an interest in preserving and protecting, for
17 the general public, the environment and character of Placer County.

18 2. Respondent Placer County is a political subdivision of the State of California and a body

19 corporate and politic exercising local government power. Placer County is the CEQA "lead agency"

20 for the Project. As lead agency for the Project, Placer County is responsible for preparation of an

21 environmental document that describes the Project and its impacts, and, if necessary evaluates

22 mitigation measures and/or alternatives to lessen or avoid any significant environmental impacts.

23 The County also has principal responsibility for determining whether projects within its jurisdiction

24 are consistent with the County general plans, community or specific plans, applicable land use

25 ordinances, and other applicable laws.

26 3. Respondent Placer County Board of Supervisors is a legislative body duly authorized under

27 the California Constitution and the laws of the State of California to act on behalf of the County of

28 Placer. Respondent Placer County Board of Supervisors is responsible for regulating and controlling

2
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief
Placer County Residents for Legal Compliance v. County of Placer, et al., Placer County Superior Court

1 land use within the County including, but not limited to, implementing and complying with the

2 provisions of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines, 14 California Code of Regulations, title 14,

3 section 15000 et seq. (the "Guidelines"), applicable land use ordinances and other laws. As the

4 elected representatives of the people of the County, the Board of Supervisors establishes overall

5 County priorities and sets policy. The Board of Supervisors is the governing body of the County and

6 is ultimately responsible for reviewing and approving or denying the Project.

7 Real Party in Interest Cierra Auburn LLC is a limited liability company formed pursuant to

8 the laws of the State of California with its principal place of business in Sacramento, California.

9 Cierra Auburn LLC is the owner of the Project site and one of the Project applicants.

10 5. Real Party in Interest Lenity Architecture, Inc. is a corporation formed pursuant to the laws of

11 the State of Oregon, registered to do business in the State of California. Lenity Architecture, Inc. is

12 one of the Project applicants.

13 6. Petitioner is unaware of the true names and identities of DOES 1 through 20 and 21 through

14 40, inclusive, and sues such unnamed Respondents and Real Parties in Interest respectively, by their

15 fictitious names. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that fictitiously

16 named Respondents and Real Parties in Interest also are responsible for all acts and omissions

17 described above. When the true identities and capacities of Respondents and Real Parties in Interest

18 have been determined, Petitioner will, with leave of Court if necessary, amend this Petition to include

19 such identities and capacities.

20 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

21 This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this Petition pursuant to Code of Civil

22 Procedure section 526, 527, 1085, 1087, and Public Resources Code section 21168.5. In the

23 alternative, this Court has jurisdiction pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 and Public

24 Resources Code section 21168.

25 8. Venue for this action properly lies in the Superior Court for the State of California in and for

26 the County of Placer pursuant to sections 393, 394 and 395 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

P BACKGROUND FACTS

2 The Project site is 8.7 acres located at 3905 Old Auburn Road, at the northwest corner of the

3 intersection of Sierra College Boulevard and Old Auburn Road in Granite Bay, California. It is within

4 the Granite Bay Community Plan ("Community Plan"). The Project is bound on the south by Old

5 Auburn Road and to the west by Sierra College Boulevard. The areas surrounding the Project include

6 residential development to the south, rural residences to the west and north, and a mixture of high and
7 low-density residential development to the east. The Project site is undeveloped a supports a mix of

8 native and non-native habitat.

9 10. The proposed development consists of a single, three-story building 34' 4 tall, containing

10 145 congregate living suites for residents 55-years of age and older, with two manager dwelling units

11 on site for a total of approximately 155,000 square feet. The Project includes a change in zoning from

12 Residential Single-Family, combining Agriculture, combining Minimum Building Site of 100,000

13 square feet (RS-AG-B-100) to Residential Agriculture, combining Minimum Building Site of

14 100,000 square feet (RA-B-100). The Project includes 101 parking spaces, including 28 covered

15 spaces and 68 open spaces. The County staff report indicates that "[t]he purpose of the proposed

16 Rezone is to allow the proposed project to occur in its proposed location."

17 11. The proposed project is a congregate living model consisting of private resident suites

18 centered around common amenities and services provided to all residents. All services are provided

19 with monthly rent including three daily meals, all utilities (other than personal phone), housekeeping,

20 linen service, private van transportation, and an extensive schedule of activities and classes. The

21 facility would operate as a month- to-month tenancy, and there are no upfront "buy-in" costs. No

22 medical care is provided, and the project would not be licensed by the State to provide care.

23 According to data provided from the applicant based on operations at other facilities owned by the

24 applicant across the country, the County concluded that 80 percent of residents of the proposed

25 project would come from within 10 miles of the project site and a typical resident would be a single

26 person in their late 70s or early 80s. Approximately 10% of the rooms are anticipated to be rented by

27 couples, resulting in an expected building population of 160 residents.

28

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief
Placer County Residents for Legal Compliance v. County of Placer, et al., Placer County Superior Court

1 12. The Project required the following entitlements: Minor Use Permit to allow for the

2 construction and operation of a "Residential Care Home for seven or more clients as required by the

3 RA-B-100 (Residential Agriculture, Combining Minimum Building Site of 100,000 Square Feet)."

4 The Project also required the Zone Reclassification described above.

5 13. Access to the site would be from Old Auburn Road. A gated Emergency Vehicle Access

6 (EVA) road is proposed from Sierra College Boulevard and would only be accessible by emergency
7 vehicles. Internal circulation would be via loop road around the structure. Development is

8 concentrated near the center of the site. The Project's landscaping includes patios, walkways, and

9 undeveloped open spaces areas. The site's southern and eastern edges contain a perennial stream,

10 Treelake Tributary, which is a tributary to Linda Creek. The project proposes a trail along the

11 southern portion of the site, which includes a span bridge over the stream.

12 14. Additional improvements include frontage and road improvements on Old Auburn Road. The

13 project proposes a "Modified Frontage" improvement that deviates from the "Recommended" Old

14 Auburn Road improvements as outlined in the Community Plan. Because the proposed improvement

15 deviates from the Community Plan, the County granted a Design Exception to construct the modified

16 frontage improvements.

17 15. The Draft EIR ("DEIR") for the Project was released for public review on December 20,

18 2018, and various comments were received from neighbors, neighborhood groups, members of the

19 public, and other public agencies. On May 22, 2019, a letter was submitted by HansenBridgett on

20 behalf of Defend Granite Bay, and the letter described in detail the flaws in the EIR's Project

21 description and the resulting failures of the EIR to function as an informational document and provide

22 an adequate analysis of Project impacts as a result of the false assumption that this unlicensed facility

23 will be a Residential Care Home and not a Senior Housing Project.

24 16. Comment letters raised, among other things, the following issues: (1) the fact that the Project

25 description was erroneous, characterizing the Project as a Residential Care Home rather than

26 accurately identifying the Project as a congregate Senior Housing Project; (2) traffic impacts were not

27 adequately analyzed; (3) land use compatibility was not adequately analyzed; (4) parking impacts

28

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief
Placer County Residents for Legal Compliance v. County of Placer, et al., Placer County Superior Court

- were analyzed under the wrong zoning designation; and (5) failure to adequately analyze Project
2 alternatives.

3 17.

4 On January 24, 2019, the Placer County Planning Commission held a hearing on the Project

5 to allow public comment and thereafter made a recommendation to the Board of Supervisors to
Certify the EIR and approve the Project.

6 18.

7 On April 3, 2019, the Granite Bay Municipal Advisory Council considered the Project, and

8 voted 3 to to recommend denial of the Project by the County decision makers because of concerns
about lack of deed restriction (potential for change of use to hotel, etc.), inconsistency with the
9 Community Plan, and that the Project is too large for the Project site.

10 19.

11 On May 28, 2019, the Placer County Board of Supervisors held a hearing, approved the
Project and certified the EIR.

12 20.

13 On May 28, 2019, Respondents filed a Notice of Determination with the County Clerk of
Placer County as provided for in Public Resources Code, section 21152.

14 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

15
16 ||21. AND INADEQUACY OF REMEDY

17 Petitioner has performed any and all conditions precedent to filing the instant action and has

18 exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent required by law.
22.

19 Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code, section 21167.5 by

20 mailing written notice of this action to the Respondents. A copy of this written notice and proof of
service are attached as Exhibit A to this Petition for Writ of Mandate.

21 23. Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.6 by concurrently filing a
22 request concerning preparation of the record of administrative proceedings relating to this action.

23 24.

24 Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law unless this

25 Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to set aside their approval of the

26 Project and adoption of the Negative Declaration. In the absence of such remedies, Respondents'
approval will remain in effect in violation of State law.

27 25.

28 This action has been brought within 30 days of the filing of the Notice of Determination as
required by Public Resources Code section 21167(c).

6
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief
Placer County Residents for Legal Compliance v. County of Placer, et al., Placer County Superior Court

1 STANDING
2 26. Petitioner has standing to assert the claims raised in this Petition because Petitioner's

3 aesthetic, environmental and property interests are directly and adversely affected by Respondents'

4 certification of the EIR and approval of the Project.

5 ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS ACTIONS
6 27. Petitioner brings this action on the basis, among others, of Government Code section 800, and

7 other applicable laws, which award Petitioners' attorneys' fees in actions to overturn agency

8 decisions that are arbitrary and capricious, such as the decisions here in question.

O FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

10 Violation of CEQA, Public Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.

11 28. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein, as if set forth in full, cach and every allegation

12 contained in paragraphs 1 through 27.

13 29. CEQA is designed to ensure that the government agencies incorporate the goal of long-term

14 protection of the environment into decisions that may affect the environment. CEQA applies to any

15 discretionary action taken by an agency that may cause reasonably foreseeable change in the
16 environment.

17 30. CEQA also mandates that the lead agency adopt feasible and enforceable mitigation measures
18 that would reduce or avoid any of a project's significant environmental impacts.
19 31. The County's approval of the Project constitutes a discretionary act that triggers it obligation

20 to comply with CEQA.

21 32. In approving the Project as described herein, Respondent County prejudicially abused its

22 discretion in violation of CEQA pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21168 and Code of Civil

23 Procedure section 1094.5, because the County certified an EIR that fails to include information

24 necessary for informed decision making and informed public participation, including information

25 necessary to reach informed conclusions regarding the significance of the Project's environmental

26 impacts, the effectiveness of mitigation measures to avoid the Project's significant environmental

27 impacts, or feasibility of mitigation measures to reduce the Project's significant environmental
28 impacts; because the EIR fails to lawfully assess the Project's cumulative effects; because the EIR

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief
Placer County Residents for Legal Compliance v. County of Placer, et al., Placer County Superior Court

fails to use the best available information and/or accepted methodology for analyzing information;

2 because the Final EIR fails to provide good faith responses to comments on the Draft EIR; because

3 the County failed and refused to provide a stable, finite Project description by obscuring the fact that

4 the Project at issue is not a "Residential Care Home" but a "Senior Housing Project," and did so in

5 order to avoid the more stringent parking and other requirements as well as the need for a

6 reclassification of the Project site to Commercial zoning; because, with respect to the findings

7 required by CEQA, the County failed to make required findings, failed to support the findings with

8 substantial evidence, and failed to disclose the analytic route showing how the evidence supports the

9 findings.

10 33. Petitioner alleges that the County violated CEQA as detailed in a number of comment letters

11 submitted by members of Petitioner organization and others during the administrative review process.

12 Petitioner intends to prosecute all of the alleged violations of CEQA described herein and in the
13 documents submitted by members of the public and other agencies during the administrative review

14 process. By way of illustration, and without limitation, Petitioner alleges the following violations of

15 CEQA by the County:

16 A. The EIR for the Project contains an inaccurate Project Description

17 34. The EIR contains a project description that is false and misled the public and the decision

18 makers. For purposes of avoiding the necessity of re-zoning the Project site to Commercial as would

19 be required for a "Senior Housing Project" as defined in the Placer County Zoning Ordinance, the
20 County identified the Project as a "Residential Care Home" as defined in the Zoning Ordinance, as a

21 "group care facility," "providing for twenty-four hour non-medical care of persons in need of

22 personal services, supervision or assistance essential for sustaining the daily living for the protection
23 of the individual." The Zoning Ordinance definition of a Residential Care Home describes a facility

24 that must be licensed by the California Department of Social Services (Health & Safety Code §§

25 1569.1, 1569.2, 1569.5), and yet the County claims that the facility will not be licensed by the State.
26 The Project is actually a Congregate Care Facility providing non-medical services requiring no
27 licensing and is therefore no an allowable use under Residential Agricultural Zoning, and falls within

28 the Zoning Ordinance definition of a "Senior Housing Project." The EIR contains the obfuscation in

8
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief
Placer County Residents for Legal Compliance v. County of Placer, et al., Placer County Superior Court

1 order to avoid parking and other requirements that would be associated with being honest about the

2 nature of the Project. The Project Description is not merely misleading, it is an intentional

3 mischaracterization of the Project in order to avoid compliance with the Zoning Ordinance, the

4 Community Plan, and CEQA.

5 35. The Project will not provide "care of persons in need of personal services, supervision or

6 assistance essential for sustaining the daily living for the protection of the individual" as would be

7 required to qualify as a Residential Care Home under the Zoning Ordinance. If the Project would

8 provide such care, it would require a license from the State, and the County has asserted that it does

9 not require such a license. In fact, the EIR states the following: "the services provided by the project

10 however are essential for daily living and include meals, housekeeping and linen services,
11 entertainment, and transportation." These services are not "essential for sustaining daily living for the

12 protection of the individual." is The Project is a Senior Housing Project as defined in the Zoning

13 Ordinance and is not an allowable use under Residential Agricultural Zoning.

14 B. Traffic and Parking:
15 36. The record reveals that the Project will have significant traffic impacts that were not
16 adequately addressed. In analyzing traffic, the EIR uses trip counts for a "congregate care facility."

17 The analysis failed to include the roadway segment of Old Auburn Road between Sierra College

18 Boulevard and the County line. The EIR estimates that the Project will generate 294 daily trips to this

19 segment and those impacts were not addressed.
20 37. The Cumulative Conditions calculations in the EIR rely on mitigation to the surrounding area

21 provided for in the Granite Bay Capital Improvement Plan ("CIP") such as Douglas Boulevard

22 6 widening to 6 lanes between Sierra College Boulevard and Cavitt Stallman Road, and all lanes of

23 Sierra College Boulevard to be widened to 6 lanes. There is not currently funding with the Granite

24 Bay CIP for these improvements, and so the "mitigation" of the Project's impacts will not occur as
25 described in the EIR.

26 38. The Project's parking impacts will be significant because the Project is a Senior Housing

27 Project that requires Commercial zoning, and under the appropriate zoning designation the Project

28

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief
Placer County Residents for Legal Compliance v. County of Placer, et al., Placer County Superior Court

-

2 would be required to provide approximately twice the number of parking spaces currently included in
the Project.

C. Land Use Impacts:

4 39.

5 As noted by the Granite Bay Municipal Advisory Council, the Project in inconsistent with

6 neighboring uses, and the 3-story structure will impact ascetics and neighborhood environmental
values in a significant way.

7 40.

8 As set forth in detail above and in comment letters submitted to the County, the Project was

9 described as a Residential Care Home in the EIR, when it is actually a Senior Housing Project that is
not an allowable use within Residential Agricultural zoning.

10 D.

11 41. The EIR failed to include a reasonable range of alternatives
CEQA requires an EIR to examine a range of reasonable alternatives that would feasibly
12 obtain most of the project objectives, but avoid or substantially lessen any significant adverse effects
13 of the project. (CEQA Guidelines § 15126.6.)

14 42.

15 The EIR failed to include any feasible alternatives, and went through the motions by
comparing the proposed Project with three homes, or an alternative that would reduce the height of
16 the facility by one foot. These are not alternatives that would obtain most of the Project objectives

17

18 while reducing impacts. These were infeasible alternatives that would not reduce impacts, and

19 allowed the County to check the box and say that the EIR includes an alternatives analysis despite the
fact that it is meaningless.

20 E. Other CEQA violations:

21 43. Respondents inappropriately deferred the performance of necessary investigations, studies or
22 inquiry with respect to the development of mitigation measures and provided no performance
23 standards, criteria or specific guidance with respect to future studies used to develop mitigation

24 measures.

25 44. The EIR fails to provide substantial evidence to support Respondents' conclusions that the
26 Project will not have a significant effect a on the environment and the CEQA findings are insufficient.
27 45.

28 As a result of Respondents' failure to comply with the procedures required by CEQA and the
CEQA Guidelines, a preemptory writ of mandate must issue ordering Respondents to set aside the

10
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief
Placer County Residents for Legal Compliance v. County of Placer, et al., Placer County Superior Court

l environmental findings and the related decision, and directing Respondents to comply with the
2 procedures mandated by CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines before acting on any development

3 proposal under the Project.
t SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
Violation of General Plan Laws - Government Code §§ 65300 et seq.;
6 Code of Civil Procedure 1085

7 46. Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 45.

8 47. Government Code Section 65300 requires the legislative body of each county to adopt a

9 general plan (and provides for associated specific and community plans) for the physical
10 development of the county. The general plan is often called a "constitution" for future development
11 to which all other land use decisions must conform. Accordingly, any decision of the County
12 affecting land use and development, including approving use permits, must be consistent with the
13 general plans. See Neighborhood Action Group v. County of Calaveras (1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 1176,
14 1182-86.

15 48. The Project violates the State Planning and Zoning Law, Government Code section 65000 et

16 seq. because the Project is not consistent with, and does not comply with, mandatory requirements of

17 the Granite Bay Community Plan.

18 49. Respondent' approval of a Project that is inconsistent with mandatory provisions of the
19 applicable land use plan was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and a failure to proceed
20 according to law.

21 50. The "modified" frontage contained in the Project approval is inconsistent with the

22 Community Plan. Further, the Project is a commercial use that is inconsistent with the zoning

23 approved as part of the Project, and is also inconsistent with the Community Plan.
24 51. The Residential Agricultural designation does not allows commercial uses such as the Senior
25 Housing Project.

26 52. Because the Project is inconsistent with the Granite Bay Community Plan and the Zoning

27 Ordinance, Respondents' approval of the Project violated State Planning and Zoning Law and must

28 be set aside.

11
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief Placer County Residents for Legal Compliance v. County of Placer, ct al., Placer County Superior Court

P 53. Respondents' conculsory findings of plan consistency, moreover, are inadequate as a matter

2 of law and are not supported by substantial evidence. The findings consist of simple checkboxes and

3 conclusory statements that the Project is consistent, without any meaningful discussion, failing to
4 demonstrate how the Project's large-scale, commercial development on a small parcel is consistent

5 with the Community Plan and Zoning Ordinance. Additionally, the County failed to articulate the

6 connection between its findings and the evidence in the record in contravention of the California

7 Supreme Court's decision in Topanga Association for a Scenic Community v. County of Los Angeles

8 (1974) 11 Cal.3d 506.

9 54. Because (1) Respondents did not proceed in the manner required by law, (2) their decision as

10 arbitrary and capricious, and (3) their decision was not supported by substantial evidence, the

11 County's approval of the Project should be set aside as set forth in the Prayer below.

12 PRAYER

13 Wherefore, Petitioner respectfully requests the following relief and entry of judgment as
14 follows:

15 1. For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing Respondents to vacate and set aside

16 the certification of the EIR and approval of the Project and to withdraw the Notice of

17 Determination for the Project;

18 For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing the County to comply with CEQA,

19 the CEQA Guidelines, and the State Planning and Zoning Law, and to take any other action

20 required by Public Resources Code section 21168.9 or as otherwise required by law;
21 3. For a temporary stay, temporary restraining order, and preliminary and permanent injunctions
22 restraining County and Real Parties in Interest and their agents, employees, officers and
23 representatives from undertaking any activity to implement the Project in any way pending

24 full compliance with CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines, and the State Planning and Zoning Law;

25 For a declaration that Respondents' actions in approving the Project violated CEQA and the
26 State Planning and Zoning Law as set forth above;
27 For Petitioner's attorneys' fees under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5 and other

28 applicable authority;
