PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 Petitioner Ventura County Coalition of Labor, Agriculture, and Business ("Petitioner" or

2 "CoLAB") seeks a writ of mandate and declaratory and injunctive relief against Respondent County
3 of Ventura ("County" or "Respondent"), and alleges as follows:

4 I. INTRODUCTION

5 1. This Petition challenges the County's March 12, 2019 and March 19, 2019 decision
6 to adopt the ordinance entitled, "County-Initiated Proposal to Amend the General Plan and Articles
7 2, 3, 4, 5, 9 and 18 of the Non-Coastal Zoning Ordinance (PL16-0127) to Establish a Habitat
8 Connectivity and Wildlife Corridors Overlay Zone and a Critical Wildlife Passage Areas Overlay
9 Zone, and to Adopt Regulations for These Areas; Find that the Proposed Amendments are Exempt

10 from Environmental Review Under the California Environmental Quality Act."("Ordinance"). The
throughout the County.
impacts to 3 11 ostensible purpose of the Ordinance is to establish a wildlife corridor
IjeLPaN g Japng NEINE 12 Despite the laudable purpose-and CoLAB supports reasonable efforts to minimize
13 wildlife movement within the County--many of the Ordinance's regulations are legally flawed and
14 scientifically unsupportable. Moreover, the Ordinance is fatally in conflict with the County's
15 General Plan.

16 2. When it adopted the Ordinance, the County ignored the command of the California
17 Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") to weigh and evaluate the project's impacts across a broad
18 spectrum of impact categories, to address those impacts through the imposition of feasible
19 mitigation measures to reduce their significance, and to consider alternatives that could avoid or
20 lessen significant impacts while accomplishing the basic objectives of the project. Had the County
21 complied with CEQA here, that review would have provided the County's decision makers with a
22 scientifically sound and accurate basis upon which to protect wildlife movement and corridors.

23 3. But the County conducted no environmental review whatsoever. Instead, the County
24 made the erroneous and legally unsupportable determination that the Ordinance-which imposes
25 stringent new zoning regulations over 163,000 acres of land within the County-is exempt from
26 CEQA. As a result, the Ordinance likely will cause potentially significant environmental impacts,
27 unintended consequences, and negative effects to property owners throughout the County. The
28 Ordinance purports to improve countywide habitat connectivity between areas such as the Santa

2 65773375v1
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 Monica Mountains National Recreation Area and the Los Padres National Forest. But rather than

2 conducting the necessary studies to ensure that effective and factually-supportable measures were

3 taken, the County relied on outdated studies from over 13 years ago and made regulatory decisions

4 based upon conjecture and speculation, in the hope evidence would later arise to justify those
5 decisions-evidence that never materialized.

6 4. Had the County complied with CEQA, the significant environmental effects of the

7 Ordinancesuch as its impacts to wildfire hazards, mineral resources, agricultural resources, air
8 quality, greenhouse gases, community character, and traffic and circulation-would have been
9 identified, studied, and mitigated or avoided. In light of the region's long history of severe wildfires,
10  including the recent fires that tragically devastated the region, the County's refusal to study and
11
3 mitigate the increased wildfire risks the Ordinance poses is reckless, and cannot be allowed to stand.
Butler & Mitchell sjeBuem Jayof JMBM 12 5. The County also violated CEQA by unlawfully piecemealing its review of the
13 Ordinance. The Ordinance was originally contemplated as part of a General Plan update, which is
14 currently undergoing appropriate environmental review, including the preparation of an

15 Environmental Impact Report ("EIR"). But to evade CEQA review, the County unlawfully
16 segmented the Ordinance from the General Plan update and claimed the former was simply exempt
17 from CEQA. The County further segmented the Ordinance, which applies only in the County's non-
18 coastal zone, from similar proposed regulations intended for the coastal zone.
19 6. In addition to the CEQA violations, the County's Board of Supervisors ("Board")
20 also failed to comply with Government Code §§ 65855 and 65857 by making significant changes
21 to the Ordinance and acting on it without first referring the matter back to the Planning Commission.
22 7. The Ordinance also lacks a factual basis. Significant portions of the Ordinance are
23 the product of arbitrary and capricious decision-making and are unsupported by substantial
24 evidence. Rather than analyzing the scientific evidence or conducting an appropriate scientific
25 inquiry and then making appropriate regulatory decisions on the basis of the facts, the County did
26 the opposite: it made regulatory decisions first, and then engaged in a post-hoc scramble to find
27 evidence to support those decisions. In fact, without notification or any documents providing a
28 scientific analysis or reasoning, the County arbitrarily added and subtracted lands from the

65773375v1 3
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 Ordinance maps, without a defined procedure, before and after the Planning Commission hearing,

2 8. The Ordinance is facially void because it violates the due process rights of County
3 residents, under both the state and federal constitutions, and contravenes principles of equal

4 protection, as there was no rational basis for the County's decision to treat landowners within the
5 arbitrarily-chosen overlay zones differently than other landowners within the County.

the 9. The Ordinance also amounts to a regulatory taking, given its impacts upon
7 reasonable and distinct investment-backed expectations of those it effects. Further, the Ordinance 6

8 is both inconsistent with the General Plan and violates the Williamson Act.

9 10. Finally, the County violated the Surface Mining and Reclamation Act ("SMARA")
10 due to failure to follow proper procedures involving state regulatory oversight authorities when

11 mining resources are implicated. 3 wlaypaw g Japng 11. Ultimately, rather than taking the required time to study the issues and generate an sje8uew Jayaf 13 ordinance that would actually address the objectives of the County with regard to wildlife movement 12

14 and habitat protection, the County instead hastily drafted and enacted an Ordinance in manner WENI 15 contrary to law and that does not even accomplish its desired objectives.

12. A writ of mandate is appropriate here to stop the enforcement and effectiveness of
17 the Ordinance, at least until the County fulfills its basic CEQA duty of properly analyzing and 16

19 members of the public, through comment letters and at public hearings. Declaratory relief also is 18 mitigating the extensive significant environmental impacts identified in the record by countless

20 appropriate to address the multiple conflicts with State and federal law.

21 II. THE PARTIES

Petitioner Ventura County Coalition of Labor, Agriculture, and Business is a 501(c)6
23 non-profit membership organization formed in 2010 to support land-based and industrial businesses 22 13.

including farming, ranching, oil, mining, and service, and to promote sensible and rational local
25 government, CoLAB identifies and researches issues that impact businesses, and works with 24

26 regulatory agencies, organizes stakeholders and proposes solutions to problems that impact Ventura

27 County. CoLAB advocates for businesses through local regulation, providing expertise, research
28 and educational campaigns to inform the public.

4 65773375v1
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

14. CoLAB and its members, including those members who own property and operate

2 businesses in Ventura County, have beneficial, operational, environmental, educational, and

3 scientific interests in the Project area. These interests are germane to CalCIMA's purpose and will

4 be directly and adversely affected by the Project, which violates provisions of law as set forth in this

5 Petition and which would cause irreversible harm to the natural environment. CoLAB and its

6 members have a direct and beneficial interest in the County's compliance with CEQA, the CEQA

7 Guidelines (14 CCR § 15000 et seq., "Guidelines"), and California State Planning and Zoning Law.

8 Further, the maintenance and prosecution of this action will confer a substantial benefit on the public
| by protecting the public from the environmental and other harms alleged herein,

10 15. Respondent County of Ventura is a county of the State of California existing under
11 the Constitution of the State of California with the capacity to sue and be sued. As used herein, the 9
lleupaw gJapng sje8uew Jayaf 12 term "County" includes, but is not limited to, the Board of Supervisors, the Planning Commission,
13 County employees, agents, officers, boards, commissions, departments, and their members, all
14 WaN equally charged with complying with duties under the County Municipal Code, and with the laws
15 a of the State. The County is a political subdivision of the State of California, and is responsible for
16 regulating and controlling land use in the territory of the County, including implementing and
17 complying with the provisions of CEQA. The County is the "lead agency" for the purposes of Public
18 Resources Code Section 21067, with principal responsibility for conducing environmental review
19 of the proposed actions. The County has a duty to comply with CEQA and other state laws.
20 16. Petitioner does not know the true names or capacities, whether individual, corporate,
21 associate or otherwise, of Respondent Does through 25, inclusive, and therefore sues said
22 Respondents under fictitious names. Petitioner will amend this Petition to show their true names
23 and capacities when and if the same have been ascertained.

24 II. JURISDICTION, VENUE AND EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

25 17. This Court has jurisdiction under California Code of Civil Procedure sections 1094.5
26 and 1085 and Public Resources Code sections 21168, 21168.5, and 21168.9.

27 18. Venue is proper in this Court because the causes of action alleged in this Petition
28 arose in Ventura County, and all parties are located or do business in Ventura County.

5 65773375vl
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

19. Petitioner complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code § 21167.5 and §
2 California Code of Civil Procedure § 388 by serving on Respondent County written notice of

3 Petitioner's intention to commence this action on April 25, 2019. A copy of the proof of service is
4 attached hereto as Exhibit A.

5 20. Petitioner has performed all conditions precedent to filing the instant action, and has
6 exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent required by law. Petitioner
7 appeared before the County prior to the adoption of the Ordinance, submitted extensive written and

8

9 oral comments, and objected to the approval of the Project.

21. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedies in the ordinary course of the

9
Mitchell 10 law unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate and requires Respondent County to set
11 aside its adoption of the Ordinance until appropriate CEQA review is undertaken.

12 IV.

& sjaQuew Jayaf Butler 13 THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT

22.

JMBM CEQA, Public Resources Code § 21000, et seq., is based upon the principle that "the
14 I maintenance of a quality environment for the people of this state now and in the future is a matter
15 of statewide concern." (Pub. Res. Code § 21000(a).) In CEQA, the Legislature established
16 procedures designed to achieve these goals-principally, the Environmental Impact Report ("EIR").
17 These procedures provide both for the determination and for full

19 require a public disclosure of the potential
18 adverse effects on the environment of projects that governmental agencies propose to approve, and

20

21 description of feasible alternatives to such proposed projects and feasible mitigation
measures to lessen their environmental harm. (Pub. Res. Code § 21002.)
23. CEQA is not merely a procedural statute; it imposes clear and substantive
22 responsibilities on agencies that propose to approve projects, requiring that public agencies not
23 approve projects that harm the environment unless and until all feasible mitigation measures are
24 employed to minimize that harm. (Pub. Res. Code §§ 21002, 21002.1(b).)

25 24. CEQA defines a project as "the whole of an action, which has a potential for resulting
26 in either a direct physical change to the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical
27 change in the environment." (CEQA Guidelines § 15378(a).) In this case, the "project" as defined
28 by the County is the passage of the Ordinance. The adoption of a zoning ordinance is a project

65773375v1 6
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

under CEQA. Enactment and amendment of zoning ordinances are specifically listed under
2 examples of discretionary projects in CEQA. (Public Resources Code Section 21080(a).) The Staff

3 Report also acknowledges that the Ordinance is a project. (March 12, 2019 Staff Report at pp. 15-
4 16.) Also, Section 4.2 of the County's Administrative Supplement to the State CEQA Guidelines

5 lists the enactment and amendment of zoning ordinances as "projects" subject to CEQA. Recent
6  case law also makes it clear that a zoning ordinance is a project subject to CEQA if it may cause
7 either a direct physical change in the environment or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical

8

9 change in the environment. (Union of Medical Marijuana Patients, Inc. v. City of San Diego (2016)
4 Cal.App.5th 103.) Because the Ordinance's purpose is to cause physical changes to the
10 environment by changing how private and public land is managed, the adoption of the ordinance is
11
9 subject to CEQA,
• & Mitchell Mangels 12 25. The failure either to comply with the substantive requirements of CEQA or to carry

: WENÍ 13 out the full CEQA procedures so that complete information as to a project's impacts is developed
14 and publicly disclosed constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion that requires invalidation of the
15 public agency action regardless of whether full compliance would häve produced a different result.

16 (Pub. Res. Code 21005.) Agencies may not undertake actions that could potentially have a
17 significant adverse effect on the environment, or limit the choice of alternatives or mitigation
18 measures, before complying with CEQA. (CEQA Guidelines § 15004(b)(2).)

19 26. Section 4.1 of the County's Administrative Supplement to the State CEQA Guidelines
20 states that "with all County-initiated projects environmental considerations should be incorporated
21 into project conceptualization, design and planning at the earliest feasible time. All County
22 agencies/departments governed by this Administrative Supplement shall not undertake a project that

23 would have a significant adverse effect or limit the choice of alternatives or mitigation measures,
24 before the completion of CEQA compliance."
25 V.

26 FACTS COMMON TO ALL CAUSES OF ACTION

A. PROCEDURAL HISTORY

27 27. In April 2011, the Board adopted revisions to the Ventura County Initial Study
28 Assessment Guidelines ("Assessment Guidelines") that recognized habitat connectivity and wildlife

65773375vI 7
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 corridors as important considerations when evaluating potential impacts of discretionary
2 development. As of 2011, the County evaluated impacts to wildlife movement corridors as part of
3 the CEQA review

4 process of discretionary projects and imposed mitigation measures where

5 appropriate. The County's general plan, land use maps, non-coastal zoning ordinance ("NCZO"),
Coastal Zoning Ordinance ("CZO"), subdivision ordinance, and assessment guidelines all (prior to
6 the enactment of the Ordinance) provided opportunities for regulating impacts of discretionary

7 actions to wildlife movement corridors.

8 28. In 2015, the Board approved a consultant contract a for a comprehensive General Plan
9 Update ("GPU") that included consultant work on a "Wildlife Corridors Program." The consultant

& Mitchell LLP 10 hired to conduct the Wildlife Corridors Program was the same one hired to conduct the
11

Mangels 12 comprehensive GPU analysis. (Ventura County General Plan 2017 Annual Report at pages 15-16.)
29.

Poe JMBM : The County originally intended to-and announced it would--conduct a "complete
13  environmental review" of the Wildlife Corridors Program pursuant to CEQA: "After obtaining
14 comments from all groups, including affected County agencies, property owners, and stakeholders,
15 staff will finalize the draft documents, complete environmental review and conduct adoption
16 hearings before the Planning Commission and the Board of Supervisors." (Id. at p. 16 [emphasis
17| supplied].)

18 30.

19

20 Subsequently, the Board "elected to complete this project ahead of the GPU

21 schedule," and voted to sever the Ordinance from the General Plan process. In doing so, the County
claimed that its enactment of the Ordinance was exempt from CEQA and abandoned the original
intent for the project to undergo CEQA review. Petitioner is informed and believes and on that basis
22 alleges the procedural maneuvering by the County to piecemeal and remove the Wildlife Corridors
23 Program from the General Plan Update process was a direct effort to avoid CEQA review, for a
24 project that plainly has potentially significant environmental impacts.

25 31. The Planning Commission considered a draft of the Ordinance at a nine-hour public
26 hearing on January 31, 2019 at which hundreds of interested parties and stakeholders expressed their
27 concerns with the Ordinance. The community was especially concerned with ensuring CEQA
28 review, ensuring the

65773375vl accuracy of the mapping process and data, guarantecing an appeals process to

8
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 address remaining inaccuracies in the mapping and any lack of fit of the regulations to a specific a
2 property or area, and clarifying and correcting certain problems in the Ordinance relating to fire
3 hazards, security lighting, mapping errors and water features.

4 32. After close of the public hearing and deliberations, the Planning Commission voted

5 to adopt a resolution recommending that the Board approve the Ordinance, subject to the Planning

6 Division: (1) researching and providing information to the Board concerning specified issues; and

7 (2) making certain revisions to the proposed amendments to the General Plan and NCZO for
8 presentation to the Board. The Planning Commission also proposed eleven revisions to the

9 Ordinance for consideration by the Board.

10 33. The Board considered the Ordinance and Planning Commission recommendations at
11 a public hearing on March 12, 2019. Again, hundreds of citizens expressed their concerns regarding 3
laypW g Japng sjeßuew Jayaf 12 the Ordinance in written and oral comments.

13 34. The Board made several significant changes to the draft Ordinance on the day of the

JMBM 14 public hearing, including 1) increasing the buffer zone (where vegetation modification is severely
15 limited) around water features from 100 feet to 200 feet, and 2) making significant changes to the
16 maps and overlay zones created by the Ordinance, substantially increasing its coverage. The
17 Board's revisions effected changes to the Ordinance that impacted hundreds of thousands of acres
18 of land.

19 35. However, the County's representation and description of the scale of the Ordinance
20 remained inaccurate and unstable. The areas included in the maps attached to the Staff Report
21 included areas within the Coastal Zone. However, the Ordinance did not include amendments to
22 the County's existing CZO. As explained in the Board of Supervisors' Staff Report and Draft
23 Ordinance, the Ordinance would amend the both the County General Plan and the NCZO. The Staff
24 Report and Draft Ordinance do not include proposed amendment of the CZO, despite the inclusion
25 of these areas in maps released to the public and the Board of Supervisors. Amending the CZO
26 would require the approval of the California Coastal Commission, and environmental review
27 associated with that approval. Nevertheless, the County included those areas in maps circulated the
28 public, misrepresenting the scope and effect of the Ordinance.

9 65773375vl
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

36. Government Code section 65857, provides in respect to the adoption of zoning
2 regulations that, "[t]he legislative body may approve, modify or disapprove the recommendation of
3 the planning commission; provided that any modification of the proposed ordinance or amendment
4 by the legislative body not previously considered by the planning commission during its hearing,

5

6 shall first be referred to the planning commission for report and recommendation, but the planning
commission shall not be required to hold a public hearing thereon." However, here, the Board did
7 not refer the matter back to the Planning Commission after making these major changes, as was

8 required by Government Code section 65857. Instead, the County brought the revised Ordinance
9 back before the Board for a final decision on March 19, 2019. The Board also refused to hear public
10  comment in respect to the major proposed revisions.

11
3 37.

llaypajw gJapng Jeffer Mangels Moreover, the County failed to provide notice to the public of the revisions to the
12 Ordinance, leading to much substantial confusion. Even the March 19, 2019 staff report itself
13 acknowledged that the last-minute changes to the Ordinance were significant, and required

JMBM 14 additional procedural steps: "Planning Division staff realized that" the changes made by the Board
15 (adding thousands of acres to certain overlay zones while subtracting thousands of acres from other
16 overlay zones) were so significant, that they would require "reconsideration of the approvals."
17 38.

18 Nevertheless, the matter was never re-opened for public comment, and the public

19 was not given an opportunity to consider, analyze, and opine on these important changes.

B. SUMMARY OF ORDINANCE

20 39. The principal regulations of the Ordinance are established through the
21 implementation of overlay zones: the Habitat Connectivity and Wildlife Corridor (*HCWC")
22 Overlay Zone and Critical Wildlife Passage Area ("CWPA") Overlay Zone.

23 1.

24 40. Habitat Connectivity and Wildlife Corridor (HCWC) Overlay Zone

25 The asserted purpose of the HCWC Zone is to preserve functional connectivity of
regional habitat linkages by minimizing the impacts of barriers, habitat fragmentation, and corridor
26 chokepoints. In total, approximately 163,000 acres are designated as HCWC within the County,

27 41. The broad HCWC Zone, as maintained in the County GIS, imposes five major
28 conditions upon development and/or use, applicable to new construction, reconstruction, addition,

65773375v1 10
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 modification, alteration, relocation, and replacement of structures, or alteration of a physical site,
2 within all properties in the mapped HCWC Zone:

3 Surface Water Feature Buffers. Development of new structures, new uses of existing

4 structures, or vegetation removal within 200 feet of a surface water feature (lake, pond,

5 creek), as mapped by the National Wetlands Inventory, is prohibited without a discretionary

6 Planned Development Permit from the County, triggering CEQA compliance.

7 Outdoor Nighttime Lighting. All outdoor lighting installed after the Ordinance effective

8 date, and all existing lighting, within 1 year of the effective date of the Ordinance, must be
9 (a) fully shielded fixtures, (b) shall have maximum installation heights (varies), (c) shall be

10 restricted on the chromaticity scale, and (d) shall have a maximum brightness specifications
11 (measured in lumens) per fixture. Other compliance criteria are required for security lighting, 9 Neypww gJapng 12 parking area lighting, outdoor recreation area lighting, service station lighting, wireless sjeBuew Jayal 13 communication facility lighting, and greenhouse lighting. Non-compliant lighting must be

14 turned off between 10 pm and sunrise. WEINL 15 Wildlife Crossing Structure Buffers. Vegetation removal within 300 feet of a high-
16 functioning wildlife crossing structure or within 100 feet of a moderately-functioning
17 wildlife crossing structure is prohibited without a Planned Development Permit, triggering
18 CEQA compliance.

19 Invasive Plant Species. Invasive plants not commercially grown for agricultural markets
20 may not be planted in the HCWC Zone.

21 Wildlife Impermeable Fencing. Wildlife Impermeable Fencing (*WIF") is defined as
including one or more of the following design features, (a) greater than 60 inches above 22

23 ground level, (b) electrified, or (c) solid walls or fencing or wrought iron, plastic mesh,

24 woven wire, razor wire, chain link fencing. WIF on lots zoned as Open Space or Agricultural

25 Exclusive, are restricted, and may only be permitted through either a ministerial or
26 discretionary permitting process.

27 a, WIF may be permitted via the ministerial permitting process if (a) new fencing will

28 not enclose more than 10 percent of a lot gross area containing no existing WIF, (b)

11 65773375v1
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 fencing will not enclose more than 10 percent of a lot gross area containing existing
2 WIF, including new and existing WIF. WIF must have 24-inch unobstructed gaps

3 every 50 feet to not qualify as an enclosure.

4 b. If not exempt or otherwise available through a ministerial permit process, WIF may

5 be permitted via the discretionary permitting process by applying for a Planned

6 Development Permit, triggering CEQA compliance.

7 2. Critical Wildlife Passage Area (CWPA) Overlay Zone

8 42. In addition to the HCWC Zone, the County has proposed three even more restrictive
9 overlay zones in certain areas that it has deemed to be particularly "critical," the CWPAs. Because
10 the three CWPA Zones are subsets of the HCWC Zone, properties located within CWPAs are also

3 11 subject to 100% of the HCWC regulations.
1LypW gJepna Jeffer Mangels 12 43. The CWPA zones require that structures be sited in "compact development" patterns
13 within individual lots, ostensibly preserving more space for species movement. The majority of

WaNI 14 properties in this area are already subject to a zoning limitation that restricts structures to only 5%
15 of a lot in OS and AE zones. The compact development requirement restricts property owners within

16 the CWPA zone from freely developing their properties. Instead, property owners are restricted to
17 | choose one location for the development of a primary structure (an undefined term). Any additional
18 structures on the entire property must be located entirely within a 100 foot envelope of the existing
19 primary structure, public road, trail or internal agricultural access road.

20 44. Three CWPAs (totaling approximately 10,901 acres) are identified on County map
21 exhibits, all of which are contained within the County-designated HCWCs.

22 45. The CWPA Zone applies to these three areas:

23 The Oak View CWPA is 1,159 acres and is located on a ridgetop between Lake Casitas (to

24 the west) and the City of Oakview (to the east).

25 The Simi Hills CWPA is 6,596 acres and is located in the mountainous region between Simi

26 Valley (to the west) and Chatsworth/Canoga Park (to the cast).

27 The Tierra Rejada CWPA is 3,146 acres and is located in the mountainous region between

28 Moorpark (to the west) and Simi Valley (to the east).

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 46. The foregoing zones were arbitrarily created and chosen by County staff and
2 consultants without first undergoing scientific studies to justify their designation. The boundaries

3 and locations of the zones have no basis in fact or science, but instead, rely upon vague,
4 ambiguous, and arbitrary "Critical Wildlife Passage Area factors." These include, but are not limited

5

6 to: (1) providing high quality habitat areas where wildlife moves; (2) proximity to urban
development (narrow areas near cities or urban development are higher priorities, compared to lower
7 priority rural areas with less development); (3) areas with native vegetation; (4) areas near water
8 bodies; and (5) areas with functioning roadway crossings.
47. There are numerous areas within the County that meet the stated requirements for
10 designation as CWPAs, but were not included; conversely, there are areas designated as CWPAs

3 11

Butler & Mitchell sjaBuew Jayal that do not meet the stated requirements for designations. For example, the Bell Canyon and Box
12 Canyon areas in the Simi Hills CWPA are not near urban development, and yet they were included
13

JMBM 14 within the CWPA. Conversely, the Santa Rosa Valley meets all of the listed criteria and is also the

15 narrowest part of the corridor, but was excluded at the last-minute due to political pressure from

16 area residents on the district supervisor, and not due to any scientific basis.

48. County staff and consultants responsible for drafting the Ordinance first designated
17 the three large CWPA zones and only later attempted to generate a post-hoc scientific and biological
18 justification for the designations. That scientific justification never materialized, but that did not
19

20 deter the County from adopting the designations anyway.

49. The most obvious example of the County's arbitrary and capricious decision-making
21 involved the creation of the Tierra Rejada CWPA. No evidence supported Tierra Rejada's inclusion
22 as a CWPA zone, but evidence existed that Tierra Rejada did not contain a primary species the
23 Ordinance was intended to address. Further, serious concern existed regarding the impact of the
24 corridor restrictions on agriculture in the Tierra Rejada Valley. Based on these factors, the Planning
25 Commission recommended removal of Tierra Rejada Valley from the Ordinance. County Planning
26 staff removed the Tierra Rejada CWPA zone from the proposed zoning maps when the Ordinance
27 was presented for Board approval. However, the Board decided-on a whim and without any
28 explanation-to add the Tierra Rejada CWPA back into the Ordinance, and subject to its restrictive

65773375vl 13
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

terms.

2 C. THE COUNTY FAILED TO COMPLY WITH CEQA

3 50. The County purported to justify its refusal to conduct CEQA review by relying upon
4 three categorical exemptions, while providing essentially no legal or evidentiary support for those
exemptions.

6 51. A memorandum from Environmental Consultants ECorp Consulting Inc. ("ECorp"),

7 which was presented during the public comment period, provides a detailed analysis of the potential
8 environmental impacts of the Ordinance, all of which are discussed in further detail below. Of
9 particular concern, however, is the potentially devastating impact of the contribution of the
10 Ordinance to wildfires, due to proposed restrictions on brush clearance that have not been properly
11
9 studied or analyzed with adequate environmental review - a tragic oversight, especially in the
Butler & Mitchell NENT 12 aftermath of the destructive Thomas, Hill, and Woolsey fires.

13 1. Common Sense Exemption is Inapplicable

14 52. The first of the exemptions relied upon by the County is the so-called "common sense
15 exemption" set forth in 14 California Code of Regulations, § 15061(b)(3) ("CEQA Guidelines").
16 The common sense exemption may only be employed where it is certain that there is no possibility a
17 CEQA project may cause significant environmental impacts. Importantly, the decision to proceed
18 under CEQA § Guidelines § 15061(b)(3) must be supported by substantial record evidence, and the
19 agency relying upon the exemption bears the burden of proving its applicability. In adopting the
20 common sense exemption, the County failed to acknowledge the significant environmental impacts
21 that will arise from the passage and enforcement of the Ordinance, and thereby failed to comply
22 with the fundamental dictates of CEQA. In short, the County did not and cannot meet its burden of
23 proving that there is no possibility of significant environmental impacts here.

24 53. The County's reliance on a "common sense" exemption to CEQA review is legally
25 misinformed, and completely inadequate. The County's Ordinance will have several significant
26 impacts on the environment-none of which have been analyzed-including, but not limited to 1)
27 fire hazards, 2) traffic and circulation impacts, 3) air quality impacts, 4) impacts to agriculture,
28| 5) impacts to mineral resources, 6) greenhouse gas impacts, and 7) community character. The

65773375vI 14
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 County entirely ignored its own Initial Study Assessment Guidelines, which set forth thresholds
2 triggering environmental review under CEQA in dozens of different categories.

3 a. Fire Hazards

4 54. The entire region has been devastated by recent fires that have affected homes,

5 businesses, communities, habitat, and even the very wildlife that the Ordinance is designed to
6 protect. Yet, the Ordinance does not account for the fact that its provisions can lead to even more
7 severe fires in the future, and tragically, preventing the ability of homeowners to protect their homes
8  and properties. The Ordinance poses significant potential environmental impacts as to fire hazards.
9 55. Section 18 of the Assessment Guidelines states that projects located in High and Very
10 High Fire Hazard Areas/Fire Hazard Severity Zones or Hazardous Watershed Fire Areas would have

11 a significant fire hazard impact: "Fire hazard is defined as the potential loss of life and/or property 3
Butler & Mitchell sja8uew Jayaf. 12 due to fire. It is further defined as any thing or act which increases or may cause an increase of the
13 hazard or menace of fire to a greater degree than that customarily recognized as normal by persons
WEINL 14 in the public service regularly engaged in fire prevention or suppression, or that interferes with the
15 operation of the fire department, or the egress of occupants in the event of fire." "Projects located
16 within High Fire Hazard Areas/Fire Hazard Severity Zones or Hazardous Watershed Fire Areas may
17 have a significant fire hazard impact." (Id.)

18 56. Here, over 119,500 acres of the overlay zones (out of a total of 163,000 acres - or
19 73%) are within High Fire Hazard Areas/Fire Hazard Severity Zones or Hazardous Watershed Fire
20| Areas. In light of the extensive, sensitive areas of the County included within the overlay zones,
21 refusing to subject the Ordinance to environmental review is not only irresponsible, it is outright
22 dangerous.

23 57. The County's Fire Protection District Hazard Abatement program calls for the
24 clearing of brush, flammable vegetation, or combustible growth located within 100 feet of structures
25 or buildings. The Ordinance would change the way vegetation is removed or managed in ways that
26 will result in an increase in fire hazards and severity. Although the Assessment Guidelines focus

27 on brush clearing within 100 feet of structures, required by Ventura County Fire, many landowners
28 in these fire prone areas have taken the initiative to clear more areas, many at the direction of

65773375vl 15
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 insurance providers. Limitations on brush clearing in unincorporated arcas (except for within 100
2 feet of structures) will change the potential fire regime in this area, exacerbating fire hazards for
3 both humans and wildlife.

4 58. An uncontrolled wildfire, exacerbated by limitations in brush clearing, would have
5 significant effects on wildlife and their habitat, even if the 100-foot buffer around structures caused
6 no effects to structures or buildings.

7 59. The Ordinance also bans native vegetation removal within 200 feet of the edge of
8 supposed surface water features. These surface water features were identified on a map that

9 employed antiquated and unreliable satellite imagery, The County admitted throughout the
10 administrative process that its maps were incorrect, and that they inadvertently included man-made

11 concrete water containment structures. Although some of these errors have been corrected, others 5
utler & Mitchell sjaBueyjJayafJ 12 remain. This will cause confusion for landowners, who will be unable to determine the extent of
13 these areas on their properties, or who might be burdened by inaccurate maps or the failure of the
: WINI 14 County to curate the maps according to the conditions existing on the ground.

15 60. Rules limiting brush clearance will increase the fire danger in communities in the
16 urban interface zones, of which there are many in Ventura County (especially on the edges of the
17 mapped corridors). The fire profile experienced in the Thomas, Hill, and Woolsey fires show a new
18 pattern of erratic winds that drove flames and embers into housing subdivisions in the cities of

19 Ventura, Santa Paula, Thousand Oaks, Westlake, Simi Valley, and Malibu and the unincorporated
20 communities of Bell Canyon and Oak Park. With the exception of the City of Ventura, all of these
21 communities, are directly adjacent to or within the wildlife corridors. These three fires ultimately
22 scorched over 383,000 acres and burned 3,190 structures in three counties. The fires devastated oak
23 trees, orchards, wildlife habitat, stream courses, and landscapes on unincorporated lands across the
24 County. Over 72,500 acres of the 163,000 acres of designated wildlife corridors (44%) burned in
25 the Thomas, Hill and Woolsey Fires.

26 61. Aside from the impacts to homeowners and business owners, the lack of
27 environmental review can also affect the very wildlife that the Ordinance purports to protect. The
28 recent fires devastated wildlife populations and their habitat, including a collared mountain lion P64

16 65773375v1
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

pet

1 (cnn.com, 12/7/18). Recently, at least one other GPS-tracked mountain lion (P-74) was presumed
2 dead, along with probable losses of bobcats as a result of the Woolsey fire (Sacramento Bee

3 11/15/18), which burned a wide swath through Santa Monica Mountains areas encompassed by the

4 Ordinance. This example demonstrates that an uncontrolled wildfire, exacerbated by more stringent
5 and widespread limitations on brush clearing, could have significant effects on wildlife habitat and

6 protected species.

7 62. The Governor's Office of Planning and Research adopted, in 2018, comprehensive
8 updates to the CEQA Guidelines and Appendices. This update included adding new impact
9 categories to the checklist in Appendix G of CEQA, Notably, the most significant change to
10 Appendix G is the addition of Wildfire as an environmental impact category. The new Wildfire
11 section includes four questions pertaining to new development in Very High Fire Hazard Severity 9 leypanw g Japng sja8uew Jayal 12 Zones focusing on whether a project would exacerbate wildfire risk, impair emergency response or
13 evacuation plans, or risk exposing people or structures to floods and landslides.

14 63. The Ordinance has the potential to do all of these things. And without the benefit of JMBM 15 substantive CEQA analysis, the County, through the adoption of this untested Ordinance, will place
16 lives and structures at greater risk. The impacts of climate change will exacerbate wildfire risks in
17 the coming years, which only makes the abandonment of a CEQA analysis more dangerous.

18 b. Impacts to Mineral Resources

19 64. The Ordinance also poses potentially-significant impacts to mineral resources.

20 65. Section 3a of the Assessment Guidelines addresses the significance thresholds for
21 impacts to mineral resources. The Ordinance poses the potential to interfere with existing mining
22 operations and preclude extraction or access to identified mineral resources, exceeding the County's
23 significance criteria.

24 66. Moreover, recognizing of the underlying policies and purpose of SMARA, the
25 CEQA Guidelines provide the following two thresholds of significance for mineral resources, which
26 ask whether a project would result in the loss of availability of a known mineral resource that would

27 be of value to the region and the residents of the state, or would result in the loss of availability of a
28 locally-important mineral resources recovery site delineated on a local general plan, specific plan,

17 65773375vI
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 or other land use plan.

2 67. Approximately 13,000 acres of the wildlife corridors are within the County's Mineral
3 Resource Protection zone ("MRP"). These areas correspond with the State Mineral Land

4 Classification of Mineral Resource Zone 2 (*MRZ-2"), areas of identified mineral resource
5 significance. The analysis of available mineral resources in the County is set forth in Section 1.4 of
6 the General Plan Resources Appendix.

7 68. Included therein is the County's analysis of its local sources of aggregate and the
8 Il estimated demand for aggregate over the next 50 years. That analysis considered and relied upon
9 the sections of state-classified and designated mineral resources located within the County.
10 Accordingly, the County must consider how the rezoning of those mineral resources for wildlife
11 conservation purposes would affect the County's prior conclusions regarding supply and demand. 3 leypiw gJapna Sj8BUEW Jaya| 12 69. The Ordinance has the potential to impair and unreasonably delay the extraction of
13 these resources and the operation and expansion of mining properties, thereby increasing the costs
14 JMBM of developing mineral resources (which itself can cause impair the development of mineral
15 resources). Additionally, the Ordinance may even preclude the extraction of the County's classified
16 and designated mineral resources, and the operation and expansion of mining properties, because
17 the purpose of the Ordinance-i.e., the conservation of wildlife habitat, including wildlife habitat
18 and corridors-is inherently incompatible with the development of mineral resources, which
19 requires surface disturbances prior to the extraction of mineral resources located thereunder. These
20 impacts to mining and the extraction of mineral resources will cause significant environmental

21 effects.

22 70. The Ordinance could result in the loss of availability of a known mineral resource
23 that would be of value to the region. Specifically, the Ordinance could result in the loss of
24 availability of approximately 41% of the County's supply of classified MRZ-2 areas, some of which
25 have been designated as significant mineral resource sectors, because the development and
26 extraction of mineral resources is inherently incompatible with the goal of preserving wildlife

27 habitat.

28 71. The Ordinance may also result in the loss of availability of a locally important

18 65773375vl
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 mineral resources recovery site delineated on a local general plan, specific plan, or other land use
2 plan. Specifically, the Ordinance may result in the loss of availability of mineral resources presently
3 protected by the County's Resource Protection Map and Mineral Resources Protection Overlay
4 Zones-i.e., local land use plans.

5 72. The Ordinance also impacts areas located on or immediately adjacent to land zoned
6 Mineral Resources Protection overlay zone; impacts areas adjacent to a principal access road to an

7 existing aggregate Conditional Use Permit; and potentially hampers or precludes extraction of or
8 access to the aggregate resources.
9 73. During the public comment period a memorandum prepared by ECorp was

3 10| presented, showing that the Ordinance would overlay multiple mining properties (and their principal

Butler & Mitchell sjaBuey Jayaf 11 access roads), including properties that have conditional use permits. Accordingly, under the
12 County Assessment Guidelines, the Ordinance is presumed to have a significant impact: "Any land

JMBM 13  use or project activity which is proposed to be located on or immediately adjacent to land zoned
14 Mineral Resources Protection (MRP) overlay zone ... shall be considered to have a significant
15 adverse impact on the environment." (Assessment Guidelines, p. 21, § D(1) [Threshold of
16 Significance Criteria].)

17 74. The Project will also have a cumulative impact on aggregate resources because it
18 would hamper or preclude extraction or access to identified resources. As the County explains in
19 the General Plan Resources Appendix, "there is relatively little land within the County which is
20 known to have significant deposits of construction grade aggregate (those classified as MRZ2).
21 MRZ-2 areas have been 'designated' by the State as areas that should be subject to special
22 management regulations through the General Plan of local jurisdictions." (General Plan Resources
23 Appendix, pp. 29, 42.) Accordingly, because the Project could hamper the extraction of designated
24 MRZ-2 areas, the Project could result in a significant cumulative impact on mineral resources.

25 75. The Project will also impair the operation and expansion of existing mining
26 properties in the County. For example, the Ordinance's restrictions on the removal of vegetation
27 would serve as a barrier to mining, which requires surface disturbance, including the removal of
28 native vegetation. Additionally, the Project's restrictions on "surface water features" could

65773375v1 19
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

potentially impair or preclude river and in-stream mining activities.

2 76. The General Plan "Goals, Policies and Programs" for mineral resources states that:
"All General Plan amendments, zone changes, and discretionary developments shall be evaluated

4 for their individual and cumulative impacts on access to and extraction of recognized mineral
resources, in compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act." (General Plan Goals,

6 Policies, and Programs, pp. 16-17, § 1.4 [Mineral Resources] [emphasis added].) Here, the County
7 recognizes the Ordinance is a discretionary "project" under CEQA. Furthermore, the Project
8 proposes a General Plan amendment and the rezoning of thousands of acres of land that includes
9 approximately 13,987 acres of state-classified "MRZ-2" arcas. Accordingly, CEQA review "shall"
10| be required.

11 77.
g The Ordinance has the potential to hamper or preclude extraction or access to
& Mitchell *pl 3, oope l JMBM &: 12 aggregate resources within or adjacent to land zoned in the MRP overlay zone and would have a
13 significant impact according to the Assessment Guidelines.

14 78. Indirect impacts to other resources would also occur if access to mineral resources

.15 was limited or precluded. For example, if access to local aggregate resources are limited or
16 precluded, construction projects in the County would be forced to go outside of the region,
17 potentially to Kern, Los Angeles, or San Bernardino counties or as far as Arizona or Nevada, to
18 obtain aggregate materials.

19 79. Indirect impact from trucking in aggregate from outside of the region include
20 transportation impacts from increased vehicle miles traveled, increases in air emissions (including
21 potential health risks from diesel fuel emissions), increased greenhouse gas emissions, and increased
22 noise from truck travel. (See discussion in sections d., e., and f., below).

23 80. Similar to the effects on agricultural resources (discussed below), the impacts on
24 mineral resources are a black-and-white threshold issue. Because the overlay zones identified in
25 the Ordinance obviously contain within them areas designated as MRZs, the County cannot simply
26 ignore these significance thresholds.

27 C. Impacts to Agricultural Resources

28 81. The Ordinance also poses potential impacts to agricultural resources.

65773375vl 20
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

82.

2 Section 5b of the Assessment Guidelines addresses the significance thresholds for
impacts to agricultural resources. Pursuant to the Assessment Guidelines, any land use or project
3 that is not defined as Agriculture or Agricultural Operations in the zoning ordinances must be
4 evaluated for effects on adjacent classified farmland. Analysis must be based on the distance

5 between new non-agricultural structures or uses and any common lot boundary line adjacent to off-
6 site classified farmland as defined in Section 5.a of the Assessment Guidelines.

7 83.

8 Any project that is closer than the distances set forth in the Assessment Guidelines
is deemed to have a potentially significant environmental effect on agricultural resources, unless
justification exists for a waiver or deviation from these distances.

10 84.

11 Approximately 44,800 acres in the corridors are zoned Agricultural Exclusive. Crop

9
Butler & Mitchell Jeffer Mangels data accessed from the Ventura County Agricultural Commissioner reports show approximately
12 7,000 acres of planted commercial crops within the County mapped wildlife corridor, of which over
13

WENE 700 acres are in the CWPA zones. Analysis of the 2016 State of California Important Farmland Map
14 shows that there are 13,530 acres classified as Prime, Statewide, Unique and Local farmland and
15  94,356 acres classified as grazing land. Therefore, the thresholds have been surpassed, and CEQA
16 environmental review was required.

17 d. Traffic and Circulation Impacts

18 85.

19 86. The Ordinance also poses potential impacts to traffic and circulation.
In respect to transportation impacts, the Assessment Guidelines call for an
20 assessment as to whether the project would conflict or be inconsistent with CEQA Guidelines
21 section 15064.3, subdivision(b). Section 15064.3(b) reflects the state's recent shift towards
22 assessing transportation impacts in terms of vehicle miles traveled (*VMT") and directs a lead
23 agency to consider whether a project would increase the "amount and distance of automobile travel
24

25 attributable to a project." (CEQA Guidelines, §15064.3.)

87. The impairment of the extraction of local mineral resources will also cause
26 significant transportation impacts. (General Plan Resources Appendix, pp. 31-33 [Hauling Impacts]
27 [*Transporting the material raises costs. It also contributes to traffic impacts, particularly if surface
28 streets must be used."].)

65773375vl 21
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 88. As discussed in the General Plan Resources Appendix, a local shortage of aggregate
2 will require the transport of aggregate from other state jurisdictions, such as Kern, Los Angeles, or

3 San Bernardino Counties, or even beyond state lines Arizona or Nevada. This, in turn, will cause
4  increased traffic impacts. The Project calls for the rezoning of approximately 41% of the County's
5 supply of classified MRZ-2 areas, to allow for the establishment of wildlife corridors. The

6

7 Ordinance will preclude access to and development of mineral resources located within those
corridors. Accordingly, the Project will increase the "amount and distance of automobile travel
8 attributable" to the Project, thereby causing a significant environmental impact.
9 e. Air Quality and Greenhouse Gases

10 89.

11
9 90. The Ordinance also poses potential impacts to air quality and greenhouse gases.
According to Section
Butler & Mitchell sja8uew Jayal 12 of the Assessment Guidelines, projects should assess
potential air quality impacts using the guidelines from the Ventura County Air Pollution Control

JMBM 13 District ("APCD"). Section 24 of the Assessment Guidelines provides that projects in the County
14 must determine the project's potential for significant impacts related to climate change by:
15

16 1. Identifying and quantifying the greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions from the
project;

17

18 2. Assessing the significance of the impact on climate change; and,

19 3. If the impact is found to be significant, identify alternatives and/or mitigation
measures that will reduce the impact below significance.

20 91;

21 These guidelines establish emissions thresholds for federal and state pollutants of

22 concern that, if exceeded, would result in a significant impact to the environment.

92. Similarly, for (i) greenhouse gas emissions and (ii) air quality, the CEQA Guidelines
23 provide two and four thresholds of significance, respectively, including the following which ask
24 whether the project would:

25 a)

26 Generate greenhouse gas emissions, either directly or indirectly, that may have a
significant impact on the environment?1

27

28 CEQA Guidelines, App. G, § XIII(a) [Greenhouse Gas Emissions].

3 standard?

4 c) Expose sensitive receptors to substantial pollutant concentrations?

5 d) Result in other emissions (such as those leading to odors) adversely affecting a

6 substantial number of people?2

93. As explained in the General Plan Resources Appendix, the impairment of the
8 extraction of local mineral resources will also cause significant impacts to air quality as a result of 7

10 significant air emissions will result from the increased risk of uncontrolled wildfires, which release 9 the additional vchicle miles travelled due to the lack of availability of mineral resources. Moreover,

11 tons of reactive organic gases, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter into the atmosphere. 3
f. Community Character ¡laypiw g uepng sjasuew Jayal 12

13 94. The Ordinance also poses potential impacts to community character.

95. Community Character is addressed in Section 25 of the Assessment Guidelines. WaNf 15 Restrictions to agricultural land uses would result in changes to community character of the rural 14

The Ordinance exceeds the following thresholds in the Assessment Guidelines: 16 areas of the County,

2 or density/parcel sizes within the community in which the project site is

located. 3

97. A wildlife corridor is fundamentally incompatible with agricultural and rural
5 community character. Moreover, the CWPA Overlay Zone, which restricts property owners from 4

7 obviously "inconsistent with existing land uses [and] site design/layout" in the areas that are effected 6 using the vast majority of their properties (due to the compact development requirements), is

8 by the restriction.

g. Land Use and Planning

10 98. The Ordinance also poses potential impacts to land use and planning.

11 99. For land use and planning, the CEQA Guidelines provide two thresholds of 9
ileypiN gJepna sjaBuew Jayal 12 significance, including whether the project would cause a significant environmental impact due to
13 a conflict with any land use plan, policy, or regulation adopted for the purpose or avoiding or

WENI 14 mitigating an environmental effect.

100. Although the County Assessment Guidelines do not provide specific thresholds of
16 significance for land use and planning, the General Plan recognizes that a zoning ordinance "shall 15

17 be consistent" with the general plan, including the applicable objectives and policies.3

resources,
19 which include goals and programs intended to safeguard access to and the extraction of mineral 18 101. The General Plan includes "Goals, Policies and Programs" for mineral

20 resources. Because the Project calls for the rezoning of land presently protected by the County's
21 Resource Protection Map and Mineral Resources Protection Overlay Zones, to allow for
22 establishment of wildlife protection corridors, the Project is inconsistent with these "Goals, Policies
23 and Programs", Such an inconsistency constitutes a significant impact.

102. Furthermore, as stated in the County CEQA Guidelines, a zoning ordinance "shall
25 be consistent" with applicable General Plan objectives and policies. Here, the County has made no 24

26 effort to consider the Project's consistency with applicable provisions of the General Plan. Nor has

1 the County considered the Project's consistency with SMARA. Instead, the County has limited its
2 consideration to only "General Plan goals and policies intended to promote the protection of
3 biological resources and wildlife connectivity in particular."

4 h. Cumulative Impacts

5 103. The Ordinance also has the potential to cause significant cumulative impacts.

6 104. The CEQA Guidelines require an assessment as to whether the project has impacts
7 that are individually limited, but cumulatively considerable.

of that 8 105. The County is in the process of updating its General Plan, and as a part
9 process, the County will complete an EIR, Within that EIR is where the County should analyze the

JMBM 14 impacts.

15 106. Furthermore, for the reasons set forth above, the Project will cause significant
16 cumulative impacts to multiple categories of resources included in Appendix G of the CEQA
17 Guidelines, including fire hazards, agricultural resources, mineral resources, transportation, air
18 quality, and greenhouse gas emissions. Because of the various potential significant impacts
19 identified above, any one of which is sufficient to trigger CEQA review, the County is unable to
20  establish that "it can be seen with a certainty that there is no possibility that the activity in question
21 may have a significant effect on the environment" (emphasis added).

23 Corridor Ordinance Is Subject to Several Exceptions to the Exemptions
an entirely 24 107. Implicitly acknowledging that the "common sense" exemption is
25 inappropriate basis to evade CEQA review here, the County also relied upon two additional
26 exemptions: 1) CEQA Guidelines Section 15307: Actions by Regulatory Agencies for Protection of
27 Natural Resources; and 2) CEQA Guidelines Section 15308: Actions by Regulatory Agencies for
28 Protection of the Environment. However, the Ordinance not qualify for these additional exemptions.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 Moreover, there are several exceptions to these exemptions that preclude the application of any
2 CEQA exemption.

3 108. As an initial matter, because the County is not a "Regulatory Agency," these

4 exemptions are therefore not available to the County. Moreover, projects involving the "protection
5 of habitat" for wildlife are covered by Class 33 Exemptions, not Class 7 or 8, and are expressly

6 limited to projects of 5 acres or less. By contrast, the Ordinance affects 163,000 acres of land. A
7 categorical exemption is plainly not available here.

not rely 8 109. In addition, under CEQA Guidelines Section 15300.2, a lead agency may
categorical exemption: (1) "for an activity where there is a reasonable possibility that the 9 upon a
10 activity will have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances"; (2) "when
11 the cumulative impact of successive projects of the same type in the same place, over time is 3 1leupuw g Japna sjeßuew Jayef 12 significant"; or (3) "for a project which may result in damage to scenic resources, including but not
13 limited to, trees, historic buildings, rock outcroppings, or similar resources, within a highway
JMBM 14 officially designated as a state scenic highway".

15 a. Exception to Exemption Based on Unusual Circumstances

16 110. The standard of review for categorical exemptions and the unusual circumstances
17 exception was articulated in the California Supreme Court's recent decision in Berkeley Hillside
18 Preservation v. City of Berkeley (2016) 60 Cal.4th 1086. At the administrative level, a challenger
19 must prove to the agency that 1) there are unusual circumstances, and 2) there is a reasonable
20 possibility of a significant impact because of those circumstances. (Id.; Respect Life South San
21 Francisco v. City of South San Francisco (2017) 15 Cal.App.5th 449.) Alternatively, a challenger
22 may show that a project will have a significant environmental effect.

23 111. Here, at least three unusual circumstances preclude any of the categorical
24 exemptions: 1) fires, 2) agricultural resources, and 3) mineral resources.

25 112. The recent fires that have ravaged the entire region have changed the landscape of
26 thousands of acres that are within the overlay zones, and thousands more that are in grave danger.
27 With climate change promising to exacerbate the conditions that give rise to even more wildfire
28 damage in the coming years, it is not only irresponsible, but dangerous, for the County to have

65773375vl 26
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 adopted the Ordinance with a categorical exemptions while utterly ignoring the potential effects of

2 the Ordinance on future fires, and the effects of past fires on the Ordinance.

3 113. As the California Supreme Court has stated, "when a proposed project risks
4 exacerbating those environmental hazards or conditions that already exist, an agency must analyze
5 the potential impact of such hazards on future residents or users." (Calif. Bldg. Industry Assn. v.

6 Bay Area Air Quality Mgmt. Dist., 62 Cal.4th 369, 377 (2015) [emphasis supplied].) Here, the
7 County failed even to consider the degree to which the Ordinance may exacerbate recent and more
8 severe fire conditions, in violation of CEQA's dictates.

9 114. Moreover, the large portions of land affected by the overlay zones that include areas
10 with agricultural and mining resources also present unusual circumstances. Yet, the effects to these
11
9 resources were not evaluated at all through the CEQA process.
Butler & Mitchell sjeßuew Jayaf 12 115. Potential impacts to agricultural and mining resources (and the fact that the impacts
13 exceed the thresholds of significance identified in the County's Assessment Guidelines) are
WEND 14 addressed above. As alleged above, the impacts upon agriculture, and particularly, mining
15 resources, also have ancillary environmental impacts on transportation, traffic and circulation, air
16 quality, and greenhouse gases.

17 116. The unusual circumstances present here, and the potential for significant
18 environmental impacts as a result of those circumstances, preclude reliance upon the exemptions

19 claimed by the County.

20 b. Exception to Exemption Based on Cumulative Impacts

21 117. When the "cumulative impact of successive projects of the same type in the same
22 place, over time is significant," a categorical exemption may not be used to avoid CEQA review.
23 118. In addition to the overlay zones at issue in this Ordinance, there are also similar
24 preservation projects in the vicinity that need to be analyzed in conjunction with each other,
25 Moreover, the General Plan Update will invariably include changes to the zoning of nearby areas,
26 and the cumulative impacts of all of these zoning changes should have been analyzed together. The
27 impacts of the past fires have not been analyzed at all in connection with this Ordinance. The future
28  impacts of the Ordinance on wildfires has also been entirely ignored.

65773375vl 27
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

119. When this phenomenon is combined with the cumulative effects of other similar
2 preservation zones, open spaces, and green belts in the area, which can prevent certain activities

3 such as brush clearance, the problem is even further exacerbated. Further, the General Plan Update
4 currently in process will provide new land use regulations and would have effects that, when
5 considered in combination with the Ordinance, are cumulatively significant. These cumulative
6 impacts constitute an exception to the exemptions claimed by the County,

7 C. Exception to Exemption Based on Scenic Highways

8 120. A categorical exemption may not be used in connection with "a project which may
9 result in damage to scenic resources...within a highway officially designated as a state scenic

10 highway."

11 121. In this case, Highway 33, which runs through the overlay zones created by the 3
1134W g Jepng Jeffer Mangels 12 Ordinance, is a designated State scenic highway. The recent fires, and future fire risks that will be

13 exacerbated by the Ordinance, contribute to risks of mudslides and land-stability issues that will
14 result in damage to a State designated scenic highway. In addition, there are wildlife crossing WEIND 15 structures contemplated throughout the region that may have effects on Highway 33, none of which
16 have been analyzed under CEQA.

17 3. The County has Illegally Engaged in Piecemealing in Order to Evade

18 CEQA Review

19 122. Separating the Ordinance from the General Plan Update to avoid CEQA review

20 constitutes classic-and impermissible piecemealing, particularly given the County's prior
21 acknowledgment of the requirement for CEQA review when the General Plan encompassed the
22 Ordinance, and CEQA review of other wildlife corridor projects.

23 123. Moreover, Petitioner is informed and believes and on that basis alleges that the
24 County is also in the process of enacting a similar wildlife corridor ordinance applicable to the
25 County's coastal areas. The County impermissible piecemealed its consideration of the current
26 Ordinance from the coastal version.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

D. THE COUNTY FAILED TO COMPLY WITH GOVERNMENT CODE
§8 65855 AND 65857

124. Government Code §65855 provides: "After the hearing, the planning commission

4 shall render its decision in the form of a written recommendation to the legislative body. Such
recommendation shall include the reasons for the recommendation, the relationship of the proposed

6 ordinance or amendment to applicable general and specific plans, and shall be transmitted to the
legislative body in such and manner as may be specified by the legislative body."

or 125, Government Code section 65857 states that the Board "may approve, modify
9 disapprove the recommendation of the planning commission; provided that any modification of the
10  proposed ordinance or amendment by the legislative body not previously considered by the

9 11 planning commission during its hearing, shall first be referred to the planning commission for
Mangels nPapils, oopes WINS 12 report and recommendation (emphasis added),

13 126. At its hearing on March 12, 2019, the Board adopted several components of the
14 Ordinance as proposed by staff, and as recommended by the Planning Commission,

15 127. However, the Board also directed staff to revise the proposed HCWC overlay zone
16 map to remove all property located within the Los Padres National Forest (hundreds of thousands

17 of acres of land). Within 15 days of the March 12, 2019 hearing, the Board also removed significant
18 acreage from the Santa Rosa Valley and Oak Park neighborhoods, all within Supervisor Linda
19 Parks' District 2, for questionable and not evidence-based reasons, including the likely influencing
20 of the district's Supervisor through political pressure and donations of constituents in that area.
21 Certain Santa Rosa Valley neighborhoods (approximately 278 acres on 59 parcels) were removed
22 entirely from the HCWC overlay zone, including Andalusia Drive, Sumac Lane and Marvella Court,
23 while others, like Rocky High Road with similar attributes in the same area were not.

24 128. The Board also allowed additional acreage to be added to the Oak View CWPA
25 (specifically, the Ventura Oaks RV Park, offering vacation and low income rental spaces). Also,
26 acreage was added to the Simi Hills CWPA by request of Boeing, which created a significant change
27  in the corridor configuration adding passage around the Bell Canyon residential subdivision (within
28 the Simi Hills CWPA) that was not contemplated by the Planning Commission. The County did

65773375vl 29
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 not consider the removal of residential lots in the Bell Canyon subdivision after this change, and did
2 not provide a scientific reason why they were not removed.

3 129.

4 The Board continued its consideration of the proposed amendment to Article 18 of
the Zoning Ordinance until March 19, 2019 at 9:30 a.m., to allow staff sufficient time to make the
5 significant changes to the overlay map requested by the Board.

6 130. However, the Board did not lawfully adopt the revised HCWC overlay zone map on
7 March 19, because it did not comply with State law requiring review of the proposed modifications

8 to the Ordinance by the County's Planning Commission pursuant to Government Code section
9 65857.

10 131.

& Mitchell The revision of the HCWC overlay zone map to remove all property located within

• Mangels 12 the Los Padres National Forest was a significant modification to the Ordinance as recommended by

Pogrey 13 the Planning Commission, which was not considered by the Planning Commission during its hearing

JMBM on the Ordinance on January 31, 2019. In addition, the acreage added to the Oakview CWPA
14 including the Ventura Oaks RV Park, and significant acreage removed from the Santa Rosa Valley
15

16 in a critical, narrow choke point in the corridor, was not considered by the Planning Commission

17 during its hearing on the Ordinance on January 31, 2019.

132. Failure to refer the issue to the Planning Commission for report and recommendation
18 violates Government Code section 65857.

19 133. The draft Ordinance considered by the Planning Commission at its January 31
20 hearing included within the HCWC overlay zone hundreds of thousands of acres located within the
21

22 Los Padres National Forest, comprising most of the Sierra Madre - Castaic regional wildlife corridor
mapped in the Missing Linkages study on which the Ordinance is based. (See Exhibit 3 to January
23 31, 2019 Planning Commission Staff Report).

24 134.

25 During the hearing, the Commission considered requests by residents of Lockwood
Valley to remove their property from the HCWC overlay zone. The Commission ultimately
26 recommended that the Board adopt the Ordinance a with a revised map of the HCWC overlay zone
27 that removes private property in the Lockwood Valley neighborhood, and directed Planning staff to
28 make those revisions to the map. (See Letter from Planning Division Director K. Prillhart to Ventura

65773375v1 30
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

j

F County Board of Supervisors, March 12, 2019, pp. 11-12).

2 135. The Planning Commission did not consider, much less recommend, the far more
3 drastic step of removing the entire National Forest from the application of the Ordinance.

4 136. The revised map prepared by Planning staff removed only a small portion of the
5 Sierra Madre - Castaic corridor in the vicinity of Lockwood Valley, leaving the great majority of
6 the HCWC overlay zone within the Los Padres National Forest intact. (See Board of Supervisors
7 Agenda, March 12, 2019, Item 31, Exhibits 17, 20.)

8 137. In revising the HCWC map, Planning staff specifically sought to retain as much of
9 the National Forest as possible, outside of the private landholdings in Lockwood Valley, because
10 these areas are "considered

11 as important components of the regional wildlife linkages and thus

9 Butler & Mitchell sjaBuew JayafJ should be retained" (Letter from Planning Division Director K. Prillhart to Ventura County Board
12 of Supervisors, March 12, 2019, p. 12).

13 138.

JMBM e At its March 12, 2019 hearing, the Board directed staff to prepare a revised HCWC
14 overlay map excluding not just property within the Lockwood Valley neighborhood, but all property
15 within the Los Padres National Forest (including private inholdings).

16 139. The current overlay zone map, as revised in response to the Board's direction,
17 represents a massive modification to the Ordinance as recommended by the Planning Commission.
18 140.

19 It removes, for the first time, hundreds of thousands of acres within the Los Padres
National Forest, including nearly all of the Sierra Madre Castaic regional wildlife corridor (see
20 Exhibit 2 to January 31, 2019 Planning Commission Staff Report).
21 141.

22 This modification clearly was not considered by the Planning Commission and was
not referred to the Commission for

23 section 65857. report and recommendation pursuant to Government Code

24 142. Chairman Bennett's explanation of the modification highlights the reasons why
25 further input from the Planning Commission was needed. Chairman Bennett stated during the March
26 12 hearing that removing all areas within the Los Padres National Forest from the HCWC

27 overlay
zone is appropriate because these areas constitute habitat for wildlife but do not constitute part of a
28 corridor through which wildlife moves to reach other habitat, and thus it is not necessary for the

65773375vl 31
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 Ordinance to protect them.

2 143. This statement is mistaken in two important respects. First, wildlife does move

3 through the Sierra Madre - Castaic regional wildlife corridor within the Los Padres National Forest;
4 that is precisely the reason the area was mapped as a regional wildlife corridor in the 2001 Missing

5 Linkages study and the 2008 South Coast Missing Linkages study that the Ordinance and HCWC

6 boundaries are explicitly based upon. (See January 31, 2019 Staff Report, pp. 4-5.) Second, the
7 goals of the Ordinance include protecting wildlife habitat used by wildlife, not just preserving
8 opportunities for movement between areas of such habitat. (Id., p. 3.)

9 144. For both these reasons, removing the Los Padres National Forest from the HCWC
10 overlay zone represents a major departure from the approach taken in developing the Ordinance,
11 and one that required further study by the Planning Commission. 9
llaypuw g Japns Jeffer Mangels 12 145. The Planning Commission, in its re-evaluation of that portion of the HCWC overlay,
13 should have also evaluated whether other lands should be removed for similar reasons - an analysis
INEINS 14 that was never performed.

15 146. Failure to follow the process required by law undermines the goals of the Ordinance
16 and renders the County's actions violative of Government Code section 65857.

17 E. THE WILDLIFE CORRIDOR ORDINANCE LACKS ANY FACTUAL

18 BASIS, IS ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS AND IS NOT SUPPORTED BY

19 SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE

20 147. Given the lack of CEQA review, the County's failure to support its regulations with
21 any scientific or factual basis is hardly surprising. Instead, the Ordinance is arbitrary and capricious,
22 and not supported by substantial evidence.

23 148. The Ordinance relies upon studies over 13 years old, with no updates, rendering the
24 resulting regulations questionable at best. The studies utilized outdated technology that

25 misidentified vegetation types critical to the delineation of functioning wildlife corridors. Thus, the
26 studies that form the scientific, biological, and evidentiary basis for the Ordinance are both
27 inaccurate and outdated, This, in and of itself, is fatal to the Ordinance.

28 149. The Ordinance includes numerous errors that mar the mapping of the overlay zones.

65773375v1 32
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 These mapping errors include water features, vegetation classifications, outdated road density
2 calculations, and general overlay zone boundaries. The County's decisions to a include a 200-foot
3 buffer around surface water features, rather than the current County-wide 100 foot buffer, and to

4 establish the compact development standards within in the CWPAs, were arbitrary and capricious

5 and lacking in evidentiary support, particularly given the serious and significant errors that suffused

6 the maps County staff employed.
Post-Hoc Rationalization of Decisions Made with Zero Evidentiary 7 1.

Support 8

9 150. The County went about drafting the Ordinance in the exact opposite way that it
10 should have, which resulted in several inaccuracies and problems with how the boundaries of the

11 overlay zones were drawn. In particular, County staff first identified the areas it wanted to protect, 9
lleypiw g Jepng sjaßuew Jayaf 12 with no evidence, then attempted to locate evidence to support the decisions that it had already

13 made. Staff's original designations were adopted into the Ordinance regardless of whether or not

WIND 14 the science supported the original decisions.

15 151. Sadly, this is not merely speculation. This methodology has been confirmed by
16 emails recently uncovered through a Public Records Act request submitted on CoLAB's behalf.
17 152. One such email from a County consultant working on the Ordinance to a Wildlife
18 Ecologist at the National Park Service provides, in relevant part:

19 ...I am still working on the Ventura County Wildlife Corridor Project as a consultant (yay!). I am writing the Staff Report for the Planning Commission Hearing that 20 believe is scheduled for May. In reading the research available online, it's obvious the biggest obstacle to movement are the freeways which the County has no control 21 over. But, I'm hopeful that by showing that animal movement is happening in VC that we can convince the Board that small increases in regulations on fencing, 22 lighting, buffers from streams and roadway crossings and the clustering of development in certain critical areas are justified. We are still trying to finalize the 23 ordinance--but I am hoping you can help me with some info/data needs for the report. NPS has great info online on the mountain lions moving mostly through LA 24 County, I seemed to remember that in your presentation to the Planning Division, you had animal movement data specific to Ventura County. 25
Can we discuss using some of your data? Ideally if we could use your spatial data to 26 make our own maps, this would be easiest and best. But if you don't feel comfortable sharing your GPS data, maybe you can share images/figures of maps with animal to reference or even show this data 27 point observations you/NPS has made? I'd like as a justification for the regulations in the ordinance. I'd like to show the animal 28 movement that is happening in Ventura County--specifically in the Tierra Rejada

33 65773375v1
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

Valley, Bell Canyon, Box Canyon, and the Santa Susana Knolls if possible. Do you know of animal movement data in the Oak View area? These are the areas we have pinpointed as being critical to movement within the County unincorporated areas.
[Figure Omitted.]

4 ..This figure mainly shows movement in LA County and eastern VC. Do you have data that shows north-south movement through the Tierra Rejada Valley for any wildlife?

153. This email is remarkable for three reasons. First, it is a direct admission that County 6

7 consultants and/or staff (the same person who drafted the staff report) drafted the Ordinance

8 including the boundaries of the overlay zones---first, and then tried to provide a post-hoc
rationalization.

10 154. Second, it acknowledges that development of individual properties does not
11 constitute a primary barrier to animal movement: "it's obvious the biggest obstacle to movement 9
ljaypaw g Japng sjeßuew Jayaf 12 are the freeways which the County has no control over." The email admits that the measures that
13 are the heart of the current Ordinance do nothing to address the real problem; rather, they are just
14 WINI secondary or tertiary considerations that they hope to "convince" the Board are "justified." This
15 email makes clear that the measures are not "justified" on the basis of any evidence in the record,
which confirm the "obvious" fact that the freeways (which the County cannot control) are the real
17 barrier to wildlife movement. Rather, the staff was forced to propose measures that are both more 16

18 restrictive on property owners, and less effective to promote wildlife movement.
attached to the email that the Tierra Rejada valley
20 does not have any evidence of mountain lions. It is also obvious that the County staff had no 19 155. Third, it is evident from the map

21 evidence regarding Tierra Rejada, and was hoping that this outside consultant from the National
22 Park Service would be able to help provide something staff could use as a justification after the fact.
23 That evidentiary support either did not exist or was never provided. Indeed, at the Planning
24 Commission hearing, the County showed another map that confirms that there was no evidence
25 found of mountain lions crossing through the Tierra Rejada Valley.

27 acknowledge that its regulations relating to fencing, lighting, buffers, and clustered development 26 156. More generally, the Ordinance's drafters and proponents are the same ones who

28 are ineffective in solving the real problem of animal movement, which would necessarily involve

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 doing something about the freeways. Importantly, however, freeways and roads are not within the
2 power of the County's regulations.

3 157. To make matters worse, even the regulations for those factors the County was able

4 to affect were formulated in an evidentiary vacuum and, as drafted, do not achieve their purported
5 primary purpose, and will not assist wildlife movement.

6 158. Rather than gathering the scientific evidence first, and developing the overlay zones

7 on that basis, the County did the precise opposite. Staff identified the protection zones first, and then
8 only later tried to find scientific evidence to fit those zones retroactively.
9 159. This is anathema to any scientifically or factually rigorous method, to the planning
10 process, and to sound public policy, and highlights the need and importance of conducting the
11
3 appropriate CEQA review in this case, when the planning effort can respond to and incorporate
ieupuw g Japna sjaBuew Jayal 12 environmental concerns.

13 2. Outdated Maps from Studies Done in 2001, 2005, and 2006

14 160. JMBM There were two linkage connections mapped by South Coast Wildlands ("SCW")
15 that apply to the Ordinance: Sierra Madre-Castaic (primarily in the Los padres national Forest), and
16 Santa Monica-Sierra Madre (primarily in the southern half of the County).
17 161. The reports for these two connections were finalized in 2005 and 2006, over 13 years
18 ago, SCW anticipated that the resulting linkage plan documents would be used as planning-level
19 tools and would not be regulatory in nature. As such, linkage documents were published with the
20 following caveat: "Results and information in this report are advisory and intended to assist local
21 jurisdictions, agencies, organizations, and property owner in making decisions regarding protection
22 of ecological resources and habitat connectivity in the area." Indeed, the models have pixelated
23 boundaries (not intended to be regulatory boundaries), where the County simply smoothed out and
24 filled in areas (many of which are highly developed with very little conservation value), even though
25 there were viable options for the corridor to exclude these areas. Specifically, the County chose to
26 "fill in" developed areas of Bell Canyon, Box Canyon and Long Canyon/Sycamore Village that
27 were not included in the studies.

28 162. The boundary lines developed by the SCW report were created through a pre-2005

data and 3 163. Furthermore, the original GIS modeling effort was based in part upon

4 mapping that was known even at the time to be incomplete and inaccurate. This is troubling because

5 current land use, development, changes to landscape, and other potential impediments over the last

6 15+ years to the proposed corridor area have not been evaluated or considered in developing the
7 draft ordinance and the maps do not represent the current, real time state of the habitats that are

8 intended to be the focus of the Ordinance.

164. The linkage designs that resulted from the modeling for the two connections were
a 10 intended to provide a starting point for conservation implementation and evaluation.

11 165. The modeling efforts to construct the linkages were flawed and outdated. While 3 • Mangels 1Papail 3, gl WaNI 12 many of these analytical techniques may have been appropriate at the time they were conducted,
13 almost 15 years have passed since the corridor models were developed, with no updates to the
14 models themselves. Variables in the permeability analysis such as road density and land cover/use
15 have changed since 2005 and 2006. New data sources would affect the preferences and distribution
16 of species and thus the location and utility of these corridors. For example, the road density data
17| used as an input to the permeability model is clearly outdated, as the corridor models do not account
18 for the roads that have been built since that time or existing roads that have been widened or paved
19 since the model was developed back in the early 2000s.
20 166. Also, the studies are premised on the presumption that agricultural uses are at odds
21 with habitat ecologies the Ordinance purports to protect. Indeed, Table 2 of the Report ranks
22 "Agriculture" as among the highest non-permeable parameters for many of the species studied,
23 ranking "Agriculture" as 9, almost as impermeable to species as "Urban" zones ranked as a 10. In
24 many places the Report recommends that existing agricultural lands be restored to native habitat. It
25 is inexplicable that thousands of acres of rich agricultural lands are included in the HCWC when it
26 is clear that the authors of the study did not believe these lands provide quality habitat for wildlife
27 passage.

167. Because no environmental review of the Ordinance has taken place, there has been 28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

-

2 no recent review of the methodology or adequacy of the scientific assumptions that the County has
made in drafting its Ordinance.

3 168.

4 Put differently, though the Ordinance is meant to protect wildlife corridors and

5 movement, there is no evidence that the County's proposal will do so. Indeed, ECorp's scientific
analysis presented during the public comment period shows several problems with the County's
6 methodology and analysis, demonstrating the need for a proper
7 (which CEQA also necessitates). scientific analysis by the County

8 169. To identify surface water feature buffers within the overlay maps, the County relied

10 exclusively on the National Wetlands Inventory maps. These maps have many known data issues

Butler & Mitchell even to the extent of misidentifying swimming pools (Thatcher School), horse riding arenas (Soule

spoßuey Jayaf- Road, Ojai), mulch piles (Soule Road, Ojai) and concrete foundations (throughout map) as "surface
12 waters," even though the definition of surface waters under the Ordinance is NOT to include man-
13 made water features.

JMBM E 14 170. While the Ordinance does outline a process for appealing the County's mislabeling
15 and misidentification of features, the process is both costly and time consuming, and is to be fully
16 borne by the land owner (except for the first hour of staff time), These costs include the a biological
17 assessment report, all staff time beyond the first hour, and any other studies or data that the Planning
18 Staff may demand (hydrology studies, historical land use studies, geological surveys, additional
19

20

21 biological surveys, etc.). These costs are substantial and can quickly add up into the tens of
thousands of dollars.

171. The County, rather than subjecting the Ordinance to CEQA review as legally
22 required, opted to use outdated and inaccurate studies as the basis for its decisions, and on top of
23 that, made additional regulatory decisions (such as the inclusion of certain areas within the CWPAs)
24

26 with NO evidentiary support whatsoever, hoping to find evidence after the fact to "justify" the
regulatory proposals of the Ordinance.

3.

27 172. The Ordinance Does Not and Cannot Achieve Its Stated Purpose
The Ordinance is fatally infected by the lack of currency of the data on which it relies,
28 the post-hoc search for data to support a pre-ordained conclusion, and the arbitrary and haphazard

65773375v1 37
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

- application of the proposed regulations.

2 173. Among other actions, the Planning Commission's removal of areas such as Tierra

3 Rejada from the Ordinance was, in fact, one of the only data-driven actions taken throughout this

4 entire process: available information indicated, for example that no mountain lions were present in

5 that area, and policies intended to promote the movement of that species therefore did not apply.

6 This is partly due to the Tierra Rejada Valley being a rich agricultural area unsuitable for significant

7 wildlife movement. Yet the Board of Supervisors, on the whim of its Chair, opted to include Tierra

8 Rejada for no discernable reason.

174. Even in the areas that arguably might benefit from regulation to promote wildlife

10 movement, the staff and consultants drafting the Ordinance admit, as discussed above, the measures
11
9 actually developed were not data-driven, and ultimately are ineffective in any case absent
Butler & Mitchell sjeßuew Jayaf. JMBM & 12 regulations regarding highways and freeways, which are outside of the County's regulatory
13 I jurisdiction.

14 175. Further, as the maps provided to the public and County decisionmakers include the
15 Coastal Zone, the County's assessment of the effect of the Ordinance appears to assume regulations
16 within the Coastal Zone that largely correspond to those in non-coastal areas, to facilitate movement
17 from the coast to the inland mountain ranges. Thus, the failure to include the Coastal Zone within

18 the Ordinance not only misrepresents its scope, but also deprives any assessment of the overall effect
19 of the Ordinance of substantial evidentiary support.

20 176. As such, not only does the Ordinance not achieve its stated objectives, but unless a
21 thorough CEQA review is undertaken (which necessarily would involve an analysis of all aspects
22 of the wildlife corridors, inside and outside of the Coastal Zone), it will be unable to achieve its
23 stated purpose.

24 F. THE COUNTY VIOLATED COUNTY RESIDENTS' DUE PROCESS

25 RIGHTS

26 177. The California Constitution provides that, "a person may not be deprived of life,
27 liberty, or property without due process of law or denied equal protection of the laws." (Cal. Const.
28 Art. 1, § 7(a).)

65773375vl 38
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 178. The United States Constitution also provides that a state cannot "deprive any person
2 of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law." (United States Constitution, amend. XIV,
3 § 1.)

4 179.

5 The County violated has violated due process for four reasons: 1) non-responsiveness
and delay in connection with a Public Records Act request that was submitted on behalf of CoLAB,
6 depriving the public of proper notice of the true information and reasoning in connection with the

7 Ordinance; 2) failure to re-open the matter for public comment after the Board made major changes
8 to the Ordinance, and related failure to send the matter back to the Planning Commission when
9 changes were made at Board level; 3) failure to provide notice to important stakeholders, and 4)
10 failure to provide for a proper appeal process as it pertains to errors in mapping made by the County

9 11

Butler & Mitchell sjaluem Jayaf. 12 in the Ordinance, and shifting the burden of proper mapping to property owners.

1.

13 180. Delay and Non-Responsiveness to Public Records Act Request
A Public Records Act

JMBM E request was submitted on CoLAB's behalf in September 2018
14 to obtain documents that would better explain the process by which the County arrived at the
15 seemingly unsupported regulations contained in the Ordinance.

16 181. The County delayed its response by more than 5 months, providing a very sparse
17 and incomplete response on

18 Ordinance. February 15, 2019- after the Planning Commission hearing on the

19 182. Because the responsive documents were provided after the Planning Commission
20| hearing and less than one month before the Board hearing, CoLAB (and the rest of the public) did
21 not have time to review and analyze the documents it received, and was totally unable to provide
22 informed comments at the Planning Commission phase.
23 183. After the documents were finally produced (just weeks before the Board hearing, and
24 still incomplete), CoLAB requested a continuance of the Board hearing so that it could review the
25 produced documents, which contain critical evidence relating to the lack of scientific support for
26 the overlay zones and proposed regulations in the Ordinance (a prime example being the email from
27 County consultants/staff discussed above admitting that the main barriers to wildlife movements are
28 roads and highways, and that the measures in the Ordinance will do nothing to help that, and

65773375vl 39
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

i

2 admitting that decisions were made in CWPA zones without any supporting evidence).

184.

3 The County's failure to continue the hearing deprived CoLAB, and the broader

4 public, of the ability to review the documents provided and provide meaningful comment.

2.

5 Significant Changes to Ordinance Made at Board Level Without Public

6 185. Comment or Planning Commission Review

7 The Board made significant changes to the Ordinance, after the close of public

8 comment, which the public never got an opportunity to opine on.

186. Specifically, the Board directed staff to revise the proposed HCWC Zone map to
remove all property located within the Los Padres National Forest (hundreds of thousands of acres

9 Butler & Mitchell 10 of land), In addition they revised the Oak View CWPA map and removed significant lands from
11

sjeBuey Jayef 12 the Santa Rosa Valley choke point and the high-density Oak Park subdivision.

187.

13 This should have been referred to the Planning Commission pursuant to Government

JMBM: 14 Code section 65857, as discussed above. This would have allowed the public an opportunity to

15 comment, and more importantly, give the public a chance to see if there are other territories included

16 within those overlay zones with similar characteristics, that could have been excluded as well.

188. Despite this not happening, the Board had another opportunity to at least open this

17 matter to the public because the relevant changes to the overlay zone maps would not be effectuated
18 until the March 19, 2019 hearing (1 week after the March 12 hearing when the decision was made).
19 189. The Board, instead, made these major changes to the Ordinance without ever opening
20 the matter for public comment. Thus, the public was denied of notice and an opportunity to be heard,
21

22 despite the County having ample opportunity to do so.

3.

23 190. Failure to Provide Notice to Important Stakeholders
Several comment letters were submitted to the County expressing the fact that
24 property owners were not given notice that their own properties would be included within one or
25 more of the overlay zones. In this regard, those property owners were denied notice and an
26 opportunity to be heard.

27 4.

28 191. Appeals Process for County's Own Mapping Errors is Lacking

65773375v1 The Planning Commission recognized, due to overwhelming evidence presented to

40
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

it in public comment, that there are flaws with the ways that the Ordinance identifies many water
2 features, vegetation, and overlay zone boundaries.

3 192. Yet, the Ordinance does not provide an administrative appeal process that feasibly
4 allows a property owner to address errors or circumstances specific to that property without

5 significant expense.

6 193. As to surface water features, for example, property owners seeking reconsideration
7 of those designations are responsible for all costs (including hiring a biologist, planning consultant,

8 and a surveyor, among other things), except for the "first hour" of staff time.
194. Also, the decision is made by the Planning Director and there is no indication
10 regarding whether administrative appeal is available.

11 195. In addition to shifting the burden and cost to the property owner to have improperly 3 Butler & Mitchell sjpuew Jayaf 12 designated features to be properly designated, the lack of administrative appeals deprives property
13 owners of due process. It also fails to provide a route for recurring policy or regulatory problems to
14 achieve adequate exposure to elected decisionmakers. WENL 15 196. The burden of bearing the cost to hire a biologist to convince the County that its
16 designations are wrong (or that they need modification) will be prohibitive for many property
17 owners, and at the public comment stage, recommended that this cost-burden should be replaced by
18 a low fixed fee (which was rejected in the final version of the Ordinance). This cost-shifting is all
19 the more inappropriate and alarming given the number and extent of errors in mapping to which
20 staff have admitted throughout the process of adoption of the Ordinance.
21 197. In addition, the Surface Water Feature Buffer map in the GIS layer was not adopted
22 as an exhibit to the Ordinance. Instead, the definition of Surface Water Feature is as follows:
23 Surface Water Feature - An area containing a stream (including intermittent and ephemeral), creek, river, wetland, seep, or pond, the riparian habitat area associated 24 with the feature, as well as a development buffer area that is 200 feet as measured from the farthest extent of the surface water feature and its associated riparian area. 25 The data used to designate the areas are obtained from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory Dataset. Areas designated as surface water 26 features are shown on the "Surface Water Feature Buffer" map within the Planning GIS Wildlife Corridor layer of the County of Ventura County View 27 Geographic Information System (GIS), as may be amended by the Planning Director. The term surface water feature does not include ponds, lakes, marshes, 28 wetlands or agricultural water impoundments or associated riparian habitat areas that

65773375v1 41
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

are legally established and human-made. [Emphasis supplied]

2 198. The Planning Director thus has unbridled discretion to make changes to the GIS

3 mapping, with no notice to effected property owners, violating due process rights of owners, who
4 are not given notice or an opportunity to be heard regarding any changes.

199. Had the County simply conducted the legally required CEQA analysis, these

6 mapping errors would have been avoided in the first place (and finalized the appropriate GIS maps,

7 which could have and should have been added as an exhibit to the Ordinance). To add insult to
8 injury, the County has now made its own resulting mapping errors the problem of property owners
within the County, in clear violation of their due process rights.

10 G. THE ORDINANCE VIOLATES EQUAL PROTECTION

11 200.
9 The California Constitution provides that, "a person may not be deprived of life,
Butler & Mitchell NEWI 12 liberty, or property without due process of law or denied equal protection of the laws." Cal. Const.
13 Art. 1, § 7(a). §

14 201. The U.S. Constitution also prohibits the denial of equal protection through the
15 fourteenth amendment. United States Constitution, amend. XIV, § 1, and 42 USC § 1983.

16 202. The County must have a rational basis for treating those property owners whose
17 properties are located within the overlay zones differently than property owners whose properties
18 are located outside of the overlay zones.

19 203. The rational basis test requires that the classification be a demonstrably effective

20 means for furthering some actual valid government interest. (E.g., City of Cleburne v. Cleburne
21 Living Center (1985) 473 U.S. 432, 440.)

22 204. The County, rather than conducting a CEQA analysis to properly analyze where, how
23 big, and how intense the proposed overlay zones should be, decided to skip any scientific review,
24 and proceed to drafting the proposed Ordinance, based on a more than a decade-old study, that was
25 never meant to serve as the foundation for an Ordinance of this magnitude.

26 205. The County's methodology was flawed, the overlay zones were improperly mapped,
27 and that the Ordinance improperly, and without a rational a basis, includes properties that have not
28 been shown to assist in attaining the goals of the Ordinance.

65773375vl 42
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

)

1 206. Specifically, the County identified 4 objectives for designating overlay zones:

2 1. Minimizing habitat fragmentation within designated habitat connectivity corridors.

3 2. Maintaining corridor widths or enhancing corridor "chokepoints" (defined as

4 "narrow, impacted, or otherwise tenuous wildlife movement corridor or linkage") to

5 facilitate species movement between natural areas.

6 3. Minimizing direct physical barriers to wildlife movement (e.g. fences, roads).

7 4. Minimizing indirect barriers to wildlife movement (e.g., lighting, human presence,

8 noise, vegetation degradation, domestic animals (dogs, cats)).
9 207. Yet, the County did no parcel-by-parcel analysis, and no study (beyond the reviewing
10 the outdated SCW reports) to determine which parcels within the County meet these criteria, and
11 which do not.

any 9 Neypaw guapng 12 208. As a result, there are many properties that meet these criteria that are not in Sjouew Jajaf JMBM & 13 overlay zone, and there are properties that do not meet these criteria that have been improperly
14 included within the overlay zones.

15 209. There is no tional basis for treating the overlay zones differently than other
16 similarly situated unincorporated areas of the County, because the appropriate analyses were never
17 undertaken at all. By definition, this means that the Ordinance lacks a rational basis.

18 H. THE ORDINANCE EFFECTUATES A REGULATORY TAKING

19 210. Under Penn Central Transportation Company v. City of New York (1978) 438 US

20 104, even if a governmental regulation a does not cause a physical invasion or deprive a landowner
21 of all economically beneficial use, it may nonetheless go too far in placing what should be a public
22 burden on private shoulders.

23 211. Penn Central established an ad-hoc, fact-based inquiry that addresses three factors
24 to be used in determining whether this type of regulatory taking has occurred: (1) the economic
25  impact of the regulation on the claimant, (2) the extent to which the regulation has interfered with
26 distinct investment-backed expectations, and (3) the nature of the governmental action. (Id. at 124.)
27 212. Most disturbingly, the County will require property owners in three areas designated
28 as Critical Wildlife Passage Areas (Tierra Rejada Valley, Oak View and Simi Hills) to choose one

43 65773375vl
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

P

1 spot on their properties to build structures, and any additional development must be located within

2 a 100 foot envelope of that primary structure, rendering vast swaths of property completely unusable
3 land. The only limited exception to this would be if an applicant applied for a discretionary permit
4 requiring an expensive and time-consuming environmental analysis.

5 213. The Critical Wildlife Passage Areas are subject to extreme regulations controlling

6 brush clearance as well as rebuilding after wildfires.

7 214. As to the first factor, the economic impact of these regulations will vary from

8 property to property, but with a regulation as extreme as the deprivation of the use of the majority
9 of one's land for structures and certain designated uses, the impacts are severe. This is more akin to
10 a "conservation easement" (which would obviously require compensation) than to an overlay zone.
11 215. As to the second factor, the investment-backed expectations of the owners in the 3 laupaiw guapng sjeßuey Jayaf 12 CWPA zones were, obviously, that they would be able to use the entirety of their properties for legal
13 purposes. The forced clustering of structures within the property, along with the fencing prohibitions
JMBM ed 14 and lighting regulations, deprives property owners of the right to enjoy their properties, as was the
15 expectation when the properties were purchased.

16 216. As to the third factor, the government action in this case specifically calls out the
17 overlay zones for these overreaching regulations. There is an unexplained, irrational, arbitrary and
18 capricious designation of these overlay zones without any scientific backing or CEQA review.

19 County cannot point to a scientific analysis that was conducted in recent years (the basis for the

20 study was made in 2006), that took into effect the recent fires, and that was based on scientific
21 | principles. As such, the government action has no scientific or legal foundation.

22 217. The three factors of the Penn Central test are therefore easily satisfied, and the
23 Ordinance effectuates a regulatory taking upon those in the overlay zones.
24 I. THE ORDINANCE IS INCONSISTENT WITH THE GENERAL PLAN

25 218. Section 65860 of the Government Code requires consistency between zoning
26 ordinances and a general a plan. "Consisten[cy] with the general plan" can be found only if a local
27 agency has adopted a General Plan and the various land uses the ordinance authorizes are compatible
28 with the objectives, policies, general land uses, and programs specified in the plan.

44 65773375vI
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

219. Here, the Ordinance would result in fundamental conflicts with at least three of the
2 fundamental policy frameworks of the General Plan: mineral resources, fire hazards, and agriculture,
3 precluding a finding of consistency between the Ordinance and the General Plan.

4 1. Mineral Resources

5 220. The Ordinance would reduce access to mineral resources, conflicting with the
6 General Plan.

7 221. The County's classified and designated mineral resources are protected by goals,
8 policies and programs for mineral resources established in section 1.4 of the County's General Plan.
9 These resources are depicted in the County's Resource Protection Map and Mineral Resources
10 Protection Overlay Zones. Id., Fig. 1b.

11 222. As detailed in a technical analysis submitted into the record by CalCIMA, the 9
weup!W g Japng sjeQuew Jayef- 12 Ordinance would include vast acreages of mineral resources that have been both classified and

13 designated by the state, including approximately 13,000 acres of state-classified mineral resource
JMBM: 14 zone (MRZ-2) areas-approximately 41 percent of the County's supply---included within the area
15 of the Ordinance. The area affected by the Ordinance will also include portions of these MRZ-2
16 areas that have been designated as regionally significant mineral resource sectors, as well as multiple
17 active mining properties.

18 223, The inclusion of these classified and designated mineral resources and mining
19 properties in the Ordinances has the potential to significantly impair and unreasonably delay the
20  extraction of these resources, in addition to the operation and expansion of mining properties,
21 thereby increasing the overall costs of developing mineral resources. Furthermore, the restrictions

22 on the removal of vegetation could limit development of these important mineral resources, which

23 requires surface disturbance, including the removal of native vegetation. Additionally, the extensive
24 restrictions on "surface water features" could impair both river and in-stream mining activities, as
25 well as mineral resources that include such features.

26 224. Also, the Ordinance could significantly impair and potentially preclude the
27 extraction of the County's classified and designated mineral resources, and the operation and
28 expansion of mining properties, because the purpose of the Project-i.e., the conservation of wildlife

65773375vl 45
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 habitat, including wildlife habitat and corridors-is inherently incompatible with the development
2 of mineral resources, which requires surface disturbances prior to the extraction of mineral resources

3 located thereunder.

4 225. The plain language of the Ordinance which does not exempt mining, and in fact
5 threatens it, conflicts with the General Plan.

6 2. Fire Hazards

7 226. Section 2.13 of the Hazards Appendix to the General Plan addresses fire hazards. As
8 stated therein, "Ventura County is subject to a wide range of fire hazards throughout the year."
9 § 2.13.1. Figure 2.13.1 demonstrates the history of 82 fires that each have consumed over-1,000
10 acres in the County since 1953, not including the more recent Thomas, Rye, and Creek Fires that
11 collectively burned 383,000 acres and 3,190 structures in three Counties, including Ventura. Figures 3
Waypaw gJal sjeßuew Joyaf 12 2.13.2-a and -b of that section demonstrate the large proportion of the County that has historically
13 burned. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, over 135,000 acres of the

JMBME 14 corridors are located within designated fire hazard areas.

15 227. Consistent with this established history of severe fires, the General Plan contains a
16 policy framework related to fire protection. § 2.13.1-2.13.3. Also, the County's Fire Protection
17 District Hazard Abatement program calls for the clearing of brush, flammable vegetation, or
18 combustible growth located within 100 feet of structures or buildings. However, among other
19 provisions of the Ordinance, the new and strict limits on vegetation modification conflict with this
20 fundamental health- and safety-related policy framework.

21 228. The primary goals are minimizing the risk of loss of life, injury, and physical and
22 economic damage from fires; and ensuring development in high-fire hazard areas "is designed and

23 constructed in a manner that minimizes the risk from fire hazards." Id., § 2.13.1. However, the
24 Ordinance enacts severe restrictions on vegetation removal or modification that run contrary to this
25 central goal.

26 229. For example, section 8109.4.8.3.2 of the Ordinance purports to exempt vegetation
27 modification that is imposed as a condition of approval or federal or State law; however, the
28 provision otherwise limits vegetation modification to a cumulative 10 percent of the lot area located

65773375vl 46
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 within a water feature. As defined in the Ordinance, a water feature comprises the body of water

2 itself, such as a stream, as well as a 200-foot buffer area. § 8102-0. But the County-by its own
3 admission-identified surface water features for the purposes of the Ordinance using antiquated and

4 unreliable satellite imagery that Petitioner is informed and believes is substantially over-inclusive.

5 230. Further, technical information upon which the County purported to rely demonstrates

6 that areas designated by the Ordinance as wildlife corridors, such as Tierra Rejada, do not even
7 contain the kinds of animals the Ordinance was intended to protect, such as California mountain
8 lions. These mapping inaccuracies vastly and erroneously increase the areas within which these

9 limitations apply, prohibiting systematic fuel modification in areas where the General Plan technical
10 data and policy indicate that modification is historically needed.

11 231. The Ordinance would permit continued growth of brush and limit the ability of 3 llaypuW g Jepna -| Jeffer Mangels 12 property owners to mitigate its effects and prevent or slow the spread of the kinds of severe fires to
13 which the area is generally prone. These limitations substantially increase the fire risk to structures,
NENI 14 people and property, and also substantially increase the corresponding risk of economic harm, in a
15 manner that directly conflicts with the General Plan policy framework regarding fire hazards.
16 3. Agriculture

17 232. Sections 1.6.1 to 1.6.3 of the General Plan provide goals, policies and programs
18 related to agricultural uses. Chief among the goals is preservation and protection of agricultural
19 lands as non-renewal resources, as well as encouraging the continuation and development of
20 facilities and programs that support agricultural production, and improving the economic viability
21 of agriculture in the County.

22 233. The goals articulated in section 1.6.1 are threefold:

23 1. Preserve and protect agricultural lands a as a nonrenewable resource to assure the

24 continued availability of such lands for the production of food, fiber and ornamentals.

25 2. Encourage the continuation and development of facilities and programs that
26 support agricultural production and enhance the marketing of County grown
27 agricultural products.

28 3. Improve the economic viability of agriculture through policies that support

65773375v1 47
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

A

agriculture as an integral business to the County."

2 234. Here, livestock operations are not exempt from requirements that place livestock at
3 increased risk of attack and loss, particularly if the Ordinance achieves its goal of facilitating the

4 movement of predatory species such as mountain lions. Livestock raising and sales generates
substantial economic activity in the County and in the State: according to the State Department of

6 Conservation, the sale of cattle and calves ranks third in dollar amounts among agricultural

7 commodities in the State.

8 235. The majority of fencing used to enclose agricultural crops and livestock qualifies as
9 wildlife impermeable fencing.

10 236. The Ordinance would substantially limit the ability of those raising and/or grazing

11
9 livestock from enclosing their properties to protect them from escape or predation, The Ordinance
Butler & Mitchell sp8uep Jayef 12 limits the total arca subject to enclosure to ten percent of properties in which no such fencing exists
13 ex ante, or where fencing does exist, to no more than ten percent additional enclosed area. Outside

JMBM 14 of those limits, a discretionary Planned Development Permit would be required. Under the
15 Ordinance, the County would no longer have a ministerial duty to approve those improvements and
16 secure livestock and associated material from animals or from the general public.
17 237. This shift is all the more problematic given the specific program in the General Plan
18 to protect specific features of agricultural operations and incorporate those protections into the
19 General Plan. As stated in Section 1.6.3, Program 2 requires the County to:
20 develop and implement standards governing development adjacent to agricultural

21 uses. The standards should address fencing and spray buffers between agricultural areas and residences, off-site flood control measures, siltation control from grading
22 operations and the development of a standard County-imposed entitlement condition which notifies new property owners of County and State laws protecting agricultural

23 operations. After the development of standards, they could be added as policies into the General Plan to guide future land use decisions. [Emphasis supplied.]

24 238. The Ordinance specifically undercuts this fundamental policy framework of the
25 General Plan-which was adopted specifically to protect agricultural uses and prevent the effects
26 of their loss--and is therefore inconsistent, in violation of Government Code section 65008.

2 THE COUNTY FAILED TO COMPLY WITH THE SURFACE MINING
AND RECLAMATION ACT

3 239, The County was required by law to comply with the Surface Mining and Reclamation
4 Act because of the Project's inclusion of more than 13,000 acres of valuable mineral resources that

5

6 (i) have been classified by the California Division of Mines and Geology (renamed the California

7 Geological Survey in 2006), and (ii) subsequently designated as "regionally significant" by the State

18 (Petition for Writ of Mandate Under Public Resources Code § 21168.5 and

19 California Code of Civil Procedure 8 1085 and/or 1094.5 - Violation of CEQA)
243.

20 Petitioner hereby incorporates by this reference the allegations of all previous
paragraphs of this Petition as though fully set forth herein,

21 244. In connection with its issuance of the Notice of Exemption claiming the common

22 sense exemption under CEQA Guidelines § 15061(b)(3) and conservation exemptions under CEQA
23

24 Guidelines §§ 15307 and 15308, Respondent County abused its discretion, did not proceed in the
manner required by law, failed to make required findings, and failed to act on the basis of substantial
25 evidence.

26 245. The County failed to conduct an adequate environmental review process for the
27 Project. Respondent's failures constitute violations of the California Environmental Quality Act.
28 246. Significant or potentially-significant impacts arising from the Project were not

10 Guidelines § 15061(b)(3) must be supported by substantial record evidence. The agency relying
upon the exemption bears the burden of proving its applicability. See Davidon Homes v. City of San

17 splitting (piecemealing), because it separated the Ordinance from the General Plan Update in order
18 to evade CEQA review.

19 252. Each of the failings above is exacerbated by the misrepresentation of the scope of the
20 Ordinance--specifically, the lack of clarity regarding the relationship of the Ordinance to the
21 Coastal Zone and its resulting effectiveness--and the resulting failure to evaluate "the whole of the
22 action," as required by CEQA Guidelines section 15378(a).

23 253.

24 Petitioner as well as members of the general public will suffer irreparable harm if the
relief requested herein is not granted and the Ordinance is allowed to go into effect in the absence
25 of a full and adequate CEQA analysis and absent compliance with all other applicable provisions of
26 CEQA.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION 1

2 (Petition for Writ of Mandate Under California Code of
4.5 - Violation of Government Code §§ 65855 and 65857) 3 Civil Procedure § 1085 and/or

4 254. Petitioner hereby incorporates by this reference the allegations of all previous
5 paragraphs of this Petition as though fully set forth herein.

255. Government Code §65855 provides: "After the hearing, the planning commission
7 shall render its decision in the form of a written recommendation to the legislative body. Such 6

8 Il recommendation shall include the reasons for the recommendation, the relationship of the proposed

9 ordinance or amendment to applicable general and specific plans, and shall be transmitted to the
10 legislative body in such and manner as may be specified by the legislative body."

11 256. Government Code section 65857 states that the Board "may approve, modify or 3 leyouw gJanng sjeBuew Jayaf 12 disapprove the recommendation of the planning commission; provided that any modification of the
13 proposed ordinance or amendment by the legislative body not previously considered by the planning

WINI 14 commission during its hearing, shall first be referred to the planning commission for report and

15 recommendation

16 257. The Board made significant changes to the Ordinance that were not considered by
17 the Planning Commission, and proceeded directly to approval of the Ordinance, in direct violation
18 of Government Code §65855 and 65857.

19 258. Petitioner as well as members of the general public will suffer irreparable harm if the
20 relief requested herein is not granted and the Ordinance is allowed to go into effect in the absence

21 of a full and adequate CEQA analysis and absent compliance with the Government Code
22 requirements.

THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION 23

24 (Declaratory Relief Under Code of Civil Procedure § 1060 -

25 Violation of Due Process, Equal Protection, Vested Property Rights, and

26 Regulatory Taking, under the California and United States Constitutions)

27 259. Petitioner hereby incorporates by this reference the allegations of all previous
28  paragraphs of this Petition as though fully set forth herein.

51 65773375vI
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 260. Petitioner has exhausted all applicable nonjudicial remedies.

2 261. An actual and substantial controversy exists between Petitioner and the County over
3 the lawfulness of the County's Ordinance.

262. For the reasons previously stated, Petitioner asserts that the County's actions,
5 including adopting the Wildlife Corridor Ordinance: 1) violate CEQA, 2) violate Government Code 4

6 §65855 and §65857, 3) violate County residents' right to due process under the California and U.S.
7 Constitutions, 4) violate equal protection under the California and U.S. Constitutions, 5) violate
8 vested property rights under the California and U.S. Constitutions, and 6) constitute a regulatory
9 taking under Penn Central.

10 263. On information and belief, the County asserts that its actions, and the Wildlife
11 Corridor Ordinance, do not violate any of the above. 3 jjaypaw gJapng 12 264. Therefore, declaratory relief is appropriate. sjaBuew Jayel FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION 13

(Petition for Writ of Mandate Under California Code of : WEW 14

15 Civil Procedure § 1085 - Ordinance is Arbitrary and Capricious)
16 265. Petitioner hereby incorporates by this reference the allegations of all previous
17 I paragraphs of this Petition as though fully set forth herein.

18 266. Given the lack of CEQA review, the County failed to support its regulations with any
19 scientific or factual basis. Instead, the Ordinance is arbitrary and capricious, and not supported by
20 substantial evidence.

21 267. The evidence for the Ordinance comprises studies over 13 years old, with no updates,
22 rendering the resulting regulations questionable at best. Thus, the studies that form the scientific,
23 biological, and evidentiary basis for the Ordinance are both inaccurate and outdated.

268. Petitioner as well as members of the general public will suffer irreparable harm if the
25 relief requested herein is not granted and the Ordinance is allowed to go into effect in the absence 24

26 of a full and adequate CEQA analysis and absent compliance with the Government Code
27 requirements.

FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (Civil Rights Violations - 42 U.S.C. 1983)
269. Petitioner hereby incorporates by this reference the allegations of all previous
4 paragraphs of this Petition as though fully set forth herein.

270. For the reasons previously stated, Petitioner asserts that the County's actions,
including adopting the Wildlife Corridor Ordinance: 1) violate CEQA, 2) violate Government Code
§65855 and $65857, 3) violate County residents' right to due process under the California and U.S.
8 Constitutions, 4) violate equal protection under the California and U.S. Constitutions, 5) violate
vested property rights under the California and U.S. Constitutions, and 6) constitute a regulatory
10 taking under Penn Central.

11 271. By virtue of the foregoing, the County, acting under the color of the laws of the State 9
H3yp2!W g Japng Jeffer Mangels 12 of California, and the laws, regulations and customs of the County, deprived Petitioner of the rights
13 and privileges secured by the United States Constitution and laws.

14 272. WANI Petitioner is entitled to attorneys' fees pursuant to 42 USC § 1988.
15 SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION

16 (Petition for Writ of Mandate Under California Code of

17 Civil Procedure § 1085 and/or 1094.5; Declaratory Relief Under Code of Civil Procedure
18 1060 -- Inconsistency with General Plan Violation of Government Code § 65008)
19 273. Petitioner hereby incorporates by this reference the allegations of all previous
20 paragraphs of this Petition as though fully set forth herein.

21 274. Section 65860 of the Government Code requires consistency between zoning
22 ordinances and a general plan. "Consisten[cy] with the general plan" can be found only if a local
23 agency has adopted and General Plan and the various land uses the ordinance authorizes are

24 compatible with the objectives, policies, general land uses, and programs specified in the plan.
25 275. Here, the Ordinance would result in fundamental conflicts with at least three of the
26 fundamental policy frameworks of the General Plan: mineral resources, hazards, and agriculture,
27 precluding a finding of consistency between the Ordinance and the General Plan.

28 276. Petitioner as well as members of the general public will suffer irreparable harm if the

5 (Petition for Writ of Mandate Under California Code of

6

7 Civil Procedure § 1085 and/or 1094.5; Declaratory Relief Under Code of Civil Procedure §

8 1060 -- Violation of the Williamson Act - Government Code §§ 51200-51297.4 )

277. Petitioner hereby incorporates by this reference the allegations of all previous
9 paragraphs of this Petition as though fully set forth herein.

10 278. The California Land Conservation Act of 1965 (the "Williamson Act"; Govt. Code

9 11

llaypaw g uapng Jeffer Mangels § 51200-51297.4) provides, among other things, that cities and counties may enter into self-
12 renewing contracts with private landowners that restrict parcels of land to agricultural or related
13 open space
JMBM use. Govt. Code §§ 51201, 51240, 51242(a), 51244. In exchange for limiting the use of
14 the contracted property, landowners receive reductions in property tax assessments, because the
15 assessments are based on farming production or open space use, instead of full market value,
16 Qualifying uses include not only crop production, but also livestock raising, and can also include

17 mineral extraction. Govt. Code § 51201(a)(3), 51238.2. Measures that would have the effect of
18 reducing such production or compromising the long-term productivity, or would impair existing or
19 reasonably foreseeable agricultural uses, violate the law. See Govt. Code § 51238.1(a)(1)-(3).
20 Further, the act provides landowners a right of action against a breaching City or County. Govt.
21 Code § 51251.

22 279. Here, the Ordinance purports to exempt certain agricultural activities from the
23 restrictions otherwise imposed, including vegetation modification. See, e.g., Ordinance § 8109-
24 4.8.3.2.f and g, 8109-4.8.3.7.b. However, livestock operations are not exempt from requirements

25

26 that place their livestock at increased risk of attack and loss, particularly if the Ordinance achieves
its goal of facilitating the movement of predatory species such as mountain lions, and that movement
27 results in closer proximity to agricultural operations, including livestock raising. Livestock raising
28 and sales generates substantial economic activity in the County and in the State.

65773375vl 54
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 280. The Ordinance defines "wildlife impermeable fencing" as any fence higher than 60
prevent free passage 2 inches, is electrified in any fashion, or is constructed of certain materials that
3 of wildlife "with little or no interference." Ordinance § 8102-0. Petitioner is informed and believes
4 the majority of fencing used to enclose agricultural crops and livestock qualifies as wildlife
5 impermeable fencing according to the terms of the Ordinance.

6 281. The Ordinance would substantially limit the ability of those raising and/or grazing
livestock from enclosing their properties to protect them from escape or predation, particularly in 7

8 the HCWC zone. The Ordinance limits the total area subject to enclosure to ten percent of properties
9 in which no such fencing exists ex ante, or where fencing does exist, to no more than ten percent
10 additional enclosed area, Id., subd. b. Outside of those limits, a discretionary Planned Development
11 Permit would be required. Id., subd. c. Under the Ordinance, the County would no longer have a dT ijaypaw g Jepng jeffer Mangels 3 WENI 12 ministerial duty to approve that fencing, and denials of such requests would result in the inability of
13 landowners to accommodate foreseeable increases in livestock production, in addition to the
creation of a greater threat of predation or escape of existing and future livestock inventory, and 14

15 would expose properties to a higher risk of theft, in violation of the Williamson Act.
16 282. In addition to livestock, to the extent mineral extraction operates under Williamson
17 Act contract in the County and is located within the area subject to the Ordinance, the failure of the
18 Ordinance to exempt such operations from the restrictions of the ordinance violate the Williamson
19 Act. Further, wildlife impermeable fencing and vegetation modification are not exempt with respect
20 to mining activities. See Ordinance § 8109-4.8.3.2. Additionally, the Ordinance's extensive
21 restrictions on "surface water features" do not exempt surface mining operations and could impair
22  both river and in-stream mining activities, as well as mineral resources that include such features.
23 Id.

24 283. The Ordinance would result in the inability of landowners to continue existing
25 mining operations or accommodate foresecable increases or expansion of mining activities, in
26 violation of the Williamson Act.

27 284. Petitioner as well as members of the general public will suffer irreparable harm if the
28 relief requested herein is not granted and the Ordinance is allowed to go into effect in the absence

55 65773375vI
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 of a full and adequate CEQA analysis and absent compliance with the Government Code
2 requirements.

3 EIGHTH CAUSE OF ACTION

4 (Petition for Writ of Mandate Under California Code of

5 Civil Procedure § 1085 and/or 1094.5; Declaratory Relief Under Code of Civil Procedure §

6 1060 -- Violation of Surface Mining and Reclamation Act, Pub. Res. Code §§ 2710 et seq.)

7 285. Petitioner hereby incorporates by this reference the allegations of all previous

8 paragraphs of this Petition as though fully set forth herein.

9 286. The Surface Mining and Reclamation Act ("SMARA") requires local agencies with
10 land use jurisdiction over state-classified and -designated mineral resources to prepare and

r & Mitchell LLP 11 transmit a Statement of Reasons specifying its proposed purpose for a project to the State Geologist
sa8uew Jayaf. JMBM : 12 and SMGB, prior to permitting a use which would threaten the potential to extract minerals in that
13 area. (Pub. Res. Code § 2762(d)(1).)
14 287. In addition, if the proposed use includes designated mineral resources (as opposed
15 to only classified resources), the local agency must include in its Statement of Reasons an analysis
16 balançing mineral values against alternative land uses that considered the importance of these
17 minerals to their market region as a whole and not just their importance to the lead agency's area of
18  jurisdiction, (Pub. Res. Code § 2763(a).)

19 288. Despite the Ordinance's inclusion of approximately 13,000 acres of classified and
20| designated mineral resources, and two letters from the State Geologist reminding the County of its
21 affirmative obligations under SMARA, including the preparation and transmittal of a Statement of
22 Reasons, the County rejected its duties and nevertheless approved the Ordinance.
23 289. The County's approval of the Ordinance without complying with its duties under
24 SMARA constitutes a prejudicial abuse of process and discretion for which there is no other
25 adequate remedy at law available to Petitioner.

26 290. Further, to the extent the County concluded that the Ordinance would not threaten
27 the potential to extract the 13,000+ acres of classified and designated mineral resources included
28 therein, that conclusion constitutes a prejudicial abuse of process and discretion for which there is

65773375v1 56
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

-

2 no other adequate remedy at law available to Petitioner.

291. If the County is not enjoined from implementing the Ordinance, Petitioner and the
3  public will suffer irreparable harm.

4 292.

5 Petitioner desires a judicial declaration and determination of the parties' respective

6 rights and duties in respect to the Ordinance. A judicial declaration is necessary and appropriate at

7 this time to eliminate uncertainties and controversies regarding the matters alleged herein.

8 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

9 WHEREFORE, Petitioner pray for relief as follows:
1. For a peremptory writ of mandate directing Respondent to set aside the Notice of

ler & Mitchell LLP 10 Exemption, and its adoption of the Ordinance in reliance upon the identified categorical exemptions,

sja8uew Jayaf 11 and to hold further required public hearings after giving public notice in the manner required by
12 law, in order to come into full compliance with CEQA;

13 2.

JMBM Eo a For a temporary stay, temporary restraining order, and preliminary and permanent
14 injunction restraining Respondent and their respective agents, servants and employees from taking
15 any action to implement the Wildlife Corridor Ordinance pending full compliance with CEQA and
16 other state and local laws;

17 3. For a declaration that the County's actions, specifically in enacting the Wildlife
18 Corridor Ordinance, 1) violate CEQA, 2) violate Government Code §65855 and §65857, 3) violate
19 County residents' right to due process under the California and U.S. Constitutions, 4) violate equal

20

21 protection under the California and U.S. Constitutions, 5) violate vested property rights under the
California and U.S. Constitutions, 6) constitute a regulatory taking under Penn Central, 7) violate
22 the Williamson Act, and 8) violate SMARA;

23 4.

24 5. For costs of suit in this action;

25 For reasonable attorneys' fees, including as authorized by Code of Civil Procedure §

26 1021.5, 42 USC 1988, and other provisions of law; and
