OAKLAND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Petitioners City of Temple City and City of Rosemead (collectively, "Petitioners") allege

2 through this Petition for Writ of Mandate ("Petition")' as follows:

3 INTRODUCTION

4 1. This Petition challenges the December 18, 2018 and January 8, 2019 decisions

5 of Respondent City Council of the City of El Monte to approve Development Agreement No.

6 02-18, Medicinal Cannabis Conditional Use Permit No. 07-18, Medicinal Cannabis

7 Conditional Use Permit No. 08-18, and Medicinal Cannabis Conditional Use Permit No. 09-

8 18 (collectively, the "Entitlements"), which would allow medicinal cannabis cultivation,

9 manufacturing, and distribution activities on a 4.4 acre site in the City of El Monte

10 ("Project"). Specifically, this Petition challenges Respondent City of El Monte's and

11 Respondent City Council of the City of El Monte's (collectively, "Respondents") reliance on

12 the Initial Study/Mitigated Negative Declaration ("MND") prepared/approved for the Project.

13 Respondents committed a number of errors and thus failed to ensure that the MND disclosed,

14 analyzed, and mitigated the Project's many foreseeable public health and environmental

15 impacts as required by the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public

16 Resources Code Sections 21000 et seq., and the CEQA Guidelines, Title 14, California Code

17 of Regulations Sections 15000 et seq.

18 2. For all these reasons, and as set forth in detail in this Petition, Respondents

19 failed to proceed in the manner required by law and committed a prejudicial abuse of a

20 discretion in relying on/adopting the MND and approving the Project and its Entitlements

21 based thereon. Petitioners accordingly seek a peremptory writ of mandate under Code of

22 Civil Procedure section 1085 and/or section 1094.5 and Public Resources Code section 21168

23 and/or section 21168.5 commanding Respondents to vacate and set aside the Entitlements and

24 the MND and refrain from taking any action in furtherance of the Project until Respondents

25 demonstrate and this court determines that Respondents fully complied with CEQA.

26 Petitioners further seek a stay of the effect of the Entitlements and a temporary restraining

27

28 Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 446, this Petition need not be verified.

SORENSeN, LLP - 1 -

OAKLAND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

order and a preliminary injunction against any/all Project activities during the pendency of

2 these proceedings. Finally, Petitioners seek an award of costs and attorneys' fees under Code

3 of Civil Procedure section 1021.5, together with any other relief the Court deems just and

4 proper.

5 PARTIES

6 3. Petitioner City of Temple City is a charter city in the State of California located

7 immediately north of Respondent City of El Monte. The City of Temple City is dedicated to

8 preventing environmental degradation, and to improving the quality of life within the City of

9 Temple City and the region, and ensuring that residents of the City of Temple City enjoy a good

10 quality of life. The City of Temple City participated in the administrative process leading up to

11 the City of El Monte's approval of the Entitlements, and lodged objections to the Project and the

12 MND prior to Respondents' final approval thereof. The maintenance and prosecution of this

13 action will confer a substantial benefit on the public by protecting the public from the

14 environmental and other harms alleged herein and by ensuring that Respondents abide by the

15 procedures required under law in approving development projects like the one at issue here. The

16 City of Temple City is beneficially interested in this matter because it has a direct interest in

17 ensuring that Respondents fulfill their duty to comply with CEQA and the City of El Monte

18 municipal code and ordinances. Given its close proximity to the City of El Monte, Petitioner City

19 of Temple City has an interest in preserving and protecting the environment for the general public

20 and its own residents. Indeed, although the land on which the Project will be located lies within

21 the City of El Monte, all roadway access to/from the Project site is within the jurisdiction of the

22 City of Temple City.

23 4. Petitioner City of Rosemead is a general law city in the State of California located

24 immediately west of Respondent City of El Monte. The City of Rosemead is dedicated to

25 preventing environmental degradation, and to improving the quality of life within the City of

26 Rosemead, and the region, and ensuring that residents of the City of Rosemead enjoy a good

27 quality of life. The City of Rosemead participated in the administrative process leading up to the

28 City of El Monte's approval of the Entitlements, and lodged objections to the Project and the
BURKE, WILLIAMS &
SORENSEN, LLP - 2 -

ATTORNEYS AT LAW
OAKLAND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 MND prior to Respondents' final approval thereof. The maintenance and prosecution of this

2 action will confer a substantial benefit on the public by protecting the public from the

3 environmental and other harms alleged herein and by ensuring that the City of El Monte abides

4 by the procedures required under law in approving development projects like the one at issue

5 here. The City of Rosemead is beneficially interested in this matter because it has a direct interest

6 in ensuring that Respondents fulfill their duty to comply with CEQA and the City of El Monte

7 municipal code and ordinances. Given its close proximity to the City of El Monte, Petitioner City

8 of Rosemead has an interest in preserving and protecting the environment for the general public

9 and its own residents.

10 5. Respondent City of El Monte is a general law city in the State of California

11 responsible for administering and carrying out its laws and applicable state laws. The City of El

12 Monte is the "lead agency" for the purposes of Public Resources Code Section 21067, with

13 principal responsibility for conducting environmental review of the proposed Project. The City of

14 El Monte has duty to comply with CEQA, state law, and its own ordinances.

15 6. Respondent City Council of the City of El Monte is, and at all times herein

16 mentioned was, the duly elected decision making body of Respondent City of El Monte. As the

17 decision making body, the City Council was charged with responsibilities under CEQA for

18 conducting a proper review of the proposed Project's environmental impacts and granting the

19 Entitlements necessary for the Project.

20 7. Petitioners are unaware of the true names and capacities of respondents fictitiously

21 named Does 1 through 20 and sue such respondents by fictitious names. Petitioners are informed
22 and believed, and on that basis allege, that the fictitiously named respondents are also responsible

23 for the actions described in this Petition. When the true identities and capacities of these

24 respondents have been determined, Petitioners will amend this Petition, with leave of the court if

25 necessary, to insert such identities and capacities.

26 8. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereon allege, that Real Party in Interest

27 GSC Holding Group, LLC ("GSC") is, and at all times herein mentioned was, the sole applicant

28 for the Entitlements granted by Respondents for the Project.
BURKE, WILLIAMS &
SORENSEN, LLP - 3 -

- 9.

2 Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereon allege, that Real Party in Interest

3 Oaks by the Lake, LLC is, and at all times herein mentioned was, the owner of the property

4 known as Assessor Parcel Number 8577-001-043 and/or 4400 Temple City Boulevard, El Monte,

5 CA where the Project is to be located. While Respondents' Notice of Intent to Adopt the MND

6 identified the "property owner" as "Oaks by the Lakes, LLC," the California Secretary of State's

7 business search website/database has no records for any such LLC but does have records showing

8 "Oaks by the Lake, LLC" is a registered/active LLC in California, and the Los Angeles County

9 Assessor confirmed that "Oaks by the Lake, LLC" is the owner of the Project site.

10.

10 Petitioners are unaware of the true names and capacities of Real Parties in Interest

11 Does 21 through 40 and sue such real parties in interest by fictitious names. Petitioners are

-12 informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that the fictitiously named real parties in interest

13 are directly and materially affected by the actions described in this Petition. When the true

14 identities and capacities of these real parties in interest have been determined, Petitioners will

15 amend this Petition, with leave of the court if necessary, to insert such identities and capacities.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

16 11.

17 This Court has jurisdiction of the matters alleged herein pursuant to Code of Civil

18 Procedure sections 526, 527, 1085, 1087, and 1094.5, and Public Resources Code sections 21168
and 21168.5.

19 12.

20 Venue for this action properly lies in the Superior Court for the State of California

21 in and for the County of Los Angeles pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 394 as

22 Respondents are located in and the activities authorized by the approved Entitlements will occur

23 in the City of El Monte, which is located in Los Angeles County. Consistent with Local Rule

24 3.232, this Petition will be filed in LA County Superior Court's Central District.

13.

25 Respondents have taken final agency actions with respect to adopting/approving

26 the MND, the Project and its Entitlements. Respondents have a duty to comply with applicable

27 state laws, including but not limited to CEQA, prior to undertaking the discretionary approvals at

28 issue in this lawsuit. Respondents failed to comply with that duty and Petitioners possess no

BURKE, WILLIAMS &
SOreNsen, LLP effective remedy to challenge the approvals at issue in this action other than by means of this

ATTORNEYS AT LAW
OAXLAND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

lawsuit.

2 14. On January 17, 2019, Petitioners complied with Public Resources Code section

3 21167.5 by mailing to Respondents a letter stating that Petitioners planned to file a Petition for

4 Writ of Mandate challenging the adequacy of the MND approved by Respondents and seeking to
invalidate the Project approvals/Entitlements. Attached hereto as Exhibit A is a true and correct

6 copy of and proof of service for this "Notice of Commencement" letter.

7 15. On January 18, 2019, Petitioners complied with Public Resources Code Section

8 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure section 388 by furnishing the Attorney General of the State

9 of California with a copy a of the Petition. Attached hereto as Exhibit B is a true and correct copy

10 of and proof of service for the letter transmitting the Petition to the Attorney General.

11 16. Pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.6(a), Petitioners request that

12 Respondents prepare the record of proceedings in this action pursuant to the record content

13 requirements of section 21167.6(e) and Local Rule 3.232. Concurrently with this Petition,

14 Petitioners are filing a Request to Prepare the Record of Proceedings and will serve that Request

15 on Respondents together with a copy of this Petition.

16 17. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary

17 law unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate and issues a peremptory writ requiring

18 Respondents to set aside their adoption of the MND and approvals for the Project. In the absence

19 of such remedies, Respondents' approvals will remain in effect in violation of state law, and the

20 environment, Petitioners, and residents and property owners of the City of El Monte, City of

21 Rosemead, City of Temple City, and nearby communities will be irreparably harmed. No money

22 damages or legal remedy could adequately compensate Petitioners or the general public (on

23 whose behalf this action is brought) for that harm.

24 18. Petitioners are entitled to recover attorneys' fees under Code of Civil Procedure

25 section 1021.5 if they prevail in this action and the Court finds that a significant benefit has been

26 conferred on the general public or a large a class of persons, and that the necessity and burden of

27 private enforcement is such as to make an award of fees appropriate.

H EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

2 19.

3 This Petition is brought consistent with the requirements of Public Resources Code

4 section 21177 and Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5. Petitioners objected to Respondents'
approval of the MND and the Project orally or in writing during the public comment period

5 provided by CEQA and/or prior to the close of the public hearings on the Project before the

6 issuance of the Notice of Determination. Indeed, Petitioners submitted comment letters to

7 Respondents on or about November 21, 2018, November 26, 2018, December 6, 2018, and

8

9 December 12, 2018 detailing numerous inadequacies of the MND and objecting to the Project's

10 approval. Petitioners and/or other members of the public raised each of the legal deficiencies

11 asserted in this Petition orally or in writing during the public comment period provided by CEQA,

12 or prior to the close of the public hearings on the Project before the issuance of the Notice of
Determination.

13 20.

14 Petitioners have performed any and all conditions precedent to filing the instant

15 action and have exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent possible and
required by law.

16 FACUAL ALLEGATIONS

17 Description of the Project Area and Project

18 21. The Project will be located within an existing 71,658 square foot industrial

19

20 building on a 4.4 acre site located at 4400 Temple City Boulevard, El Monte, California 91731

21 (APN 8577-002-054) (*Subject Property"). The Subject Property is located in the M-2 General

22 Manufacturing zone, and has frontage along the east side of Ellis Lane/Temple City Boulevard.

23 Access to the Subject Property is provided via two existing driveways located on the east side of

24 Ellis Lane/Temple City Boulevard. The Subject Property is surrounded on three sides by land
uses currently devoted to Regional Commercial and Industrial/Business Park. However,

25

26 residential development occupies the frontage along the west side of Ellis Lane, opposite the

27 Subject Property, and residents of Respondent City of Temple City, including families with small

28 children, live, work, shop, and attend school in the neighborhood and immediate vicinity of the
Subject Property.

OAKLAND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 22. Petitioners are informed and believe that the Project site is contaminated and

2 undergoing active remediation. In addition to being in the vicinity of extensive groundwater

3 contamination associated with the City of El Monte's San Gabriel Groundwater Basin Superfund

4 site that is subject to ongoing, long term remediation under the U.S. Environmental Protection

5 Agency's jurisdiction, the Subject Property itself and/or its groundwater was also contaminated

6 by volatile organic compounds by a prior business (Miller Dial Corporation) that was required to

7 install vapor extraction/remediation wells which remain and operate on the Project site under the

8 State of California's Department of Toxic Substances Control's continuing jurisdiction.

9 23. On September 25, 2018, Real Party in Interest GSC filed an application for

10 Development Agreement No. 02-18 and Medicinal Cannabis Conditional Use Permit Nos. 07-18,

11 08-18, and 09-19, consisting of: (1) a Conditional Use Permit to allow medicinal cannabis

12 cultivation; (2) a Conditional Use Permit for medicinal cannabis manufacturing, and (3) a

13 Conditional Use Permit for medicinal cannabis distribution; and (4) adoption of a MND and

14 Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program to conduct commercial medicinal cannabis

15 activities on the Subject Property.

16 24. Real Party in Interest GSC proposes to establish medicinal cannabis cultivation,

17 manufacturing, and distribution operations on the Subject Property. To establish such operations,

18 GSC proposes to remodel the existing 71,658 square foot building, and to upgrade the utilities to

19 accommodate the proposed use.

20 Respondents' Review and Approval of the Project

21 25. On or about November 8, 2018, Respondents released a Notice of Intent to Adopt

22 the MND as well as the Initial Study and Mitigated Negative Declaration for the Project for

23 public review and comment. The MND asserted that despite the Project's significant size and

24 industrial scope - which includes a 43,882 square foot cultivation area capable of producing

25 8,850 marijuana plants per harvest cycle for five (5) harvest cycles per year for a total of 44,250

26 plants per year, a 8,674 square foot manufacturing/extraction area, and a 8,338 square foot

27 distribution area located directly across the street from a residential area, the Project will have

28 10 significant, unmitigated environmental impacts.
BURKE, WILLIAMS &
SORENSEN, LLP - 7-

ATTORNEYS AT LAW
OAKLAND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 26. The MND was made available for public comment from November 8, 2018

2 through November 27, 2018. Various persons and entities - including Petitioners and residents of

3 El Monte, Rosemead, and Temple City - submitted written comments on and objections to the

4 MND and the Project prior to the close of the public comment period. Those comments stated

5 and demonstrated, inter alia, that the MND had failed to accurately/completely describe the

6 Project and adequately identify, evaluate, and mitigate all of the Project's potentially significant

7 environmental impacts.

8 27. Uncertain about the number of active Commercial Medicinal Cannabis Business

9 applications pending before Respondents, Petitioner City of Temple City's Planning Manager

10 submitted a Public Records Request via e-mail on November 16, 2018 for a list of all such

11 applications and the status of each in the application process. Respondent City's Director of

12 Community and Economic Development sent a reply email containing an attachment listing a

13 total of eleven (11) active applications, six (6) of which, including the Project at issue here, were

14 identified as being in the final "Entitlements" phase.

15 28. On November 27, 2018, the City of El Monte Planning Commission considered

16 the Project and the MND. Members of the public attended the meeting to express their concern

17 over Respondents' inadequate review process and the Project's foreseeable and unmitigated

18 significant adverse environmental impacts. Petitioners submitted comment letters pointing out

19 various deficiencies in the MND and objecting to the Project. Despite these comments, the

20 Planning Commission voted (3-1, absent) to recommend that the City Council approve

21 Development Agreement No. 02-18, approve Medicinal Cannabis Conditional Use Permit Nos.

22 07-18, 08-18, and 09-19 subject to conditions; and adopt and Initial Study/MND and Mitigation

23 Monitoring and Reporting Program.

24 29. On December 18, 2018, Respondent City Council considered the Planning

25 Commission's recommendation that the Project be approved. Prior to the hearing, Petitioners

26 once again submitted comments regarding the inadequacy of the MND and in opposition to the

27 Project. Those comments pointed out numerous deficiencies in the MND, including its failure to

28 adequately describe the Project and analyze and fully mitigate the Project's: (1) impacts on
BURKE, WILLIAMS &
SORENSEN, LLP 8

ATTORNEYS AT LAW
OAKLAND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 public services including police and fire; (2) impacts on transportation and traffic; (3) waste

2 impacts; (4) generation, use, handling, and disposal of hazardous materials; (5) water usage; and

3 (6) cumulative impacts with approximately eight other similar pending projects in the immediate

4 vicinity. Despite the written and oral comments, Respondent City Council voted (4-1) to adopt

5 the MND prepared for the Project, to issue Conditional Use Permit Nos. 07-18, 08-18, and 09-18,

6 and to introduce an ordinance approving Development Agreement No. 02-18 for a first reading.

7 30. El Monte Ordinance 2924 and El Monte Municipal Code Section 5.18.070(A)

8 require discretionary Conditional Use Permit(s) and a Development Agreement for commercial

9 medicinal cannabis projects like the Project proposed by Real Party in interest GSC here.

10 Development Agreement No. 02-18, like all development agreements, is a legislative act that

11 must be enacted by ordinance and that is not final until after a first and second reading. City staff

12 reports agreed and expressly noted that the Conditional Use Permits were not valid until the

13 Development Agreement was finally approved. Even so, on December 20, 2018, Respondents

14 filed a Notice of Determination with the County Clerk for Los Angeles County. That Notice of

15 Determination was premature because it was filed/posted before Respondents had finally adopted

16 an ordinance approving Development Agreement No. 02-18. Accordingly, the December 20,

17 2018 Notice of Determination did not start the applicable CEQA statute of limitations period.

18 31. On January 8, 2019, Respondent City Council held a second hearing/reading to

19 adopt an ordinance approving Development Agreement No. 02-18. Accordingly, approval of the

20 Development Agreement was complete/final on January 8, 2019, and, absent a successful

21 referendum, becomes effective 30 days thereafter.

22 32. By letter dated January 9, 2019, Petitioners' counsel informed counsel for

23 Respondents and representatives of Real Parties in Interest that the Notice of Determination

24 Respondents filed on December 20, 2018 was premature because the Development Agreement

25 had not yet had a second reading and been adopted. Petitioners requested that Respondents

26 withdraw the December 20, 2018 Notice of Determination and refile a new/valid Notice of

27 Determination after the Project's CUPs and Development Agreement approvals were final.

28 33. On a January 10, 2019, Respondents filed a second Notice of Determination for the
BURKE, WILLIAMS &
SORENSEN, LLP - 9-

ATTORNEYS AT LAW
OAKLAND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

P Project with the County Clerk for Los Angeles County.

2 34. By email dated January 14, 2019, Respondents represented that the January 10,

3 2019 Notice of Determination would govern the 30-day statute of limitations period under

4 CEQA. However, Respondents refused to rescind the premature December 20, 2018 Notice of

5 Determination or request that the Los Angeles County Clerk remove it from its CEQA Notice

6 posting/website. Even if the December 20, 2018 Notice of Determination was not premature and

7 complied with CEQA's content and filing/posting requirements so as to effectively commence the

8 30-day limitations period under CEQA (Petitioners contend it did not), this lawsuit is timely.

9 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

10 Violation of CEQA

11 35. Petitioners re-allege and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs in their

12 entirety.

13 36. At all times relevant to this action Respondent City of El Monte was the "Lead

14 Agency" responsible for the review and approval of the Project under Public Resources Code

15 section 21067.

16 37. CEQA is designed to ensure that government agencies incorporate the goal of

17 long-term protection of the environment into decisions that may affect the environment,

18 consistent with the provision of a decent home and suitable living environment for every

19 Californian. CEQA applies to any discretionary action taken by an agency that may cause a

20 direct or reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment.

21 38. In furtherance of its goal of environmental protection, CEQA requires that an

22 agency prepare an EIR for project whenever substantial evidence in the record supports a fair
23 argument that the project may have significant impact on the environment. The EIR is the

24 cornerstone of the CEQA process and discloses a project's potential adverse environmental and

25 human impacts. The EIR also informs decision makers, responsible agencies, and the public of

26 all feasible mitigation measures and project alternatives that would lessen or avoid the project's

27 adverse environmental impacts.

28 39. CEQA also mandates that the lead agency adopt feasible and enforceable
BURKE, WILLIAMS & - 10 - SORENSEN, LLP
ATTORNEYS AT LAW PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE OAKLAND

-

2 mitigation measures to avoid or at a minimum reduce all of a project's significant environmental

3 impacts to insignificant levels. If substantial evidence in the record supports a fair argument that

4 any of the project's significant environmental impacts cannot be mitigated to a less than

5 significant level, an agency may not rely on a Mitigated Negative Declaration and must instead
prepare an EIR.

6 40.

7 Respondents' approval of Conditional Use Permit Nos. 07-18, 08-18, and 19-19,

8 and Development Agreement No. 02-18 are discretionary acts that trigger their obligation to
comply with CEQA.

9 41.

10 Respondents violated CEQA when they approved the Project by failing to

11 adequately describe the Project, identify the existing/baseline conditions and/or evaluate and

12 mitigate all Project impacts to levels of insignificance for the following non-exclusive list of

reasons:

13 a.

14 The MND fails to completely and adequately describe the Project and its

15 effects, including, but not limited to: Project-specific information on the

16 use of hazardous substances in commercial medicinal cannabis cultivation

17 and manufacturing; information concerning the amount of waste (organic

18 and non-organic) generated by cultivation; how cannabis byproducts will

19 be disposed of and in what quantities; the types of pesticides, herbicides, or

20 hazardous substances that will be used (and their proper handling and

21 disposal); the use and risks of mishandling solvents and the potential

22 impacts of such mishandling; the types, times and numbers of anticipated

23 deliveries to/from the Subject Property and the traffic impacts of those

24 deliveries; and Project site-specific information regarding the type, location

25 and extent of existing soil and groundwater contamination and related

remediation efforts.

26 b.

27 The MND violates CEQA it because it categorically fails to analyze whether

28 the Project's impacts will be cumulatively considerable. The MND's

BURKE, WILLIAMS &
SOREnSeN, LLP cumulative impact analysis is literally relegated to a single, conclusory and

ATTORNEYS AT LAW - 11 -

OAKLAND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

F unsupported sentence on page 101 of the MND and is limited to air

2 eminssions. CEQA provides that "a project may have a significant effect

3 on the environment if the project's possible effects . . are individually

4 limited but cumulatively considerable." (Pub. Res. Code § 21083.)

5 "*Cumulatively considerable' means that the incremental effects of an

6 individual project are significant when viewed in connection with the

7 effects of past projects, the effects of other current projects, and the effects

8 of probable future projects." (14 CCR § 15065(a)(3).) Although

9 Respondents were fully aware of at least ten (1) other medical-marijuana

10 related project applications in the immediate vicinity of the Project and

11 were in fact simultaneously conducting wholly separate environmental

12 review under CEQA for at least two such related projects at the same time

13 Respondents were considering the Project, the MND failed to acknowledge

14 any other foreseeable/related projects or undertake any cumulative impacts

15 analysis whatsoever. This type of piecemeal impact analysis violates

16 CEQA. Indeed, earlier in the day on January 8, 2019, before Respondents

17 finally approved the Project at the City Council's meeting later that same

18 evening, Respondents filed and provided public notice of its completion of

19 and intent to adopt a separate MND for another massive 132,908 square

20 foot medicinal cannabis facility proposed by El Monte Green Group, LLC

21 and Green Mountain Alliance, LLC located literally a stone's throw away

22 from the Project site on nearby Gidley Street.

23 C. The MND fails to adequately identify the existing baseline conditions and

24 analyze and mitigate the Project's impacts on traffic, transportation,

25 circulation and safety. These include increased traffic from Project

26 employees and from Project trucks, vans and other vehicles associated

27 with the proposed operation of a major distribution center on residential

28 streets and within a residential community. Indeed, rather than using
BURKE, WILLIAMS & - 12 - SORENSEN, LLP
ATTORNEYS AT LAW PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE OAXLAND

1 traffic observations and counts to identify and quantify the actual existing

2 vehicle trips and roadway/intersection level of service conditions

3 associated with the Project site's existing furniture outlet store and

4 telecommunications business tenants as required by CEQA, Respondents

5 impermissibly used assumed/hypothetical traffic baseline information that

6 resulted in skewed impact analyses and unsupported impact significance

7 determinations. Given that access to the Project site comes only through

8 the City of Temple City, the MND's failure to so much as document the

9 actual existing traffic conditions and study the Project's potential impacts

10 directly affects the residents of that community.

11 d. The MND fails to adequately identify the existing baseline conditions and

12 analyze and mitigate the Project's impact on the demand for police

13 services. For example, despite acknowledging that its threshold of

14 significance uses police service ratios and response times to assess the

15 significance of impacts, the MND fails to provide any data on existing

16 service calls/ratios and response times or analysis of how the Project (or

17 existing projects of similar size and operational characteristics) might

18 affect those standards. Accordingly, there is no factual basis for

19 Respondents' conclusion that the Project's impact on police services will

20 be insignificant. Moreover, Respondents' statement that the Police

21 Department will "*continue to review" the operational plans impermissibly

22 defers mitigation by failing to provide the public the opportunity to review

23 and analyze the public safety impacts of the Project.

24 e. The MND fails to adequately identify the existing baseline conditions and

25 analyze and mitigate the Project's impact on fire services. For example,

26 the MND admits that there will be an "increase in the demand for . .  fire

27 service calls" but concludes without explanation or analysis of existing

28 and/or existing plus project fire service ratios and response times that the
BURKE, WILLIAMS &
SOreNSen, LLP • 13 -

ATTORNEYS AT LAW
OAKLAND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1

2 increase will be "less than significant" because Real Parties will pay for
fire response costs. However, this conclusory statement fails to

w

4 meaningfully review the Project's fire services impacts, ignores data

5 indicating that the Project will result in an increased demand for fire

6 services, and does not explain how such impacts to the demand for fire

7 services can be mitigated below the level of significance by Real Parties'

8 payment of fire response costs. Indeed, Respondents failed to demonstrate

9 that it has the kind of dedicated fund and related mitigation program

10 required under CEQA to ensure such in lieu fee payments will produce

11 effective and enforceable mitigation of fire service impacts. Moreover,

12 Respondents' statement that the Fire Department will "continue to review"

13 the operational plans impermissibly defers mitigation by failing to provide

14 the public the opportunity to review and analyze the public safety impacts

15 of the Project and the adequacy of any mitigation measures before the
project is approved.

16 f.

17 The MND fails to adequately analyze and mitigate the Project's potential

18 impact on public services because - notwithstanding the Project's location

19 on the border of the City of Temple City and near Rosemead - the MND

20 fails to consider the Project's foreseeable impact on the Los Angeles

21 County Sherriff's Department as the City of Temple City's and City of
Rosemead's contract law enforcement provider.

22 g.

23 The MND fails to adequately identify the existing baseline conditions and

24 analyze and mitigate impacts from the Project's acknowledged use,

25 disposition, and handling of hazardous materials. The MND fails to

26 identify, let alone discuss or analyze, the potential environmental and

27 health impacts of hazardous materials (e.g., herbicides, pesticides,

28 solvents) to be used in connection with the cultivation, manufacturing, and

BURKE, WILLIAMS &
SORENSen, LLP distribution of cannabis products under the Project, and compounds this

ATTORNEYS AT LAW - 14 -

OAKLAND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

M critical error by illegally deferring the actual identification of the

2 hazardous materials to be used and the mitigation to be employed to

3 ensure their safe handling and prompt accident response. Nor does the

4 MND address the risk of leakage or spraying of hazardous materials

5 during transport to or from the Project Site or whether/how the Project

6 might exacerbate existing contamination at/near the site or inhibit existing

7 and/or planned remediation of that contamination.

8 h. The MND fails to adequately identify the existing baseline conditions and

9 analyze and mitigate the Project's impact on water supplies. The Project

10 is expected to have an average water consumption of 2,543 gallons per
11 day, which equals approximately 928,195 gallons per year. While the

12 MND states that the City is anticipated to have a surplus of available water
13 by the year 2035, it also plainly admits that the "City would not have

14 enough supplies to meet projected demand during a single dry-year or

15 multiple dry-year scenario." This violates CEQA, especially considering
16 Respondents employed (but failed to apply/follow) a water supply

17 threshold of significance that expressly acknowledges that a project would
18 result in a significant adverse utility impact if there were "insufficient

19 water supplies to serve the project and the reasonably foreseeable future

20 development during normal, dry, and multiple dry years."
21 i. The MND fails to analyze and mitigate the Project's potential odor

22 impacts. By requiring the installation of ventilation and filtration systems

23 that prevent odors from exiting the structure "to the greatest extent

24 feasible" only, Respondents have eliminated any guarantee that the Project

25 will not create offensive odors that would adversely impact the

26 environment. This violates CEQA's requirement that mitigation measures

27 be proven to be effective and enforceable. Indeed, under the proposed

28 mitigation measure Real Parties could emit such noxious odors if excessive
BURKE, WILLIAMS & - 15 - SORENSEN, LLP
ATTORNEYS AT LAW PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE OAKLAND

• 1 equipment costs led them to deem effective odor control infeasible.

2 j. The MND and the Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program

3 impermissibly and illegally defer the development of key mitigation

4 measures, including for the Project's potentially significant air quality/odor

5 and hazardous materials impacts, until after Project approval without

6 providing critically important and legally required performance standards

7 to ensure the effectiveness and enforceability of any such mitigation

8 measures or plans to be developed after-the-fact.

9 42. Respondents lack substantial evidence to support their conclusion that

10 identified mitigation measures will actually mitigate the Project's significant impacts.

11 43. Respondents violated CEQA by failing to prepare an EIR for the Project when

12 the record demonstrates that the Project may cause the potentially significant environmental

13 impacts described above, among others, which have not been adequately disclosed, analyzed,

14 or mitigated to a less than significant level.

15 44. For all of the above reasons, Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion

16 and failed to comply with the law.

17 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

18 WHEREFORE, Petitioners prays for judgment as follows:

19 1. For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing Respondents to

20 vacate and set aside all Project approvals/Entitlements, including Development Agreement

21 No. 02-18, Conditional Use Permit Nos. 07-18, 08-18, and 09-18;

22 2. For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing Respondents to

23 vacate and set aside the MND for the Project;

24 3. For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing the Respondents to

and adopted a Mitigated Negative Declaration. This notice is given pursuant to Public
Resources Code section 21167.5.

Please note that, pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.6, the record of proceedings for the City of El Monte's actions includes, among other things, all "internal agency communications, including staff notes and memoranda related to the project or to compliance with [CEQA]."
