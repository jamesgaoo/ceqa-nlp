VERIFIED PETTTION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

P Plaintiff and Petitioner, CITIZENS FOR RESPONSIBLE DEVELOPMENT, a California

2 unincorporated association ("Petitioner") alleges against the City of CHOWCHILLA

3 ("CHOWCHILLA"), and the City Council of the City of CHOWCHILLA (the "City Council"),

4 CHOWCHILLA and the City Council being collectively referred to as "Respondents" or the "City",

5 as follows:

INTRODUCTION 6

7 1. This action challenges the decisions by the City in connection with the approvals for a

8 project called the "Sessions Tentative Subdivision Map" (the "Project"). The Project consists of a

9 Tentative Subdivision Map for a 200-lot subdivision within the City of Chowchilla on approximately

10 40 acres. The lots will range in size from 5,000 SF to 10,098 SF. As part of the buildout of the 200
11 lots, the Project would also include two 0.28-ac pocket parks, which will be located on each side of

12 Alvarado Avenue. Additionally, the Project would include construction of a total of 9,180 linear feet

13 of new roadway within the subdivision, and 1,330 linear feet of frontage improvements along

14 Washington Avenue. The subdivision will have primary access from Washington Road and
15 secondary access will be available via the existing collector / local street extensions to the north

16 (Cottonwood Drive) and to the east (Edgewood Avenue). The subdivision will eventually connect to
17 future planned developments via Alvarado Avenue and Riley Avenue.
18 2. Petitioner challenges the City's actions in adopting Resolution No. 19- adopting

19 Tentative Subdivision Map 17-0006 to allow for the Project and in adopting : Mitigated Negative
20 Declaration under the California Environmental Quality Act and the CEQA Guidelines (all of the
21 foregoing, the "Project Approvals").

22 3. Petitioner alleges that the City's actions in giving the Project Approvals violate
23 provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code Section 21000,

24 et seq. ("CEQA").

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 PARTIES

2 4. Petitioner, CITIZENS FOR RESPONSIBLE DEVELOPMENT, is a California

3 unincorporated association. Its members include residents in the City of CHOWCHILLA and

4 persons or entities that have participated in the public hearing process regarding the proposed
Project. The members of this association advocate for quality of life issues for the citizens and

6 visitors of the City of CHOWCHILLA and these members are opposed to the City-facilitated

7 development of the Project without regard to the quality of life for its residents and visitors and its

8 attendant worsening of the environmental impacts in the City. The members of CITIZENS FOR

9 RESPONSIBLE DEVELOPMENT seek to promote and support developments in the City of

10 CHOWCHILLA that balance the needs for growth while preserving the elements of livability in our

11 cities.

12 5. Petitioner has a substantial interest in ensuring that the City's decisions are in

13 conformity with the requirements of law, and in having those requirements properly executed and
14 the public duties of the City enforced. Petitioner will be substantially and adversely affected by
15 impacts resulting from the City's actions and approvals described in this petition, and Petitioner is

16 aggrieved by the acts, decisions and omissions of the City as alleged in this petition. Petitioner is

17 suing on its own behalf and on the behalf of others who will be affected in the City of

18 CHOWCHILLA and surrounding areas, as well as on behalf of the citizens of the City of

19 CHOWCHILLA.

20 6. Respondent, The City of CHOWCHILLA, is a charter city, duly organized under the

21 laws of the State of California. The City of CHOWCHILLA and/or the Planning Commission of the

22 City of CHOWCHILLA is the lead agency under CEQA for evaluating the environmental impacts of

23 the Project.

24 7. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that Respondent, City
25 Council of the City of CHOWCHILLA, is the elected governing body of CHOWCHILLA and is the
26 body responsible for promulgating municipal ordinances, resolutions and policies.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 8. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that the Real Party in

2 Interest, Sessions Family Trust (the "Developers") are the owners of (or have the right to purchase)

3 the real property that is the subject of the Project. The Developer is named as a real party pursuant

4 to the requirements of Public Resources Code Section 21167.6.5, subdivision (a).

5 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

6 9. This Court has jurisdiction to consider the CEQA claims under Public Resources

7 Code section 21168.5. This Court has jurisdiction to issue writs of mandate pursuant to Code of

8 Civil Procedure section 1094.5.

9 10. The Respondent, City of CHOWCHILLA, is located in Madera County. Venue is

10 proper in the County of Madera pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Section 394, subdivision (a).

11 11. Petitioner has a direct and beneficial interest in the granting of this writ of mandate,
12 as well as the requested injunctive relief. Petitioner has appeared at the public hearings held in
13 connection with granting the Approvals, and Petitioner has objected to the approval of the Project
14 prior to the City's adoption of the Approvals.

15 12. The City and City Council made various land use and CEQA approvals, including the
16 Project Approvals.

17 13. Petitioner and other interested parties and individuals made oral and written

18 comments on the Project Approvals and raised each of the legal deficiencies asserted in this petition.
19 14. Petitioner has exhausted all available administrative remedies before Respondent, the
20 City, by objecting to the approval of the Project, as required by the provisions of Public Resources
21 Code Section 21177.

22 15. Petitioner has performed all conditions imposed by law precedent to filing this
23 petition, including without limitation complying with the requirement of Public Resources Code
24 Section 21167.5 by mailing (and sending by email) on April 2, 2019 a notice to the City that this
25 action would be filed. A copy of the Intent to Sue letter is attached to this Petition as Exhibit "A."
26 16. Petitioner will also serve a copy of this Petition on the California Attorney General as
27 required by law.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

17. Petitioner hereby notifies Respondent, the City, to prepare the complete record of

2 Respondents' proceedings relating to this action, subject to all rights and procedures for Petitioner to

3 elect to prepare, itself, the administrative record in this matter after Petitioner receives and reviews

4 Respondents' Preliminary Notification and cost estimate. A copy of the Petitioner's notice of

5 election to prepare the record is filed concurrently with this Petition.

6 18. Petitioners have no adequate remedy at law unless this Court grants the requested writ

7 of mandate and thereby orders the City to set aside the Approvals of the Project. In the absence of

8 such remedy, (a) the Project Approvals will remain in effect, in violation of State environmental

9 laws and planning laws; (b) the Project, lacking adequate environmental review, will be in violation

10 of CEQA; and (c) Petitioners and members of the public in the community in which the Project

11 would be developed will suffer irreparable harm.

12 19. There is a significant probability that Petitioners will prevail on the merits in this

13 matter. The Court should issue a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction and permanent
14 injunction ordering Respondents to suspend all activities implementing the Project (including

15 without limitation processing or granting any permits for development of the Project) until the Court,

16 by way of return writ, adjudicates that the City has fully complied with all requirements of the

17 California Environmental Quality Act.

18 FACTS

19 20. The Project consists of a Tentative Subdivision Map for a 200-lot subdivision within

20 the City of Chowchilla on approximately 40 acres. The lots will range in size from 5,000 SF to

21 10,098 SF. As part of the buildout of the 200 lots, the Project would also include two 0.28-ac pocket
22 parks, which will be located on each side of Alvarado Avenue. Additionally, the Project would

23 include construction of a total of 9,180 linear feet of new roadway within the subdivision, and 1,330

24 linear feet of frontage improvements along Washington Avenue. The subdivision will have primary
25 access from Washington Road and secondary access will be available via the existing collector /

26 local street extensions to the north (Cottonwood Drive) and to the east (Edgewood Avenue). The
27 subdivision will eventually connect to future planned developments via Alvarado Avenue and Riley
28 Avenue.

4
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 21. On October 18, 2018, the Planning Commission of the City held a public hearing to
2 consider the Project. During this hearing, the Planning Commission heard from concerned members

3 of the public with regard to environmental issues and other policy matters relating to the Project, and
4 together they raised each of the legal deficiencies asserted in this Petition. The Planning

5 Commission closed the public hearing and deliberated. After the deliberations, the Planning

6 Commission directed staff to gather more information regarding, among other things, concerns over
7 excessive water demands from the Project raised by Petitioner and also by the Chowchilla Water

8 District (CWD).

9 22. With regard to the excessive water demand issue, the city Staff Report for October 18
10 Planning Commission meeting took the position that there was no recognizable threshold of
11 significance with regard to water use (in direct conflict with the position taken by the CWD and by
12 Petitioner), and that therefore the issue could be completely ignored.

13 23. On November 28, 2018, the Planning Commission held a Special Meeting, during
14 which staff provided the additional information requested. With regard to the water demand issue,
15 the Staff Report for November 28 Planning Commission meeting engaged in an erroneous
16 comparison and arithmetic exercise to contemplate groundwater impacts - erroneous because it
17 ignored the significant percentage of water used in almond orchards that becomes ground water
18 recharge. Nevertheless, the Planning Commission thereafter voted to recommend that the City
19 Council adopt the Project Approvals. During this hearing, the Planning Commission heard from
20 concerned members of the public with regard to environmental issues and other policy matters
21 relating to the Project, and together they raised each of the legal deficiencies asserted in this Petition.
22 24. On December 18, 2018, City Council held a Special Meeting to consider the Planning
23 Commission's recommendation to adopt the Project Approvals. During this meeting, the City
24 Council heard from concerned members of the public with regard to environmental issues and other
25 policy matters relating to the Project, and together they raised each of the legal deficiencies asserted
26 in this Petition. The Meeting was continued to March 26, 2019.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

I 25. On March 26, 2019, City Council held a meeting to consider the Project again.

2 During this meeting, the City Council heard from concerned members of the public with regard to

3 environmental issues and other policy matters relating to the Project, and together they raised each of

4 the legal deficiencies asserted in this Petition. Thereafter, the City Council adopted a resolution

5 adopting the Project Approvals.

6 26. At each of the Planning Commission and City Council hearings regarding the Project,
Petitioner made arguments that the Project would result in several significant environmental impacts,

8 which were either not considered in the MND or were not adequately mitigated, including, among

9 other things, the Project's excessive and unfair water demands.

10 27. Petitioner has performed all conditions imposed by law precedent to filing this action;
11 including complying with the requirement of Public Resources Code Section 21167.5 by mailing

12 notice to the City that this action would be filed. (See, Exhibit A).

13 28. Petitioner will also serve a copy of this Petition on the California Attorney General as
14 required by law.

15 29. Petitioner has a substantial interest in ensuring that the City's decisions are in

16 conformity with the requirements of law, and in having those requirements properly executed and
17 the public duties of the City enforced. Petitioner and members of the public will be adversely

18 affected by impacts resulting from the City's actions and approvals, and Petitioner and such

19 members of the public are aggrieved by the acts, decisions, and omissions of the City as alleged in

20 this petition and complaint. Petitioner brings this action on its behalf, and on behalf of others who

21 will be affected in the City of CHOWCHILLA, as well as citizens of the City of CHOWCHILLA.
22 30. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy available in the ordinary course of

23 law to redress the claims alleged in this petition. Petitioner and the public generally will suffer
24 irreparable harm if this court does not issue a writ to compel the City to comply with CEQA and to

25 vacate and set aside the above-described approvals related to the Project.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (Violation of CEQA and CEQA Guidelines; MND Does Not Comply with CEQA)

3 31. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations of Paragraphs
4 through 30 inclusive in this Petition.

5 32. CEQA requires a lead agency for a project to prepare a Mitigated Negative

6 Declaration that complies with the requirements of CEQA. The lead agency must provide for public

7 review and comment on the project and related environmental documentation. A Mitigated Negative

8 Declaration must provide sufficient environmental analysis so that decision makers can intelligently

9 consider environmental impacts that a proposed project may create.

10 33. The City's actions in adopting the MND for the Project constitute prejudicial abuse

11 of discretion, because the City failed to proceed in the manner required by law and the City failed to

12 support its decision to grant the approvals with substantial evidence. Among other failings by the
13 City, the City:

14 a) Should have prepared, circulated for review and comment and adopted an
15 environmental impact report that analyzed and mitigated all of the significant environmental impacts

16 raised by Petitioner and other members of the public during the public hearings;
17 b) Failed to adequately disclose or analyze the significant environmental impacts that

18 will result from the development of the Project, including but not limited to the environmental

19 impacts from the excessive water demands of the Project. In addition, the MND did not study any
20 cumulative impacts, and Petitioner alleges that if an environmental impact report is required, there

21 will also be several cumulatively considerable impacts by the Project on all of the other

22 environmental impacts.

23 c) Improperly deferred the analysis of impacts and the definition of and implementation

24 of mitigation measures;

25 d) Failed to adopt all feasible mitigation measures and failed to adequately mitigate

26 environmental impacts from the development of the Project; and
27 e) Failed to adopt legally adequate findings as required by law with regard to the
28 approvals.

7
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

34. CEQA requires every lead agency to provide a good faith, reasoned analysis in

2 response to comments received on a mitigated negative declaration, to address (in detail)

3 recommendations and objections raised by comments submitted to the lead agency, and to explain

4 why specific comments and objections, especially those of experts, were not accepted by the lead

5 agency. The MND fails to respond adequately to comments made by Petitioner and other members

6 of the public to the MND. Moreover, the City Council in granting the Project Approvals, failed

7 consider the substantial evidence of significant impacts presented by Petitioner and other concerned

8 members of the community.

9 35. All of the letters and testimony of Petitioner and other members of the community

10 constitute a fair argument that there is a reasonable probability that the Project. will create several

11 significant environmental impacts.

12 36. As a result of the City's violations of CEQA, Petitioner and the public have been

13 harmed, because, prior to the City's approval of the Project and adoption by the City of the MND,
14 Petitioner and other members of the public were not fully informed about the significant
15 environmental impacts that could occur from the development of the Project.

16 37. Petitioner and members of the public will suffer irreparable harm if the relief
17 requested in this Petition is not granted by this Court, and the Project is constructed in the absence of
18 an environmental impact report for the Project that complies with the applicable provisions of CEQA

19 and other applicable laws.

20 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

21 (Violation of CEQA and CEQA Guidelines; Inadequate Findings)
22 38. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations of Paragraphs
23 through 37 inclusive in this Petition.

24 39. CEQA requires that the findings made by a lead agency in connection with the
25 approval of a project must be supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record. CEQA

26 further requires that a lead agency provide an explanation of how the evidence in the record supports
27 the conclusions it has made.

28

8
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 40. The City violated CEQA by adopting findings that are inadequate as a matter of law,

2 because the findings are not supported by substantial evidence in the record, including but not

3 limited to the following:

4 (a) The determination that certain impacts would be less than significant and/or

5 that the adopted mitigation measures would avoid or lessen the Project's effects on the environment;

6 (b) The determination that the Project is not in conflict with the City's general

7 plan; and

8 (c) The proposed mitigation measures would reduce all identified significant

9 impacts to a level that a is less than significant.

10 41. As a result of the defects described above, the City prejudicially abused its discretion

11 by adopting findings that do not comply with the requirements of CEQA. Therefore, the City also

12 prejudicially abused its discretion by granting approvals for the Project based upon defective and

13 inadequate findings. Accordingly, the City's approval of the Project and its certification of the

14 MND must be set aside.

15 PRAYER 1 R RELIEF

16 WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully prays for judgment against the Respondents, and each

17 of them, as follows:

18 1. For a peremptory writ of mandamus directing Respondents, the City and the City
19 Council, to vacate and set aside the approval of the Project, the actions adopting the MND, and all
20 related approvals.

21 2. That this court issue a writ of mandate suspending the authority of Respondents, the
22 City and the City Council, their officers, employees, agents, boards, commissions and other

23 subdivisions, to grant any authority, permits or entitlements as part of the Project (including without
24 limitation to any of the Real Party in Interest) until after the City requires Developer to prepare a full
25 environmental impact report to fully analyze all significant environmental impacts from the Project,
26 consistent with the requirements of CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines, and all other applicable laws, and

27 until a full set of legally adequate findings are made by the City as required by law.

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

3. That this Court issue a temporary restraining order and a permanent injunction

2 enjoining Respondents, the City and the City Council, their officers, employees, agents, boards,

3 commissions and other subdivisions, as well as the Real Party in Interest, from undertaking any

4 activities, demolition, grading or construction pursuant to the City's approvals as described herein,

5 prior to the City's full compliance with CEQA, the City's municipal code, and other applicable laws.

6 4. For attorney's fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Code section 1021.5.

7 5. For costs of suit; and

8 6. For such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper.
