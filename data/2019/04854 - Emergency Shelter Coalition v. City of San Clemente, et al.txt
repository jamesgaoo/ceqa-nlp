Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 INTRODUCTION

2

3 1. On May 21, 2019 and June 4, 2019, the City of San Clemente approved

A Ordinance No. 1673 and Ordinance No. 1674 ("Ordinances"), designating

5 City-owned property located at 380 Avenida Pico, San Clemente ("Site") as

6 the "sole public areas in the city available for camping purposes by those

7 persons experiencing homelessness or otherwise unable to shelter." On June

8 18, 2019, the City amended the Ordinances to provide a date for expiration.

9 2. Petitioner Emergency Shelter Coalition ("ESC") alleges the City unlawfully

10 approved the Ordinances in direct contravention of its General Plan without

11 proper notice, without obtaining necessary permits, and without doing what is

12 required to ensure the Site is suitable for human habitation and to ensure that

13 the development of and uses of the Site will not harm the environment.

14 Petitioner further alleges that the City has not made a good faith effort to

15 identify and provide an appropriate site for emergency shelter.

16 3. For these reasons, and those set forth below, Petitioner respectfully requests

17 the Court: 1) set aside the City's approval of the Ordinances; and 2) enjoin any

18 further operation or use of the Site for persons experiencing homelessness or

19 otherwise unable to shelter pending compliance with the California Coastal

20 Act, the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), and California's
Planning and Zoning Law.
21 II. PARTIES

22

23 4. Petitioner Emergency Shelter Coalition is now, and at all times since its

24 incorporation on July 30, 2018 has been, a non-profit organization under the

25 laws of the State of California. Petitioner's members share a common goal to

26 establish a year-round emergency shelter and resource center in San Clemente

27 to provide people experiencing homelessness with a safe place to sleep,
engage
28 in fundamental daily life activities, and obtain counseling and referral
services. Petitioner's members include individuals who are residents of,

-1-
Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 employed in, or habitually visit the City and who devote their time and
2 resources to assisting persons experiencing homelessness in San Clemente,
3 regardless of the reason. Petitioner's members enjoy and appreciate the coast
4 and desire to protect its waters and nearby lands from degradation.

5 Furthermore, Petitioner has an interest in procuring the enforcement of the

6 City's duty to abide by laws including, but not limited to, the Coastal Act,

7 CEQA, the requirements of MS4 permits, and to protect the constitutional

8 rights of its residents. As a result of litigation brought by Petitioner, the City

9 created an Emergency Shelter Overlay Zone that includes locations for
10 providing shelter outside the Coastal Zone. Petitioner continues to work to
11 develop a shelter for homeless persons and persons otherwise unable to find
12 shelter in the Emergency Shelter Overlay Zone.
13 5. Respondent City of San Clemente is a government entity with the capacity to
14 sue and be sued. The City developed, owns, and operates the Site, which is a
15 vacant lot next to a sewage treatment plant. The City of San Clemente is the
16 "lead agency" as the term is defined by CEQA, and is therefore responsible for
17 evaluating the environmental impacts of the project (Cal. Public Resources
18 Code § 21067). Respondent City Council of San Clemente is the legislative
19 authority for the City of San Clemente and, as the elected decision-making
20 body in the City of San Clemente, is a public agency under CEQA (Cal. Public

21 Resources Code, § 21063). Respondent Planning Commission of San
22 Clemente advises the City Council on land use policies and laws and to makes
23 final decisions on certain kinds of development and use permits (hereinafter,
24 the City, the City Council, and the Planning Commission shall collectively be
25 referred to as "Respondents"). On May 21, 2019 and June 4, 2019, the City
26 Council adopted the Ordinances, which are the subject of this litigation. The
27 City enforces the prohibitions on camping on public property pursuant to the
28 provisions of Ordinance No. 1671, as amended.

1 III. VENUE

2 6. Venue is proper in the Superior Court for the County of Orange pursuant to
3 Code of Civil Procedure § 394, because Respondent City of San Clemente is a
4 city situated within the County of Orange, and this action is filed in the
5 Superior Court for the County of Orange.

6 IV. RIGHT TO RELIEF

7 7. This petition is brought under Public Resources Code §§ 21168, 21168.5, and
8 30803(a); and Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1094.5 and 1085. Respondents have
prejudicially abused their discretion by failing to proceed in manner required
10 by law and their decisions are not supported by substantial evidence.
11 8. Petitioner has beneficial interest in the outcome of this proceeding, which is
12 brought on behalf of itself and its members. Petitioner also has public interest
13 standing to enforce Respondent's public duty to comply with the law.
14 9. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of
15 law. Unless this Court grants the relief requested, Respondents will continue
16 to fail and refuse to perform their legal duties. No money damages or other
17 legal remedy could adequately compensate Petitioner and others for the
18 hardship caused by Respondents' failure to perform their legal duty.
19 10.Petitioners contend that Respondents' actions as described in this petition
20 violate their legal duties. Respondents contend otherwise. Declaratory relief
21 is therefore necessary and appropriate to resolve this controversy.
22 Accordingly, Petitioners seek a judicial declaration of the rights and duties of
23 the respective parties.
24 11.Petitioner has caused to be served on Respondents that certain "Notice of
25 Commencement of Action" pursuant to Public Resources Code § 21167.2 gave
26 the Attorney General notice of intent to file this action. Petitioner will serve
27 the Attorney General with a copy a of this petition, along with a notice of
28 Petitioner's filing, as required by Code of Civil Procedure § 388 and Public

-3-
Petition for Writ of Mandate

Resources Code § 21167.7.

2 12.This petition is timely. The Notice of Exemption was posted at the Clerk of
the County of Orange on May 24, 2019 and again on June 6, 2019.

5 V. FACTUAL BACKGROUND
13.0n August 19, 2014, the San Clemente City Council amended Ordinance No.
1585 to cap the maximum number of beds in any Emergency Shelter facility at
20 in response to public comment.
14.The City has received, and continues to receive, information related to the
10 homeless population through the annual Point In Time Count, outreach by its
11 contractor Mercy House, and the publicity of the ongoing Federal Litigation
12 regarding the housing crisis in Orange County.
13 15.The number of unsheltered homeless individuals has been steadily increasing
14 for decades. In the City, that number reached over 90 known unsheltered

15 individuals by the Point in Time Count performed in January 2019. The
16 increase in the homeless population is consistent with that in other cities that
17 do not have any public emergency shelter or clear housing development plan
18 to ensure seniors, people with disabilities, and the working poor can access
19 housing.

20 16.In 2014, during litigation, San Clemente was forced to properly zone areas of
21 the city that could be used for homeless emergency shelter. At that time, the
22 City considered an area comprising the Site at 380 Avenida Pico, San
23 Clemente. That area was once the site of an animal shelter that had to be

24 moved because of potential environmental constraints. The City concluded it
25 would not be an appropriate site for a shelter for homeless persons or animals.
26 17.In 2018, the City of San Clemente passed Ordinance 1671, which prohibits
27 camping on public land in San Clemente.
28 18.On March 5, 2019 the City of San Clemente amended Ordinance 1671 in

-4-

Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 response to a Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decision in Martin v. City of
2 Boise (9th Cir. 2018) 902 F.3d 1031. That case held in part "that the Eighth
3 Amendment prohibits the imposition of criminal penalties for sitting sleeping,
4 or lying outside on public property for homeless individuals who cannot obtain
shelter." Id. The City's amendment stated that no enforcement of Ordinance
6 1671 would happen absent exigent circumstances.
7 19. The City Council held a meeting on May 21, 2019.

8 20.The agenda for that meeting stated the Council would consider the evaluation
and feasibility of creating a temporary emergency shelter for homeless persons

10 and ordinances relating to the prohibition of camping on public property.
11 21.The Staff report made no mention of what the temporary shelter would be or
12 where the temporary shelter would be, and did not provide any other indication
13 that would have given notice of the actual plans for the development and use
14 of the Site or its impacts on the environment.
15 22.On information and belief, the City began preparing the Site as a shelter before
16 the ordinance was even reviewed or approved with no notice.
17 23. At the May 21, 2019 meeting, the City Council approved Ordinance No. 1673
18 as an urgency ordinance. The urgency ordinance designates that a selected lot
19 would be the sole public area on which people experiencing homelessness are
20 permitted to camp, and requires enforcement of the City's anti-camping

21 ordinance against people experiencing homelessness in all other public areas.
22 24.During the public comment period at the May 21, 2019 meeting, resident Brad
23 Malamud pointed out any discussion about shelter were improperly discussed
24 in closed session and needed to be open to the public. Other members of the
25 public expressed concerns about the environmental impacts of people camping
26 on the beaches. Housing is a Human Right Orange County ("HHROC')
27 expressed concern about the City acting prematurely without an opportunity to
28 investigate the options. Gene James, a resident, expressed concern that the

-5-
Petition for Writ of Mandate

people were not kept informed.

2 25.Also at the May 21, 2019 City Council meeting, Petitioner, through one of its

3 members, proposed an alternative location for shelter outside the Coastal Zone
4 and detailed how it could comply with the zoning regulation. Another speaker
5 insisted that the selected site needed to comply with SB2, the shelter zone

6 under the General Plan.
26.Due to the high attendance, the City requested that people leave the room
rather than stay standing in the aisles after their comment. After the member of
ESC presented ESC's shelter proposal and used his opportunity for public
10 comment, he left the meeting room per the City's instructions. Moments later,
11 a member of the public proposed the Site. It was not clear until the vote that
12 the City was voting on that Site. Despite attending the meeting, ESC did not
13 have notice of the site until it was later reported. During the meeting, the City
14 Council announced 380 Avenida Pico as the site selected to "shelter" homeless
15 persons.

16 27.The land use element of the General Plan specifically designates the Site for
17 "Public" use. Similarly, in the Coastal Land Use Plan created in March 2018,
18 the Site is designated for "Public" use.
19 28.The Site is in an industrial zone. See West Pico Corridor Specific Plan
20 Chapter 1.
21 29.The Site was once an animal shelter, which the City then deemed unsafe due to
22 risk of mudslide (among other dangers). The Site was then used as a storage
23 lot for the sewage treatment facility located next to the lot.
24 30.The Site is located within the Coastal Zone.

25 31. The Site is directly next to the Segunda Deshecha Creek. The Creek runs
26 directly into the Pacific Ocean. Both relevant coastal waters and the Creek are
27 listed as "impaired" bodies of water by the San Diego Regional Water Board.
28 See State Water Resources Control Board, Final 2014/2016 California

-6-
Petition for Writ of Mandate

Integrated Report (Clean Water Act Section 303(d) List, 305(6) Report)
(2017).
32.The Site is less than two miles from the San Clemente Pier, one of the most
impaired bodies of water in the County.
33.City Councilmember Laura Ferguson stated that the City could avoid CEQA
by selecting a site less than half an acre in size.
34.Councilmember Ward stated the main reason for the Ordinance is that, going
co into summer, people in the North Beach parking lot create a conflict.

9 35.Mayor Pro Tem Bane pointed out that they had been working on this issue for
10 months and he believes they can move forward due to an allegedly amended
11 order from the Ninth Circuit in Martin.

12 36.A representative of the City said that "at the rate we are going," the City could
13 expect to be done preparing the Site by that Friday, which was three days from
14 the date of the meeting.
15 37.On or about May 24, 2019, the City of San Clemente began moving
16 individuals who were unsheltered to the Site under threat of arrest.
17 38.On or about May 24, 2019, the City placed two portable toilets and two
18 dumpsters on the lot. The City changed the fencing around the lot and installed
19 electricity to power a camera to watch over the residents. The City placed sand
20 bags around the fenced area. A security guard was hired. At some point, a third
21 portable toilet was added with a lock that is only accessible to the security
22 guard. The fence has one opening on one side and otherwise encoloses the
23 Site.

24 39.On May 24, 2019, the City of San Clemente filed a Notice of Exemption from
25 CEQA with the Orange County Clerk, claiming that the May 21, 2019
26 Ordinance No. 1673 was exempt under Public Resources Code, §§ 15304 and
27 15269. The City alleged exemption from the requirements of CEQA under the
28 "common sense" exemption for projects with no possibility of significant

Petition for Writ of Mandate

environmental impact; the exemption for minor alterations in the condition of
2 land; and the exemption for actions necessary to prevent or mitigate an

3 emergency.
40.Upon information and belief, the City of San Clemente did not obtain, and has
not obtained, a permit for development at the Site from the Coastal

6 Commission.

7 41.The City Council held another meeting on June 4, 2019.
42. In the publicly posted meeting agenda for the June 4, 2019 meeting, the
attachment that purported to show the location of the proposed shelter for
10 homeless persons simply stated it would be discussed at the meeting. The City
11 did not provide adequate notice in the agenda of its intent to vote on Ordinance
12 No 1674.

13 43.The City did not follow the required and necessary procedures to investigate
14 potential environmental impacts, allow public comment, or obtain permits for
15 development and use of the Site from regulatory agencies prior to the June 4th
16 Meeting.
17 44.At the meeting on June 4, 2019, the City Council approved Ordinance No.
18 1674, which is a standard ordinance identical in substance to Ordinance No.
19 1673.

20 45.At the June 4, 2019 meeting, a representative of HHROC spoke during the
21 public comment period and pointed out that moving So quickly risked opening
22 the City to litigation and asked the City to look at needs including County
23 Mental Health Services, families, and toilets.
24 46.The next public speaker pointed out that the lot is next to the trails and the

25 park, and expressed concerns about impacts on those resources.

26 47.Other members of the public expressed concern about impacts of use of the
27 Site as a homeless shelter, alleging that it caused a rat infestation, would
28 require cleaning with bleach, and raising concerns about possible impacts on

-8-
Petition for Writ of Mandate

Pico Park and nearby trails, as well as general public health.
48.Members of the public discussed the exclusion of the property from the shelter
zone, and stated that they had asked questions about possible solutions in April
and were told solutions were being considered but that those solutions were

not previously disclosed. One speaker said the map at the meeting and the lack

6 of transparency confused residents about the actual location. Another resident
detailed how neighbors were not given information or notice or opportunity to
investigate. He further suggested that the City ignored its own zoning
regulations.
10 49.On June 6, 2019, the City of San Clemente filed a Notice of Exemption from
11 CEQA with the Orange County Clerk claiming that the May 21, 2019
12 Ordinance No. 1674 was exempt under Public Resources Code, §§ 15304 and
13 15269. The City alleged exemption from the requirements of CEQA under the
14 "common sense" exemption for projects with no possibility of significant
15 environmental impact; the exemption for minor alterations in the condition of
16 land; and the exemption for actions necessary to prevent or mitigate an
17 emergency.

18 50.Upon information and belief, approximately 40 persons reside on the Site. By
19 comparison, only approximately 10 people resided at North Beach.
20 51.The portable toilets are regularly full and overflowing. The smell of waste is
21 strong. When the toilets are cleaned, they are washed and the waste residue
22 flows out. On information and belief, the water from cleaning or rain events
23 must flow downhill to the Creek which leads to the Ocean.

24 52.People regularly drive to the Site and yell, throw items at homeless people,
25 inspect the property, attempt to gain access to sleep, or deliver donations. As a
26 result, there is a change in intensity of use of Avenida Pico in the area. The
27 change in use impacts the noise emitted from the property.
28 53.Only a few days after opening the lot the City recognized the change in traffic

-9.
Petition for Writ of Mandate

and began issuing parking tickets to those who pulled over at the Site,

2 including issuing tickets to homeless individuals requesting to stay there.
54.Development at and use of the Site has potential to cause significant impacts
on the environment.
55.The Water Board is investigating the environmental impacts of the Site.

VI. LEGAL BACKGROUND AND LEGAL VIOLATIONS
56.CEQA applies to "discretionary projects proposed to be carried out or
approved by public agencies" (Cal. Pub. Resources Code, § 21080.) Under
10 CEQA, the term "project" is broadly defined and includes any activities that
11 have a potential for resulting in a physical change in the environment. (Cal.
12 Public Resources Code § 21065; CEQA Guidelines §§ 15002(d), 15378(a).)
13 57.CEQA requires public agencies to consider and document the environmental
14 implications of their discretionary actions in order to "[e]nsure that long term
15 protection of the environment…shall be the guiding criterion in public
16 decisions." (Cal. Pub. Resources Code § 21001(d).) In enacting CEQA, the
17 California Legislature declared it to be the policy of California to "[t]ake all
18 action necessary to provide the people of this state with clean air and water."
19 (Id. at § 21001(b).)
20 58. The Coastal Act requires that the City obtain a Coastal Development Permit
21 for developments within the Coastal Zone including a change in the density of
22 use of land.

23 59.The "coastal zone" is land and water specified on maps identified and set forth
24 in Section 17 of Chapter 1330 of the Statutes of 1975-1976 Regular Session
25 enacting Division 20 of the Public Resource code and subsequent
26 amendments. (Cal. Pub. Resources Code §30103(a).)
27 60.The lot at issue, and the rest of the City's property at 380 Avenida Pico, is
28 located within the coastal zone.

-10-
Petition for Writ of Mandate

61.The Coastal Act requires that "any person... wishing to perform or undertake
2 any development in the coastal zone shall obtain a coastal development
3 permit." (Cal. Pub. Resources Code §30600(a).)
62.The Coastal Act defines "person" as "any individual, organization,
partnership, limited liability company, or other business association or

6 corporation, including any utility, and any federal, state, local government, or

7 special district or an agency thereof." (Cal. Pub. Resources Code §30111)

8 (emphasis added.)
63.A "development" under the Coastal Act, includes but is not limited to:
10

11 the placement or erection of any solid material or structure;

12 discharge or disposal of any dredged material or of any gaseous, liquid, solid, or thermal waste; grading, removing, dredging,
13 mining, or extraction of any materials; change in the density or intensity of use of land, and any other division of land,
14 including lot splits.. construction, reconstruction, demolition, or
15 alteration of the size of any structure....

16 (Cal. Pub. Resources Code §30106.)
17 64. The Coastal Commission issues development permits for local governments
18 that do not exercise their options to establish local coastal programs, like the
19 City of San Clemente. (Cal Pub. Resources Code §30600.)
20 65.The General Plan prohibits the city from creating and operating a campground
21 outside of the designated SB 2 shelter zone and without adequate shelter
22 services contemplated by state law and the City's own Zoning Code. Camping
23 is not a permitted land use for the Site under the General Plan.
24 66.State law and the city's own Municipal Code mandate that all decisions
25 affecting land use in San Clemente-including all planning, environmental
26 decisions, and development in the City--must be consistent with the City's
27 General Plan. However, the, and uses allowed used the Ordinances are
28 decidedly inconsistent with the "Public" land uses designated for the Site in

-11-
Petition for Writ of Mandate

the General Plan. As such, the Ordinances are void.

2 67.While the Constitution prohibits the City from enforcement of any criminal

3 prohibitions on camping when there is no appropriate indoor alternative as

4 cruel and unusual, the General Plan also prohibits the city from using public

5 land as a public camp ground with no shelter or social services provided.

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
(Petition for Writ of Mandate re: Coastal Act)
10 68.Petitioner realleges paragraphs 1-67, as if fully set forth herein.
11 69. The purpose of the California Coastal Act is to provide "a comprehensive
12 scheme to govern land use planning for the entire Coastal Zone of California."
13 The legislature found that:
14 "the California coastal zone is a distinct and valuable natural

15 resource of vital and enduring interest to all the people[;] [t]hat
to promote the public safety, health, and welfare…. it is necessary
16 to protect the ecological balance of the coastal zone and prevent
17 its deterioration and destruction[;]" and "[t]hat existing
developed uses, and future developments that are carefully 18 planned and developed consistent with the policies of this
19 division, are essential to the economic and social well-being of

20 the people of this state...." (Cal. Pub. Resources Code § 30001 (a), (c), and (d).)
21 70.The Coastal Act requires that "any person... wishing to perform or undertake
22 any development in the coastal zone shall obtain a coastal development
23 permit." (Cal. Pub. Resources Code §30600(a).)
24 71.The Coastal Act defines "person" as "any individual, organization, 25 partnership, limited liability company, or other business association or 26

27 corporation, including any utility, and any federal, state, local government, or

28 special district or an agency thereof." (Cal. Pub. Resources Code §30111)
(emphasis added.)

-12-
Petition for Writ of Mandate

72.The City is therefore a person under the Coastal Act.
2 73.A "development" under the Coastal Act, includes but is not limited to:

the placement or erection of any solid material or structure;
discharge or disposal of any dredged material or of any gaseous, liquid, solid, or thermal waste; grading, removing, dredging, mining, or extraction of any materials; change in the density or
intensity of use of land, and any other division of land, including lot splits... construction, reconstruction, demolition, or
8 alteration of the size of any structure....

9 (Cal. Pub. Reources. Code §30106.)
10 74.The City's actions are a "development" under the Coastal Act because they
11 include the "placement or erection" and "construction" of structures, the
12 "discharge or disposal" of waste, and "grading."
13 75.The City's actions are a "development" under the Coastal Act because they
14 constitute a "change in the density or intensity of use of land."
15 76.The City's actions are a "development" under the Coastal Act because
16 changing half of an unused lot into a camp site constitutes the "division of
17 land."

18 77.Upon information and belief, the City did not obtain, and does not hold a

19 Coastal Development Permit authorizing the development at issue.
20 78.Any person may request equitable relief to restrain any violation of the Coastal
21 Act. (Cal. Pub. Resources Code §30803(a).)
22 79.Petitioner is entitled to a permanent injunction preventing the City from
23 operating the Site without a Coastal Development Permit.
24 80.Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 1085, alternatively § 1094.5, a writ of
25 mandate should be issued directing Respondents to rescind the Ordinances and
26 comply with the requirements of the Coastal Act.

1 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
2 (Petition for Writ of Mandate re: CEQA)
t.

uvo 81.Petitioner realleges paragraphs 1-67, as if fully set forth herein.
82. The purpose of CEQA is to ensure the long-term protection of the environment
and informed decision-making and informed participation in decisions that

7 could have environmental impacts.
8 83. The Ordinances and development and operation of the Site are discretionary
actions and constitute projects under CEQA.
10 84. The City of San Clemente is the "lead agency" as the term is defined by
11 CEQA, and is therefore responsible for evaluating the environmental impacts
12 of the project (Cal. Public Resources Code § 21067.)
13 85.The City's adoption of the Ordinances has potential to cause significant
14 impacts on the environment.
15 86.In deciding to proceed with the Ordinances, and in relying on purported
16 exemptions to CEQA, the City of San Clemente violated CEQA because, inter
17 alia:

18 (a) The City of San Clemente failed to consider the environmental impacts of
19 the Ordinances and development and use of the Site as a homeless shelter;
20 (b) The City of San Clemente failed to proceed in the manner required by law
21 and abused its discretion under CEQA;
22 (c) The City of San Clemente's claims of exemption under CEQA is contrary
23 to law, because no emergency existed, the development and use of the Site as
24 a homeless shelter would cause more than a minor alteration in land and also

87.Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 1085 (alternatively § 1094.5), a writ of

THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION
(Against All Parties For A Writ Of Mandate And Ancillary Injunctive Relief
co Based On Violations Of State Law And City's Municipal Code In Adopting
Ordinances Not Consistent With General Plan)
10 88.Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference each and every
11 allegation contained in paragraphs 1-67 inclusive, as set forth above.
12 89.California's Planning and Zoning Law (Gov. Code, § 65000 et seq.) requires
13 each city and county to "adopt a comprehensive, long-term general plan for the
14 physical development of the county or city, and of any land outside its
15 boundaries which in the planning agency's judgment bears relation to its
16 planning." (Gov. Code, § 65300.) The general plan has been aptly described
17 by the California courts as the "constitution for all future developments"
18 within a city or county.
19 90.Under California law, including, but not limited to, Government Code con
20 65860(a), the propriety of virtually any local decision affecting land use and
21 development depends upon consistency with the applicable general plan and
22 its elements. The consistency doctrine has been acknowledged by the
23 California courts to be "the linchpin of California's land use and development
24 laws; it is the principle which infuse{s] the concept of planned growth with the
25 force of law."

26 91.Accordingly, all actions taken, and all decisions made, by the City that directly
27 or indirectly affect land uses in San Clemente must be consistent with the

28 City's General Plan. §17.04.070 of the City's Municipal Code expressly

-15-
Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 provides that:

2 "The City of San Clemente General Plan is the foundational planning

3 policy document of the City. It defines and sets forth the basic policy and guidelines by which the community will be permitted to develop
4 in the future. It is intended to guide all planning, environmental

5 decisions, and development in the community. Among other things, the General Plan establishes what kinds of land uses will be permitted
6 and where, how dense the development may be, and the proportional

7 relationship of the built environment." 92.Under the Land Use Element of the City's General Plan, the Site designated 8 for camping per Ordinances Nos. 1673 and 1774 is designated for "Public
9 (Coastal Zone)" uses only. Likewise, under the West Pico Corridor Specific 10 Plan (the "Specific Plan"), the Site is zoned for "Public" uses only. In 11 addition, under the Coastal Element of the City's General Plan, which 12 incorporates the Land Use Plan portion (certified by the California Coastal
13 Commission in August 2018) of the City's Local Coastal Program ("LCP"), 14 the Site is designated for "Public" uses only.
15 93.As stated in the Land Use Element of the City's General Plan, "[t]raditionally, 16 the Land Use Element is considered the General Plan's most important policy 17 document because it describes the allowed types and configurations of land 18 uses and where they can be located, including residential, commercial, mixed-
19 use, industrial, open space, recreation and public uses."
20 94.The uses allowed for the "Public" land use areas designated in the Land Use 21 Element are government offices, hospitals, social services, utilities,
22 recreational and cultural facilities, schools, libraries, and public and private 23 parking. By no stretch of the imagination are homeless camping uses and 24 activities allowed in areas designated for "Public" use. 25 95.A land use designation of "Public" does not provide for camping; the City's
26 action approving the Ordinances is inconsistent with the land use designation 27 in the General Plan. In fact, nowhere in the Land Use Element or the Coastal 28 Element of the General Plan, nor or in any other Element thereof, are any

-16-
Petition for Writ of Mandate

2 daytime or overnight camping uses, including pitching or occupying camp

3 facilities, permitted on any property in the City that is designated for "Public"

D use. Under the Land Use Plan that is incorporated as part of the Coastal
Element of the General Plan, the only camping or tenting activities that are

6 officially permitted in the Coastal Zone are restricted to San Clemente State

7 Beach, and such activities are not permitted uses at the Site which is located in
the Coastal Zone.

8 96. The Housing Element to the City's General Plan states as a Goal that it

10 will "[e]nsure equal housing opportunity and prevent housing discrimination

11 of protected persons" and that a strategy to achieve that goal is to "[p]rovide

12 housing resources for prevention of homelessness and alternative housing for

13 the homeless and disabled." Ordinances Nos. 1673 and 1774 are in conflict
with that goal.
14

15 97. The Housing Element further states that the City will consider updates to its

16 emergency shelter overlay zoning when "[s]ignificant changes in the housing

17 market conditions that would impact the City's homeless shelter needs

18 between the Homeless Censuses. The City will consult homeless service

19 providers to establish the appropriate modifications to the established unmet
homeless shelter needs."

20

21 98.The City's unsheltered population has grown steadily since the adoption of the

22 revised Housing Element, but t failed to provide any reasonable public

23 process, let alone consult with providers to establish appropriate modifications

24 to address unmet shelter needs. The City's rushed emergency ordinance to

25 allow camping on a potentially toxic, public parcel is inconsistent with its

26 Housing Element goals to address the needs of homeless persons.

27 99.However, notwithstanding the inconsistency with the General Plan's "Public"

28 land use designation for the Site, the City has adopted the Ordinances which
now allow new and expanded uses to occur at that property--including, but

-17-
Petition for Writ of Mandate

not limited to, daytime and overnight camping activities by homeless persons
2 (and potentially others) who choose to reside at the site for various periods of
time through the end of June 2020.
100. Although the City has tried to style the Ordinances as changes to the
u Health & Safety Chapter of its Municipal Code, they are, in reality, zone
6 changes because they purport to materially alter and expand the allowed uses
at the Site. As such, in adopting the de facto zone changes for the Site that
have been put into effect by the Ordinances, the City has failed to comply with
the provisions of §17.16.040 of the City's Zoning Code that required the City
10 Council to adopt findings prior to approving such changes, including a finding
11 that the proposed ordinances are "consistent with the General Plan."
12 101. Inexplicably, the Ordinances are devoid of any findings of consistency
13 with the City's General Plan and this glaring omission is a tacit admission by
14 the City that the following fact is true-i.e., the Ordinances are invalid--and
15 were void from the outset-because they are patently inconsistent and
16 incompatible with the goals, objectives, policies, land uses, and programs
17 specified in the General Plan.
18 102. The Land Use Element of the City's General Plan does provide for an
19 "Emergency Shelter (ES)" land use designation that "allows emergency
20 shelters to meet State goals and policies for homeless needs, pursuant to
21 limitations in the Zoning Code." However, the Site has never been designated
22 for "Emergency Shelter" uses in the General Plan.
23 103. Pursuant to §17.56.100 of the City's Municipal Code, the Emergency
24 Shelter Overlay District (otherwise known as the "SB 2 Overlay Zone") is
25 strictly confined to the Rancho San Clemente Business Park Sub-Area which
26 is located miles away from the Site. Ironically, in connection with the prior
27 litigation between the City and petitioner ESC-which led to the establishment
28 of the SB 2 Overlay Zonethe City repeatedly rejected ESC's requests to

-18-
Petition for Writ of Mandate

establish the SB 2 Overlay Zone west of the 5 Freeway in San Clemente,
2 including sites within the West Pico Corridor Specific Plan area where the Site
is located. As the administrative record will reflect, the City expressly found
that sites west of the 5 Freeway would not be appropriate locations for SB 2
shelter sites to serve the homeless population of San Clemente. Now,
6 however--in stark conflict with its earlier position---the City has established a
7 campground for homeless persons at the Site.
104. Moreover, as made clear by the SB 2 Guidelines issued by the
California Department of Housing and Community Development ("HCD") the
10 type of "emergency shelter" envisioned by SB 2 (Gov. Code, § 65583) is not
11 an array of tents pitched haphazardly on a dirt lot next to a sewage treatment
12 plant. Instead, the HCD Guidelines contemplate that an emergency shelter
13 would consist of a permanent or temporary structure providing, at a minimum,
14 indoor housing ("beds") with, at least, minimal supportive services for
15 homeless persons. That, too, is what the City's General Plan and Zoning Code
16 contemplate for emergency shelters, not scores of homeless individuals
17 sleeping in tents, or on the bare ground, next to a sewage plant.
18 105. As the Site is presently being used pursuant to the Ordinances, the
19 homeless camping uses occurring at that location are grossly inconsistent with
20 the emergency shelter goals and objectives of both SB 2 and the City's

21 General Plan. At all times relevant to this action, however, Respondents were
22 obligated to comply with the state law consistency doctrine, but it chose not to
23 do so.

24 106. As alleged hereinabove, the Ordinances were void at the time they were
25 adopted and they must be rescinded by the City.
26 107. At all times relevant to the action, Respondents had the ability to
27 perform each of the duties and obligations alleged herein, but have failed and
28 refused to perform such legal duties and obligations. Respondents have acted

-19-
Petition for Writ of Mandate

2 arbitrarily, capriciously, and without evidentiary support in failing and
refusing to carry out or discharge their mandatory duties and obligations as
alleged herein.
108.
Ur Unless compelled by this Court to perform the legal duties and
obligations alleged above, Respondents will continue to abdicate such duties
and obligations and will continue to violate the law. ESC and the public have
been, and will continue to be, injured as a result of the City's acts and
omissions as alleged above.
9 109.

10 In light of the foregoing, ESC is entitled to a peremptory writ of

11 mandate which, inter alia directs Respondents to vacate and set aside the

12 Ordinances and any actions which they have taken, or may hereafter take, in
reliance thereon or in connection therewith.

13 110.

14 In addition, ESC is entitled to ancillary injunctive relief in support of

15 and relating to the mandamus relief sought above.

16

17 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

18 WHEREFORE, Petitioners/Plaintiffs pray for relief as follows:

19 For a writ of mandate:

25 3. For a preliminary and permanent injunction ordering Respondents to refrain

26 from further development and operation of the Site without a Coastal

27 Development Permit from the Coastal Commission.

28

4. For a preliminary and permanent injunction ordering Respondents to refrain
2 from further development and operation of the Site without consideration of

3 the environmental impact and compliance with the General Plan.
5. For a preliminary and permanent injunction ordering Respondents to refrain

5 from further development and operation of the Site without complying with

6 CEQA and CEQA Guidelines, and to take any other action required pursuant

7 to § 21168.9.

8 6. For a judgment declaring that the Ordinances violate CEQA, the Coastal Act,
9 and Government Code § 65860(a) and cannot be enforced.
10 7. For an award of attorney's fees, litigation expenses, and costs as permitted or
11 required by law; and
12 8. For such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

SUPERIOR COURT OF CALIFORNIA
COUNTY OF ORANGE

ADR Information

Introduction.

Most civil disputes are resolved without filing a lawsuit, and most civil lawsuits are resolved without a trial. The courts and others offer a variety of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) processes to help people resolve disputes without a trial. ADR is usually less formal, less expensive, and less time-consuming than a trial. ADR can also give people more opportunity to determine when and how their dispute will be
resolved.

BENEFITS OF ADR.

Using ADR may have a variety of benefits, depending on the type of ADR process used and the circumstances of the particular case. Some potential benefits of ADR are summarized below.

Save Time. A dispute often can be settled or decided much sooner with ADR; often in a matter of months, even weeks, while bringing a lawsuit to a trial can take a year or more.
Save Money. When cases are resolved earlier through ADR, the parties may save some of the money they would have spent on attorney fees, court costs, experts' fees, and other litigation expenses.

Increase Control Over the Process and the Outcome. In ADR, parties typically play a greater role in shaping both the process and its outcome. In most ADR processes, parties have more opportunity to tell their side of the story than they do at trial. Some ADR processes, such as mediation, allow the parties to fashion creative resolutions that are not available in a trial. Other ADR processes, such as arbitration, allow the parties to choose an expert in a particular field to decide the dispute.

Preserve Relationships. ADR can be a less adversarial and hostile a way to resolve a dispute. For example, an experienced mediator can help the parties effectively communicate their needs and point of
view to the other side. This can be an important advantage where the parties have a relationship to
preserve.

Increase Satisfaction. In a trial, there is typically a winner and a loser. The loser is not likely to be happy, and even the winner may not be completely satisfied with the outcome. ADR can help the parties find win-win solutions and achieve their real goals. This, along with all of ADR's other potential advantages, may increase the parties' overall satisfaction with both the dispute resolution process and the outcome.

Improve Attorney-Client Relationships. Attorneys may also benefit from ADR by being seen as
problem-solvers rather than combatants. Quick, cost-effective, and satisfying resolutions are likely to
produce happier clients and thus generate repeat business from clients and referrals of their friends and
associates.

DISADVANTAGES OF ADR.

ADR may not be suitable for every dispute.
Loss of protections. If ADR is binding, the parties normally give up most court protections, including a decision by a judge or jury under formal rules of evidence and procedure, and review for legal error by an appellate court.

L1200 (Rev. Jul. 2018) Page 2 of 4

Less discovery, There generally is less opportunity to find out about the other side's case with ADR than with litigation. ADR may not be effective it takes place before the parties have sufficient
information to resolve the dispute.

Additional costs. The neutral may charge a fee for his or her services. If a dispute is not resolved through ADR, the parties may have to put time and money into both ADR and a lawsuit.
Effect of if delays if the dispute is not resolved. Lawsuits must be brought within specified periods of time, known as statues of limitation. Parties must be careful not to let a statute of limitations run out while
a dispute is in an ADR process.
TYPES OF ADR IN CIVIL CASES.

The most commonly used ADR processes are arbitration, mediation, neutral evaluation and settlement
conferences.

Arbitration. In arbitration, a neutral person called an "arbitrator" hears arguments and evidence from
each side and then decides the outcome of the dispute. Arbitration is less formal than a trial, and the rules
of evidence are often relaxed. Arbitration may be either "binding" or "nonbinding." Binding arbitration means that the parties waive their right to a trial and agree to accept the arbitrator's decision as final. Generally, there is no right to appeal an arbitrator's decision. Nonbinding arbitration means that the parties are free to request a trial if they do not accept the arbitrator's decision.

Cases for Which Arbitration May Be Appropriate. Arbitration is best for cases where the parties want another person to decide the outcome of their dispute for them but would like to avoid the formality, time, and expense of a trial. It may also be appropriate for complex matters where the parties want a decision-maker who has training or experience in the subject matter of the dispute.

Cases for Which Arbitration May Not Be Appropriate. If parties want to retain control over how their dispute is resolved, arbitration, particularly binding arbitration, is not appropriate. In binding arbitration, the parties generally cannot appeal the arbitrator's award, even if it is not supported by the evidence or the law. Even in nonbinding arbitration, if a party requests a trial and does not receive a more favorable result at trial than in arbitration, there may be penalties.
Mediation. In mediation, an impartial person called a "mediator" helps the parties try to reach a mutually acceptable resolution of the dispute. The mediator does not decide the dispute but helps the parties
communicate so they can try to settle the dispute themselves. Mediation leaves control of the outcome
with the parties.

Cases for Which Mediation May Be Appropriate. Mediation may be particularly useful when parties have a relationship they want to preserve. So when family members, neighbors, or business partners have a dispute, mediation may be the ADR process to use. Mediation is also effective when emotions are getting in the way of resolution. An effective mediator can hear the parties out and help
them communicate with each other in an effective and nondestructive manner.

Cases for Which Mediation May Not Be Appropriate. Mediation may not be effective if one of the parties is unwilling to cooperate or compromise. Mediation also may not be effective if one of the parties has a significant advantage in power over the other. Therefore, it may not be a good choice if the parties have a history of abuse or victimization.

Neutral Evaluation. In neutral evaluation, each party gets a chance to present the case to a neutral a person called an "evaluator." The evaluator then gives an opinion on the strengths and weaknesses of each party's evidence and arguments and about how the dispute could be resolved. The evaluator is

L1200 (Rev. Jul. 2018) Page 3 of 4

often an expert in the subject matter of the dispute. Although the evaluator's opinion is not binding, the parties typically use it as a basis for trying to negotiate resolution of the dispute.
Cases for Which Neutral Evaluation May Be Appropriate. Neutral evaluation may be most appropriate in cases in which there are technical issues that require special expertise to resolve or
the only significant issue in the case is the amount of damages.

Cases for Which Neutral Evaluation May Not Be Appropriate. Neutral evaluation may not be appropriate when there are significant personal or emotional barriers to resolving the dispute.
Settlement Conferences. Settlement conferences may be either mandatory or voluntary. In both types of settlement conferences, the parties and their attorneys meet with a judge or a neutral person called "settlement officer" to discuss possible settlement of their dispute. The judge or settlement officer does not make a decision in the case but assists the parties in evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of the case and in negotiating a settlement. Settlement conferences are appropriate in any case where settlement is an option. Mandatory settlement conferences are often held close to the date a case is set
for trial.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

In addition to mediation, arbitration, neutral evaluation, and settlement conferences, there are other types of ADR, including conciliation, fact finding, mini-trials, and summary jury trials. Sometimes parties will try a combination of ADR types. The important thing is to try to find the type or types of ADR that are most likely to resolve your dispute.
