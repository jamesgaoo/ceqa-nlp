2 PLEASE TAKE NOTICE, under Public Resources Code Section 21167.7, and Code of
Civil Procedure Section 388, that on September 17, 2019, Petitioners Save Rural SLO and

4 Stephanie Shakofsky filed a Petition for Writ of Mandamus against Respondents County of

The Petition alleges that Respondents violated the California Environmental Quality
Act in connection with the adoption of Resolution No. 2019-237 to approve Nouel Riel Cellars
9 Inc.'s application for a Minor Use Permit (DRC2018-00018) for the construction of an indoor
10 cannabis cultivation facility and ancillary processing of cannabis, including drying, trimming,
11 grading, sorting, packaging, labeling, and storing that includes four (4) 4,980 square foot
12 greenhouses supporting up to 19,920 square feet of cannabis, improvements concerning the
13 site's access driveway and parking area, new perimeter fencing and appurtenant exterior
14| lighting, relocation of an existing storage shed, installation of a 160-square foot storage
15 container, and modification of the parking requirements ("Project") and erroneous adoption of
16 a Mitigated Negative Declaration ("MND") for the Project. The Petition also alleges that the
17 Respondents failed to proceed in a manner required under law by failing to comply with
18 County Code's requirement for a 2:1 water offset ratio for new projects in the Paso Robles
19 Groundwater Basin.
20 A copy of the Petition for Writ of Mandamus is enclosed herewith.

2 INTRODUCTION

3 1. On August 13, 2019 the County of San Luis Obispo ("County") by and through

4 the Board of Supervisors (collectively "Respondents") adopted Resolution No. 2019-237 and
approved a Minor Use Permit (DRC2018-0018) submitted by Gary Spackman of Nouel Riel

6 Cellars Inc. and Sandra and David Wood of Coastal Elevations ("Real Parties") for the

7 construction of an indoor cannabis cultivation facility and ancillary processing of cannabis,

8 including drying, trimming, grading, sorting, packaging, labeling, and storing that includes four
(4) 4,980 square foot greenhouses supporting up to 19,920 square feet of cannabis,
10 improvements concerning the site's access driveway and parking area, new perimeter fencing

11 and appurtenant exterior lighting, relocation of an existing storage shed, installation of a 160-

12 square foot storage container, and modification of the parking requirements (*Project"). The

13 Respondents adopted a Mitigated Negative Declaration ("MND") for the Project because they

14 erroneously determined that there is no substantial evidence that the Project may have a

15 significant effect on the environment.

16 2. The Project is located at 7755 Airport Road in Paso Robles, California and is

17 within the Paso Robles Groundwater Basin. The Paso Robles Groundwater Basin has been

18 assigned a Level of Severity III impacted groundwater basin. In order to meet the Project's

19 water demands, the Real Parties plan to utilize the existing on-site well as a water source. The

20 MND asserted the Project's water demands would total 1.23 acre feet per year of water (AFY).

21 However, during the Board of Supervisors' appeal hearing on August 13, 2019, the Real

22 Parties' representative admitted on the record that the Project would actually have a water

23 demand of 5.5 AFY. This is over four times the water usage stated in the MND. Therefore,

24 the MND failed to analyze the actual water usage a and a fair argument exists that the Project

25 may have a significant impact on water.

26 3. The MND asserts that the Project is expected to generate noise levels of

27 approximately 70 decibels at 25 feet from the source. The MND also estimates that the noise

28 level would be reduced to below 60 decibels at the property line due to noise attenuation from

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
2

the source. However, the MND does not cite any evidence to support this analysis, and the

2 Respondents admitted at the Board of Supervisors hearing that the Project may violate County
nighttime noise standards. Further, information supplied by the Real Parties after the MND

4 was circulated and just prior to the Board of Supervisors' appeal hearing indicated that odor
management fans would lead to an increase in noise. However, that impact was never

6 analyzed in the MND.

7 4. Petitioners Save Rural SLO and Stephanie Shakofsky (*Petitioners") are

8 concerned with the Respondents' failure to conduct adequate environmental review under the
California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA").

10 5. The MND contains mitigation measures only to address fugitive dust associated
11 with construction and monitoring and avoidance measures pertaining to biological resources.

12 No other mitigation measures were imposed for any other environmental impact. A fair

13 argument exists that the Project may have significant impacts on the environment thus

14 warranting preparation of an Environmental Impact Report ("EIR").

15 6. Petitioners challenge the approval of the Project and the adoption of the MND
16 on the grounds that the Project does not comply with the California Environmental Quality Act
17 ("CEQA" - Pub. Resources Code § 21000 et seq.) because the MND failed to analyze the

18 actual water demand of the Project. And, the MND relied on the wrong water offset ratio since

19 a 2:1 offset ratio is required in the Paso Robles Groundwater Basin for new development such

20 as this one. Furthermore, the MND failed to provide adequate support of the Project's

21 compliance with County Noise Standards and a fair argument exists that the Project may have

22 significant impacts to water and noise. The MND also wholly failed to analyze glare and night

23 lighting.

24 7. On August 19, 2019, Respondents filed a Notice of Determination and, pursuant

25 to Public Resources Code Section 21167, this action was filed within 30 days thereof.

26 II

27 PARTIES

28 8. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 7 as if fully

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
3

- set forth herein.

2 9.

3 Save Rural SLO is an unincorporated association of residents and taxpayers of
the County of San Luis Obispo. Save Rural SLO has strong interested in preservation of the
4  environment and includes residents affected by the Project and whose interests will be

5

6 adversely affected by the violations of CEQA. Petitioner Save Rural SLO and its members

7 submitted comments on the Project that addressed the lack of environmental review in front of

8 the hearing officer and appealed the decision of the hearing officer to the Board of Supervisors.

10.

9 Petitioner Stephanie Shakofsky is an individual dedicated to the protection of

10 the environment in the County of San Luis Obispo by participating in local environmental and

11 land use policy and decision making. Petitioner Stephanie Shakofsky is a resident of the

12 County of San Luis Obispo and is affected by the Project, and whose interests in preservation

13 of the ecological integrity of the County will be adversely affected by the lack of proper

14 environmental review under CEQA and approval of the Project. Petitioner Stephanie

15 Shakofsky participated at the public hearing and submitted comments on the Project.

11.

16 Respondent County of San Luis Obispo, through Respondent Board of

17 Supervisors of the County of San Luis Obispo, is a political subdivision of the State of

18 California. On August 13, 2019, Respondents approved the Project and adopted an MND for
the Project.

19 12.

20 The true names and capacities, whether individual, corporate or otherwise, of

21 Does 1-15 are unknown to Petitioners who therefore sue said Respondents by such fictitious

22 names and will seek leave to amend this Petition when their identities have been ascertained.

13.

23 Petitioners are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that Respondents

24 and each of them were the agents and employees of each of the remaining Respondents and

25 while doing the things herein alleged, were acting within the course and scope of such agency
and employment.

26 14.

27 Real Party in Interest, Nouel Riel Cellars Inc., is an owner or applicant for the

28 Project being proposed and properly named as a Real Party in Interest pursuant to Public
Resources Code section 21167.6.5.(a), which states Petitioners shall name as a Real Party in

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
4

Interest any person or persons identified in the Notice of Determination filed by Respondents.

2 15. Petitioners are informed and believe, and on that basis allege that Real Party in

3 Interest, Gary M. Spackman, is an owner of Nouel Riel Cellars, Inc.

16. Real Party in Interest, Coastal Elevations, is an owner or applicant for the
Project being proposed.

17. Petitioners are informed and believe, and on that basis allege that Real Parties in
Interest, Sandra and David Wood, are owners of Coastal Elevation.

8 18. The true names and capacities, whether individual, corporate, or otherwise, of

9 Does 16 through 30 are unknown to Petitioners who therefore sue said Real Parties in Interest

10 by such fictitious names and will seek leave to amend this Petition for Writ of Mandamus

11 when their identities have been ascertained.

12 19. Petitioners are informed and believe that at all times herein alleged, Real Parties
13 in Interest and each of them were the agents and employees of each of the remaining Real

14 Parties in Interest and while doing the things herein alleged, were acting within the course and
15 scope of such agency and employment.
16 III

17 STANDING

18 20. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 19 as if fully

19 set forth herein.

20 21. Approval of the Project will adversely affect the interests of Petitioner Save

21 Rural SLO. Petitioner Save Rural SLO has a strong a interest in the preservation of the

22 environment. Members of Petitioner Save Rural SLO reside in the County of San Luis Obispo,

23 and include residents affected by the Project and whose interests will be adversely affected by

24 the violations of CEQA. Approval of the Project and adoption of an MND will adversely

25 affect these interests of Petitioner Save Rural SLO and its members. Petitioner Save Rural

26 SLO was formed subsequent to Project approval. Its members have expressed their concerns

27 and commented on the Project during the administrative proceedings wherein the Project was
28 considered. Therefore, Petitioner Save Rural SLO has exhausted its administrative remedies

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

1 and has standing pursuant to Public Resources Code Section 21177(c). Accordingly, Petitioner

2 Save Rural SLO is an "aggrieved person" within the meaning of Public Resources Code §
3 21177. The claims asserted and relief requested are broad-based, so that participation in the

4 litigation by individual members is not required.

5 22. Approval of the Project will adversely affect the interests of Petitioner
6 Stephanie Shakofsky. Petitioner Stephanie Shakofsky is a resident and taxpayer of San Luis

7 Obispo County who is dedicated to preserving the environment of the County of San Luis

8 Obispo as set forth, supra, and is concerned about maintaining the environmental integrity of
9 the County of San Luis Obispo. Approval of the Project and adoption of an exemption from
10 environmental review will adversely affect these interests of Petitioner Stephanie Shakofsky.
11 Petitioner Stephanie Shakofsky has submitted comments on and objections to the lack of

12 CEQA compliance and has participated at public hearings. Accordingly, Petitioner Stephanie
13 Shakofsky is an "aggrieved person" within the meaning of Public Resources Code Section
14 21177.

15 23. Jurisdiction of this Court is invoked pursuant to California Code of Civil

16 Procedure §§ 1085 and 1094.5; California Public Resources Code § 21167; CEQA Guidelines
17 § 15112; the Constitution of the State of California; the Constitution of the United States; and

18 other applicable laws and regulations.

19 IV

20 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

21 24. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 23 as if fully

22 set forth herein.

23 25. Petitioner has performed all conditions precedent to the filing of this Petition by

24 themselves or others, raising each and every issue known to them before Respondents, in

25 compliance with Public Resources Code § 21177, Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1085 and

26 1094.5, and other applicable laws.

27 26. Notice of the filing of this action as required by Public Resources Code §
28 21167.5 was mailed to Respondent on September 17, 2019. (Letter and Proof of Service are

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
Violation of the California Environmental Quality Act
[Public Resources Code § 21000 et seq.]
5
27.
6 Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 26 as if fully
set forth herein.
7
28. Respondents' adoption of an MND constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion 8
because a fair argument exists that the Project may have a significant effect on the
9

10 environment. "With certain limited exceptions, a public agency must prepare an EIR whenever

11 substantial evidence supports a fair argument that a proposed project 'may have a significant

12 effect on the environment.'** Protect Niles v. City of Fremont (2018) 25 Cal.App.5th 1129,
1138-1139.
13
29.
14 CEQA requires that Respondents adequately and accurately disclose, evaluate,

15 and mitigate the impacts of the Project. The MND failed to adequately evaluate the impacts of

16 the Project on water and noise as well as the visual and lighting impacts of the Project. At the

17 Board of Supervisors appeal hearing, the representative for the Real Parties admitted that the
Project's water demand would be 5.5 AFY. The MND's analysis was based on the erroneous 18

19 assumption that the Project's water demand would be 1.23 AFY. Furthermore, at the Board of

20 Supervisors hearing the Respondents admitted that the Project may violate County noise

21 standards. The MND did not fully analyze the impacts of the Project since the parameters of

22 the Project kept changing after the MND was already completed. A fair argument exists that

23 the Project may have a significant impact on the environment. "The fair argument standard is a

24 tlow threshold' test for requiring the preparation of an EIR. It is a question of law, not fact,

25 whether a fair argument exists, and the courts owe no deference to the lead agency's

26 determination. Review is de novo, with a preference for resolving doubts in favor of

27 environmental review." Protect Niles v. City of Fremont, supra, 25 Cal.App.5th at 1139,

2 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

3 Violation of the County of San Luis Obispo's County Code [County Code Section 22.94.025]
4

5 30. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 29 as if fully

6 set forth herein.

7 31. The Respondents approved the Project with condition of approval #17 that

8 required only a water offset at a ratio of 1:1 "as required by Section 22.94.025.F" of the
County Code. However, Section 22.94.025.F of the County Code requires "net new water

10 demand shall be offset at a ratio of 2:1 through participation in water conservation

11 programs..." Therefore, it was erroneous as a matter of law to approve the Project with a water

12 offset at a ratio of 1:1 when the County Code expressly requires a water offset at a ratio of 2:1

13 for new projects in the Paso Robles Groundwater Basin.

35. An actual controversy has arisen concerning Respondents' failure to comply
28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
8

1 with CEQA (Pub. Resources Code $ 21000 et seq.), as set forth above.

2 36. As a result of the above-alleged violations of CEQA, Respondents have failed to

3 conduct adequate environmental review as required by law and, thus, have failed to proceed in
a manner required by law in approving the Project.

5 37. At all times mentioned herein, Respondents have been able to comply with

6 CEQA, prepare adequate environmental review, and comply with all relevant provisions.of

7 law. Notwithstanding such an ability, Respondents have failed and continue to fail to perform

8 their duty to comply with CEQA and all other relevant provisions of law.
9 38. Petitioners are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that Respondents
10 are threatening to proceed with development of the Project in the near future. Said

11 implementation of the Project will irreparably harm the environment and will result in

12 significant and unmitigated adverse environmental impacts.

13 39. Petitioners possess no speedy, adequate remedy at law, in that implementation

14 and development in connection with the Project will permanently and forever harm, injure,

15 degrade, and impact the environmental values of the County of San Luis Obispo and the State

16 of California. Petitioners will suffer irreparable and permanent injuries if Respondents' actions

17 described herein are not set aside.

18 40. A stay and/or restraining order and preliminary and permanent injunction

19 should issue restraining Respondents from proceeding with development of the Project.

20 41. In order to preserve the status quo, a stay and/or restraining order and

21 preliminary and permanent injunction should issue staying Respondents' approval of the

22 Project and adoption of the MND.

23 PRAYER

24 WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for judgment as follows:

25 1. For Alternative and Peremptory Writs of Mandate ordering Respondents to set

26 aside: (1) any and all Project approvals, including, but not limited to, approval of Minor Use

requirements, and (2) adoption of an MND for the Project.

Re: Notice of Intent to Commence Litigation
Pursuant to the requirements of Public Resources Code Section 21167.5, this letter will
serve as notice that Save Rural SLO and Stephanie Shakofsky will commence litigation against the County of San Luis Obispo and Board of Supervisors of the County of San Luis Obispo (*Respondents").
This litigation challenges the actions of Respondents in connection with the adoption of Resolution No. 2019-237 to approve Nouel Riel Cellars Inc.'s application for a Minor Use Permit (DRC2018-00018) for the construction of an indoor cannabis cultivation facility and ancillary processing of cannabis, including drying, trimming, grading, sorting, packaging, labeling, and storing that includes four (4) 4,980 square foot greenhouses supporting up to 19,920 square feet of cannabis, improvements concerning the site's access driveway and parking area, new perimeter fencing and appurtenant exterior lighting, relocation of an existing storage shed, installation of a 160-square foot storage container, and modification of the parking requirements (*Project") as well as the Respondents' erroneous adoption of a Mitigated Negative Declaration ("MND") for the Project when a fair argument exists that the Project will have significant impacts on the environment.
This litigation has been commenced, inter alia, because the actions listed in the preceding paragraph do not comply with the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act (Public Resources Code § 21000 et seq.).
The Petition also alleges that the Respondents failed to proceed in a manner required under law by failing to comply with the County Code's requirement for a 2:1 water offset ratio for new projects in the Paso Robles Groundwater Basin.
