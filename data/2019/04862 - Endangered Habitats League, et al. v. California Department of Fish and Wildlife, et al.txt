INTRODUCTION

2 1. On or about June 27, 2019, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife
3 ("CDFW") approved and entered into a Dispute Resolution Agreement ("DRA" or
4 "Agreement") concerning the proposed Otay Ranch Village 14 and Planning Areas 16/19

5 project ("Village 14 Project") in unincorporated San Diego County. The Agreement commits

6 CDFW to transfer public lands in the Rancho Jamul Ecological Reserve to the private Village 14
Project developer for development, and to take other actions to facilitate an agreed alternative to
8 the Village 14 Project ("DRA Project") all without any public review and without conducting
9 any analysis under the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"). CDFW's decision to
10 give up protections for a wide swath of pristine San Diego backcountry and to support the DRA
11 Project without any public input or environmental review violates CEQA.
12 2. The Village 14 Project has been under consideration by the County for over two
13 years. GDCI Proctor Valley, L.P., the site owner, and Jackson Pendo Development Company,
14 its agent and manager (collectively, "Jackson Pendo"), are seeking to construct 1,119 single-
15 family houses on nearly 1,300 acres. The project includes development of sensitive habitat
16 known as PV-1, PV-2, and PV-3. The Village 14 Project would locate 340 houses on these 200
17 acres.

18 3. Throughout the County's administrative review of the Village 14 Project, CDFW
19 submitted comments objecting to development on PV-1, PV-2, and PV-3. In the 1990s, CDFW
20| and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service ("USFWS") approved a Multiple Species Conservation
21 Program ("MSCP") for San Diego County, which establishes habitat preserves and other
22 mitigation necessary to allow the County to authorize limited development that results in the
23 incidental take of endangered and other protected species. Under the MSCP and the associated
24| County Subarea Plan, PV-1, PV-2, and PV-3 were designated as preserve or "no take
25 authorized" lands. CDFW informed the County that the County was prohibited from authorizing
26 development of PV-1, PV-2, and PV-3 pursuant to the MSCP and its implementing plans and
27 agreements. Nevertheless, the County approved the Village 14 project. Petitioners have
28 separately filed suit challenging that approval.

v

4. Notwithstanding its concerns, CDFW proceeded to work with Jackson Pendo
2 behind closed doors. CDFW ultimately agreed to take action to support a completely
3 reconfigured project-the DRA Project-by which Jackson Pendo will withdraw development
4 plans for PV-1 and a portion of PV-3 and certain other portions of the Village 14 project in

5 exchange for CDFW allowing the development of PV-2 and a portion of PV-3, and transferring

6 currently protected public lands within the Rancho Jamul Ecological Reserve to Jackson Pendo
for development. In other words, CDFW agreed to give a private developer protected lands
within a state ecological reserve, and to allow development on lands currently protected by the

9 MSCP-all in exchange for the developer's agreement not to develop lands that are already
10 protected by the MSCP.
11 5. Before entering into this startling agreement, CDFW took no steps to comply with
12 CEQA. CDFW prepared no analysis of environmental impacts for the public or decisionmakers,
13 made none of the required ÇEQA findings, and took no other procedural steps necessary to
14 comply with the statute. The Agreement states that "CDFW will rely on the County-certified
15 Project EIR for its consideration of any action regarding or pursuant to th[e] Agreement." But in
16 approving the Agreement, CDFW committed itself to the sale of the Ecological Reserve
17 property and to support the DRA Project, regardless of the outcome of any future environmental
18 review. This commitment to implementing the DRA Project before undertaking CEQA
19 compliance is unlawful.
20 6. For these reasons, CDFW's approval of the Agreement constituted an abuse of
21 discretion and must be overturned.

22 PARTIES

23 7. Petitioner Endangered Habitats League ("EHL") is a is a tax-exempt non-profit
24 California corporation dedicated to the conservation of native ecosystems and to sustainable
25 land use and transportation planning. Since 1991, EHL has engaged in planning partnerships
26 across Southern California and worked to create habitat preserve systems, including the MSCP,
27 now threatened by climate change and the approval of the DRA Project. EHL is extremely
28 active in the San Diego region, where many of its members live and enjoy the biological

diversity in the area and served on the County advisory committee for the 2011 General Plan
2 Update. EHL submitted written comments to CDFW objecting to and commenting on the

3 Agreement.

8. Petitioner Center for Biological Diversity (the "Center") is a non-profit a
conservation organization dedicated to the protection of native species and their habitats through
6 science, policy, and environmental law. The Center has approximately 70,000 members
7 worldwide, including residents of San Diego County within communities in the vicinity of the
8 DRA Project. The Center has worked for many years to protect imperiled plants and wildlife,

9 open space, air and water quality, and the overall quality of life for people in unincorporated San
10 Diego County where the DRA Project is proposed. Members of the Center objected to the
11 approval the Agreement and will be directly and adversely affected by the Agreement.
12 9. The interests that EHL and the Center (together, "Petitioners") seek to further in
13 this action are within the goals and purposes of these organizations. Petitioners and their
14 members have a direct and beneficial interest in the CDFW's compliance with laws bearing on
15 approval of the Agreement. These interests will be directly and adversely affected by the
16 Agreement, which violates the law as set forth in this Petition, and implementation of which
17 would cause substantial harm to the natural environment, public health, and the quality of life in
18 the surrounding community. The maintenance and prosecution of this action will confer a
19 substantial benefit on the public by protecting the public from the environmental and other
20 harms alleged herein.
21 10. Respondent CDFW is, and at all times herein mentioned was, an administrative
22 and regulatory agency of the State of California with a mission of managing California's diverse
23 fish, wildlife, and plant resources, and the habitats upon which they depend, for their ecological
24 values and for their use and enjoyment by the public. CDFW has a mandatory duty to comply
25 with CEQA.

26 11. Respondent Charlton H. Bonham is, and at all times herein mentioned was, the
27 appointed Director of Respondent CDFW. Mr. Bonham is the signatory, on behalf of CDFW, of
28 the Agreement. As the Director, Mr. Bonham is charged with responsibilities under CEQA for

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

2 17. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 526, 527, 1085, 1087, and 1094.5,
3 and Public Resources Code sections 21168, 21168.5 and 21168.9, the San Diego County
4 Superior Court has initial jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandate to set aside CDFW's decision to
5 enter into the Agreement.

18. Venue for this action properly lies in the Superior Court for the State of California
7 in and for the County of San Diego pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 393(b). The

8 effects of the actions taken by Respondents will be felt in San Diego County, and therefore the
9 | causes of action plead below arose in San Diego County.

10 19. Venue for this action properly lies in the Central Division of the Superior Court
11 for the State of California for the County of San Diego. On information and belief, the DRA
12 Project is located in zip codes 91914 (South Division) and 91935 (East Division). However, as
13 this petition pleads a California Environmental Quality Act claim, venue is proper in the Central
14 Division pursuant to Local Rule 1.2.2(E).
15 20. Petitioners have performed any and all conditions precedent to filing this action
16 and have exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent possible and
17 required by law. Petitioners and their members submitted numerous objections to approval of
18 the Agreement, CDFW's failure to evaluate the DRA Project's impacts as required by CEQA,
19 and the DRA Project's inconsistency with the existing MSCP and implementing plans and
20 agreements.

21 21. Respondents have taken final agency actions with respect to entering into the
22 Agreement. Respondents have a duty to comply with applicable state laws, including but not
23 limited to CEQA, prior to undertaking the discretionary approvals at issue in this lawsuit.
24 22. On July 26, 2019, Petitioners complied with Public Resources Code section
25 21167.5 by emailing and mailing to Respondents a letter stating that Petitioners planned to file a
26 Petition for Writ of Mandate seeking to invalidate Respondents' approval of the Agreement.
27 Attached hereto as Exhibit A is the true and correct copy of this letter.
28

7

Case No.

- 23. On July 29, 2019, Petitioners will comply with Public Resources Code section
2 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure section 388 by furnishing the Attorney General of the
3 State of California with a copy a of the Petition. Attached hereto as Exhibit B is the true and

4

5 correct copy of the letter transmitting the Petition to the Attorney General.
24. Pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.6(b)(2), Petitioners elect to
6 prepare the record of proceedings in this action. Concurrently with this Petition, Petitioners will
a 7 file a notice of election to prepare the administrative record.

8 25. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary
9 law unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to set aside
10 their decision to enter the Agreement. In the absence of this remedy, Respondents' decision will
11 remain in effect in violation of State law, and Petitioners and their members will be irreparably
12 harmed. No money damages or legal remedy could adequately compensate Petitioners and their
13 members for that harm.

14 26. This petition is timely filed.

16 STATEMENT OF FACTS®

17 Proctor Valley and the Proposed Project Site

27. The DRA Project would be located in the remote Proctor Valley area of San Diego
18 County, northwest of the City of Chula Vista and near the small, unincorporated town of Jamul.
19 Apart from the dirt and gravel Proctor Valley Road, a designated scenic highway, the site is
20 entirely undeveloped. Travelers along Proctor Valley road are treated to the undeveloped, gentle
21

22 hillsides of Proctor Valley, San Miguel and the Jamul Mountains, and the dense trees and shrubs
of Upper Otay Reservoir.
23 28. Proctor Valley is located at the crossroads of a wealth of biological resources. The
24 site abuts the 5,600-acre Rancho Jamul Ecological Reserve, owned by CDFW, to the west,
25 north, and east. The Rancho Jamul Ecological Reserve provides raptor foraging habitat, host
26 plants and nectar resources for the Quino checkerspot butterfly, habitat occupied by the
27 California gnatcatcher and San Diego fairy shrimp, burrowing owl locations, and important
28 habitat for numerous other special and protected species, including the mountain lion.
8
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE & COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
Case No.

29. CDFW acquired the portion of the Rancho Jamul Ecological Reserve at issue in
2 the DRA with state and federal funding to "provide permanent protection of important
3 biological, scenic, cultural and historic resources." Before this acquisition, the Wildlife

4 Conservation Board staff explained that this land was "the highest priority for acquisition by the
State and federal government as part of the joint Natural Community Conservation Planning
program. Proctor Valley also provides the last remaining connection between the San Diego
7 National Wildlife Refuge and other protected open space in southern San Diego County.
30. The Wildlife Refuge is otherwise surrounded by development. As such, Proctor
9 Valley and the DRA Project site provide a vital wildlife movement corridor for species traveling
10 between the protected habitat of San Miguel Mountain within the Wildlife Refuge to the
11 northwest and the Jamul Mountains to the southeast. CDFW has recognized the importance of
12 water sources in Proctor Valley for wildlife migration between these two areas.
13 31. The DRA Project site itself supports numerous sensitive natural vegetation
14 communities including chaparral, coastal sage scrub, riparian and vernal pools. For instance, the
15 site contains special-status plants, including the federally threatened/state endangered Otay
16 tarplant, the federally threatened spreading navarretia, and other California Rare Plant Rank list
17 species. The site also contains special-status wildlife species, including the federally endangered
18 San Diego fairy shrimp and Quino checkerspot butterfly, the federally threatened California
19 gnatcatcher, the state fully protected Golden Eagle and white-tailed kite, and the federal
20 candidate western spadefoot toad. The site is not only replete with sensitive flora and fauna; it
21 provides some of the County's last best habitat for many of these species.
22 32. For instance, Proctor Valley contains key habitat for the federally endangered
23 Quino checkerspot butterfly, a small orange-and-black butterfly that was once one of the most
24 common butterflies in Southern California but is now on the verge of extinction. Proctor Valley
25 connects vital habitat areas for the Quino checkerspot butterfly---San Miguel Mountain and
26 Otay Mountain-and contains significant habitat, including host plants and nectar sources. After
27 the wet winters of 2017 and 2018, limited surveys revealed over 50 Quino checkerspot butterfly
28 on and near the site.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE & COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
Case No.

33. In addition, recent observations and USGS tracking data show that federally-listed
2 Golden Eagles frequently travels through Proctor Valley and forages in the DRA Project site.

3 Recent scientific literature indicates that Golden Eagles are particularly sensitive to
4 development; for instances, houses, roads, and infrastructure can cause Golden Eagles to vacate
5 nearby areas. Development in Proctor Valley would result in the loss of important eagle
6 foraging habitat and the San Miguel Mountain/Rancho San Diego eagle territory, shrinking
7 available habitat in San Diego County significantly.

8 34. The western spadefoot toad, a state species of special concern, is also present in
9 Proctor Valley. This brown and green amphibian requires shallow, temporary pools or streams
10 during breeding season, many of which are present on or near the DRA Project site.
11 II. The Multiple Species Conservation Program

12 35. In response to ongoing threats to federal and state listed endangered species and
13 continued development pressures, CDFW and USFWS prepared the MSCP for San Diego
14 County. The MSCP is a joint federal Habitat Conservation Plan and state Natural Community
15 Conservation Plan. The MSCP established mechanisms to ensure the survival and recovery of
16 certain federally and state listed species while providing the County with limited "take"
17 authorization pursuant to the federal Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C. section 1531 et seq.,
18 and the California Endangered Species Act, Fish and Game Code section 2050 et seq. Notably,
19 the MSCP does not cover some sensitive species found on the DRA Project site, including the
20 Quino checkerspot butterfly and the western spadefoot toad.
21 36. To implement the MSCP in the vicinity of the DRA Project, CDFW worked with
22 the County, the City of Chula Vista, and the USFWS to prepare a MSCP Subarea Plan. The
23 DRA Project is located within the "South County Segment" of the Subarea Plan.
24 37. CDFW approved the County's take permit pursuant to the Natural Community
25 Conservation Program Act (Fish and Game Code § 2800 et seq.) on March 17, 1998. CDFW
26 also entered into an "Implementing Agreement" with the County to establish the entities' roles
27 and responsibilities for carrying out the MSCP and Subarea Plan.

28
10
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE & COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
Case No.

38. The MSCP and the Subarea Plan includes an open space preserve system that
2 differs from the one originally approved by the County as part of the County's General Plan
3 (specifically, in the Otay Ranch Subregional Plan). Among other things, the MSCP expanded
the preserve system to include approximately 200 acres of central Proctor Valley (known as PV-
1, PV-2, and PV-3) in exchange for allowing for increased development in other areas. PV-1,

6 PV-2, and PV-3 are designated in the Subarea Plan as "no take authorized" and "Otay Ranch
7 Areas Where No 'Take Permits' Will be Issued, " and are identified in the MSCP Subregional
Plan and its EIR as "100 percent conserved," meaning such lands fall within the designated
9 "Hardline Preserve" area. In exchange designating these and other lands as Preserve, the MSCP
10 allowed expanded development footprints, increased residential density and/or reduced Preserve
11 in Otay Ranch Villages 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10 and 11, areas in which the City of Chula Vista
12 subsequently permitted development.

13 39. The EIR prepared for the MSCP also establishes preservation of PV-1, PV-2 and
14 PV-3 as mitigation for the impacts of the development authorized by the MSCP.
15 III. History of the Village 14 and DRA Projects.

16 40. Jackson Pendo has been interested in acquiring the Rancho Jamul Ecological
17 Reserve for development for a number of years. Before submitting its Village 14 proposal to the
18 County, Jackson Pendo contacted CDFW regarding a proposed land exchange, which would
19 involve Jackson Pendo's acquisition and development of lands within the Rancho Jamul
20 Ecological Reserve. By letter dated July 22, 2016, CDFW informed Jackson Pendo that it "must
21 decline [the] proposal," citing its determination that the proposed land exchange would not
22 result in a net conservation benefit.

23 41. Lacking access to Rancho Jamul, Jackson Pendo submitted an application for the
24 Village 14 Project in November 2016. Village 14 is proposed as a sprawling residential
25 community located on a 1,284-acre site, with 1,119 single-family homes and "ranchettes,"
26 10,000 square feet of commercial space, and associated development. The proposed Village 14
27 Project did not include development on Rancho Jamul Ecological Reserve.

28

11
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE & COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
Case No.

42. Between December 15, 2016 and January 23, 2017, the County circulated a notice
a 2 of preparation ("NOP") for a Draft Environmental Impact Report for Village 14. CDFW
3 commented on the NOP, noting that the development footprint included PV-1, PV-2, and PV-3,

4

Un which were designated in the MSCP Subarea Plan as "Otay Ranch Areas Where No 'Take

6 Permits' Will Be Issued." CDFW also commented that a proposed alternative involving
development on Rancho Jamul would not be feasible.

7 43. On March 1, 2018, the County released the draft environmental impact report
8 ("DEIR") for the Village 14 Project. Despite CDFW's comments on the NOP, the document
9 defined the project as the development of Village 14, 16 and 19 (including PV-1, PV-2, and PV-
10 3) with up to 1,119 single-family residential units.

11 44.

12 On Aril 16, 2018, EHL submitted extensive comments on the DEIR. For instance:

a. EHL commented that the proposed development of least 340 new homes in
13 PV-1, PV-2, and PV-3 conflicted with the MSCP and associated Subarea Plan.

14 b. EHL noted that approval of Village 14 in this configuration would require
15 modification of mitigation measures established for the MSCP, specifically related to protection
16 of PV-1, PV-2, and PV-3.

17 C. EHL commented on the many ways the DEIR failed to adequately analyze,
18 mitigate, and avoid direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts to biological resources, including
19 the western spadefoot toad, the Quino checkerspot butterfly, the Golden Eagle, and other
20 sensitive flora and fauna.

21 d. EHL noted that any land exchange alternative, involving development of
22 the Rancho Jamul Ecological Reserve, was infeasible given CDFW's stated unwillingness to
23 transfer the property.
24 45. Numerous other agencies, organizations, and individuals also commented on the
25 DEIR. For instance, CDFW submitted extensive comments on the Village 14 Project's conflict
26 with the MSCP and Subarea Plan, as well as its likely adverse impacts on many special status
27 plants and animals.

28
12
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE & COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
Case No.

46. In September 2018, the County released the Final EIR ("FEIR") for the Village 14
2 Project. Despite the significant and fundamental flaws identified in the DEIR, the FEIR

3 contained only limited revisions. The Village 14 Project's key components remained unchanged.

47. On October 19, 2018, the County Planning Commission considered the Village 14

5 Project, ultimately voting 5-1 to recommend approval.

48. On November 26, 2018, Mr. Bonham wrote to the County regarding a proposal to
7 | "condition" approval of the Village 14 project on future amendments to the MSCP to remove
8 the PV-1, PV-2, and PV-3 Preserve and "No Take" designations. Mr. Bonham stated that the
9 MSCP and Subarea Plan do not authorize the County to conditionally approve development of
10 the Village 14 Project and PV-1, PV-2, and PV-3 through a non-MSCP process. Instead, Mr.
11 Bonham stated that to develop PV-1, PV-2, and PV-3, the County and project developer would
12 have to pursue an amendment to the MSCP before the County considered the Village 14 Project.
13 49. On December 21, 2018, EHL sent a letter to CDFW regarding development of
14 PV-1, PV-2, and PV-3. EHL explained that amendments to such designated preserve areas, as
15 suggested by CDFW, would require a major amendment to the MSCP.

16 50. On March 19, 2019, Mr. Bonham sent a letter to the County offering to meet
17 directly with members of the Board "to try to find a path forward." Mr. Bonham stated that "the
18 most appropriate and preferred approach to address development on PV-1, PV-2 and PV-3
19 [would be] through a major amendment process" to the MSCP. Mr. Bonham also reiterated his
20 concern that the County's proposed approach of merely conditioning approval of the Village 14
21 Project on a future amendment to the MSCP was unlawful.

22 51. On March 20, 2019, EHL sent a letter to CDFW mirroring some of these concerns.
23 Specifically, EHL raised legal and practical issues associated with the County's proposal to
24 condition approval of the Village 14 Project on a future MSCP amendment.

25 52. In mid-May 2019, the County set the Village 14 Project for hearing before the
26 Board of Supervisors on June 26, 2019.
27

28

13
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE & COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
Case No.

F 53: On June 19, 2019, EHL submitted further comments outlining the continued flaws
2 in the County's FEIR and the Village 14 Project's ongoing inconsistencies with state law and
3 relevant plans.

4 54. On or around June 19, 2019, the County for the first time made public that, in

5 addition to considering the Village 14 Project analyzed in the EIR, the County would also be
6 considering approval of the DRA. According to the staff report, all parties intended that the
7 Agreement would "memorialize the parties' discussions regarding the process for extending take
8 authorizations and addressing issues related to the MSCP.3

9 55. On information and belief, none of these discussions occurred in a public forum.
10 56. The DRA obligates the CFDW to facilitate approval of a completely reconfigured
11 project, which had never been disclosed to the public or analyzed under CEQA. The Agreement,
12 while woefully sparse on details, would allow development of PV-2 and portions of PV-3, while
13 also allowing Jackson Pendo to acquire and develop portions of the Rancho Jamul Ecological
14 Reserve. The Agreement obligates CFDW to place deeds to the reserve property into escrow,
15 and to close on the transfer to Jackson Pendo, subject-only to future approval by WCB. The
16 Agreement further requires CFDW to take actions to support and implement the DRA Project
17 and prohibits CFDW from taking any actions that would interfere with the timely
18 implementation of the DRA Project.

19 57. EHL and CBD objected to the Agreement in letters to CDFW on June 25, 2019.
20| Specifically, EHL and CDB commented that:
21 a. The Agreement obligated CDFW to take certain steps with respect to the
22 DRA Project, including applying for a land conservation evaluation with the Wildlife
23 Conservation Board to transfer lands within the Rancho Jamul Ecological Preserve to Jackson
24 Pendo and approving a revised tentative map. As the Agreement effectively surrenders CDFW's
25 future discretion to reject the DRA Project, approval of the Agreement is a project pursuant to
26 CEQA and requires CDFW compliance with its mandates.
27 b. The DRA Project would lead to greater environmental harm than the
28 original Village 14 Project. As CDFW commented in 2016, transfer and development of the
14
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE & COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
Case No.

Rancho Jamul Ecological Reserve lands would result in degradation of lands that were actively
2 achieving the conservation goals for which they were acquired.

3 58. On June 26, 2019, the County voted 3-2 to approve both the Village 14 Project

4 and the Agreement.

59. On June 27, 2019, Director Charlton H. Bonham executed the Agreement on
6 behalf of CDFW. On information and belief, CDFW prepared no CEQA documents related to
7 approval of the Agreement.

8 60. On information and belief, CFDW did not prepare or file a notice of exemption,
9 notice of determination, or other notice related to CEQA compliance.

10 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

11 Violations of 2A - Against All Respondents
12 (Public Resources Code § 21000 et seq; State CEQA Guidelines; CCP §§ 1085, 1094.5)
13 61. Petitioners hereby reallege and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs
14 in their entirety.

15 62. On June 27, 2019, Mr. Bonham executed the DRA on behalf of CDFW. Entering
16 into the Agreement is a project pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act. See
17 CEQA Guidelines § 15378. Specifically, the Agreement obligates CDFW to transfer the Rancho
18 Jamul Ecological Reserve lands to Jackson Pendo subject only to future actions outside of its
19 control, and further requires CDFW to take actions to support and implement the DRA Project,
20 and to refrain from taking actions that would interfere with the timely implementation of that
21 project.

22 63. CDFW has therefore committed to actions that have the potential to cause direct
23 and indirect physical changes in the environment, specifically those related to the development
24 of the DRA Project. The DRA Project includes development of the Rancho Jamul Ecological
25 Reserve, biologically rich area set aside for permanent preservation. In addition, the DRA
26 Project authorizes development of PV-2 and a portion of PV-3, despite their preservation
27 designations in the MSCP, Subarea Plan, and EIR. By approving the DRA, the CDFW took final
28
15
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE & COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
Case No.

action to approve a sale of the Rancho Jamul lands and took the first step toward committing
2 itself to amendment to the MSCP to conform to the MRA Project.

3 64. On information and belief, CDFW took no steps to comply with CEQA prior to

4 entering into the Agreement. It did not prepare or make available to the public any

5 environmental document, make any necessary findings or statements of overriding

6 consideration, or otherwise comply with CEQA's specific, procedural obligations.

7 65. While the DRA states that CDFW anticipates relying on the FEIR certified by the

8 County for the Village 14 Project in the future, CDFW did not rely on the FEIR to approve the
9 Agreement. On information and belief, CDFW did not certify that it reviewed and considered
10 the information in the FEIR, did not adopt related CEQA findings or a statement of overriding
11 considerations, or file a notice of determination or other notice for its approval of the
12 Agreement. In addition, the FEIR for the Village 14 Project did not analyze the environmental
13 impacts of the DRA Project.
14 66. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents prejudicially abused their
15 discretion and failed to proceed in the manner required by law by entering into the DRA without
16 complying with the requirements of CEQA. Respondents' approval of the Agreement must be
17 set aside.

18 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

19 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for judgment as follows:
20 1. Alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing CDFW and Mr. Bonham to
21 vacate and set aside their approval of the Agreement;
22 2. Alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing CDFW and Mr. Bonham to
23 comply with the requirements of CEQA and to take any other action as required by Public
24 Resources Code section 21168.9;

25 3. For a temporary stay, temporary restraining order, and preliminary and permanent
26 injunctions restraining CDFW, Mr. Bonham, and Real Parties in Interest and their agents,
27 servants, and employees, and all others acting in concert with CDFW and/or Mr. Bonham on
28 their behalf, from taking any action to implement the Agreement, pending full compliance with
16

Case No.

the requirements of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines;

2 4. For costs of the suit;

3 5. An order awarding Petitioner its attorneys' fees under Code of Civil Procedure
4 section 1021.5 and other applicable authority; and

6. For such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
