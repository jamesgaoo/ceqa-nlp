Crulcher LLP VERIFIED SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

l Petitioner and Plaintiff HERITAGE FIELDS EL TORO, LLC, a Delaware limited liability

2 company (hereafter "Heritage Fields"), brings this action on its own behalf, on behalf of the general

3 public, and in the public interest, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 and Public
Resources Code section 21168 or, in the alternative, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section

5 1085 and Public Resources Code section 21168.5. Heritage Fields alleges as follows:

6 INTRODUCTION

1. In defiance of repeated pleas that the County of Orange (the "County") refrain from

8 taking actions that threaten the successful completion of the master-planned Orange County Great
Park (the "OC Great Park"), and in clear violation of the California Environmental Quality Act,
10 Public Res. Code Sections 21000 et seq. ("CEQA"), on November 14, 2017, the Orange County

11 Board of Supervisors approved the EI Toro 100-Acre Development Plan (the "Lowe Development
12 Plan" or "Project" or "100-Acre Parcel"), certified the inadequate Final Program Environmental
13 Impact Report No. 620 for the El Toro 100-Acre Parcel Development Plan (the "EIR"), adopted an
14 inadequate Statement of Overriding Considerations for the EIR, and authorized execution of a Master

15 Ground Lease with Lowe Enterprises Real Estate Group ("Lowe"), a California corporation. These

16 approvals are collectively referred to in this Complaint as the "Project Approvals." The County filed
17 the Notice of Determination on November 14, 2017.

18 2. The approximately 100 acres that the County proposes to lease to Lowe were, or will
19 be, conveyed by Heritage Fields to the City of Irvine ("City"), and in turn by the City, at no cost, to

20 the County for the land, as part of the overall Great Park transaction in the early 2000's that allowed
21 the former Marine Corps facility at El Toro to be transformed into commercial and residential

22 development and more than a thousand acres of public parks. The approximately 100 acres set aside
23 for the County were intended to be utilized for County-related uses, as a public benefit, and have
24 been so designated in the City-approved plans and CEQA documents prepared with respect to the OC
25 Great Park. In contrast to this intended purpose, the Project Approvals now allow Lowe, a private
26 real estatè developer, to build One Million (1,000,000) square feet of new private office development,
27 One Thousand Nine Hundred Ninety-Eight (1,998) private dwelling units, Two Hundred Thousand
28 (200,000) square feet of private retail uses, and Two Hundred Forty-Two (242) private hotel rooms,

Gibson, Dunn & 2
Crutcher LLP VERIFIED SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

adjacent to the OC Great Park, within the jurisdictional boundaries of the City. In total disregard for
established principles of California law, the County determined that the Development Plan was
3 exempt from the City's General Plan, the County's General Plan, the City's Zoning Code, the

4 County's Zoning Code, approval by any planning commission, and all other public hearing and
notice provisions of the City and County. Accordingly, the Project was analyzed and approved

6 without any consideration or review by any planning commission or without even sO much as a single
7 noticed public hearing by a City or County planning commission.

3. In other words, the County contends that the Lowe Development Plan alone is exempt
from all standards and procedures applicable to every other development in the State of California.
10 In making this erroneous determination, the County compounded the error by failing to analyze in the
11 EIR the significant land use incompatibilities created by allowing the Project's commercial and
12 residential development to replace the originally approved public and institutional uses. Not only is
13 the Project inconsistent with the current zoning in the City of Irvine, it is also inconsistent with the
14 requirements of "Measure W" (a citizens' initiative approved by the voters of the County in 2002,
15 which reserved the subject property for open space and public/educational uses). None of these land
16 use inconsistencies were disclosed or analyzed in the EIR as required by CEQA.

17 4. Moreover, the EIR failed to respond to comments to raised by Heritage Fields and other
18 concerned members of the public, failed to make a good-faith effort at disclosure as required by
19 CEQA, ignored applicable City and County park land standards, improperly segmented
20 environmental review, improperly deferred mitigation measures, misrepresented the true provisions
21 of Lowe's Development Plan, and failed to recirculate the EIR as required by CEQA despite
22 revealing new significant traffic impacts and a complete reversal of the EIR's analysis of greenhouse
23 gas emissions just 10 days before the County Board of Supervisors approved the Project.
24 5. Beyond these myriad violations of CEQA, the unequivocally private uses approved by
25 the County violate the express language and clear intent of the 2003 City and County Pre-Annexation
26 Agreement (*Pre-Annexation Agreement"), which agreement reserved the subject property for
27 government uses, such as a Youth and Family Resource Center, an animal shelter, childcare facilities,
28 law enforcement training facilities, and an emergency shelter. The County has also violated the Pre-

Gibson, Dunn &
Crutcher LLP VERIFIED SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 Annexation Agreement because it has approved the Project without a current, enforceable, binding

2 commitment obligating the County to pay its fair share of mitigation and infrastructure expenses, as

3 required by provision of the agreement intended to benefit future users of the area such as Heritage

4 Fields, the landowner and master developer of the nearby Great Park Neighborhoods.

S 6. The Project is in the City's Great Park area, which is carefully governed by multiple

6 agreements, including the City's Amended and Restated Development Agreement ("ARDA"), with,

7 inter alia, Heritage Fields. In the context of the ARDA, the City and Heritage Fields have allocated

8 responsibility for the funding and completion of the infrastructure and park improvements required to
bring the vision of the Orange County voters, to have a world-class public park, to fruition. The

10 ARDA balances many interests. Among other things, it requires the City to construct a largc-scale

11 public park in compliance with the Great Park Master Plan. The ARDA is premised on the

12 recognition that there is a finite amount of traffic capacity to accommodate future development, and a

13 finite number of infrastructure improvements to create that capacity. The available traffic capacity

14 must accommodate both the buildout of the OC Great Park and the private development that was

15 approved as part of the OC Great Park planning process, in order to fund the dedication and

16 contribution of $200 million toward the construction of the OC Great Park. As memorialized in

17 Exhibit L of the ARDA, the County's 100 acres were designated for 300,000 square feet of

18 "institutional" development, and therefore expected to utilize only the traffic capacity needed to

19 accommodate the list of public/institutional uses provided for in the Pre-Annexation Agreement

20 between the County and the City. The County never disputed the substance of Exhibit Lor the

21 assumptions in the 2003 EIR prepared in connection with the OC Great Park. The amount of

22 development associated with the Project requires far more traffic capacity than was assumed in the
23 2003 EIR for the OC Great Park, or in the ARDA. If the County improperly utilizes the trips needed
24 for completion of the OC Great Park by building the Project, the City will not be able to fulfill its
25 contractual commitment to Heritage Fields. By executing contracts for the Lowe Development Plan
26 and Ground Lease and insisting that the City rezone the County's property for the dense private-use
27 Project inconsistent with the Property's permitted uses and the Overlay Plan included as Exhibit L in
28 the ARDA, the County has committed acts of governance that intentionally interfere with the ARDA

Gibson, Dunn l 4
Crutcher LLP VERIFIED SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

such that the City will be unable to construct the OC Great Park as required by the ARDA, or meet its

2 other obligations with respect to Heritage Fields.

3 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

7. This Court has jurisdiction over the writ action under section 1094.5 of the Code of

5 Civil Procedure and section 21168 of the Public Resources Code.

6 8. This Court also has jurisdiction over the writ action under section 1085 of the Code of
Civil Procedure, and section 21168.5 of the Public Resources Code.

8 9. Venue for this action was properly laid in the Orange County Superior Court because

9 the property on which the Lowe Development Plan is located is in the County of Orange.

10 10. Venue for this action is now properly before the Sacramento Superior Court because

11 on April 16, 2018, the Orange County Superior Court transferred this case along with all the related

12 cases to the Sacramento Superior Court, after granting the City of Irvine's Motion to Transfer Venue
13 pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 394(a).

14 11. This petition is timely filed in accordance with Public Resources Code section 21167

15 and CEQA Guidelines section 15112.

16 PARTIES

17 12. Petitioner and Plaintiff HERITAGE FIELDS EL TORO, LLC is the owner of land

18 within the former Marine Corps Air Station El Toro Property ("MCAS EI Toro Property"), portions

19 of which are immediately adjacent to the 100-Acre Parcel on which the Project would be constructed

20 (the "Property"). Heritage Fields is also the master developer of the Great Park Neighborhoods,

21 which is also within the boundaries of the former MCAS El Toro Property. Heritage Fields

22 purchased the MCAS El Toro Property from the United States Department of the Navy, and as part of

23 the original entitlement process, Heritage Fields conveyed more than 1,100 acres of former MCAS EI

24 Toro Property to the City and contributed substantial financial resources toward the coordinated

25 development of a great metropolitan park, now known as the "Orange County Great Park," that is

.' 26 intended to provide cultural, athletic, recreational, agricultural and aesthetic amenities to residents

27 throughout Southern California. Heritage Fields, which is an intended beneficiary of the Pre-

28 Annexation. Agreement, is directly and adversely affected by development that does not contribute its

Gibson, Dunn 8 5
Crutcher LLP VERIFIED SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 fair share toward park land, roadway, infrastructure, and other public improvements, and that would

2 be incompatible with the significant investments Heritage Fields has made to building the Orange
3 County Great Park and Great Park Neighborhoods.

4 13. On information and belief, Respondent and Defendant COUNTY OF ORANGE is a

5 political subdivision of the State of California, and is the lead agency under CEQA for the Project.

6 14. On information and belief, Real Party in Interest and Defendant LOWE
7 ENTERPRISES REAL ESTATE GROUP ("Lowe"), a California corporation, would be the master

8 developer of the Property and would be the lessee under the Master Lease pursuant to which Lowe is
responsible for "the master planning, entitlement, and infrastructure development for the Property,

10 entitling and developing the Property for its highest, best and most economically viable use."
11 15. The names and capacities, whether corporate, individual, or otherwise, of Defendants

12 Does through 100, inclusive, are unknown to Heritage Fields at this time. Heritage Fields therefore

13 sues these Defendants, and cach of them, by such fictitious names. Heritage Fields will seek leave of
14 court to amend this complaint to show the true names and capacities of the Doe Defendants when

15 they are fully ascertained. Heritage Fields is informed and believes that the Doe Defendants are

16 responsible and liable to Heritage Fields for the events, happenings and occurrences set forth herein.
17 STATEMENT OF FACTS

18 16. Following the decision by the Department of the Navy in 1993 to close the nearly
19 4,700-acre Marine Corps Air Station El Toro, the County sought to pursue a large-scale commercial
20 airport on the MCAS EI Toro property. Instead, to ensure that Orange County would receive a
21 regional park, the voters of Orange County decisively halted the County's plan by approving Measure
22 W on March 5, 2002. Measure W changed the allowed reuse of the MCAS EI Toro to a plan
23 consisting exclusively of educational, recreational, open space, cultural and other public uses as long
24 as the land remained unincorporated. To guarantee that the Board of Supervisors would honor those
25 plans, Measure W enshrined those protections in the County General Plan and required that any
26 change of that designation while the land remained unincorporated must be submitted to a vote of the

27 people.

Gibson, Dunn 8 Crutcher LLP 6
VERIFIED SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 17. In 2003, the City, the former Irvine Redevelopment Agency, and the County entered

2 into a Pre-Annexation Agreement, which was intended to facilitate the City's annexation of the vast

3 majority of the former MCAS El Toro Property, and the ultimate transfer of the land to future owners
T and developers of the MCAS El Toro Property (the role ultimately secured by Heritage Fields after it

5 purchased the MCAS EI Toro Property). To achieve that end, the Pre-Annexation Agreement

6 provided that:

7 The County agrees to pay its fair share of costs as part of the funding mechanism [City] was to set up to fund the costs of building "necessary 8 infrastructure and related improvements." (Section 2.2.5.)
[City] will provide "through a Development Agreement between Irvine and
10 the purchaser(s) of El Toro property" (now Heritage Fields) for the conveyance of certain parcels to the County in the manner prescribed in the Pre-Annexation Agreement. (Section 2.2.3.4.) 11
The City and County would "agree to cooperate and work together with the 12 Navy to cause the expeditious transfer of the El Toro property." (Section 4.)
13 18. In exchange for the County's agreement to allow the City to annex the vast majority of

14 the former MCAS El Toro Property, the City agreed to zone the 100-Acre Parcel for the "exclusive
15 use of the County or its designees, lessees, or concessionaires .. . to construct and operate permitted

16 uses and facilities." (Section 2.2.3.1.)

17 19. Section 2.2.4 of the Pre-Annexation Agreement further provides that "Irvine will zone

18 County's parcels and designate them in Irvine's General Plan, in accordance with County direction."

19 In addition, the "County shall retain exclusive land use control over [its parcels within the MCAS EI

20 Toro Property], and shall be entitled to place any development upon said parcels that County shall

21 determine to be desirable for County's needs, as though said property remained unincorporated,

22 without the obligations for payment to Irvine of any permit fees or other mitigation/impact fees, other
23 than in Section 2.2.5, including but not limited to the following uses, all of which Irvine agrees with:

24 Animal shelter; Environmental health facilities; Automotive / equipment repair facilities; childcare
25 facilities; youth and family resource center; Law enforcement training facilities; emergency shelter;

26 Transitional shelter care facility; Children & Family Services Center; Business offices; Warehouses;
Field 27 Storage facilities; Vehicle parking and storage facilities; Heavy equipment and storage;

28 operations and maintenance facility.'

7 Gibson, Ounn &
Ciutcher LLP VERIFIED SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

20. On information and belief, the City has already fulfilled this obligation by zoning the
2 100-Acre Parcel as an Institutional Use that allows every one of the permitted uses required by the

3 Pre-Annexation Agreement.

4 21. Consistent with the process first established by the Pre-Annexation Agreement, the

5 City and the purchaser of the MCAS El Toro Property (Heritage Fields) entered into a Development

6 Agreement dated as of July 12, 2005 governing the future development of the MCAS EI Toro

7 Property. The Development Agreement was subsequently amended and restated in December 2010

8 in the ARDA. Both the original development agreement and the ARDA were adopted pursuant to
Section 65864 et seq. of the California Government Code (the "Development Agreement Statute"),

10 which authorizes a local agency to vest a property owner's development rights on its property in

11 accordance with the land use regulations and zoning/land use designations applicable at the time the
12 development agreement was entered into. At the time the original development agreement and the

13 ARDA were entered into, the zoning designation applicable to the 100-Acre Parcel was the
14 Institutional Zoning contemplated by the uses enumerated in the Pre-Annexation Agreement. By its
15 terms the ARDA only permits the 100-Acre Parcel to be used for institutional purposes. The ARDA

16 was recorded on December 27, 2010 by Heritage Fields against that portion of the 100-Acre Property
17 that was conveyed by the Navy to Heritage Fields before that property was conveyed by Heritage
18 Fields to the City. Heritage Fields' conveyance of the property to the City was made subject to the
19 land use restrictions in the ARDA. The City subsequently conveyed that portion of the 100-Acre
20 Parcel to the County subject to the land use restrictions set forth in the ARDA.

21 22. Section 7.9 of the ARDA further acknowledged the County's obligation set forth in
22 the Pre-Annexation Agreement to pay for its fair share of infrastructure improvements, required the
23 City to actively enforce these provisions of the Pre-Annexation Agreement, and recognized the fact
24 that nothing in the Development Agreement should be deemed as a "waiver by Heritage Fields of any
25 rights Heritage Fields" has against the County with respect to enforcing the Pre-Annexation
26 Agreement.

27 23. In 2006, the County acknowledged the limited uses to which the 100-Acre Parcel may
28 be put, writing to the Orange County Grand Jury that:

Gibson, Dunn 8
Crutcher LLP VERIFIED SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Irvine agreed to the County sharing in a certain percentage of the property taxes as well as receipt of certain parcels of property, totaling approximately 240 acres to be used for certain County purposes such as a Youth and Family Resource Center, an animal shelter, childcare facilities, law enforcement training facilities, and an emergency shelter.
24. Eight years after this admission and more than 10 years after the Pre-Annexation
Agreement was enacted, on January 28, 2014, the County Board of Supervisors approved a
Disposition and Development Agreement with Lowe to develop both the County's 100-Acre Parcel,
and a nearby parcel of land also conveyed to the County pursuant to the Pre-Annexation Agreement
(the other parcel is commonly known as the "West Alton Parcel"). On information and belief, Lowe

9 proceeded to create a Development Plan (the "Lowe Development Plan") that would allow for the

10 development of private offices, private dwellings, private retail and private hotel uses on both those

11 parcels.

12 25. A Notice of Preparation of a Draft Program EIR was released by the County and was

13 filed with the State Clearinghouse on November 7, 2014. The Draft EIR was released for the

14 minimum required review period on November 4, 2016. Twenty-six comment letters-including one

15 by Heritage Fields-were submitted within the comment period raising myriad defects with the EIR,

16 including but not limited to a failure to (i) accurately identify the proper land use jurisdiction over the

17 100-Acre Parcel, (ii) adequately mitigate significant impacts to parks and recreational uses in

18 neighboring jurisdictions, (iii) accurately disclose inconsistencies with applicable land use and air

19 quality regulations, (iv) properly mitigate traffic impacts, (v) properly analyze, disclose and mitigate

20 air quality and greenhouse gas emission impacts, and (vi) properly mitigate against impacts to the

21 adjacent wildlife corridor.

22 26. On November 3, 2017 (six business days before the Board of Supervisors certified the

23 Final EIR and approved the Project), the County released a Final EIR consisting of 1,328 pages of

24 responses to comments and 14,681 pages of new attachments.

25 27. Buried in these documents was a brand-new disclosure that the recommended Project

26 would create new significant traffic impacts never before disclosed in the Draft EIR and a complete

27 reversal of its conclusions with respect to greenhouse gas emissions.

28

Gibson, Dunn : 9
Crutcher LLP VERIFIED SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

28. Omitted from these documents was any substantive County response to the objection
2 raised repeatedly by numerous commentersincluding Heritage Fields--that the EIR's assumption

3 that the County, and not the City, has land use jurisdiction over the Project is incorrect as a matter of

4 law. Therefore, the County has not proceeded in a manner according to law, in violation of CEQA.
29. On November 14, 2017, after hearing objections to the Lowe Development Plan from
dozens of public speakers and receiving numerous additional comment letters reiterating previous

7 objections and identifying new failures to comply with CEQA arising from the Final EIR's responses

8 to comments, one member of the Board of Supervisors asked a representative of County Counsel
whether any case law supported the County EIR's assertion that the County-and not the City--held
10 land use authority over the 100-Acre Parcel. The County Counsel informed the Supervisors that no

I1 case law supported the County EIR's position. The County Board of Supervisors then stopped asking
12 questions, certified the EIR, adopted the Statement of Overriding Considerations, and approved the

13 Lowe Development Plan.

14 30. A Notice of Determination was filed by the County on November 14, 2017.

15 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

16 31. Heritage Fields jected to the Project in the administrative proceedings, and fully

17 exhausted its administrative remedies, including by submitting at least three letters raising issues with
18 the adequacy of the EIR and objections to the legally flawed process.

19 32. Either Heritage Fields or other commenters in the CEQA administrative process raised

20 all factual and legal issues asserted under CEQA in this Petition. Heritage Fields has thus exhausted
21 all administrative remedies available to it, or such exhaustion is otherwise futile.

22 33. Heritage Fields has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.5 by
23 providing the County with notice of its intention to commence the action. Proof of service of the

24 is notice is attached as Exhibit 1. A copy of this Second Amended Petition will be sent by registered
25 mail to the Attorney General of the State of California.
26 34. Heritage Fields elects to prepare the administrative record. A copy of that election is

27 attached as Exhibit 2.

Gibson, Dunn & 10
Crutcher VERIFIED SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

35. While the County had already indicated that it would litigate the issues contained
herein, on February 26, 2018, Heritage Fields delivered a letter to the Clerk of the Board of
Supervisors consistent with the provisions of Government Code section 910 et seq., which provided
the requisite notice to the County. A true and correct copy of the letter dated February 26, 2018 is
attached hereto as Exhibit 3. On March 29, 2018, Heritage Fields submitted a Claim for Money or
Damages Against the County of Orange (pursuant to Government Code section 910 et seq.) (the
"Claim Form"). No response has been received. A true and correct copy of the Claim Form is

attached hereto as Exhibit 4.

9 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

10 (Violations of the California Environmental Quality Act Against Respondent County of
11 Orange and Real Party in Interest Lowe Enterprises)
12 36. Heritage Fields incorporates paragraphs 1 through 35 of this Petition and Complaint as
13 though fully set forth herein.

14 The EIR Fails to Accurately Describe the Land Use Jurisdiction Applicable to the
15 Project and Fails to Make a Good-Faith Effort to Disclose Conflicts with Applicable
16 General Plan and Zoning Ordinances

17 37. An accurate, stable and finite project description is indispensable to an informative
18 and legally sufficient EIR. CEQA Guidelines Section 15124(d) requires the project description to
19 include a statement describing the intended uses of the EIR, including "*a list of the agencies that are
20 expected to use the EIR in their decision making" and "a list of permits and other approvals required
21 to implement the project."

22 38. The EIR at issue in this action failed to accurately identify the "list of the agencies that
23 are expected to use the EIR in their decision making" and "a list of permits and other approvals
24 required to implement the project," and thus the Project Description is inadequate.
25 39. CEQA requires that a lead agency conduct an adequate environmental review prior to
26 approving a discretionary project. This duty includes an obligation to make a good-faith effort at full
27 disclosure to the public of all significant environmental effects that may occur as a result of the
28 Project.

Gibson, Dunn 8 I1 Cruichor LLP VERIFIED SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

40. The EIR fails to make good-faith effort at fully disclosing the Project's "conflicts

2 with applicable land use plan[s], polic[ies] and regulation[s]," as required by Significance Threshold

3 4.9-1. The EIR's failure to accurately describe this impact renders both the EIR-and the Statement

4 of Overriding Considerations-inadequate and in violation of CEQA.

5 41. Any sufficient analysis of the Project's consistency with applicable land use controls

6 requires the EIR to identify which land use controls apply. The EIR took the unsupportable position
that the Project is exempt from any land use requirements, including but not limited to City and

8 County general plan and zoning requirements. (EIR, at p. 3-1.) All analysis in the EIR that flows

9 from this erroneous conclusion is necessarily flawed.

10 42. The EIR exacerbates the lack of analysis of land use incompatibilities by failing to
11 disclose the Project's fundamental inconsistency with Measure W. If, as the County asserts, the
12 language of the Pre-Annexation Agreement stating that the 100-Acre Parcel is to be treated "as

13 though it is unincorporated" is correct, Measure W (and all other provisions of the County General

14 Plan) must apply. And, as noted in the recitals to the Pre-Annexation Agreement, Measure W applied
15 open space and public use land use designations to the Property. The Lowe Development Plan

16 complies with none of these use restrictions and none of these development standards. The EIR
l7 never discloses this fact.

18 43. Alternatively, if the Property is not subject to Measure W, the Property is subject to
19 City "TTOD" Zoning. The EIR did not fully or accurately identify the Project's inconsistency with
20 the TTOD Zoning, and thus failed to make the good-faith effort at disclosure required by CEQA.
21 44. Because the EIR sometimes claims that the Project is exempt from County General
22 Plan standards (although it contradicts itself by citing to those standards when it is convenient to do

23 so), the EIR purports to analyze the Project's consistency with City land use requirements. However,

24 this analysis is incomplete and inaccurate. For example, Table 2 provided as part of Topical
25 Response 3.1.2 on page 3-4 of the Final EIR fails to disclose the fact that the Development Plan
26 allows substantial deviations from the requirements set forth in Table 2. The implication of this
27 omission is that the Development Plan standards are dramatically less restrictive than the surrounding
28 zoning and the impacts of those deviations are never disclosed. As a result of this failure, the

Gibson, Dunn & 12
Crutcher LLP VERIFIED SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 County's findings with respect to significant impacts to land use compatibility are not supported by

2 substantial evidence.

3 45. The EIR also misleadingly and selectively quotes from the Pre-Annexation Agreement

4 in an apparent attempt to argue for the County's preferred position, rather than fairly and accurately

5 disclosing impacts to members of the public and to decision makers. For example, the EIR quotes the

6 section of the Pre-Annexation Agreement stating that the County "shall be entitled to place any
7 development upon said parcels that County shall determine to be desirable for County's needs, as

8 though said property remained unincorporated, without the obligations for payment to Irvine of any
9 permit fees or other mitigation/impact fees." However, the EIR excludes the next clause of the

10 sentence, which qualifies the preceding phrase, and states that these uses include but are not limited

1I to the following, "all of which Irvine agrees with: Animal shelter; Environmental health facilities;

12 Automotive / equipment repair facilities; childcare facilities; youth and family resource center; Law

13 enforcement training facilities; emergency shelter; Transitional shelter care facility; Children &
14 Family Services Center; Business offices; Warehouses; Storage facilities; Vehicle parking and
15 storage facilities; Heavy equipment and storage; Field operations and maintenance facility." (italics
16 added.) In doing so, the EIR fails to accomplish its mandated requirements of full disclosure.
17 The EIR Fails to Adequately Respond to Public Comments

18 46. CEQA demands that the lead agency must provide written responses to comments

19 submitted during the EIR comment period, and address concerns "in detail, giving reasons why
20 specific comments and suggestions were not accepted." (CEQA Guidelines § 15088(c).)
21 47. The EIR violated this requirement by, among other instances, failing to respond to
22 Heritage Fields' comment (identified in the Final Paragraph of Comment HFET-2) that "the EIR
23 should have acknowledged the City standards and assessed the Project's environmental impacts
24 against those standards."

25 The EIR Has Impermissibly Piecemealed Analysis
26 48. CEQA Guidelines Section 15378 defines a project to mean the "whole of an action."
27 CEQA prohibits the segmenting of a project into smaller components to avoid the risk that
28

Gibson, Dunn l 13
Crulcher LLP VERIFIED SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

environmental impacts from each project segment will be "submerged," potentially leading to

2 cumulatively "disastrous consequences."

3 49. The County impermissibly splits the 100-Acre Parcel and the West Alton Parcel

4 portions of the Lowe Development Project into two separate EIRs, released just weeks apart despite

5 the fact that Lowe has the exclusive right to engage in comprehensive development scheme for both

6 the 100-Acre EI Toro Parcel and the West Alton Parcel pursuant to the same Disposition and

7 Development Agreement ("DDA") with the County.

8 50. The two property components not only share the same developer, but they are also
both located on the former MCAS El Toro Property, utilize the same roadways, and require (or, in the
10 words of the EIR, will "request") similar amendments to the same City Planning Area 51 zoning
11 regulations. They also share the same architect/master planner and contain largely parallel
12 Development Plans. Lowe's F development timeline (Exhibit F to the DDA) treats the development of
13 the 100-Acre Parcel and West Alton Parcel as a single component and even appears to anticipate a
14 single CEQA review process:

15 Lowe's Task 1 is to conduct a Site Assessment for both the 100-Acre Parcel
16 and West Alton Parcel concurrently;

17 Lowe's Task 2 is to create a (singular) "Master Plan/Specific Plan" for both the 100-Acre Parcel and West Alton Parcel concurrently;
18 Lowe's Task 3 is to evaluate infrastructure and financing for both the 100-
19 Acre Parcel and West Alton Parcel concurrently;

20 Lowe's 4 Task 4 is to conduct research and technical studies for both the 100- Acre Parcel and West Alton Parcel concurrently;
21 Lowe's Task 5 is to comply with CEQA for both the 100-Acre Parcel and
22 West Alton Parcel concurrently; and

23 Lowe's Task 6 is to gain entitlements for both the 100-Acre and Alton Parcel concurrently.
24 51. Given the integrated nature of the development plan for the two properties, the EIR
25 should have analyzed the projects on both parcels as one project, and the County's failure to conduct
26 the EIR analysis in that manner represents impermissible segmentation of a unified project.
27

Crutcher LLP VERIFIED SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 The EIR Improperly Defers Mitigation and Analysis to Subsequent Environmental

2 Reviews That May Never Occur

52. The EIR implicitly admits that the EIR fails to fully analyze the development that will
occur on the property as to several potentially significant impacts, including:
Aesthetics (pages 3-104 to 3-105 and page 3-133);
6 Traffic and access, particularly in view of equivalency provisions of the
7 Development Plan allowing conversion of one type of use to another (pages 3- 171, 3-255);

8 Light and Glare (page 3-186 to 3-187);
Shade and Shadow (page 3-188);
10 Noise Impacts (page 3-195); and
11 Public Facilities / Services (page 3-201).
12 53. The EIR justifies its failure to fully analyze the effects of the Project on two legally
13 inadequate bases: First, the EIR states that it would be "speculative" to study those details and
14 improperly attempts to hide behind the document's label as a "Program" EIR, despite applicable
15 precedent demonstrating that the label of an environmental impact report as a "project" or "program" a
16 document does not change the requirements of the analysis.

17 54. Second, the EIR also misrepresents the true nature of the Lowe Development Plan by
18 falsely stating that all future development will be subject to project-specific discretionary CEQA
19 review. In truth, Section 3.5 of the Lowe Development Plan states that "[p]ermitted uses are
20 permitted by right and do not require any type of discretionary action." Permitted uses (according to
21 the Lowe Development Plan) include--among dozens of other items-offices, hotels and residential
22 uses. Thus, the plain language of the Development Plan contradicts the assurances provided by the
23 EIR that the inadequate analysis in the EIR will be subsequently supplemented.
24 The EIR Fails to Adopt Adequate Mitigation Measures to Reduce Significant
25 Traffic Impacts
26 55. CEQA requires that mitigation measures be feasible, including with respect to legal
27 impediments.

28

Gibson, Ounn / 15 Crutcher LLP VERIFIED SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

56. In violation of this requirement, the EIR relies on transportation mitigation measures

2 that would violate current City law and the vested rights of Heritage Fields. Thus, the EIR's traffic

3 mitigation cannot be legally implemented and is therefore legally inadequate.

4 57. For example, Mitigation Measure TRAN-3 provides that the County (or its designee)

5 would conduct a "fee reallocation study" to determine a project's fair-share contribution to be paid to

6 the North Irvine Transportation Management ("NITM") Program, and that the County would cause
7 its designee to pay for its share of mitigation fees toward the List of NITM Improvements. This

8 provision violates the terms of the City of Irvine NITM Ordinance and the rights of Heritage Fields

9 codified in the Amended and Restated Development Agreement entered into between the City and
10 Heritage Fields.
11 58. NITM does not currently have a process to allow developments other than those listed
12 in the ordinance to utilize NITM. NITM functions as a closed universe intended to mitigate the
13 impacts of the scope of development approved within the NITM area prior to (or concurrent with) the
14 adoption of the NITM Program. Section 6-3-701 of the Irvine Municipal Code explicitly states that
15 the "NITM Program is not intended to fund deficiencies that may be caused by developments outside

16 of the Properties that are approved subsequent to the adoption of this chapter, subsequent regional
17 changes in traffic patterns, or subsequent circulation changes due to development outside of the
18 Properties." Thus, the fundamental premise of using the closed "NITM" system to mitigate
19 additional development is at odds with the purpose of NITM and the Irvine Municipal Code.

20 59. Ignoring these legal restrictions, the EIR would purport to have the County negotiate
21 an agreement with the City to allow it to pay for the fair-share cost of those improvements. But, to
22 allow the Lowe Development Plan to be included in the NITM properties, the NITM ordinance
23 would need to be amended. Under the ARDA, both participants in NITM--Heritage Fields and The
24 Irvine Company-would have to consent to any such amendment; and neither entity has provided its
25 consent. Yet the EIR treats this legally impossible and yet-to-be negotiated agreement as adequate
26 mitigation. Morcover, it would make no sense for Heritage Fields or The Irvine Company to allow
27 the ordinance to be amended to allow Lowe to pay its fair share, because the traffic capacity created
28 under the NITM program is intended to be utilized by development projects (including the OC Great

Gibson, Dunn 8 16
Crutcher LLP VERIFIED SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Park) sponsored by Heritage Fields and The Irvine Company. Allowing Lowe to usurp that capacity

2 only reduces the ability of Heritage Fields to build-out its previously vested development rights.

60. This mitigation measure is wholly inadequate because it does not address what
is happens if the County is unable to reach an agreement with the City or Caltrans, and the EIR does not

5 specify the contents of the agreement. This leaves the adequacy and actual terms of the mitigation

6 obligation entirely uncertain.

7 61. The requirement that the County require a future traffic study to determine fair-share

8 fee impacts is also inadequate given that Section 3.5 of the Lowe Development Plan allows permitted
uses to be built by right without "any additional discretionary review." So, the County has no actual

10 ability to require the developer to determine and then pay its fair share of traffic improvements, or to

11 require that the mitigation be in place before the development is constructed, rendering this

12 mitigation simultaneously illusory and misleading.

13 The EIR Must Be Recirculated Due to Significant New Information Added to the EIR

14 62. CEQA Guidelines Section 15088.5 requires an environmental impact report to be

15 recirculated when "significant new information is added to the EIR" after it is released for public

16 comment but before it is certified. The Guideline makes clear that information can include

17 "additional data or other information," and provides that this information is significant when "the EIR

18 is changed in way that deprives the public of a meaningful opportunity to comment upon a

19 substantial adverse environmental effect of the project or a feasible way to mitigate or avoid such an

20 effect that the project proponents have declined to implement."

21 63. These changes specifically include, among other examples, situations where there is a

22 substantial increase in the severity of an environmental impact. Where an EIR reveals a new

23 potentially significant impact, recirculation is required. Instead, 10 days before certification, the

24 Final EIR revealed, without sufficient explanation, that the Project will cause significant traffic

25 impacts at new intersections and roadway segments not previously disclosed by the Draft EIR. The

26 increase in severity to environmental impacts includes impacts to both freeway ramps and surface

27 street segments.

28

Gibson, Dunn 8 17
Crutcher LLP VERIFIED SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES,
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

64. The Final EIR also reversed the conclusion of the Draft EIR with respect to whether
the Project would cause a significant impact on greenhouse gas emissions. The Draft EIR had
concluded that there would be significant and unavoidable impacts, but the Final EIR reversed this
conclusion. The Final EIR fails to fully explain this reversal of position, thus depriving members of
the public a with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on this significant change.

65. Although the sudden change and brand-new analysis is not fully explained by the EIR,
it appears that this sudden change is based (at least in part) on the addition of Mitigation Measures
GHG-5 and GHG-6, which require the use of electric lawnmowers and leaf blowers, and require

9 additional analysis as part of subsequent development reviews. As noted above, given the plain

10 language of Development Plan Section 3.5, which states that "permitted uses are permitted by right
[1 and do not require any type of discretionary action," this mitigation measure may be entirely
12 unenforceable, and thus cannot be relied upon by the EIR to support its conclusion that the
13 greenhouse gas impacts have been mitigated to a level of less than significance.

14 66. The EIR's sudden reversal of its analysis requires recirculation so that the public and
15 decision makers will not be deprived of a meaningful opportunity to review and comment on the EIR.
16 The EIR Inaccurately Analyzes the Project's Provision of Park Land and Consistency
17 with Both City and County Park Standards

18 67. The EIR is required to evaluate significant impacts to existing park facilities that will

19 be caused by, for example, increased use of existing park facilities due to an insufficient supply of
20 parks provided by a new development. The EIR acknowledges this standard measure of evaluating
21 significant impacts by stating that the County's park standards set forth in its zoning code and other
22 land use regulations "ha[ve] been the basis to satisfy recreation impacts and evaluate potential CEQA
23 impacts for most, if not all, of the communities in South Orange County."

24 68. The EIR fails to accurately or consistently evaluate the Project's provision of park
25 land under this standard. First, Topical Response 3.1.9 (Parks) makes internally contradictory
26 interpretations of CEQA thresholds and obfuscates which standard the EIR is using to meásure

27 impacts: just seven lines before it cites to the County zoning standards as the measure of determining

28

Gibson, Dunn & 18
Crulcher LLP VERIFIED SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

a significant impact under CEQA, the Response states (at page 3-35) that "neither the City's nor the

2 County's typical park land standards apply to the proposed Project."

3 69. The Project is plainly inconsistent with the City's park standards. For instance, under
the City of Irvine Park Standards Manual, park land located within a setback is not eligible for park is

5 credit, but approximately half of the park land that the EIR takes credit for is within the required

6 latitudinal setback.

70. Contradicting its earlier statement regarding the applicable parkland standard, the EIR
goes on to claim that the Project's provision of 9.9 acres of park land meets the County's park code
requirements, and thus there cannot be a significant impact as to parks and recreation.

10 71. Exacerbating the unclear and inconsistent analysis, the EIR misrepresents the Project's

11 compliance with those standards.

12 72. • The County's General Plan Recreation Element indicates that the 2.5-acre park

13 requirement applies to "usable local park land (i.e., park land that is relatively level, served by
14 utilities, for multi-purpose playfields, court sports, etc.) for each prospective 1,000 residents." The

15 park criteria is set out in even greater detail in Appendix VII-3 of the County General Plan.

16 However, approximately 74% (7.3 acres) of the "parks" provided by the Project will be in the form of

17 what the EIR terms a "linear park." This so-called "linear park" fails to satisfy the definition of a

18 usable park in the County General Plan because it will consist only of an approximately 50-foot wide

19 landscaped trail and associated "exercise" amenities, rather than the "usable" "multi-purpose" parks

20 called for by the County General Plan. Once the 7.3. acres of landscaped trail are excluded from the

21 calculation, the Project would only provide approximately 3.4 acres of park land, a deficit of 66%

22 compared to the County park standard and a deficit of nearly 83% compared to the (proper) City park

23 standard.

24 73. These facts undermine the County's incorrect and conclusory assertion that the Project

25 complies with park standards. Thus, the EIR's assertion that the Project will cause no significant
26 impact to existing Park Facilities because it complies with County park standards is misleading and
27 not supported by substantial evidence in the record.

2 The Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations Are Unsupported by
Substantial Evidence

3 74.

4 CEQA requires that a project with significant adverse impacts be approved only if the

5 lead agency makes findings-supported by substantial evidence-that the project's benefits will

6 outweigh its adverse impacts and that there are not feasible mitigation measures or less damaging
alternatives available.

7 75.

8 Because the EIR fails to accurately identify the Project's significant impacts to

9 Recreational Facilities and Parks, Traffic, Land Use Consistency and Greenhouse Gas Emissions, the

10 County never adopted findings to justify the Project's impacts in these areas. Thus, the Statement of

11 Overriding Considerations fails to meet CEQA requirements.

76.

12 For all of the reasons set forth above, the Court should decertify the EIR and enjoin

13 the County and Lowe from taking any further action with respect to the Project, until a timely writ of

14 mandate is returned to this Court in compliance with CEQA, and the other applicable land use

15 regulations violated by Respondents' actions.

2 Heritage Fields has exhausted its administrative remedies through its participation in
the public processes preceding the approval.

3 81.

4 Heritage Fields has no plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of
law to challenge the County's actions.

Plan.

8 The City--and Only the City---Has the Authority to Approve a Private Development
Project Within Its Jurisdictional Boundaries.
10 83.
- The County asserts that the City's zoning and land use jurisdiction is inapplicable to

12 the Project due to California Government Code Sections 53090-53091, which the Draft EIR

13 incorrectly says "exempts [cities and counties] from zoning regulations when one entity owns

14 territory within the jurisdiction of another entity." However, the County fails to note that the

15 exemption from intergovernmental immunity cited by the County applies only to actions taken in a

16 governmental capacity; for actions which involve private or commercial projects, the jurisdiction in

17 which the property is located retains land use control. Thus, a state or local agency may not "extend

18 its immunity to private entrepreneurs who are involved in the local commercial market where their

19 competitors are subject to local regulation." (Board of Trustees v. City of Los Angeles (1975) 49

20 Cal.App.3d 45, 50.) Following Board of Trustees, the California Attorney General reconsidered an

21 earlier opinion (that it coincidentally had issued to the County of Orange) originally indicating a

22 relatively broad degree of immunity when one jurisdiction owned land within the boundaries of

23 another jurisdiction. Instead, the Attorney General opined that the proper view of Government Code

24 Sections 53090-91 is that these statutes do not extend immunity to "private parties with respect to

25 their own private pursuits merely because the state" (or by parity of reasoning, the County) "happens

26 to be their landlord." 68 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 114, 121. Accordingly, the Project is subject to the land

27 use jurisdiction of the City-not the County-and the County's approval of the Development Plan

28 was taken without legal authority. (See also Xavier Becerra, Opinion of the Attorney General, No.
14-403 (Dec. 6, 2018).)

Gibson, Dunn &
Crutcher LLP 21
VERIFIED SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES, •DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 84. Here, the Project is being proposed by Lowe pursuant to a disposition and

2 development agreement ("DDA") in which Lowe will be the "applicant" and "face" of the Project,

3 and is obligated to secure entitlements from relevant public agencies, minimize risks to the County,

4 and maximize potential for an extremely favorable financial return for the County.

5 85. Lowe's lead role as developer of the Project is demonstrated by the fact that the

6 Development Plan appended to the Draft EIR was prepared for Lowe and the County (and, indeed,

7 has Lowe's logo on the front cover).

8 86. The County's Ground Lease with Lowe is for a term a of 99 years, a term which

9 connotes long-term private use and ownership.

10 87. The Master Lease makes plain the fact that the County is not a partner nor in joint

I1 venture with Lowe. This is Lowe's private development project and it is therefore subject to full City
12 regulatory and land use authority, even though the County is the landlord. Section 24 of the Master

13 Lease makes clear that "it is expressly understood and agreed that [the] County docs not in any way

14 or for any purpose become a partner of or a joint venturer with [Lowe] in the conduct of [Lowe's]
15 business or otherwise." Indeed, Section 12.5 of the Master Lease would allow Lowe to make

16 recommendations for the sale of all or a portion of the property to third parties in furtherance of
17 Lowe's obligation to undertake "the master planning, entitlement, and infrastructure development for
18 the Property, entitling and developing the Property for its highest, best and most economically viable

19 use."

20 88. In other words, the Lowe Development Plan is an approval for an unequivocally
21 private development project undertaken by Lowe on a property located within the City. The County,
22 although it owns the Property, has no immunity from City jurisdiction for private projects and
23 therefore lacks the jurisdiction to authorize this development, and the City has not approved the
24 development. To the extent the County were to possess jurisdiction to approve a private development
25 project within the City (which it does not), the Project nonetheless fails to comply with the County's
26 General Plan. *

27 89. It would be a complete violation of state planning laws to have a project that need a not
28 conform to any General Plan. (E.g., East Sacramento Partnership for a Livable a City V. City of

Gibson, Dunn i 22 Crutcher VERIFIED SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 Sacramento (2016) 5 Cal.App.5th 281 ["local land use and development decisions must be consistent

2 with the applicable general plan"]; Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Board of Supervisors, 52 Cal.3d 553,

3 570 (1990) [*the propriety of virtually any local decision affecting land use and development

4 depends upon consistency with the applicable general plan and its elements"] (quoting Resource

5 Defense Fund v. County of Santa Cruz (1982) 133 Cal:App.3d 800, 806).)

6 90. Moreover, even accepting the County's demonstrably incorrect position that the

7 private Lowe Development Plan is a "public project," County development and infrastructure

8 improvements still must be consistent with adopted General Plans. (See, e.g., Friends of "B" Street

9 v. City of Haywärd (1980) 106 Cal.App.3d 988, 998 [citing Government Code section 65302's

10 requirement that a local agency must comply with specified mandatory elements of an adopted

U general plan and noting that the "Legislature did not limit this policy to decisions regarding proposed

12 private developments; it encompasses all decisions involving the future growth of the state, which

13 necessarily includes decisions by a city to proceed with public works projects. All such decisions are

14 to be guided by an effective planning process that includes the local general plan"].)

15 91. Further, to the extent that County had planning jurisdiction, the County failed to

16 submit the Lowe Development Plan for a review by and recommendation from the County's Planning

17 Commission, even though this procedural requirement is imposed on both public and private projects.

18 Section 7-9-5(a) of the Orange County Code vests the County Planning Commission with the power

19 to "recommend to the officers of the County adoption of plans and regulations for the future growth,

20 development and beautification of the County in respect to public and private development." (Italics

21 added.)

22 92. The Board of Supervisors' adoption of the Development Plan without any noticed

23 hearing or review by the Planning Commission violates Section 65453 of the California Government
24 Code, which requires specific plans (the closest analogy to the Development Plan) to be subject to

25 review by the Planning Commission. No such review occurred for the Project.

26 93. Moreover, cach of the Planning Commission and the Board of Supervisors (the

27 legislative body for the County) must hold at least one public hearing for which public notice is given

28 through publishing in a newspaper of general circulation not less than 10 days prior to the hearing.

Gibson, Dunn & 23
Crutcher LLP VERIFIED SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRJT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES,
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

(See Sections 65353-54 of the Government Code.) On information and belief, the County held no

2 public hearings and provided no notice in the form required by the Government Code.

3 94. Similarly, even if the County were to claim that the Lowe Development Plan

4 constitutes a zoning enactment other than a specific plan, Section 65853 et seq. requires the Planning
Commission to review other proposed land use ordinances at a noticed public hearing. Thus,

6 regardless of whether the County characterizes the "Lowe Development Plan" as specific plan or

7 other zoning enactment, the County failed to proceed in the manner required by law.

95. Beyond these procedural defects, the Lowe Development Plan violates the
foundational requirement that all zoning enactments and development projects be compatible with the
10 objectives, policies, general land uses, and programs specified in a General Plan. (Cal. Gov. Code, §
11 65860(a)(ii).) As emphasized by the California Supreme Court, a zoning ordinance that is
12 inconsistent with the general plan is void ab initio. (Lesher Communications, Inc. v. City of Walnut
13 Creek (1989) 262 Cal.Rptr. 337)

14 96. For example, the Lowe Development Plan is inconsistent with the provisions of
15 Measure W, a voter initiative approved in 2002 that enacted County General Plan amendments that
16 changed "the allowed reuse of MCAS El Toro to a non-aviation plan, consisting of educational,
17 recreational, open space cultural and other public uses" for so long as the area remained
18 unincorporated. In contrast, Heritage Fields' developments--subject only to the City General Plan-
19 are fully consistent with that plan.

20 97. The Measure W General Plan designation restricting the use to "educational,
21 recreational, open space cultural and other public uses" could not be modified by an action of the
22 Board of Supervisors because Section 9 of Measure W provides that "[t]he Initiative may be amended
23 only by a vote of the people at a regular election held in accordance with the requirements of the
24 California Elections Code." And, acknowledged in the Pre-Annexation Agreement, Measure W
25 applied open space designations to the Property. The one land use designation other than an "open
26 space" designation (which still does not allow the current Lowe proposal) was an "Education/Park
27 Compatible" designation, which called for long-term uses focused on educational facilities and
28 related research and development uses. That designation provided for 80% of the area to remain as

Gibgon, Duhn 8 Crutcher LLP 24
VERIFIED SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 open space, a maximum Floor to Area Ratio of 0.4, and a maximum of 45 employees per acre. The

2 Lowe Development Plan violates every one of these standards.

3 98. In short, the County's approval of the Lowe Development Plan violates Measure W by

4 enacting a land use plan wholly inconsistent with the General Plan provisions adopted by voters,

5 despite the requirement that the land use plan enacted by Measure W could only be amended by a

6 vote of the people for so long as the land remains "unincorporated."
99. The Lowe Development Plan is further inconsistent with the numeric, objective

8 standards for the provision of park land contained in the County's General Plan (see paragraph 72

9 above).

10 100. In addition to the fact that the Lowe Development Plan was never approved by the

11 City, it violates numerous City standards, including the existing City General Plan designation of the
12 site for Institutional Uses.

13 101. The Lowe Development Plan thus followed none of the (even potentially) applicable
14 rules:

15 it was not adopted by the City (which is the only jurisdiction with land use
16 authority over this private development project);

17 it was not adopted following the required County procedures for review of private development projects; and
18 it violates numerous substantive provisions of the County General Plan
19 applicable to both public and private developments.

20 102. Thus, Heritage Fields is entitled to, and requests that this Court issue, a peremptory
21 writ of mandate compelling the County to repeal its approval of the Lowe Development Plan.

25 103. Heritage Fields incorporates paragraphs 1 through 102 of this Complaint as though

26 fully set forth herein.

27 104. On or about December 27, 2010, Plaintiff Heritage Fields executed the ARDA with

28 the City and the Irvine Redevelopment Agency ("RDA"). The ARDA was recorded on the same day.

Gibson, Dunn & 25
Crutcher L.LP VERIFIED SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGE DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

I The ARDA a is a valid and enforceable contract that remains in effect between Heritage Fields, the

2 City, and the Successor Agency to the RDA.

3 105. The County is not and has never been a party to the ARDA; however, the ARDA is an

4 existing encumbrance on the County property that was recorded against title as part of the original

5 Great Park transaction.

6 106. Defendant County had knowledge of the ARDA at the time that it was entered into,
7 because it was adopted as part of a public process and subsequently recorded. The County also had

8 knowledge of the ARDA throughout the CEQA environmental review process for the Lowe

9 Development Plan, because the EIR for the Project references the ARDA throughout its analysis.

10 Further, the County had knowledge of the ARDA and the fact that the Lowe Development Plan

11 violated the ARDA no later than November 13, 2017, when the City informed the County of its
12 violation by a letter of that date. In the letter, the City communicated that the proposed project
13 "violates binding agreements with the City, such as ... the Amended and Restated Development

14 Agreement" and, regarding traffic, that the ARDA contemplated that the County property would
15 consist of approximately 300,000 square feet of institutional uses, and therefore the Project "is not

16 consistent with ARDA and it far exceeds the it overall ADT Budget for Planning Area 51." Exhibit L
17 of the ARDA contains the Overlay Plan for the Heritage Fields development and expressly provides

18 that the County property would be developed with "institutional" uses. On information and belief,

19 Lowe also had similar knowledge as Defendant County as to the ARDA L and Exhibit L containing the
20 Overlay Plan. Heritage Fields believes that Lowe understood that the ARDA was an existing
21 encumbrance on the County property and, despite this, agreed to create the Lowe Development Plan,
22 which is inconsistent with the institutional use restrictions.

23 107. By entering into contracts for the Lowe Development Plan and Master Ground Lease
24 with Lowe, the County committed acts of governance intentionally designed to induce a breach or
25 disruption of the ARDA. Defendant County and Lowe knew or were at minimum substantially
26 certain that such breach or disruption was a necessary consequence of its actions.

27 108. a As a result of Defendant County and Lowe's above-described actions, there has been a
28 breach or disruption of the ARDA. Section 3.9.4 of the ARDA requires the City to construct a park

Gibson, Dunn & 26
Crutcher LLP VERIFIED SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- on

2 the Great Park Property substantially in compliance with the Great Park Master Plan. The

3 construction of such a park requires a certain amount of allocated traffic capacity. With the County

4 contracting with Lowe to pursue the Lowe Development Plan-an unanticipated and unlawful dense

5 private development which uses substantially more trips than assumed under the ARDA-in the OC

6 Great Park area, the County proposes to utilize trips reserved for other ARDA uses, such as the City's

7 construction of the large-scale park pursuant to Section 3.9.4. The County has not made adequate

8 arrangements to ensure that the Project will in fact implement all necessary traffic mitigation, and

9 there will therefore be reduced traffic capacity to accommodate future traffic from as yet to be

10 implemented uses in the OC Great Park. As a result of the reduction in available trips, the City will

11 be unable to construct a park on the Great Park Property substantially in compliance with the Great
Park Master Plan, in breach of the ARDA.

12 109.

13 But for Defendant County and Lowe's actions regarding the Lowe Development Plan,

14 the ARDA would have been performed by the City and Heritage Fields.
110.

15 Heritage Fields has been damaged due to Defendant County and Lowe's interference

16 with the ARDA, because Heritage Fields has developed and is developing properties in the OC Great

17 Park area in reliance on the City's promise to construct a park on the Great Park Property

18 substantially in compliance with the Great Park Master Plan-a feature which has enhanced the value

19 of Heritage Fields' properties already and will greatly enhance that value when completed as planned.

20 Heritage Fields has invested hundreds millions of dollars to obtain the property subject to the ARDA

21 and to entitle that property for specific uses articulated in the ARDA, and previously approved by the

22 City of Irvine. This includes completion of the OC Great Park by the City and planned residential

23 and commercial development. Due to the County's intentional interference with Heritage Fields'

24 contract with the City (namely the ARDA), the County is diverting traffic and infrastructure capacity

25 (paid for by Heritage Fields) that would otherwise service the OC Great Park, and in turn, prevent the

26 City from implementing its full vision for a robust scope of public park and recreational

27 improvements. This reduction in available capacity will limit the types and ranges of potential oC

28 Great Park uses, and Plaintiff will be precluded from maximizing the full value of its investments.
The County and Lowe were aware that damage will be caused to Plaintiff as a result of their actions,

Gibson, Dunn &
Crutcher l 27 VERIFIED SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

but chose to act in total disregard of Heritage Fields' rights under the ARDA-thereby damaging

2 Plaintiff in an amount to be established at trial. The County and Lowe's actions were made with

3 malice and intent to harm, were grossly reckless and were done without any regard whatsoever for

4 the rights of Heritage Fields, and the promises enjoyed by Plaintiff under the terms of its contracts

5 with the City.

6 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

7 (Breach of Contract Against Defendant County)

8 111. Heritage Fields incorporates paragraphs I through 110 of this Complaint as though

9 fully set forth herein.

10 112. The Pre-Annexation Agreement between the County and the City is a valid and

L enforceable contract that is currently still in effect.

12 113. Heritage Fields is an intended third-party beneficiary under the Pre-Annexation
13 Agreement. When the City and County executed the Pre-Annexation Agreement, they intended for it

14 to benefit, in part, the future purchaser of the MCAS El Toro Property and a future "Base user,"
15 which ultimately became Heritage Fields. At minimum, the City intended future Base users, such as

16 Heritage Fields, to benefit from the County's promise to "pay its fair share of costs" for infrastructure

17 improvements directly related to servicing the County's properties to be received under the Pre-
18 Annexation Agreement. In Section 2.2.5, the contract expressly provides that "the City seeks to

19 create a funding mechanism whereby all Base users pay their fair share of the costs of developing the
20 necessary infrastructure and related improvements," then obligates the County to pay its fair share.
21 This provision was intended to benefit future "Base users," such as Heritage Fields, so that certain

22 users were not made to pay a disproportionate share of infrastructure costs or the County's share of
23 infrastructure costs.

24 114. Thus, the intent to benefit Heritage Fields appears from the terms of the Pre-
25 Annexation Agreement. In addition to the clear intent to benefit Base users in Section 2.2.5, the City
26 and County intended other benefits for future purchasers of the EI Toro property, including (a) the
27 City's and County's efforts to facilitate "expeditious transfer of the MCAS El Toro property"
28 (Section 4), and (b) the Pre-Annexation Agreement's requirement that a Development Agreement be

Gibson, Dunn 28 Crutcher LLP VERIFIED SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

established to govern the manner in which the parcels would be conveyed by the purchaser to the

2 County (Section 2.2.3.4). Heritage Fields ultimately became the purchaser of the lands within the
MCAS El Toro Property, and thus fits squarely within the class of parties intended to be benefited by

4 the Pre-Annexation Agreement.

5 115. The City's intent to benefit Heritage Fields by certain provisions of the Pre-

6 Annexation Agreement was later evidenced by the terms of the development agreement that the City
executed with Heritage Fields, the ARDA. Section 7.9 of the ARDA quotes Section 2.2.5 of the Pre-
Annexation Agreement (regarding the County's promise to pay its fair share of infrastructure costs,

9 for the benefit of future Base users) in full and the City covenants to request the County to honor this

10 obligation, and covenants to actively pursue enforcement of this provision, again for the benefit of

11 Heritage Fields as a Base user. In ARDA Section 7.9, the City also expressly acknowledges Heritage
12 Fields' existing ability to enforce its third-party rights under the Pre-Annexation Agreement:
13 "INJothing contained herein shall be deemed a waiver by Heritage Fields of any rights Heritage
14 Fields may have as against the County with respect to the County Agreement [Pre-Annexation
15 Agreement]."

16 116. On information and belief, the City has fully performed all conditions, covenants and
17 obligations required on its part to be performed in accordance with the terms of the Pre-Annexation

18 Agreement.

19 117. Under the Pre-Annexation Agreement, the County contractually committed to request
20 City zoning in accordance with government uses, such as the 15 government uses enumerated in
21 Section 2.2.4 of the Pre-Annexation Agreement. In the alternative, pursuant to the requirement that

22 the land be treated as though it is "unincorporated," the County Board of Supervisors was obligated
23 to follow the land use plan enacted by Measure W, requiring its "unincorporated" land to be
24 maintained in accordance with the Open Space or Educational land use designations imposed on the
25 property by Measure W. .
26 118. The County has breached the Pre-Annexation Agreement by:

27 failing to comply with this obligation to maintain uses in accordance with
28 Measure W;

Gibson, Dunn & 29
Crutcher VERIFIED SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

I approving : Development Plan that will introduce uses not authorized by the Pre-Annexation Agreement; 2
process; 3 refusing to recognize the City's land use jurisdiction and review

4 setting up mechanism by which Lowe may receive building permits without paying its fair share of transportation improvements (thus increasing the burden on Heritage Fields); and 5
creating impacts on the Orange County Great Park and other recreation 6 facilities not contemplated by the Pre-Annexation Agreement.
7 119. Heritage Fields has been and will be damaged by these breaches, because (among
8 other things) the Lowe Development Plan does not adequately provide for payment of infrastructure 9 costs (a potential harm to Base users such as Heritage Fields that Section 7.9 of the ARDA 10 recognized would give rise to a right by Heritage Fields to take action against the County); creates 11 adverse impacts to the City's ability to implement its full and complete vision for a robust scope of
12 public park and recreational improvements at the OC Great Park--a public good and an essential 13 foundation of Heritage Fields' past and ongoing investment in its Great Park Neighborhoods 14

15 development; and interferes with Heritage Fields' vested right to be able to develop its Property in
accordance with the carefully crafted land use assumptions codified by the land use regulations 16 existing at the time the ARDA was entered into.
17 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION
18 (Declaratory Relief Against Defendants County of Orange and Lowe Enterprises)
19 120. Heritage Fields incorporates paragraphs through 119 of this Complaint as though 20 fully set forth herein.
21
121. Heritage Fields alleges and declares, and seeks a declaration of this Court as provided 22 below, as follows:
23
A. The Pre-Annexation Agreement, and specifically Sections 2.2.3 and 2.2.4 24 thereof, does not and cannot exempt the 100-Acre Parcel from the applicability of the City's General 25 Plan, the City's Zoning Code, the California subdivision Law, and all other procedures applicable to 26 all public or private developments in the City. In satisfaction of the Pre-Annexation Agreement, the 27 City has zoned the 100-Acre Parcel as institutional, which is consistent with the permitted uses (i.e.,
28 institutional uses only), as defined and set forth in Section 2.2.4 of the Pre-Annexation Agreement.

Gibson, Dunn & 30
Crutcher LLP VERIFIED SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 Such uses are the only uses allowed on, and constitute permitted uses of, the 100-Acre Parcel, and

2 therefore, Lowe cannot presently develop the 100-Acre Parcel for private commercial and residential

3 uses as contemplated in the Lowe Development Plan.

4 B. In the alternative, the Pre-Annexation Agreement, and specifically Sections

5 2.2.3 and 2.2.4 thereof, allows the County to retain land use control to implement the institutional

6 uses as defined and set forth in Section 2.2.4 of the Pre-Annexation Agreement (i.e. institutional uses

7 only), but if the County exercises land use control, it must do SO subject to the County's General Plan

8 (including Measure W), the County's Zoning Code, the California subdivision Law, and all other
procedures applicable to all public or private developments in the County, and therefore, the County

10 cannot approve the development of the 100-Acre Parcel for private commercial and residential uses,

11 and Lowe cannot develop the 100-Acre Parcel for private commercial and residential uses as

12 currently contemplated in the Lowe Development Plan.

13 C. Lowe, as a private developer, is also subject to, and remains subject to, the
14 City's General Plan, the City's Zoning Code, the California subdivision Law, and all other

15 procedures applicable to all public and private developments in the City, provided, however,

16 permitted uses, as defined and set forth in Section 2.2.4 of the Pre-Annexation Agreement (i.e.,
17 institutional uses only), shall be the only uses allowed on, and constitute permitted uses of, the 100-
18 Acre Parcel, and therefore, Lowe cannot develop the 100-Acre Parcel for private commercial and

19 residential uses as currently contemplated in the Lowe Development Plan.

20 D. The City has already zoned the 100-Acre Parcel as institutional and fully
21 satisfied its obligations to do so under the Pre-Annexation Agreement, and as such, the County and
22 Lowe cannot lawfully approve and develop the Property for private commercial and residential uses
23 because such uses are inconsistent with the applicable zoning. Only the City can amend its zoning in
24 accordance with its lawful police powers and consistent with due process. Section 2.2.4 of the Pre-

25 Annexation Agreement is interpreted as allowing the County to demand from time to time that the
26 City change its zoning and planning restrictions. That would constitute an unlawful delegation and
27 abdication of the City's police power, and a violation of due process. Section 2.2.4 of the Pre-

28 Annexation Agreement also is an unlawful attempt to bind future City Councils in relation to their

Gibson, Dunn & 31
Crutcher LLP VERIFIED SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 exercise(s) of police power and land use authority, should it be interpreted as allowing the County to

2 make such a demand. Alternatively, should the City refuse to comply with the County's demand (as

3 the City has said it will do), then the City will fail to comply with Section 2.2.4 of the Pre-

4 Annexation Agreement. In that case, Section 5 of the Pre-Annexation Agreement, which provides

5 that "failure of any party to comply with any provision of this [Pre-Annexation] Agreement shall

6 render the entire Agreement void[,J" must be enforced. In that case, the Pre-Annexation Agreement
7 is void, no future transfer of the remaining portions of the 100-Acre Parcel is required, and the

8 Property may only be developed consistent with the institutional zoning limitations that presently
exist.

10 E. In the alternative, if, and to the extent the Pre-Annexation Agreement is not

11 unlawful, void, and unenforceable, the only permitted use of the 100-Acre Parcel shall be those

12 permitted uses, as defined and set forth in Section 2.2.4 of the Pre-Annexation Agreement (i.e.,

13 institutional uses only).

14 F. The ARDA strictly prohibits the uses of the 100-Acre Parcel contemplated by
15 the Lowe Development Plan, and limits development to institutional uses. On December 27, 2010,

16 after the Navy conveyed portions of the 100-Acre Parcel to Heritage Fields, the ARDA was recorded
17 against those properties transferred by the Navy, including the 100-Acre Parcel and the West Alton

18 Parcel. Thereafter, Heritage Fields conveyed the 100-Acre Parcel to the City subject to the covenants
19 and conditions already recorded against the title, including the land use limitations set forth in the
20 ARDA. The City thereafter conveyed that portion of the 100-Acre Parcel to the County subject to the
21 covenants and conditions already recorded against the title, including the limitations set forth in the

22 ARDA. Therefore, the 100-Acre Parcel cannot be used for any purposes other than the institutional
23 uses permitted by the ARDA, which was recorded prior to the property transfers to the City, and then
24 later to the County. The County took title to those portions of the 100-Acre Parcel subject to the land
25 use restrictions specifically articulated in the ARDA.

26 122. Heritage Fields is informed and believes, and alleges thereon, that the County disputes
27 each and every one of the allegations and declarations set forth in paragraph 121 above, and that an
28 actual controversy exists as to each and every allegation and declaration therein.

Gibson, Dunn 8 Crutcher LLP 32

1 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

2 123. In each of the items enumerated above, the County has violated its duty under the law,
3 abused its discretion, failed to proceed in the manner required by law, and decided to take the actions
4 objected to without the support of substantial evidence. Accordingly, certification of the EIR and

5 approval of the Lowe Development Plan must be set aside.

6 124. THEREFORE, Heritage Fields prays for a declaration and entry of judgment against
7 the County and Lowe as follows:

8 A. For an alternative and peremptory writ of mandate, commanding the County:
9 1. To set aside and vacate the certification of the EIR, Findings and Statement of
10 Overriding Considerations supporting the approval of the Lowe Development
11 Plan and Master Lease; and

12 2. To set aside and vacate the approval of the Lowe Development Plan and
13 Master Lease based upon the EIR, Findings and Statement of Overriding
14 Considerations;

15 B. For an order precluding the County and Lowe from taking any action to construct
16 facilities, infrastructure, or undertake site preparation until an adequate EIR is
17 prepared and timely resubmitted to this Court;

18 C. For a declaration of the following:
19 1. That neither the County nor Lowe, nor any other private party, can develop the
20 100-Acre Parcel for private commercial and residential uses as contemplated in
21 the Lowe Development Plan;
22 2. That by approving the Lowe Development Plan, the County has failed to
23 comply with the various City planning and zoning restrictions applicable to all
24 private developments in the City;
25 3. That in the event the City's planning and zoning restrictions are found
26 inapplicable to the 100-Acre Parcel, that the Lowe Development Plan fails to
27 comply with the County's general plan and zonjng codes (including Measure
28 W), and other applicable laws and measures;

Gibson, Dunn t 33 Crutcher LLP VERIFIED SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 4. That Lowe as a private developer, or any other private developer, is also®

2 subject to the same County and/or City restrictions as enumerated above;

3 5.

4 That the only permitted use on the 100-Acre Parcel shall be the permitted uses
(i.e., institutional uses), as defined and set forth in Section 2.2.4 of the Pre-

5 Annexation Agreement; or in the alternative, that the Pre-Annexation

6

7 Agreement is unlawful, void, and unenforceable by its terms as an abdication
of the City's police power; and

8 6.

9 That the ARDA is an existing encumbrance on title to the 100-Acre Parcel

10 such that neither the County, Lowe, nor any other private party, can develop

I1 the Property for private commercial and residential uses as contemplated in the
Lowe Development Plan;

12 D.

13 For damages, including but not limited to those for breach of contract, lost profits,

14 E. expenses, diminution in value of property and business, and prospective profits;
For injunctive relief precluding County or Lowe from taking any action to advance the

15 Project;

16 F. For specific performance under the terms of the contract;

17 G. For costs of the suit;

18 H. For reasonable attorney's fees; and

19 I. For such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

Re: CLAIM FOR MONEY OR DAMAGES AGAINST THE COUNTY OF ORANGE
(Pursuant to Govt. Code section 910, et seq.)
Dear Clerk of the Board of Supervisors:

The purpose of this letter is to provide you with notice pursuant to the California Tort Claims Act of the claims by Heritage Fields El Toro, LLC ("Heritage Fields") that seek, in part, money or damages against the County, as part of a larger nonmonetary action against the County. Heritage Fields' position is that the California Tort Claims Act does not require notice of its damages claims in this circumstance. (See Eureka Teacher's Assn. v. Bd. of Educ., 202 Cal. App. 3d 469, 475 (1988);
Indep. Hous. Servs. of San Francisco v. Fillmore Ctr. Assocs., 840 F. Supp. 1328, 1358 (N.D. Cal. 1993).) Further, because the County of Orange has already filed a lawsuit (County of Orange v. City of Irvine, Orange County Superior Court Case No. 30-2017-00959467-CU-MC-CJC) seeking resolution of some issues raised in Heritage Fields' claims, the County has indicated that it will litigate these issues rather than settle them, and so has waived any notice-for-settlement requirement. However, in an abundance of caution, Heritage Fields hereby provides the notice described in Government Code sections 910-915.4. As the County has already indicated that it will litigate rather than settle these claims, Heritage Fields requests an expedited response to this notice letter, so that litigation may continue uninhibited.

The claimant is Heritage Fields EI Toro, LLC, with the following post office address:

Heritage Fields El Toro, LLC
25 Enterprise, Suite 300
Aliso Viejo, CA 92656

Heritage Fields is represented by counsel in this matter, and desires that notices regarding the
claims be sent to its counsel at the following post office addresses:

On November 14, 2017, the Orange County Board of Supervisors approved the El Toro 100-Acre Development Plan ("Plan"), certified Environmental Impact Report No. 620 for the Plan, and
authorized execution of a Master Ground Lease ("Ground Lease") with a private developer, lowe
Enterprises Real Estate Group, LLC ("Lowe"), in furtherance of the Plan. These approvals concern
100 acres of land owned by the County in the City of Irvine ("City") on the former Marine Corps
facility at El Toro. Although pursuant to various contracts, codes, and regulations, the land can
only be used for County-related institutional uses, the County has acted as described above and
issued approvals to authorize dense, private development of the land, to the detriment of
Heritage Fields, a neighboring landowner. The monetary claims asserted by Heritage Fields claims
are: (1) Intentional Interference with Contractual Relations; and (2) Breach of Contract.

The claim for intentional interference with contractual relations involves the Amended and
Restated Development Agreement ("ARDA"), a contract between Heritage Fields and the City.
The ARDA requires the City to construct a park on the Great Park property, the area near the 100-
acre property, substantially in compliance with the Great Park Master Plan, and such construction
requires an allotted amount of traffic capacity. By approving the Plan, its EIR, and the Ground
Lease, the County authorized that traffic trips reserved for ARDA uses instead be utilized for Plan
uses and failed to mitigate the additional traffic impacts. As a result of the reduction in available trips for ARDA uses, the City will be unable to construct a park on the Great Park Property substantially in compliance with the Great Park Master Plan, in breach of the ARDA. The County knew about the ARDA and its requirements when it issued its approvals and did so with the
intention to induce breach or disruption of the ARDA.

Heritage Fields has been damaged due to the County's interference, because Heritage Fields has
developed and is developing properties in the Great Park area in reliance on the City's promise to
construct a park on the Great Park property substantially in compliance with the Great Park Master Plan-a feature which has enhanced the value of Heritage Fields' property. Heritage
Fields has invested hundreds millions of dollars to obtain the benefits provided by the ARDA
(including completion of the Great Park) and the right to entitle that property for specific uses articulated in the ARDA. Due to the County's interference, Heritage Fields will be precluded from maximizing the full value of its investments. The County's actions were made with malice and
intent to harm, were grossly reckless and were done without any regard whatsoever for the rights
of Heritage Fields, and the promises enjoyed by Heritage Fields under the terms of its of contracts
with the City. Thus, Heritage Fields seeks damages and punitive damages pursuant to this claim
in excess of $10,000 in an amount to be proven at trial.

The claim for breach of contract involves the 2003 Pre-Annexation Agreement between the
County and City, to which Heritage Fields is an intended third-party beneficiary because the parties intended the agreement to benefit future purchasers of the El Toro property, such as

46

February 26, 2018
Page 3

Heritage Fields. Thus, Heritage Fields is empowered to enforce the contract. The County has breached the Pre-Annexation Agreement by: (1) failing to comply with its obligation to maintain
uses in accordance with Measure W; (2) approving the Plan, which will introduce uses not authorized by the agreement; (3) refusing to recognize the City's land use jurisdiction and review process; (4) setting up a mechanism by which Lowe may receive building permits without paying its fair share of transportation improvements (thus increasing the burden on Heritage Fields); and (5) creating impacts on the Orange County Great Park and other recreation facilities not contemplated by the agreement.

Heritage Fields has been and will be damaged by these breaches, because the Plan does not adequately provide for infrastructure costs, creates adverse impacts to the future development and vibrancy of the Orange County Great Park (a public good and an essential foundation of
Heritage Fields' past and ongoing investment in its Great Park Neighborhoods development); and interferes with Heritage Fields' vested right to be able to develop its property in accordance with existing land use agreements, assumptions and regulations. Thus, Heritage Fields seeks damages pursuant to this claim in excess of $10,000 in an amount to be proven at trial.
Claimant does not know the names of all of the public employees who engaged in the wrongful conduct, but public employees who caused the injury, damage, or loss include members of the County of Orange Board of Supervisors, County officials and others responsible for the approvals discussed herein.

The claims each exceed $10,000 in damages and will be brought in an unlimited civil case, initially in the Superior Court for the County of Orange or in another venue should the existing litigation be transferred from the County of Orange by a Judge in the Orange County Superior Court.

relations involves the Amended and Restated Development Agreement ("ARDA"), a contract between Heritage
Fields and the City. The ARDA requires the City to construct a.park on the Great Park property, the area near

will be unable to construct a park on the Great Park Property substantially in compliance with the Great Park
Master Plan, in breach of the ARDA, The County knew about the ARDA and its requirements when it issued
its approvals and did so with the intention to induce breach or disruption of the ARDA.

Heritage Fields has been damaged due to the County's interference, because Heritage Fields has developed and
is developing properties in the Great Park area in reliance on the City's promise to construct a park on the Great
Park property substantially in compliance with the Great Park Master Plan---a fcature which has enhanced the
value of Heritage Fields' property. Heritage Fields has invested hundreds millions of dollars to obtain the
benefits provided by the ARDA (including completion of the Great Park) and the right to entitle that property
for specific uses articulated in the ARDA, Due to the County's interference, Heritage Fields will be precluded
from maximizing the full value of its investments. The County's actions were made with malice and intent to

the promises enjoyed by Heritage Fields under the terms of its contracts with the City. Thus, Heritage Fields
seeks damages and punitive damages pursuant to this claim in excess of $10.000 in an amount to be proven at
trial.

The claim for breach of contract involves the 2003 Pre-Annexation Agreement between the County and City, to
which Heritage Fields is an intended third-party beneficiary because the parties intended the agreement to
benefit future purchasers of the El Toro property, such as Heritage Fields. Thus, Heritage Fields is empowered
