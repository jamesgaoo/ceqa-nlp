19 INTRODUCTION

20 1. By this action, Petitioner East Yard Communities For Environmental Justice

21

22 ("Eastyard" or "Petitioner") challenges the unlawful actions of the City of Commerce and its

23 agents (collectively "City" or "Respondent") in approving the construction/use of a 24-hour,

24 convenience store and gas station ("Project") on a 20,395 square-foot ("SF") lot at the

25 intersection of S. Atlantic Blvd. and Washington Blvd. in the City of Commerce, California
("Site"). Specifically, on May 7, 2019, the City Council reversed the City Planning

26

27 Commission's denial of the Project's conditional use permit ("CUP") and variances

28 ("Entitlements"), and apparently approved the Project under the California Environmental Quality

-1-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

-

2 Act ("CEQA") via a categorical exemption ("CE") even though it is less than 300 feet from

3 residential zoned property as proscribed by the Commerce Municipal Code ("CMC" or "Code").

4 As alleged herein this Petition, the City granted the Entitlements and CE (collectively "Project

5 Approvals") absent substantial evidence in the record-as required under the CMC or CEQA.
JURISDICTION

6 2.

7 This Court has jurisdiction under Pub. Res. Code §§ 21168 or 21168.5 (i.e., CEQA

8 actions) and Code. Civ. Proc. §§ 1085 or 1094.5 (i.e., mandamus actions). The parties and the
Project Site are located in Los Angeles County with the City responsible for the Project's

10 compliance with applicable local/state zoning laws and serving, via is sub-agents, as the lead

11 agency under CEQA. The within action has been timely brought within 90 days of the City's

12 granting of the Project Approvals pursuant to Gov. Code § 65009. Furthermore, because

13 Petitioner is unaware of any properly filed CEQA Notice of Exemption ("NOE"), the within

14 action is timely brought within 180 days after the City's approval of the Project Approvals per

15 Pub. Res. Code § 21167 and 14 Cal. Code Regs. ("CEQA Guidelines") § 15112. Petitioner

16 served a Notice of Intent to File this Petition on the City Clerk pursuant to Pub. Res. Code

17 21167.5 by mail on July 25, 2019 as reflected in Exhibit A hereto. Concurrent with the filing of

18 this action, Petitioner will timely notify the Attorney General of the State of California of the

19 filing of the action in accordance with the requirements of Pub. Res. Code § 21167.7.

PARTIES

20 3.

21 Petitioner East Yard Communities for Environmental Justice ("Eastyard" or

22 "Petitioner") is a non-profit corporation with its headquarters at 2317 Atlantic Boulevard,

23 Commerce California 90040 less than a quarter mile from the Project Site whose members

24 include affected individuals who have a beneficial interest in the matters set forth in this Petition.

25 Eastyard was established in 2001 by residents of the Commerce/East Los Angeles area who were

26 concerned with the increasing environmental health impacts of industrial pollution in their

27 community, as well as several pending expansion projects adjacent to homes, schools and parks.

28 Petitioner's mission is to ensure environmentally sustainable development in the I-710 corridor

-2-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 and informed decisionmaking by public officials in Commerce concerning consistency with

2 development regulations in the City and for the Site. Eastyard members (i.e., Mark Lopez, Cindy

3 Donis, Laura Cortez, Jocelyn Del Real, Maria Becerra) testified before the City at multiple

4 Project public hearings, such as City Planning Commission hearings held in 2018 and City

5 Council hearings held in 2019.

6 4. Respondent City of Commerce ("City" or "Respondent") is a California municipal

7 corporation chartered under the Constitution and laws of the State of California and located in the

8 County of Los Angeles, California that permits the Project and serves, via its sub-agents, as lead

9 agency for the Project's compliance with CEQA.

10 5. Real Party in Interest business entities Elliot Megdal & Associates and Megdal

11 Commerce, LLC and individual Taylor Megdal (collectively "Real Party") are believed to be

12 businesses and/or individuals domiciled and operating in Los Angeles County and recipients of

13 the Project Approvals.

14 6. The true names, capacities, corporate, associate or otherwise of Respondents and

15 Real Parties named herein as DOES through 10, inclusive, are unknown to Petitioner who,

16 therefore, sues said Respondents and Real Parties by fictitious names. Petitioner will amend this

17 Petition to show the true names and capacities when they have been ascertained.

18 7. Petitioner, individually and through its members, objected to the Project Approvals

19 orally, in writing, and/or by filling speaker cards during the public comment period before the

20 close of the Project's public hearing. Petitioner has exhausted all administrative remedies, the

21 City's determinations are final, and no further administrative appeals are available under State or

22 local law. All issues submitted for judicial review in this Petition were sufficiently raised and

23 disputed with the City before the Project was approved. The City was given notice and the

24 opportunity to act in compliance with CEQA, the CMC, and other applicable laws but failed to do

25 SO.

26 LI

28 -3-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

2 8. Project (Feb. 2018): The Project includes the demolition of a drive-through

3 restaurant and the construction/use of a 24-hour convenience store in connection with a four-

4 pump fueling station on a 20,395-SF, commercial/manufacturing ("C/M-1") zoned Site located

5 within 100 feet of residential uses. To this end, the Project requires the below-requested

6 Entitlements:

7 One conditional use permit (i.e., CUP No. 528) to allow a convenience store with

8 gasoline sales on the C/M-1 zoned Site pursuant to CMC §§ 19.11.030.A, 19.31.400.A;

9 and

10 Two variances (i.e., Variance No. 18-01) from CMC § 19.31.400.B that requires the

11 combination of a service station and mini-market "must" a) be located on a parcel at least

12 25,000 SF and b) located minimum of 300 feet from property zoned for residential uses.

13 9. Planning Commission Denial of the Project (Oct. - Nov. 2018): Between

14 October and November 2018, the City Planning Commission held multiple public hearings on the

15 Project where City staff recommended denial of the Entitlements. On November 28, 2018, the

16 Planning Commission unanimously agreed with staff's recommendation and denied the

17 Entitlements, in part, because the Commission could not make nine of the ten CUP findings under

18 CMC § 19.39.420.A, or any of the five variance findings under CMC § 19.39.510. Because the

19 City could not make the Code-required land use findings and planned to deny the Entitlements,

20 the City admittedly did not prepare an initial environmental study pursuant to CEQA.

21 10. City Council Reversal & Approval of the Project (Feb. May 2019): In

22 February 2019, the City accepted an appeal of the Planning Commission's denial of the Project

23 Entitlements (*Appeal"). Between April and May 2019, the Appeal appeared on the agendas for

24 multiple public hearings before the City Council where Eastyard members appeared and urged

25 Council to deny the Appeal and sustain the Commission's action, in part, because the City could

26 not make the Code-required findings and concerns regarding the Project's environmental impacts

27 on residents. These concerns were echoed by City Planning Commissioner Johncito Peraza who

28 -4.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

-

2 testified before Council about the Project's inconsistency with applicable zoning laws and

3 explicitly requested the Project not be approved under CEQA via categorical exemption ("CE").

4 Furthermore, leading up to Council's final action, City staff repeatedly raised concerns about

5 increased traffic and driving hazards caused by the Project and confirmed that no traffic study or

6 other CEQA documentation had been prepared showing impacts would be less than significant.

7 Notwithstanding the above concerns and in the name to "bait the line" for "economic

8 development" in the City (according to one Councilmember), the City Council granted the

9 Appeal on May 7, 2019, approved the Project Approvals, and directed City staff to prepare a

10 resolution making the appropriate findings of fact to grant the Project Approvals, which has yet to
be presented to the public.

11

12 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

13 (Writ of Mandate and Administrative Mandamus Code Civ. Proc. §§ 1085, 1094.5 - Violations of Applicable Land Use Laws)

14 11.

15 Petitioner restates and realleges Paragraphs 1-10 as if fully set forth herein.

12.

16 The California Supreme Court has described General Plans and zoning schemes in

many ways. See

17 e.g., DeVita v. County of Napa (1995) 9 Cal.4th 763, 773 (as a 'constitution,'

18 "for future development located at the top of 'the hierarchy of local government law regulating

19 land use); Topanga Assn. for a Scenic Community, 11 Cal.3d at 517-518 (as a 'contracts,' where

20 "each party foregoes rights to use its land as it wishes in return for the assurance that the use of

21 neighboring property will be similarly restricted, the rationale being that such mutual restriction

22 can enhance total community welfare"); Orange Citizens for Parks & Recreation v. Superior

23 Court (2016) 2 Cal.5th 141, 159 (as 'yardstick,' where "one should be able to "take an

24 individual parcel and check it against the plan and then know which uses would be permissible").

25 While planning agencies enjoy some discretion interpreting their zoning laws, "deference has

26 limits" and courts are not bound by unreasonable interpretations contrary to the plain language of
regulations and statutes. Id. at 146, 156-157 (rejecting attempts to "downplay the facial
27 inconsistency," Court held city abused its discretion finding residential project consistent with

28 -5-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 general plan designation where "no reasonable person could conclude that the Property could be

2 developed without a general plan amendment"); see also Stolman v. City of Los Angeles (2003)

3 114 Cal.App.4th 916, 925 (vacating variance based on zoning administrator's interpretation

4 contradicted by the plain language of the municipal code).

5 13. Here, Petitioner is informed and believes that granting the Project Approvals

6 constituted a prejudicial abuse of discretion by the City by failing to proceed in the manner

7 required by law or making the necessary land use findings supported by substantial evidence -

8 as required under the City Code. This includes but not limited to the City's failure to make the

9 necessary CUP and variance findings (CMC $§ 19.39.420.A, 19.39.510) including allowing this

10 Project within an otherwise forbidden 300 feet of a residential zone, or provide the underlying

11 facts and analysis to fill the analytical gap justifying the granting of the Entitlements. CUP and

12 variance findings that lack substantial evidence include, but are not limited to:

13 "That the strict or literal interpretation and application of this Title 19 [of the Code]

14 would result in practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships inconsistent with the

15 general purpose and intent of this Title 19, or would deprive applicants of privileges

16 granted to others in similar circumstances" (CMC § 19.39.510.A, emph. added);

17 "That there are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions applicable to

18 the property involved or the intended development of the property that do not apply

19 generally to other property in the same zone" (id. subd., B, emph. added);

20 "That the granting of such variance will not constitute the granting of a special privilege

21 inconsistent with the limitations on other properties in the vicinity classified in the same

22 zone" (id. subd., C, emph. added); and

23 "That the granting of such variance will not be materially detrimental to the public

24 health, safety, or general welfare nor injurious to property or improvements in the zone

25 or neighborhood in which the property is located" (id. subd., D, emph. added; see also

26 CMC § 19.39.420.A.9);

27

28 -6-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

H

2 "That the granting of such variance will not create any inconsistency with any objective

00 v contained in the general plan" (CMC § 19.39.510.C, emph. added; see also CMC §
19.39.420.A.8).

Un "The proposed use is one conditionally permitted within the subject zone and complies

6 with the intent of all applicable provisions of this Title 19 [of the Code], including, but

7 not limited to, those set forth in Chapter 19.19 (Site Planning and General Development
Standards)" (CMC § 19.39.420.A.1, emph. added);

8

9 "The proposed use would not impair the integrity and character of the zone in which it is
to be located" (id., subd., 2, emph. added);

10

11 "The subject site is physically suitable for the type of land use being proposed" (id. subd.,
3, emph. added);

12

13 "The proposed use would be compatible with existing and future land uses within the

14 zone and the general area in which the proposed use is to be located" (id. subd., 5, emph.
added);

15

16 "There would be adequate provisions for public access to serve the subject proposal" (id.
subd., 7, emph. added); and

17

18 "The proposed design and elevations preserve and maximize the image, character, and
visual quality of the neighborhood"* (id. subd., 10, emph. added).

19 14.

20 Furthermore, absent appropriate CEQA analysis, the City could not make the

numerous public safety land use findings supported by substantial evidence.

21 15.

22 Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law other than the relief

23 sought in this Petition. If the City does not revoke the Project Approvals and allow the

24 development of the Project, Petitioner and the public will suffer irreparable harm from which

25 there is no adequate remedy at law in that the Project will be built, operations commence, and
significant adverse impacts occur contrary to State and local law.

26 //

28 -7-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- 16.

2 In sum, the City abused its discretion by granting the Project Approvals in clear

3 violation of the plain language of applicable zoning laws and absent any evidence, much less
substantial evidence, to support the Code-required land use findings.

4 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
(Writ of Administrative Mandamus - Code Civ. Pro. § 1094.5 - CEQA Violations)

6 17.

7 18. Petitioner restates and realleges Paragraphs 1-16, as if fully set forth herein.

8 CEQA provides categorical exemptions for projects that are unlikely to have

9 environmental impacts. Pub. Res. Code § 21084. These exemptions are to be construed narrowly

10 and are not to be expanded beyond the scope of their plain language. Castaic Lake Water Agency

11 V. City of Santa Clarita (1995) 41 Cal.App.4th 1257; Wildlife Alive v. Chickering (1976) 18

12 Cal.3d 190, 205. They must also be construed in light of their statutory authorization, which

13 limits such exemptions to classes of projects that have been determined not to have significant

14 effects on the environment - ensuring categorical exemptions are interpreted in a manner

15 affording the greatest environmental protection. See e.g., Azusa Land Reclamation Co. v. Main

16 San Gabriel Basin Watermaster (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 1165, 1192; Save our Schools v. Barstow

17 Unified Sch. Distr. Bd. of Educ. (2015) 240 Cal.App.4th 128, 140; County of Amador v. El
Dorado County Water Agency (1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 931, 966.

18 19.

19 Here, despite substantial evidence from Petitioner, City staff, and City Planning

20 Commissioner regarding significant environmental impacts-including but not limited to land

21 use, traffic, and public safety hazard impacts-the City apparently approved the Project as

22 categorically exempt relying on irrelevant factors-such as the need to "bait the line" for

23 "economic development." Hence, the City failed to proceed in a manner required by law when it

24 granted the Entitlements via an apparent CE absent substantial evidence. Substantial evidence is

25 enough relevant information and reasonable inference that a fair argument can be made to support

26 a conclusion, even though other conclusions. CEQA Guidelines § 15384(a). Substantial

27 evidence includes facts, reasonable assumptions predicated on facts, and expert opinions

28 supported by facts. Pub. Res. Code §§ 21080(e), 21082.2(c); CEQA Guidelines §§ 15064(f)(5),

-8-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 15384. Here, no evidence, much less substantial, was provided before the City granted the

2 Project Approvals.

3 20. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy at law other than the relief

4 sought in this Petition. If the City persists in its refusal to rescind the Project Approval and allow

5 the development of the Project, Petitioner and the public will suffer irreparable harm from which

6 there is no adequate remedy at law in that the Project will be built, operations commence, and

7 significant adverse impacts on the environment would occur, contrary to State and local law.

8 21. In sum, the City ignored substantial evidence and made a decision untethered to

9 any facts, evidence, or analysis justifying the Project's apparent CE. Laurel Heights

10 Improvement Assn. V. Regents of University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 394.

11 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

12 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for the following relief:

13 1. That the Court enter a peremptory writ of mandate ordering the City, including all

14 agents thereof, to set aside and void the Project Approvals for the Project (including CUP No. 528

15 and Variance No. 18-01) pending the City's full compliance with the CMC, CEQA, and other

16 governing laws including but not limited to making the necessary zoning findings, supporting

17 all conclusions and determinations with substantial evidence, and providing the public with all

18 relevant documents prior to any future approval of the Project;

19 2. That the Court issue a temporary stay, stay, temporary restraining order, and/or

20 injunction ordering the City to refrain from allowing the Project to proceed and issuing further

21 permits while this Petition is pending;

22 3. That the Court issue a permanent injunction ordering the Project halted pending

23 the City's full compliance with the CMC, CEQA, and other governing law.

24 4. For other and further relief as the Court finds proper.

RE: NOTICE OF INTENT TO FILE LAND USE/CEQA PETITION IN THE MATTER OF THE APPROVAL OF THE 7-
ELEVEN PROJECT (2425 S. ATLANTIC BLVD.; COMMERCE, CA 90040)

Dear Ms. Shumway and Mr. Tapia:

This is to inform you that Petitioner East Yard Communities For Environmental Justice
("Eastyard" or "Petitioner") will be filing suit against the City of Commerce and its sub-agents (collectively "City" or "Respondents") challenging its approval of the 7-Eleven convenience store and gas station development ("Project"), which includes the approval of a) a conditional use permit
(i.e., CUP No. 528), b) two variances (i.e., Variance No. 18-01), and c) the apparent adoption of a
categorical exemption (collectively "Project Approvals").

As agents of the Respondents, please take notice, under Pub. Res. Code § 21167.5, that
Petitioner alleges that the Project Approvals violated the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), as well as various local and state zoning laws applicable to the Project. Specifically, on May 7, 2019, the City granted the Project Approvals despite substantial evidence from Petitioner,
City staff, and City Planning Commissioner that (a) the City could not make the necessary land use findings required under the Commerce Municipal Code ("CMC" or "Code"); and (b) the Project's potential significant environmental impacts including but not limited to land use, traffic, and public safety hazard impacts. This was all done absent any documentation, citation to a specific exemption, or other information/evidence in the record relevant to the Code-required findings or
environmental impacts of the Project. As such, Respondents abused its discretion when granting the Project Approvals absent substantial evidence tethered to evidence and analysis in the record- as required under the CMC and CEQA.
Furthermore, the City's granting of the Project Approvals is evidence of a pattern-and-
practice of Respondents' failure to conduct adequate CEQA review of development projects as further evidenced by the most recent approval of the Citadel Mall Expansion Project that included the approval of, inter alia, Development Agreements 18-032 and 18-033 in reliance on a facially inadequate Final Environmental Impact Report (SCH # 2016091024).

Petitioner intends to pray for the following relief:

Ms. Ms. Shumway and Mr. Tapia July 25, 2019
Page 2 of 2

1. That the Court enter a peremptory writ of mandate ordering the City, including all agents
thereof, to set aside and void the Project Approvals for the Project (including CUP No. 528
and Variance No. 18-01) pending Respondents' full compliance with the CMC and governing
law - including but not limited to making the necessary zoning findings, supporting all
conclusions and determinations with substantial evidence, and providing the public with all relevant documents prior to any future approval of the Project;
2. That the Court issue a temporary stay, stay, temporary restraining order, and/or injunction ordering the Respondents to refrain from allowing the Project to proceed and issuing further permits while this Petition is pending;

3. That the Court issue a permanent injunction ordering the Project halted pending the Respondents' full compliance with the CMC, CEQA, and other governing law; and
4. For other and further relief as the Court finds proper.
You will be served with the Petition shortly.
