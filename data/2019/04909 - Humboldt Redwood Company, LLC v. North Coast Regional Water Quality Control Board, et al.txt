2 PLEASE TAKE NOTICE, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 388 and Public

3 Resources Code § 21167.7, that on November 18, 2019, Petitioner and Plaintiff, Humboldt

4 Redwood Company, LLC ("HRC"), filed a petition under the provisions of the California

5 Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code § 21000 et seq. ("CEQA"), against the North

6 Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board ("Regional Board") and California State Water

7 Resources Control Board ("State Board") (collectively, "Respondents"), challenging all actions

8 and approvals taken in adopting Order No. R1-2019-0021 (Waste Discharge Requirements for
Nonpoint Source Discharges and Other Controllable Water Quality Factors Related to Timber

10 Harvesting and Associated Activities Conducted by Humboldt Redwood Company, LLC in the

11 Upper Elk River Watershed, Humboldt County) on June 19, 2019 ("the 2019 WDRs"). The 2019

12 WDRs impose requirements on HRC's timber harvesting, forest management practices, and

13 associated activities that require inappropriate, infeasible, and unnecessary permit conditions.

14 Respondents' decisions are not supported by their findings, and the findings are not supported by
substantial evidence in the record.

15

16 The petition and complaint seeks a writ of mandate and declaratory relief setting aside the

17 objectionable requirements that violate CEQA and other applicable law. Specifically, HRC seeks

18 a determination and judgment that Respondents committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion by

19 failing to proceed in the manner required by law, imposing mitigation beyond that legally
permissible under CEQA, and failing to adopt feasibility findings.

20 A copy of the Petition and Complaint is attached to this notice.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

4826-4544-0172.v5

Petitioner and Plaintiff, Humboldt Redwood Company, LLC ("HRC" or "Petitioner")
2 hereby petitions the Court for a writ of mandate and complains for declaratory relief against
Respondents and Defendants North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board ("Regional
Water Board" or "Regional Board") and California State Water Resources Control Board ("State
Water Board" or "State Board") (collectively, "Respondents"), and by this petition and complaint

6 alleges as follows:
INTRODUCTION

8 A. 2019 Waste Discharge Requirements

9 1. This action challenges the Regional Board's adoption of Order No. R1-2019-0021

10 (Waste Discharge Requirements for Nonpoint Source Discharges and Other Controllable Water

11 Quality Factors Related to Timber Harvesting and Associated Activities Conducted by Humboldt

12 Redwood Company, LLC in the Upper Elk River Watershed, Humboldt County) on June 19,

13 2019 ("the 2019 WDRs"), which imposes Waste Discharge Requirements (*WDRs") on HRC's

14 timber harvesting, forest management practices, and associated activities that require

15 inappropriate, infeasible, and unnecessary permit conditions and out and out impermissible

16 exactions.

17 2. The 2019 WDRs expand and extend the illegal five-year moratorium on lawful

18 timber harvesting activities in five watersheds for three additional years. The Regional Board

19 abused its discretion by failing to analyze or adopt findings of feasibility, failed to adequately
20 respond to HRC's objections and comments, and failed to incorporate limitations on feasibility

21 and controllability in that the requirements of the WDRS are not feasible and are not properly

22 targeted at reasonably controllable discharges of HRC. The Regional Board further abused its

23 discretion by summarily imposing permit conditions to reduce sediment discharge that are not

24 supported by substantial evidence in the record. The objectionable measures violate limitations

25 on agency regulatory actions and constitute improper control of silviculture practices which are

26 outside the Regional Board's statutory jurisdiction and expertise, with no demonstrated need or
27 effectiveness. Indeed, the Regional Board wholly ignored that the 2019 WDRs could result in an

28 increase in sediment discharge by precluding HRC's state-of-the-science silviculture and
-1-

4826-4544-0172.v5

1 management practices.

2 B. 2016 Waste Discharge Requirements and the Amendment Process

3 3. Respondents seek to force HRC to solve a problem it did not cause. The 2019
WDRs are the culmination of several years of administrative proceedings conducted by

5 Respondents seeking to address sediment conditions in the Lower Elk River Watershed,

6 downstream from HRC's landholding. Such sediment, and associated flooding events, are caused

7 by numerous sources, including rising sea levels, extreme weather events, natural background

8 sources, and anthropogenic drivers decades of agricultural, residential, roadway, grading and

9 other land development-in the lower reach which have altered drainage patterns and the natural

10 river course, causing an unnatural choke.

11 4. Sediment delivery to the lower reach also occurred as a result of historical
12 upstream timber operations. But for the downstream alteration of the river course and elevations,

13 such sediment could have naturally exited the watershed and Humboldt Bay. The volume of

14 sediment currently present in the lower reach bears no relationship to HRC's timber harvesting

15 activities, which incorporate stringent and responsible land stewardship. Regardless,

16 Respondents imposed the entire regulatory burden on upstream landowner timber companies.

17 i. 2016 WDRs

18 5. The Regional Board previously issued watershed-wide WDRs to HRC on

19 November 30, 2016 for HRC's timber harvest operations in the Upper Elk River Watershed,
20 Order No. R1-2016-0004 (Waste Discharge Requirements for Nonpoint Source Discharges and

21 Other Controllable Water Quality Factors Related to Timber Harvesting and Associated Activities

22 Conducted by Humboldt Redwood Company LLC) (the "2016 WDRs"). The 2016 WDRs were

23 based on and meant to implement the Regional Board's adopted total maximum daily sediment

24 load (*TMDL") action plan ("TMDL Action Plan") for the Elk River Watershed, as more fully

25 alleged below.

26 6. The 2016 WDRs included prescriptions imposed by the Regional Water Board

27 pursuant to a conceptual zero load allocation (notwithstanding the California State Board of

28
- 2 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

4826-4544-0172.v5

Forestry and HRC's concerns raised over these new requirements). As alleged herein, however,

2 the State Board unreasonably changed course in relation to HRC's WDRs.

3 ii. The State Water Board Resolution

4 7. On August 1, 2017, the State Board adopted Resolution No. 2017-0046 ("State

5 Water Board Resolution" or "Resolution"), which purported to approve the TMDL and the

6 TMDL Action Plan for the Upper Elk River Watershed adopted by the Regional Board. At the
time it approved the TMDL Action Plan, the State Board also ordered the Regional Board to

8 reopen the 2016 WDRs and impose new WDRs that went beyond the Action Plan adopted by the

9 Regional Board.

10 8. The 2019 WDRs impose additional restrictions that result directly from the State

11 Board Resolution. HRC and Green Diamond Resource Company ("Green Diamond") challenged

12 the State Board Resolution in an action currently pending before this Court: Humboldt Redwood

13 Company, et al. v. California State Water Resources Control Board, et al., Humboldt County

14 Superior Court Case No. CV170778 (filed August 31, 2017), which has been stayed by order of

15 this Court pending final approval of the TMDL Action Plan and completion of the WDR process

16 and/or other actions implementing the TMDL.'

17 9. HRC alleges that in approving the Resolution, the State Board abused its discretion

18 in directing the Regional Water Board (i) to impose on HRC a capricious re-interpretation of the

19 zero load allocation and other measures (including numeric targets and indicators) as prescriptive

20 rather than conceptual or goal-oriented as provided for in the Regional Water Board's adopted

21 TMDL Action Plan and proposed Amendment to the North Coast Region Water Quality Control

22 Board Basin Plan- ("Basin Plan Amendment"), and (ii) to impose that erroneous interpretation

23 through a mandated Regional Board review of HRC's 2016 WDRs that ultimately lead to the

24 2019 WDRs. The Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. § 1251 et seq.) and the Porter-Cologne Water

25

26 Petitioners preserved the right to challenge the TMDL Action Plan and Basin Plan Amendment (including while those plans were pending approval of the Office of Administrative Law

27 ("OAL") and of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"), respectively), and anticipate taking steps to file an amended and/or supplemental pleading in that action.
28 • Regional Water Board Resolution No. R1-2016-0017, as amended by the Executive Officer of the Regional Water Board on July 14, 2017.
- 3-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

4826-4544-0172.v5

Quality Control Act (Wat. Code § 13000 et seq.) do not provide authority to require the

2 impossible, and the adoption of a TMDL cannot overcome that lack of authority.

3 10. On October 15, 2018, the State Water Board issued a clarification of its intent in

4 adopting portions of the State Water Board Resolution that are objectionable to HRC. Until

5 completion of the 2019 WDR process, including the opportunity for administrative review, it was

6 uncertain whether such clarification would ensure that implementation of the TMDL Action
Plan/Basin Plan Amendment/State Water Board Resolution in the 2019 WDR process would

8 overcome HRC's objections, thereby avoiding the necessity of proceeding with this litigation.

9 The State Board is named as party herein based on its arbitrary and capricious action in ordering

10 the reopening and reissuance of the 2016 WDRs with the State Board's reinterpreted conditions

11 rescind or modify its Resolution as applied in the 2019 and then its failure to take any action to
12 WDRs, despite the opportunity to do so by accepting HRC's administrative appeal of the

13 Regional Board's decision. Far from declining to become involved, the State Board reinterpreted

14 the TMDL Action Plan and ordered the Regional Board to reopen the 2016 WDRs and adopt the

15 2019 WDRs under the express HRC-focused requirements of its Resolution.

16 11. Petitioner contends that Respondents acted contrary to law and committed a

17 prejudicial abuse of discretion in numerous respects by: (i) failing to apply the proper legal

18 standard in making their decisions; (ii) adopting findings that are insufficient to support their

19 decisions; (iii) making findings and imposing new requirements that are not supported or justified

20 by substantial evidence in the administrative record; and (iv) failing to make other necessary

21 findings. Accordingly, this Court should issue a writ of mandate directing the Regional Water

22 Board to set aside and vacate and/or modify its decision adopting the 2019 WDRs for HRC as

23 alleged herein.

24 12. HRC further seeks a stay of enforcement of the portions of the 2019 WDRs

25 challenged herein pending resolution of this lawsuit in order to continue all appropriate lawful

26 harvesting and management activities.

PARTIES

13. Petitioner and Plaintiff Humboldt Redwood Company, LLC ("HRC") is a
Delaware company with offices in Scotia and Santa Rosa, California. HRC is a privately-owned

4 forestry company managing timber production zoned lands in the Upper Elk River Watershed.

5 The company's mission is to demonstrate it is possible to manage productive forestlands with a

6 high standard of environmental stewardship while operating as a successful business. HRC is
engaged in, and intends to continue to engage in, lawful and permitted timber harvest operations,

8 including logging and lumber production, and forest management in Humboldt County. HRC has

9 a significant and direct interest in continued approval of timber harvest and management activities

10 under Regional Water Board-issued water quality permits, including WDRs. HRC would be

11 adversely and directly affected by the 2019 WDRs and the State Board Resolution if the Court

12 does not grant the relief sought by Petitioner. HRC is the largest landowner, owning

13 approximately 22,000 acres, in the Upper Elk River Watershed.

14 14. Respondent and Defendant North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board

15 ("Regional Board") is one of nine regional water quality control boards statewide and has
16 jurisdiction over Humboldt County, including the Upper Elk River Watershed at issue in this

17 action. The Regional Board is semi-autonomous and is comprised of part-time Board members

18 appointed by the Governor and confirmed by the Senate. The Regional Board makes water

19 quality decisions for its region, including setting standards, issuing waste discharge requirements,

20 determining compliance with those requirements, and taking appropriate enforcement actions.

21 15. Respondent and Defendant State Water Board ("State Board") was established in

22 1967 by the Legislature and consists of five members appointed to a four-year term by the

23 Governor (and confirmed by the Senate). The agency is charged with preserving, enhancing, and

24 restoring the quality of California's water resources and drinking water for the protection of the

25 environment, public health, and all beneficial uses, and ensuring proper water resource allocation

26 and efficient use, for the benefit of present and future generations. Together with the nine state

27 regional boards, the State Water Board has primary responsibility for implementing and enforcing

28 the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act. However, the agency's authority is not unlimited.
- 5-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

4826-4544-0172.v5

Its mission is to ensure the "highest reasonable quality" for waters of the State, while allocating

2 waters to achieve "the optimum balance" of beneficial uses, including protection and enforcement

3 of water needs of industry, agriculture, and other users.

4 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

5 16. This Court has jurisdiction over this proceeding pursuant to the California

6 Constitution, Article VI, § 10, Water Code § 13330, Code of Civil Procedure §§ 88, 1060, and
1094.5, or in the alternative 1085.

8 17. Venue in this Court is proper pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §§ 392 and 393,

9 in that the real property and activities that are the subject of this action, or some part thereof, are

10 located in Humboldt County, where the causes of action arose or some part thereof arose as a

11 result of the activities described herein.

12 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

13 Regulatory Framework

14 A. Federal Regulation of Water Quality and TMDLs

15 18. The goal of the federal Clean Water Act ("CWA") is "to restore and maintain the

16 chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation's waters" 33 U.S.C § 1251(a). Under

17 section 303(d) of the CWA, states are required to develop lists of impaired waters and to address

18 those waters by developing a TMDL that establishes the maximum level of a "pollutant" that a

19 listed water can accommodate without impairing water quality standards. A TMDL requires a

20 comprehensive analysis of the natural and human-caused sources of a pollutant within a listed

21 watershed; a TMDL establishes reduction targets and allocates necessary "load" reductions to the

22 sources of a pollutant. A TMDL is defined as the sum of the individual waste load allocations for

23 point sources, load allocations for nonpoint sources, and natural background. 40 C.F.R. § 130.2.

24 B. California Water Quality Control Program

25 19. The Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act (Wat. Code § 13000 et seq.)

26 established a statewide program of water quality control that is maintained through regional

27 administration within the framework of statewide coordination and policy. For the purposes of

28 the Act, the state is divided into nine regions, each of which is governed by is a regional board.
- 6 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

4826-4544-0172.v5

1 Wat. Code §§ 13200, 13201. Each regional board is charged with formulating and adopting

2 water quality control plans for the areas within its region and, through those plans, establishing

3 water quality objectives that will "ensure the reasonable protection of beneficial uses [of waters

4 of the state] and the prevention of nuisance." Wat. Code §§ 13240, 13241.

5 C. The Regional Board, Basin Plan and WDRs

6 20. The Regional Water Board has jurisdiction over the state's northwestern counties,

7 including Del Norte, Humboldt, Mendocino, Trinity, and portions of Sonoma, Siskiyou, Lake and

8 other counties. The HRC property is located within the boundary of the North Coast region and
lies within Humboldt County. The Regional Water Board enforces the Water Quality Control
10 Plan for the North Coast Region ("Basin Plan"), which prohibits the discharge of materials that

11 adversely affect the beneficial uses of water of the State.

12 21. For timber harvest projects on private lands, the Regional Water Board issues

13 WDRs and Waivers of WDRs, which establish conditions or requirements to control discharges

14 of "waste" to waters of the State. Discharges associated with timber harvesting activities

15 typically include sediment from erosion and/or increased water temperature from loss of riparian

16 canopy. Subject to their authority to issue WDRs to protect water quality, Regional Water

17 Quality Control Boards do not regulate timber harvesting - such regulation is left to the purview

18 of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection ("CAL FIRE"). CAL FIRE

19 regulates timber harvesting through a separate timber harvesting plan approval process pursuant

20 to the Z'berg-Nejedly Forest Practice Act of 1973. Pub. Res. Code §§ 4511 et seq.

21 22. The Regional Water Board has been active in regulating discharges from logging
22 and associated activities since 1972. WDRs are the primary regulatory mechanism utilized by the

23 Regional Water Board to control the nonpoint source pollution resulting from past and ongoing

24 timber harvesting activities in Upper Elk River Watershed, where the HRC property is situated.

25 Petitioner is subject to previously approved WDRs for its lawful timber harvest and other land-

26 management activities in the Upper Elk River Watershed.

- 7-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

4826-4544-0172.v5

D. The TMDL Action Plan

2 23. The Regional Water Board adopted a TMDL that established a "zero" load

3 allocation for nonpoint source (anthropogenic and natural) sediment at zero. (The "load

4 allocation is defined as zero," TMDL Action Plan, Section IV.) As alleged herein, such a
reduction could only exist as a target or goal and, as the Regional Board acknowledged, a
prescriptive zero load allocation is physically impossible to achieve. The Regional Board
accordingly deemed the zero load allocation as "necessarily conceptual" in the TMDL Action

8 Plan and left the Regional Board with "discretion on how to implement it in WDRs." Id.

9 However, the State Board reinterpreted the TMDL Action Plan to make zero loading a

10 prescriptive standard, which is unwarranted and unreasonable as imposed on Petitioner and its

11 operations.

12 24. The Elk River Watershed has been divided into 3 subbasins: (i) the Upper Elk

13 River, (ii) Upper Little South Fork Elk River, and (iii) Lower Elk River Watersheds. Relevant

14 here, the State-developed sediment TMDL and TMDL Action Plan arbitrarily address only

15 sediment loading from the Upper Elk River Watershed and only property owned by timber

16 operatorseven though the entire watershed is listed as impaired.

17 25. The record demonstrates that nuisance flooding is caused by other anthropogenic

18 activities as well as natural conditions in the Lower Elk River Basin. Respondents' approach

19 ignores causes of sediment accretion a from a century of human modifications to the floodplain and

20 Humboldt Bay as well as natural changes affecting the capacity of the Elk River and its

21 floodplain to carry and discharge sediment to Humboldt Bay.

22 26. The TMDL also does not address sediment loading from the two subbasins located

23 downstream of the Upper Elk River, though the stated intent of the TMDL is, in part, to prevent

24 depositing in the latter two subbasins in the low-gradient channel and floodplain.

25 27. In order to adopt a legitimate TMDL Action Plan and ameliorate the flooding that

26 the Regional Water Board has found to be a nuisance, the Regional and State Boards should have

27 considered and addressed all of these natural and anthropogenic factors throughout the entire Elk

28
8 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

4826-4544-0172.v5

River Watershed. Even EPA, which urged completion of the TMDL, questioned the TMDL's
limited geographic scope.

28. Ironically, the imposition of a prescriptive zero discharge limit on Petitioner will

4 severely restrict its land use without any measurable reduction in the historic sediment accretion

5 and flooding nuisance that the TMDL purports to address. Even more ironic, Petitioner cannot

6 implement sediment reducing road improvements and remediation without causing some minor
level of sediment discharge. A prescriptive zero load allocation would prevent activities that are
designed to protect and improve water quality.

9 29. Under the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act, the Regional Water Board

10 prepared the TMDL Action Plan and proposed it as a Basin Plan amendment. See Wat. Code

11 con 13242. However, further confining the scope of the sediment TMDL, the Regional Water

12 Board excluded the Upper Little South Fork Elk River watershed on the basis that it is wholly

13 contained in the boundaries of the Headwaters Forest Reserve managed by the Bureau of Land

14 Management and purportedly maintains many of its original old growth redwood characteristics,

15 meets water quality standards, and "should be removed from the 303(d) list of Impaired Waters."

16 Factual Background

17 E. Multiple Causes of Sediment

18 30. The Regional Water Board found that historic land management activities-

19 subject to the Regional Board's jurisdictionin the Upper Elk River watershed "caused

20 significant sediment discharge, sedimentation, and aggradation in the impacted reach," where

21 excessive flooding results. Resolution No. R1-2016-0017, T 10. These reaches are situated in the

22 Elk River valley floodplain mostly outside the HRC property.

23 31. Various other conditions, including basin soils, plate tectonics, rising sea levels,

24 seasonal weather patterns, and human modification of the flood plain and Humboldt Bay also

25 affect sedimentation rates.

26 32. The Regional Board also found that, during the decade of 1988 to 1997, excessive

27 timber harvest rates, poor management practices, and large winter storms combined to result in

28 unprecedented rates of sediment delivery. The excessive timber harvest and poor management
- 9-

4826-4544-0172.v5

practices were not carried out by HRC. (HRC did not own property in the Elk River watershed

2 until 2008.) In 1998, the watershed was listed as impaired by excessive sediment discharge and

3 sedimentation and the TMDL project was initiated.

4 33. The TMDL Action Plan itself shows an overall reduction in sediment loading from

5 anthropogenic sources after 1997, resulting from sound forest management practices including

6 those implemented by HRC since 2008.

7 34. Petitioner is informed and believes and on that basis alleges that significant causes

8 of sediment deposition, retention, and resultant flooding also are located downstream (outside

9 Petitioner's control) and result from background conditions and other human modifications of the

10 Elk River floodplain and Humboldt Bay. Any requirements to remediate or control sediment

11 discharges that occurred either under permits or prior to adoption of the Porter-Cologne Water

12 Quality Control Act and the WDRs are illegal de facto Cleanup and Abatement Orders.

13 F. Petitioner's Stewardship and WDRs

14 35. As acknowledged by the Regional Water Board, approximately 15 to 20 years ago,

15 forestry practices were substantially modified to prevent and significantly minimize sediment

16 effects. Changes included new road construction and wet weather use requirements, improved

17 logging methods, no harvest and expanded riparian protection zones, watershed-wide harvest

18 acreage limitations, and monitoring and reporting programs.

19 36. On HRC property, with the creation of the company in 2008, clearcut logging and

20 harvest of old-growth timber on its lands were immediately eliminated. Petitioner and the

21 preceding landowner have also spent millions of dollars since 1999 to inventory and remove

22 virtually all the controllable legacy sediment sources from the landscape on HRC's ownership,

23 preventing that sediment from being discharged into the Elk River system. HRC maintains

24 effective contemporary erosion control practices.

25 37. The TMDL and TMDL Action Plan effectively ignore the extensive empirical

26 information and analysis that Petitioner has submitted in support of its current timber harvest

27 operations and long-term management plans. Petitioner has expended considerable time,

28 resources, and energy on technical analyses and field investigations of sediment sources,
- 10 -
VERIFIED PETITION FÖR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

4826-4544-0172.v5

conditions and processes affecting the identified "impacted reaches." Petitioner also conducts

2 continual watershed analysis activities, as part of a state- and federally-approved Habitat

3 Conservation Plan with oversight by federal and state agencies.

38. HRC operates in the Elk River drainage under enforceable Riparian Management
Zones established under its approved Habitat Conservation Plan to protect and restore aquatic

6 resources, beneficial uses and water quality. Petitioner's extensive research and study
demonstrate that changes in forestry practices have been effective in controlling logging-related

8 sediment.

9 39. Ongoing activities, even when conducted in the most responsible manner possible,

10 nonetheless cannot prevent all sediment discharges. Even the TMDL Action Plan recognizes that

11 a zero load allocation must be a "conceptual" zero value because no amount of land use

12 restriction can physically result in zero loading of non-point source sediment, as alleged herein.

13 Thus, by definition a prescriptive zero load allocation is unattainable and cannot be justified,

14 particularly for a naturally occurring constituent.

15 40. Also problematic, the 2019 WDRs and State Board Resolution strong-arm HRC to

16 remediate the impacted reach if it wants to continue timber harvesting and management activities

17 on its geographically-removed property. This is the definition of an exaction.

18 41. The zero load allocation also dismisses the undisputed effectiveness of years of

19 inventorying, removing, and controlling legacy sediment as required by Cleanup and Abatement

20 Orders and HRC's Aquatic Habitat Conservation Plan, which is already reducing both near- and

21 long-term sediment loading. The arbitrary and capricious nature of the load allocation is laid bare

22 by the fact that Petitioner's management methods are, in fact, already contributing to the solution,

23 rather than the problem. The zero load allocation jeopardizes these ongoing removal activities

24 which do occasionally result in some, albeit minimal, short term sediment discharge in exchange

25 for long term sediment removal benefit. As HRC commented, these ongoing activities are also

26 jeopardized by the fact they are typically conducted and funded as part of ongoing forestry

27 activities including timber harvest which the zero load allocation seeks to constrain further.

28
- 11 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

4826-4544-0172.v5

1 42. Petitioner's management plans have resulted in net reduction of sediment loading

2 from the Upper Elk River in relation to baseline conditions, and a reduction in sediment inputs in

3 relation to inputs that would occur without Petitioner's operations.

4 43. Petitioner has voluntarily supported stewardship efforts to improve impaired

5 conditions in the Lower Elk; but has consistently objected to any imposition of regulatory

6 remediation obligations as a condition upon its operations. Although the TMDL Action Plan
characterizes remediation efforts as non-regulatory, it improperly ties remediation to the

8 regulatory obligations and limitations on land management imposed only on Petitioner (and one

9 other timber operator). This quid pro quo is improper.

10 Administrative Proceedings

11 A. Regional Board Actions

12 44. On December 23, 2015, the Regional Board provided public notice of the

13 proposed TMDL Action Plan and Basin Plan Amendment and opened a 45-day public comment
14 period. On April 7, 2016, the Regional Water Board held a public hearing and received oral

15 comments and testimony on the proposed TMDL Action Plan/Basin Plan Amendment, the

16 Regional Board's proposed program of implementation for the Upper Elk River Watershed

17 TMDL.

18 45. Throughout the TMDL development process, Petitioner submitted comments at

19 workshops, during designated public comment periods, and at public hearings. Specifically,

20 Petitioner and its counsel submitted separate comment letters, and HRC's expert Dr. Lee.

21 MacDonald submitted an extensive technical report, on February 15, 2016. Representatives also

22 gave oral presentations at public hearings on April 7, 2016 and May 12, 2016 regarding

23 Petitioner's concerns. As explained in these and other comments, deficiencies in the TMDL

24 Action Plan included an inaccurate depiction of current reasons for impairment and an established

25 load allocation without clear, measurable, and attainable targets.

26 46. Petitioner identified deficiencies in three related categories: (i) sediment TMDL

27 and the unfounded, unjustified, and infeasible zero load allocation; (ii) sediment source analysis

28 (including inaccurate assessments of natural loading and anthropogenic streamside landslide and
• 12 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

4826-4544-0172.v5

bank erosion); and (iii) exclusion of the Lower Elk River watershed (and significant contributors

2 to impairment) from the TMDL Action Plan.

3 47. To address TMDL Action Plan deficiencies, CAL FIRE recommended several

4 revisions, including that the Regional Water Board (i) reflect a more feasible target condition

5 since evidence suggests that "equilibrium" conditions may not be the norm in the Lower Elk

6 River; (ii) address the uncertainty of achieving downstream objectives for hillslope-related

7 sediment load reduction measures; (iii) reconsider the sediment source analysis; and (iv) modify

8 numeric targets to reflect more achievable outcomes.

48. On May 12, 2016, the Regional Board adopted the TMDL Action Plan by

10 Resolution No. R1-2016-0017. The three main components of the Program of Implementation

11 detailed in the TMDL Action Plan include: (i) revising regulatory programs to reduce sediment

12 loads (regulation of upslope discharges under WDRs or Waivers,); (ii) implementing necessary

13 and feasible instream and channel remediation and restoration; and (iii) establishing a Watershed

14 Stewardship Program lead by Humboldt County. The TMDL Action Plan failed to account

15 properly for commenters' concerns.

16 49. In light of the sediment accretion in the impacted reachlargely downstream from

17 Petitioner's property and operationsthe Regional Water Board concluded that sediment loading

18 capacity ("the a greatest amount of loading that a water can receive without violating water quality

19 standards," 40 C.F.R. Part 130.2(f)) is "reasonably defined" as zero, "until such time as the
20 impacted reach can be remediated and channel function restored." Resolution No. R1-2016-0017,

21 1 13. The Regional Board declared that "the total maximum daily load of sediment that can be

22 discharged on an annual basis must be zero (TMDL = 0)." Id.

23 50. However, the Regional Water Board noted that estimating the sediment loading

24 capacity of a natural system as zero "is inherently conservative since no amount of source control,

25 remediation, and restoration can completely eliminate sediment transport downstream." In

26 addition, the TMDL in turn derived from a sediment source analysis that incorporated additional

27 layers of conservative assumptions. Resolution No. R1-2016-0017, f 16.

1 51. Although the TMDL Action Plan established a zero load allocation (see Resolution

2 No. R1-2016-0017, T 14), the load allocation was not intended or drafted to be absolute. Rather,

3 it is a "best estimate" of loading, which estimates may range from "reasonably accurate" to "gross
4 I allotments..." 40 C.F.R. Part 130.2(g); Resolution No. R1-2016-0017, 1 14. Significantly, the

5 Regional Water Board stated, "the Board had discretion on how it chooses to implement it [the

6 zero load allocation]. The zero load allocation is a basic construct that directs the Board to craft

7 waste discharge requirements in a manner that reduce and eliminate discharges to the maximum
extent practicable." Resolution No. R1-2016-0017, T 14 (emphasis added). According to the

9 Regional Board, the "zero load allocation is necessarily conceptual." TMDL Action Plan at 6.

10 52. The TMDL Action Plan was intended to provide a reasonable, flexible approach to

11 water quality improvements and the load allocation established by the Regional Water Board was

12 expressly not intended to handicap the agency's ability and discretion to create reasonable WDRs.

13 B. State Water Board Revi v and Order

14 53. On December 15, 2016, the State Water Board issued notice of a 33-day public

15 comment period to submit written comments on the Board's proposed approval of the TMDL

16 Action Plan and Basin Plan Amendment.

17 54. The written comment period was the main vehicle for affected operators to submit

18 their concerns to the State Water Board. Although the agency stated it would separately publish

19 an agenda for a public meeting on these issues, public commentary at that meeting would be
20 circumscribed: "Oral comments at the State Water Board meeting generally will be limited to a

21 summary of the written comments submitted during the written comment period." Notice of

22 Opportunity to Comment, at 1. The notice further directed any questions to Regional Water

23 Board staff.

24 55. On January 17, 2017, HRC submitted a comment letter to the State Water Board

25 discussing deficiencies in the TMDL that it had previously raised to the Regional Water Board,

26 including significant technical and legal flaws pertaining to the decision to exclude the lower

27 portion of the watershed affecting the identified "impacted reaches," elements of the sediment

28

4826-4544-0172.v5

1 source analysis, and the assignment of a zero load allocation for forestry operations on county and

2 state zoned private timberlands.

3 56. On July 14, 2017, the Executive Officer of the Regional Water Board made minor,
non-substantive amendments to the TMDL Action Plan, as authorized by Regional Water Board

5 Resolution.

6 57. On August 1, 2017, the State Water Board adopted (by 4-0 vote, with Vice Chair

7 Steven Moore absent) Resolution No. 2017-0046, approving the Basin Plan Amendment to
incorporate the TMDL Action Plan for the Upper Elk River sediment TMDL.

58. In the State Water Board Resolution, the board singled-out requirements

10 applicable to the "two major upstream landowners"--Petitioner and Green Diamondbut not

11 other anthropogenic sources. The Board also expressly directed its comments to the timber

12 industry. Resolution No. 2017-0046, 11 8-9.

13 59. In particular, the State Board stated that hillslope indicators and numeric targets

14 apply throughout a discharger's area of land ownership and not solely in areas of active harvest.

15 60. In addition, the State Board markedly departed from the language crafted by the
16 Regional Water Board regarding the conceptual and flexible nature of the zero load allocation.

17 Instead, the State Board stated its "understanding," among other things, that "the WDRs and any

18 other orders for the two major landowners [that conduct timber harvesting] will also contain any

19 additional specific provisions to ensure that all anthropogenic discharges of sediment are
20 minimized and eliminated," and "in the absence of a future amendment to the TMDL Action

21 Plan…the WDRs and any other orders will require the landowners to achieve the zero load

22 allocation for all anthropogenic discharges of sediment as soon as feasible, but no later than

23 2031." Id., 9 (emphasis added). Further, the State Board ordered its interpretation to be

24 incorporated in a new review of HRC's 2016 WDRs. Specifically, the State Board ordered that

25 the Regional Board reopen and reissue the 2016 WDRs and apply the State Board's
26 "understandings" rather than implement the provisions of the TMDL that the Resolution was

27 approving. The State Board imposed these extraordinary requirements without proposing any

28 amendment to the TMDL itself following proper procedures. Id., 1 2 at p. 3.
- 15 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

4826-4544-0172.v5

1 61. In a later clarification of its understanding, the State Board stated that "the WDRs

2 and any other orders for the two major landowners will also contain any additional specific

3 provisions to ensure that all anthropogenic discharges of sediment are eliminated to the extent

4 feasible and, if not feasibly eliminated, minimized as soon as feasible but not later than 2031."

5 Letter from Assistant Chief Counsel Philip G. Wyels to Wayne M. Whitlock, October 15, 2018

6 (reflecting clarified language, with emphasis added).

7 62. As alleged above, based on the record before it, the Regional Water Board never

8 intended the zero load allocation to apply in absolute terms. Missing from the State Water
Board's analysis is any understanding that the zero load allocation is inherently conservative and,

10 a more importantly, is a basic construct that directs the Regional Water Board to craft WDRs in a

11 manner that reduces and eliminates discharges to the maximum extent practicable but not through
12 the prescriptive, inflexible approach imposed by the State Board Resolution. In taking its

13 unwarranted hardline approach targeting timber operations and land holdings, the State Water

14 Board effectively co-opted the Regional Water Board's reserved discretion to implement the zero

15 load allocation in a reasonable manner.

16 63. The State Water Board's findings also were inconsistent with State Board staff

17 responses to comments. Staff stated the Regional Water Board established a zero load allocation

18 "which in its implementation is necessarily conceptual" and is "designed to control all

19 controllable factors," defined as "those actions, conditions, or circumstances resulting from man's

20 activities that may influence the quality of the waters of the State and that may be reasonably

21 controlled." Staff Responses to Public Comments, pp. 3-4 (emphasis added).

22 64. Staff also noted several hedges applicable to the TMDL Action Plan's zero load

23 allocation, including dependence on upslope landowners (Petitioners and U.S. Bureau of Land

24 Management) compliance with Regional Water Board "issued permits" that "to the maximum

25 extent feasible" incorporate targets and indicators to control all "controllable factors" (i.e., that

26 may be reasonably controlled) associated with sediment delivery "towards a sediment allocation

27 of zero." Id. at 4 (emphasis added). The TMDL Action Plan, staff concluded, "affords

28 considerable flexibility as to how the zero load allocation is translated into regulatory actions."
- 16 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

4826-4544-0172.v5

1 Id. at 10, 13-14. In addition, a "zero load allocation is intended to be accomplished by
implementing best management practices and other measures as described in WDRs that control
all controllable factors." Id. at 11-12. There was no indication from staff that the State Water
Board would order revisions to existing WDRs or adoption of additional orders. The zero load
allocation was to be implemented "in future permitting actions." Id. at 12, 14.

65. The State Water Board clearly took issue with the flexible approach adopted into
the TMDL Action Plan itself, but failed to direct an amendment to the Action Plan, which would

8 have been the proper mechanism for considering and implementing such a significant change.
Directing an amendment process would have triggered the opportunity for additional public

10 comment and debate. However, the State Board chose to "reinterpret" and effectively rewrite the

11 clear language of the TMDL Action Plan instead. In so doing, the State Water Board acted

12 outside the bounds of approving the Basin Plan Amendment and imbued the State Water Board

13 Resolution with the effect of an order to the Regional Water Board to revise Petitioner's WDRs

14 and to issue additional orders to mandate a prescriptive zero load allocation on an accelerated

15 timeframe:

16

17 [The State Water Board]…Directs the North Coast Water Board to review its WDRs for the two major landowners in the Upper Elk River Watershed
18 that conduct timber harvesting and revise the WDRs and adopt any additional orders as necessary to make them consistent with the State

19 Water Board's understandings of how the TMDL Action Plan will be implemented as described in finding no. 9, above. The WDRs and any
20 other orders must include interim milestones and earlier compliance requirements than 2031 where appropriate and to the maximum extent
21 feasible. The revisions to the WDRs and the adoption of any additional
orders shall be completed as expeditiously as possible, but no later than

22 January 2019, and the North Coast Water Board shall submit written updates on its the preereti a o ihco progress of the Watershed Stewardship

23 Program to every six months until the revisions to the WDRs and the adoption of any additional orders are completed. (Page
24 3, 1 2, emphasis added.)

25 66. Procedurally and substantively, the State Water Board's Resolution constituted an

26 unwarranted, arbitrary and capricious action that unduly burdens Petitioner's timberland and

27 activities conducted thereon. As Petitioner explained in comment letters, sediment conditions in

28
• 17 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

4826-4544-0172.v5

1 the impacted reaches are a reflection of inherent watershed setting, downstream land use

2 activities, contemporary sea level rise, and sediment loading.

3 67. The current impairment is not solely due to current sediment loading, and

4 particularly not to sediment loading from current forest management activities, which contribute

5 an estimated less than 5% of total loading. The arbitrary TMDL is also inconsistent with other

6 North Coast TMDLs that are set in a range of 20-25% above background conditions.

7 C. 2019 WDRs

g 68. Petitioner was not on notice that the State Water Board would direct re-opening its

9 permits and WDRs under a significantly different standard from that established in the TMDL

10 Action Plan. Nor was HRC given an adequate opportunity to meaningfully comment on such an

11 action, or the reinterpretation of the TMDL Action Plan, which reinterpretation has the effect of

12 imposing new and different obligations on Petitioner than the TMDL Action Plan itself.

13 69. In response to the State Board Resolution, the Regional Board undertook to review

14 and revise HRC's 2016 WDRs. Applying the State Board's new standards mandated in the

15 Resolution, rather than those contained in the approved TMDL, Regional Board staff determined

16 that the 2016 WDRs "may not be fully adequate to implement certain Specific Upper Elk River

17 Watershed Indicators" (2019 WDRs { 29)- -despite the Regional Board's original adoption of

18 findings that the 2016 WDRs were adequate.

19 70. The Regional Board requested that HRC "propose additional measures, where

20 such feasible and appropriate measures exist, to implement the [Table 2] hillslope indicators and

21 numeric targets." Id. (emphasis added). On February 1, 2019, HRC submitted its proposal to

22 supplement the measures contained in the 2016 WDRs, noting its view that then-existing

23 requirements were already more than sufficient to fully implement the requirements of the TMDL

24 Action Plan, including the Table 2 Hillslope Indicators and Numeric Targets, and that such

25 indicators and targets should not be applied as permit limitations (and certainly not where such

26 limitations are not appropriate or feasible). (Exhibit A hereto.)

27 71. Indeed, TMDL indicators and numeric targets may only be incorporated into

28 orders if appropriate and only to the extent feasible, and "incorporation" does not mean
. 18
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

4826-4544-0172.v5

converting "indicator" zones into prescriptive silvicultural limits. Hillslope indicators and

2 numeric targets are not substantive permit limits. Neither are they independently enforceable.
Instead, targets and indicators are assessment tools designed to measure progress, assess, and

4 inform.

72. Under the guise of implementing the State Board Resolution, the Regional Board

6 proposed even more restrictive measures without evidentiary justification. HRC submitted
written comments and oral testimony objecting to the additional measures in light of the proposed

8 action's inconsistency with the TMDL's clear statements regarding the necessarily conceptual
nature of the zero load allocation, the intended role of the indicators and targets, and the

10 requirement of feasibility and controllability in the implementation of the TMDL in WDRs.

11 Comments of counsel, Wayne M. Whitlock (April 15, 2019) (Exhibit B hereto); comments of

12 HRC, Michael W. Miles (April 15, 2019) (Exhibit C hereto).

13 73. On June 19, 2019, the Regional Board adopted Order No. R1-2019-0021,

14 approving revised WDRs for HRC's timber harvesting operations in the Upper Elk River

15 Watershed. On July 19, 2019, HRC submitted a petition for review of that order to the State

16 Board. The State Board failed to take any action on the petition, which was deemed denied by

17 operation of law on October 18, 2019.

18 D. Petitioner's Need to Take Legal Action

19 74. As State Water Board staff indicated, the Regional Water Board set the TMDL and

20 numeric targets that would allow dischargers to continue economic activity on their land while

21 requiring feasible measures to attain the TMDL conceptual zero allocation. Staff also stated "[t]o

22 the extent that ongoing sediment discharges will continue to occur, the North Coast Board found

23 that such discharges are necessary to accommodate important economic and social development

24 in the area and are consistent with the maximum benefit of the people of the state." Staff

25 Responses to Comments, p. 18. In order for Petitioner to reasonably continue any economic

26 activity, the zero load allocation cannot be construed as imposing any limitation other than a

27 conceptual one.

28
19 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

4826-4544-0172.v5

75. The Regional Water Board stressed that (as inappropriate as it was) a zero

2 allocation standard would nonetheless allow the Board to utilize its discretion to allow timber

3 harvesting operations to continue. Necessarily, the Regional Water Board admitted, it is

4 physically impossible to achieve a true zero load allocation. (TMDL Action Plan, Section IV.

5 "no amount of land use restriction can physically result in zero loading of non-point source

6 sediment (i.e., the control of all natural and anthropogenic sediment delivery from the upper
watershed).") The direction by the State Water Board to require achievement of a prescriptive

8 zero load allocation is untenable, unwarranted, and unreasonable. There is simply insufficient

9 evidence that such a burdensome standard applied only to Petitioner would result in recovery of

10 water quality or reduction in impairment to the affected reaches. Nor is it the most efficient or

11 effective manner of addressing watershed sediment issues.

12 76. Petitioner's timber harvesting operations are directly threatened by Respondents'

13 overreaching application of the zero load allocation to its property. The declaration Petitioner

14 seeks from this Court will serve to protect its property and business interests as well as provide

15 direction to Respondents as to the legally permissible scope of WDRs.

16 E. Harm to Petitioner, the Timber Industry, and Economy

17 77. Direct and secondary impacts in the near and long term could also result from the

18 Respondents' imposition of the zero load allocation and implementation of the TMDL Action

19 Plan through the 2019 WDRs. Petitioner owns and manages many thousands of acres of

20 timberland in the Upper Elk River watershed, representing a key component of its lawful and

21 permitted harvesting and management activities. Petitioner is informed and believes and on that

22 basis alleges that a large percentage of the private timber harvested within the State occurs in the

23 North Coast Region. Indeed, timber is one of longest-standing industries in the county.

24 Petitioner, its businesses, and the livelihoods of their employees and contractors, and businesses

25 and employees in the production and supply chain, depend on the continued legally permitted

26 harvest of timber. Planned, sustainable timber harvests on the HRC property are essential to
27 sourcing the HRC sawmill at Scotia and other sawmills in the area that directly and indirectly

28 employ thousands who work in the woods as foresters and loggers, or are mill workers or work
20 -

4826-4544-0172.v5

for suppliers of goods and services supporting forest management and lumber manufacturing. A

2 reliable supply of redwood logs is also of critical importance to HRC's customers who currently

3 offer natural, sustainable redwood as a decking and fencing product that competes with composite

4 decking, cedar, and treated wood.

5 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

6 (Writ of Mandate, CCP § 1094.5)

7 78. HRC re-alleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations of all

8 foregoing paragraphs.

9 79. HRC contends that Respondents acted contrary to law and prejudicially abused

10 their discretion in the process of imposing HRCs 2019 WDRs: the State Board in requiring the
11 reopening of HRC's 2016 WDRs and dictating imposition of additional measures not included in

12 the TMDL; and the Regional Board in implementing the State Board Resolution and imposing

13 other overreaching requirements in adopting the 2019 WDRs. Respondents (i) failed to apply the

14 proper legal standard in making their decisions; (ii) adopted findings that are insufficient to

15 support their decisions and/or failed to make required findings; and (üii) made findings and

16 imposed new requirements that are not supported or justified by substantial evidence in the

17 administrative record.

18 80. HRC challenges those aspects of the 2019 WDRs that exceed the Report of Waste

19 Discharge (ROWD) as modified by HRC's February 1, 2019 supplemental proposal, including

20 the following:

21 a) Imposition of TMDL "Riparian Management Zones" (TMDL RMZs) that impose

22 inappropriate and infeasible harvesting and management restrictions to 64 percent

23 of HRC's Property in the Upper Elk River Watershed and improperly convert the

24 indicator zones (an assessment tool for meeting numeric targets) into prescriptive

25 permit limits, without scientific basis or justification;

26 b) Extension of the five-year moratorium on timber harvesting (from the 2016

27 WDRs) for an additional three years, and expanding it from limited harvests to

28
- 21 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

4826-4544-0172.v5

2 prohibiting any harvesting, with only an open-ended review of the moratorium at

u p W the end of the eight-year period;
c) Extension of the five-year Timber Harvesting Plan enrollment process (from the
2016 WDRs) for an additional three years;
d) The requirement of a feasibility study for removal of pre-existing instream

o0 sediment caused by natural processes and possibly legacy activities, but not HRC's
timber operations;

9 e) Operational wet weather restrictions above and beyond those already required by

10 the Forest Practice Rules and operator-specific HCP;

11 f) All other provisions that exceed those proposed in the ROWD and supplemental
proposal.

12 81.

13 In HRC's comments on the proposed 2019 WDRs, it continued its objections to

14 provisions over and above those included in HRC's ROWD. Whitlock Comment Letter, at 5.

82.

15 The measures proposed by HRC meet the goals of the TMDL and provide water

16 quality protection (including through state-of-the science, watershed-specific silviculture). There

17 is no evidencemuch less substantial evidencethat measures beyond those included in HRC's

18 technically-based painstaking ROWD and supplemental proposal are necessary, feasible, or

appropriate.

19 83.

20 Resource agencies (NOAA Fisheries, California Department of Fish and Wildlife

21 and CAL FIRE) criticized the technical basis and justification for measures beyond those in the

22 ROWD, characterizing the additional measures as unnecessary.

84.

23 On April 15, 2019, representatives of CAL FIRE commented on areas within their

24 expertise and specific experience with HRC's operations and regulations thereof, including the

25 need for relevant empirical evidence and best available peer-reviewed literature, or scientifically

26 valid studies or monitoring data.

85.

27 HRC submitted significant volumes of data collected pursuant to the monitoring

28 requirements of the Regional Board, as well as HRC's HCP and other scientific studies only to
have the Regional Board ignore the data and input of other trustee agencies with expertise and
22
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

4826-4544-0172.v5

F regulatory authority in adopting the overreaching requirements of the 2016 WDRs and then the

2 2019 WDRs.

3 86. HRC questioned the lack of scientific support demonstrating a cause and effect

4 relationship between the additional requirements imposed in the 2019 WDRs and the downstream

5 water quality objectives the agency hopes to achieve. Indeed, those measures will not restore

6 conditions in the impacted lower reach. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis

7 alleges, that the Regional Board's Elk River Recovery Assessment Framework Report states that

8 other inherent and anthropogenic conditions and processes substantially control and contribute to

9 current downstream beneficial use impairments and nuisances.

10 87. The Regional Board lacks authority, and it is arbitrary and capricious, to require

11 Humboldt Redwood to remediate or control passive migration of "legacy" sediment (i.e.,

12 sedimentation caused by the historic land management activities of prior owners in the Elk River

13 Watershed, including pre-Porter-Cologne Act logging activities).

14 88. In addition, as to "high risk" areas, the Regional Board extended and expanded the

15 prohibition on harvest activities for multiple years-despite the admitted lack of conclusive data as

16 to whether ongoing timber harvesting contributes to high sediment loads or not. Indeed, HRC.
17 monitoring has established that it does not.

18 89. The Regional Board abused its discretion by failing to consider the actual

19 necessity of additional measures imposed in the 2019 WDRs over and above the measures

20 proposed in HRC's ROWD and 2019 supplemental proposal. Further, the Regional Board failed

21 to respond adequately to HRC's objections and comments, as well as the comments of the lead

22 and trustee agencies. In response to the detailed and lengthy comments provided by HRC and its

23 counsel, the Regional Board responded in a mere handful of conclusory pages, largely ignoring

24 the meat of the comments. The Regional Board and staff also ignored several comments on

25 behalf of HRC at the public hearing, including the requirement to make feasibility findings and

26 HRC's comments that it had proposed other equally effective methods to meet water quality

27 objectives that were consistent with HRC's management approach (as opposed to the

28 management approach dictated by the Regional Board's additional measures).
23
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

4826-4544-0172.v5

90. In fact, rather than providing scientific support for the additional measures,

2 including the TMDL RMZs, the Regional Board staff cited "professional judgment" as its

3 justification in the adoption hearing. Professional judgment of the Regional Board staff, who are
not professional foresters, does not provide the necessary justification and "substantial evidence"

necessary to support infeasible additional measures.

91. The Porter-Cologne Act and the Basin Plan impose feasibility and controllability
limitations upon the Regional Board. There is no evidence that the Regional Board adequately
considered the required factors of feasibility or controllability in the requirements imposed upon

9 HRC. Further, the Regional Board failed to make findings with adequate support that the

10 disputed measures were in fact feasible or that the sediment targeted by them is in fact

11 controllable. The combination of the new TMDL RMZs and the now eight-year harvest

12 moratorium in designated watersheds would cripple HRC's Elk River Watershed operations

13 indefinitely. HRC's ownership in the watershed contains Timberland Production Zoned lands,

14 meaning the use of these lands is limited to timber production and compatible uses. The 2019

15 WDRs unreasonably limit HRC's forest management on 14,036 acres and keep an additional
16 3,343 acres out of timber production for at least eight years. Regional Board staff stated at the

17 public hearing on the 2019 WDRs that those prescriptions could be relaxed only if downstream

18 conditions improveand that is left to the "voluntary" Stewardship Program. In reality, the

19 combination of the unjustified and extraordinary WDR measures and the stewardship program is

20 an indirect means of coercion; HRC is left with supporting the downstream remediation of

21 sedimentation that it did not cause or else be forced to implement increasingly burdensome

22 restrictions on its timber harvest and management that have no established connection to the

23 downstream problem.

24 92. The 2019 WDRs further violate the Water Code's prohibition on specifying the

25 means of compliance with water quality standards. Waste discharge requirements may not

26 specify the design, location, type of construction, or particular manner in which compliance may

27 be had with a requirement, order or decree. HRC proposed well-substantiated, scientifically-

28 supported measures in the ROWD and supplemental proposal, but the Regional Board failed to
• 24 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

4826-4544-0172.v5

analyze the adequacy or inadequacy of those measures and summarily imposed alternative

2 measures.

93. Petitioner is informed and believes and on that basis alleges that Respondents also
failed to proceed in the manner required by law by violating legal requirements for hearings and

meetings.

6 94. For all the reasons alleged, Respondents' decisions and orders constituted arbitrary
and capricious action. HRC has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy at law to correct the errors
committed by Respondents other than through the relief sought by this Petition.
9 95. Accordingly, HRC seeks a determination and judgment that Respondents

10 committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion by failing to proceed in the manner required by law,

11 in that they failed to adopt feasibility findings, their decisions are not supported by their findings,

12 and findings are not supported by substantial evidence in the record.

13 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

14 (California Environmental Quality Act, Pub. Res. Code § 21000 et seq. ("CEQA"))

15 96. HRC re-alleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations of all
16 foregoing paragraphs.

17 97. As Petitioner and/or or its legal counsel commented during public hearings and/or

18 in written comments, the State Board's imposition of the new conditions and the Regional

19 Board's adoption of the 2019 WDRs implementing them also violated CEQA. CEQA does not
20 require or authorize implementation of infeasible mitigation measures. Pub. Res. Code §§ 21002,

21 21081; CCR §§ 15091, 15093. Respondents failed to make necessary findings concerning

22 feasibility and their decisions are not supported by substantial evidence in the record.

23 98. HRC's counsel's comment letter demonstrated that ROWD activities would result

24 in cumulative environmental benefits and that additional measures beyond the ROWD and

25 supplemental proposal were infeasible. The Regional Board, however, failed to analyze

26 feasibility factors, including economic impact. Moreover, no substantial evidence supports the

27 Regional Board's determination that ROWD activities would result in potentially significant

28 environmental effects (requiring the specified additional mitigation). Respondents further failed
25
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

4826-4544-0172.v5

to analyze potential environmental impacts from the WDRs measures themselves, where other

2 measures are environmentally beneficial.

99. The administrative record demonstrates that downstream sediment impacts are
cumulative, accruing over the past 150 years and caused by multiple sources. Yet, the 2019
WDRs under the guise of implementing the State Board Order improperly impose an undue
burden of measures designed to address cumulative impacts on HRC, well beyond HRC's share
for cumulative impacts.

8 100. Petitioner has performed all conditions precedent to filing this action including

9 exhaustion of administrative remedies to the extent required by law and complying with notice

10 provisions of Public Resources Code §§ 21167.5 (Exhibit D hereto) and 21167.7 (Exhibit E

11 hereto).

12 101. Accordingly, HRC seeks a determination and judgment that Respondents

13 committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion by failing to proceed in the manner required by law,

14 imposing mitigation beyond that legally permissible under CEQA, and failing to adopt feasibility

15 findings. Respondents' decisions are not supported by their findings, and the findings are not

16 supported by substantial evidence in the record.

17 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

18 (Taking)

19 102. HRC re-alleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations of all

20 foregoing paragraphs.

21 103. The Regional Board's imposition of additional measures in the 2019 WDRs

22 violate limitations on agency regulatory action and constitute unlawful and overreaching

23 exactions without a sufficient nexus or rough proportionality to HRC's proposed activities.

24 104. Respondents' decisions alleged herein unfairly and unreasonably impose

25 substantial regulatory and legal obligations upon Petitioner and its operations without a rational

26 nexus to Petitioner's past, present, and future operations on the HRC property. Petitioner, and

27 one other landowner, are the only landowners targeted with the arbitrary "zero load" standard

28 such that their lawful land use is restricted until other parties and processes that are beyond
• 26 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

4826-4544-0172.v5

Petitioner's control rectify sedimentation in a downstream floodplain that was caused and
exacerbated by a number of natural and human factors. In the alternative, Petitioner is forced to
bear the burden of rectifying downstream sedimentation to continue its lawful operations.

105. Petitioner bears this burden despite (a) the fact that Petitioner had no hand in the
historic sediment accretion in the floodplain, (b) compelling evidence that current use of the HRC
property under Petitioner's highly protective management practices does not contribute to that
floodplain sediment accretion-the actual problem the TMDL and Action Plan is designed to

8 address, and (c) clear evidence in the record that the downstream causes of sediment accretion

9 were not considered to determine whether the load allocation would be effective.

10 106. A "zero load" standard would impose a serious, infeasible restriction that would

11 deprive Petitioner of ongoing economic, lawful and permitted business activities without any

12 effective improvement in the downstream sediment condition that is the premise for the TMDL

13 and the TMDL Action Plan and the implementing 2019 WDRs.

14 107. As alleged herein, many of the requirements of the 2019 WDRs that HRC has

15 objected to constitute impermissible land-use exactions and permit conditions, violating the

16 requirements of rough proportionality and an essential nexus between the demands and regulatory

17 burdens on HRC and the impacts of permitted timber harvesting operations.

18 108. The Regional Board has not established an essential nexus or rough proportionality

19 between the permit conditions imposed on HRC's upstream timber operations and the
20 downstream impaired conditions that it seeks to correct. Instead, the permit conditions in the

21 2019 WDRs are out and out exactions that exceed the level of mitigation allowable under the law

22 by requiring HRC to mitigate beyond the effects of HRC's own proposed activities.

23 109. The zero-load allocation and objectionable permit conditions contained within the

24 2019 WDRs substantially interfere with HRC's beneficial use of its property for timber

25 harvesting, implicating HRC's investment-backed expectations, and entitling HRC to just

26 compensation. Article I, section 19 of the California Constitution and the Fifth Amendment to

27 the United States Constitution prohibit the taking of private property for public use without just

28 compensation. Respondents have not compensated HRC for the regulatory taking as alleged

1 herein. HRC has incurred and will continue to incur attorney's fees, expert fees, and costs

2 relating to this proceeding in amounts that cannot yet be ascertained. HRC proposes to bifurcate

3 the proceeding to allow a second phase, if necessary, to amend the petition to include further

4 allegations of an inverse condemnation action.

5 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

6 (Writ of Mandate, CCP § 1085)

7 110. HRC re-alleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations of all
foregoing paragraphs.

9 111. Although Water Code section 13330(e) provides that Code of Civil Procedure

10 section 1094.5 generally governs proceedings filed under the former section, in the alternative,

11 this Court has authority to render judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 on the

12 same grounds and facts alleged above.

13 112. For all the reasons alleged herein, Respondents' decisions, actions and approvals

14 constituted arbitrary and capricious action. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy at

15 law to correct the errors committed by Respondents other than through the relief sought by this
16 Petition.

17 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

18 (Declaratory Relief, CCP § 1060) §

19 113. HRC re-alleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations of all
20 foregoing paragraphs.

21 114. This case presents a justiciable issue in that the Petitioner has and continues to

22 conduct timber harvesting and management operations on the HRC property that have been duly

23 permitted and authorized, including through the Regional Water Board's historical issuance of

24 WDRs to Petitioner.

25 115. Petitioner has fully complied with all applicable requirements of California and

26 federal law in the operation of its forest practices.

27 116. Enforcement of a prescriptive zero load allocation and other permit conditions as

28 directed by the State Water Board and incorporated into the 2019 WDRs will unconstitutionally
28
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

4826-4544-0172.v5

deprive Petitioner of property rights without due process of the law and violate the constitutional

2 limitations on regulatory requirements of essential nexus and proportionality.

3 117. Moreover, the process directed by the State Water Board and incorporated into the

4 2019 WDRs is contrary to provisions of law granting Petitioner due process in the permit review

5 and revision process, and is therefore unlawful.

6 118. A declaratory judgment in this matter would terminate the unconstitutional

7 application of the zero load allocation and other permit conditions to Petitioner, would afford

8 relief from the uncertainty, cost, disruption, conflict and controversy giving rise to this

9 proceeding, and would prevent a similar situation from arising in the future.

10 119: This matter is most properly resolved through a declaratory judgment issued by

11 this Court. The matter involves important questions of the constitutionality of the net zero load

12 allocation and permit conditions as applied to Petitioner. It is therefore of critical importance to

13 Petitioner and the public at large.

14 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

15 WHEREFORE, Petitioner and Plaintiff prays for entry of judgment as follows:

16 120. For a judgment that the State Water Board and the Regional Water Board

17 committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion for the reasons stated herein;

18 121. For the issuance of a writ of mandate compelling the Regional Water Board to set

19 aside and vacate the challenged portions of the 2019 WDRs and/or modify the 2019 WDRs as

20 alleged herein;

21 122. For an order that the State Water Board is estopped from imposing the provisions

22 of paragraphs 2 (page 3) and 9 of the State Water Board Resolution against the Regional Wäter

23 Board and/or Petitioner, or at all;

Mr. Matt St. John, Executive Officer
North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board
5550 Skylane Blvd Ste A
Santa Rosa, CA 95403-1072

Dear Mr. St. John:

M apologize for the extended delay in responding to you letter of December 15, 2017 requesting input regarding the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) Resolution No. 2017-0046. As you are aware, we sought and were given clarification by the SWRCB of
the order in an additional letter to our counsel dated October 15, 2018. On behalf of our
entire organization we are deeply disappointed, after so much effort was put into the process
of adopting the Elk River TMDL and our subsequent WWDR that we find ourselves revisiting
this issue. It was abundantly clear at the time of adoption of the TMDL it was the intent of your board for the WDR to be the mechanism where enforceable measures were developed. The TMDL was to provide guidance and goals and the zero-load allocation, was by its very
nature, conceptual.

want to reiterate our concern that the SWRCB and the RWQCB have now adopted a policy
that, if left unchanged, will result in our company being forced to cease all operations in Elk River in 12 years. Zero sediment discharge is an unattainable standard for our operations.
We have implemented necessary measures for our operations, consistent with the intent of
the TMDL, to limit sediment discharge associated with our current management practices to
a level of insignificance. The adoption of a policy that requires the elimination of all
discharges within the next 12 years is unattainable.

It has been made clear to us, it is not the intent of the RWQCB to force us to cease all
operations in Elk River. It is also clear that all parties involved in this process anticipate that
progress will be made to address sedimentation, specifically within the lower Elk River watershed over this twelve-year time frame thereby allowing this order to modified. None the less, our company is faced with the dire certainty, that without specific intervening action
to modify this order within these twelve years, we will be prohibited from managing our timberlands within Elk River in 2031.

You have asked for input as to how the current WDRS (Order R1-2016-0004) should be revised to ensure the WDRs fully address the hillslope indicators and numeric targets listed in Table 2 of the Upper Elk River TMDL Action Plan; and what additional specific provision(s)

does HRC propose to ensure that all anthropogenic discharges of sediment are eliminated or
minimized to the extent feasible.

HRC has carefully reviewed its current approved WDRs within the context of implementing
Table 2 of the TMDL Action Plan for consistency with the SWRCB resolution. A 'crosswalk'
(Attachment A) was developed to evaluate the extent to which the WDRs address all the
TMDL indicator and numeric targets listed in Table 2. This crosswalk is helpful in
demonstrating how the existing WDRs implement the complete suite of hillslope indicators and numeric targets. Additional provisions we are proposing to be incorporated into revised WDRs are also shown in response to your request for further certainty that all discharge be eliminated or minimized to the extent feasible. These additional provisions address wet weather road use and timber operations within 300 feet of Class I and II watercourses and
150 feet of Class III watercourses. Specific WDR revisions are proposed in Attachment B.
The Upper Elk River: Technical Analysis for Sediment (Tetra Tech 2015) identifies roads and stream channels as the most significant anthropogenic sediment sources of the most recent
period analyzed (2004-2011) compared to other controllable sources such as landslides and
surface erosion from harvest areas. Tetra Tech estimates harvest related landslides and
surface erosion sediment delivery combine to be less than 2 percent of total loading
compared to roads, which are estimated to deliver 16 percent, and 38 percent from in- channel sources (i.e. low order channel incision, bank erosion, and streamside landslides).
While delivery from roads is effectively controlled and reduced through improved BMPs, in- channel sources are more complicated. Channel conditions have been altered by historic practices which prior to the 1970s commonly used stream channels for transportation corridors. These altered channel conditions are presumed to have higher rates of chronic erosion in response to winter storms than undisturbed channels. The practices which led to
these in-channel conditions have long since been abandoned and are prohibited under the
current WDRs and FPRs. Modern road building and harvesting techniques have relocated disturbance out of and away from sensitive riparian areas.
We are therefore left to consider what additional actions might be taken to eliminate and minimize the effects of these past stream channel impacts. Class II, and III watercourses
are currently afforded substantial protection during timber operations under the current
WDRs promoting the restoration of mature riparian forest structure and canopy cover, large
wood recruitment to channels, slope stability, and ground cover. Harvest-related peak flow
effects have been addressed through harvest acre limitations established at the sub- watershed level. Stream restoration activities reflecting the most feasible approach for addressing stream channel conditions include:
> HRC's removal of over 170,000 cubic yards of sediment from stream channels at historic
crossing locations since 2008
HRC's North Fork Elk River Coho Help Act large wood introduction project (completed)
Cal-Trout's Wrigley floodplain restoration project (completed by HRC) Redwood Community Action Association (RCAA) and the North Coast Regional Land Trust (NRLT) joint floodplain restoration project on Martin Slough (completed; lower Elk River)

channel conditions.

Riparian Zones (Existing and New Provisions) 1. Recognition that the characteristics found within 300 feet of either side of Class and II watercourses, and within 150 feet of either side of Class III watercourses are the indicators
used to evaluate riparian forest conditions specific to delivery of wood to channels, slope
stability, and ground cover pursuant Table 2 of the TMDL Action Plan. We continue to ensure
these characteristics meet numeric targets through the combination of existing measures
found in the WDRs along with new measures.
2. Existing measures occurring within these TMDL Action Plan prescribed indicator zones of
influence include, but are not limited to (1) primarily selection silviculture and total exclusion
of clearcutting; (2) use of a slope stability checklist and licensed geologic review for the
identification and mitigation of slope stability issues; (3) no harvest zones adjacent Class
and II watercourses providing for maximum shade, wood delivery, slope and bank stability, and undisturbed ground cover; (4) established HCP riparian management zones (RMZs)
which exclude the entry of heavy ground based equipment, require the retention of significant forest canopy cover and all down wood, and allow for only single-tree selection/no
group harvest; (5) retention of 18 largest trees per acre within 100 feet of Class watercourses; (6) no ignition of burning or mechanical site preparation within RMZs; (7) no
harvest of Class III channel trees or trees located on unstable slopes adjacent Class III
watercourses; (8) no watercourse crossings except at regulatorily permitted locations; (9)
additional riparian management requirements and harvest limitations for the WDR identified
High Risk Areas including the Clapp Gulch, Railroad Gulch, Tom Gulch, McCloud Creek, and portion of Lower South Fork Elk River sub-basins.
3. New proposed WDR provisions include (1) retention of a minimum of 50 percent post harvest
forest canopy cover well distributed throughout the HCP Class III RMZs; (2) exclusion of group selection harvest areas from within Class III RMZs; (3) no new road construction or re- construction, ground-based logging or site preparation within 300 feet of a Class I or II
watercourse or within 150 feet of a Class III watercourse between October 15 and May 1.

Wet Weather Road Use (New Provisions)
1. Limit log hauling operations to permanent rocked all-season roads meeting HCP storm-proof standards between November 15th and April 1 st. 2. Require a minimum of 48 hours (two days) for roads to dry out following any rain-related
shut down of hauling caused by a precipitation event of greater than 0.25 inches rainfall within any 24-hour period before resuming log hauling. All other existing requirements for
specific road conditions to be met prior to resuming hauling continue to apply.
3. Require erosion control materials be stock-piled on site for all road construction activities
occurring between September 15th and October 15th, and that these materials to be applied
by the end of day prior to any day for which the National Weather Forecast is for a 'chance'
(30 percent or greater) of rain.

As noted above, the TMDL Action Plan identifies the characteristics of riparian zones 300 feet on either side of Class I and II watercourses, and 150 feet on either side of Class IlI
watercourses, as the indicator for meeting numeric targets related to recruitment of wood
to channels, slope stability, and ground cover. Actual riparian zones in the ecological sense rarely if ever extend 300 feet upslope of Class I and II watercourses and 150 feet of Class III
watercourses; however, activities occurring at these distances have the potential to influence processes within the actual riparian area. HRC's approach to riparian conservation and
restoration involves a suite of provisions nested within the 300-foot and 150-foot indicator
zones including licensed geologic review and exclusion of clearcutting throughout these
zones along with limitations on road construction and ground-based yarding operations.
The variable width riparian management zones (RMZ) and associated management restrictions found within the TMDL indicator widths have been established specific to the
upper Elk River watershed in consultation with state and federal wildlife agencies for the
purpose of maximizing large wood recruitment, riparian and aquatic temperature control, and minimization of ground disturbance and related potential for sediment delivery. The forest characteristics found within the identified TMDL riparian zones resulting from current
management indicate riparian health associated with active and potential wood recruitment,
slope stability, and ground cover are all improving over time consistent with the goal of the
TMDL's numeric target.

The current WDR prohibition of road construction and re-construction beginning September 15th and prohibition of ground-based yarding beginning October 1st, has proven infeasible as these restrictions are excessive in shortening the logging season, particularly where
seasonal wildlife restrictions for the Northern Spotted Owl and Marbled Murrelet prohibit
timber operations until September 1st, and September 15th, respectively; and have not
demonstrated benefit for reducing and eliminating discharge. Analysis of coastal California weather patterns, including those performed by NCRWQCB staff, demonstrate October as a
seasonally dry month with minimal potential for erosion-producing precipitation in the first half of the month. The proposed modification above linking road construction and ground- based yarding restrictions to the indicators listed in Table 2 of the Action Plan will improve
the efficiency and feasibility of these measures.
We are optimistic you will find our proposed amendment to the WDR satisfy your request to address the SWRCB resolution.

Sincerely:

Code of Regulations, title 14, section 913.2 within Riparian Management Zones.

3. Subwatershed average annual harvest rates from the ROWD (Attachment D) fall
near or below 2% equivalent clearcut acres averaged over any 10 year period and are generally reasonable. Harvest rates above this threshold may cause
concern for cumulative impacts on water quality. Where an individual, or multiple, THP(s) would result in an average annual harvest rate in any
subwatershed above 2% equivalent clearcut acres over any 10 year period, the Executive Officer may decline to enroll the THP(s), or portions of the THP, or
may require additional mitigations or monitoring as a condition of enrollment.

4. Harvesting in High Risk Areas a. High risk areas are defined as those areas identified in HRC's ROWD
amendment request dated October 4, 2016 submitted to the Regional Water

At a minimum, the report shall characterize geologic hazards using a combination of the following data and methods of investigation:
Existing hazard maps derived from slope stability models;
Available maps and reports;
Aerial photographs;
Field investigation and mapping; and
Applicable studies and technical models.

shall include, but are not necessarily limited to the following:
Avoid and minimize canopy removal in areas with elevated landslide
hazard;
Avoid and minimize activities upslope of existing landslide and on
vulnerable portions of deep seated landslides; and Stabilization of existing landslides where applicable by methods such as planting, manipulating drainage, buttressing, and other feasible
engineering techniques.

3. The engineering geologic report may be submitted before or during the THP review process conducted by CAL FIRE, or by request of the Executive Officer. The Regional Water Board staff shall review the engineering geologic report and
may request additional information or require additional conditions be
incorporated to further reduce or mitigate the potential for sediment discharge. If additional information or mitigation is required, HRC shall not proceed with the proposed activity until demonstration that the potential impacts to the beneficial uses of water will be adequately mitigated.

4. HRC shall maintain and update the landslide inventory included in Appendix C of
the ROWD according to the specifications described in the Monitoring and
Reporting Program in Section IV of this Order.

7. Additional wet weather operations shall be consistent with the ROWD and HCP
wet weather prescriptions.

B. Erosion Control Plans
1. HRC shall prepare and submit an inventory of CSDS within, and in the vicinity of, the logging area for all THPs it submits in the UER. Any CSDS not previously inventoried and treated as part of the Road Management activities described in
Section I.D. of this Order shall be inventoried and scheduled for treatment
concurrently with THP operations, including those off-road sites from the master treatment schedule in the vicinity of the THP.

2. These CSDS will be subject to the following:
a. Each CSDS shall be inventoried in an ECP, which will include: a description of
the current condition of each site, an estimate of the potential sediment
volume that could discharge from the site, a narrative description of the proposed management measures, and a schedule for implementation; b. Inventoried CSDS must be treated per the site specific ECP schedule;
C. The ECP shall be submitted to the Regional Water Board for review and approval with the THP it is associated with; and d. If treatment of such sites "strands" any other CSDS, HRC does not relinquish
responsibility for also treating the stranded sites. For logistical reasons, it is recommended that measures be taken to prevent sites from becoming
stranded.

C. Feasibility Study for Control of In-channel Sediment Sources within HRC's
Ownership Boundaries HRC shall conduct a feasibility study to evaluate potential methods to control, trap; or meter sediment from in-channel sources in the UER before such sediment can be
transported to the impacted reach. The feasibility study shall identify potential methods to reduce transport of sediment from tributaries in the UER to the
impacted reach that may include design and implementation of small scale pilot projects. If the pilot projects demonstrate the success of methods to reduce sediment discharge from in-channel sources, HRC shall develop a plan to implement
these methods on a wider scale throughout the UER.

1. By October 15, 2017, HRC shall submit to the Regional Water Board Executive

the North Fork Elk River.

2. By October 15, 2018, HRC shall complete corrective action for all remaining road
related CSDS described in the master treatment schedule in Attachment C. HRC
will continue to prioritize and treat CSDS associated with legacy skid trails according to the schedule described in the master treatment schedule. The
annual report described in Section IV.B.1. shall include a list of those sites
treated during the previous year and those scheduled for treatment during the
upcoming year.

E. Alternatives Methods of Compliance
Many measures proposed in the ROWD are incorporated as enforceable specific
requirements above. Additional water quality protection measures include
subwatershed harvest rates, limited harvesting and additional riparian protections
for Class II and III streams in high risk areas, and a feasibility study for controlling in-channel sediment sources. HRC may propose and submit for approval by the Regional Water Board, alternative measures that can be demonstrated to provide beneficial uses protection and nuisance abatement that is equal or better than that provided by these specific requirements. Any proposed alternative measures shall be submitted in writing to the Regional Water Board Executive Officer. The proposal shall include a description of the alternative measure(s), accompanied by
supporting documentation that the alternative measures will achieve equal or better protection than those specific requirements. The Executive Officer shall bring any meritorious proposal to the Regional Water Board for its consideration after public notice and a hearing.

H. HRC shall maintain copies of all correspondence and records collected and prepared
to document compliance with this Order and provide access to Regional Water Board to review and copy.

I. No discharge of waste into the waters of the state, whether or not the discharge is made pursuant to waste discharge requirements, shall create a vested right to
continue the discharge. All discharges of waste into waters of the state are
privileges, not rights. (Wat. Code, § 13262, subd.(g).)

J. Prior to implementing any change to the project or activity that may have a
significant or material effect on the findings, conclusions, or conditions of this Order,

V. APPLICATION AND ENROLLMENT PROCEDURE

Pursuant to this Order, for the first five years following adoption of this Order, HRC must apply to the Regional Water Board Executive Officer for coverage of individual THPs as described below. After five years, an enrollment process is not required to commence operations for CAL FIRE-approved THPs that fully comply with requirements of this Order, unless notified in writing by the Regional Water Board Executive Officer that the plan is not eligible for coverage.
For the first five years, before operations may commence on an approved THP, HRC must apply for enrollment of the THP under this Order by submitting an enrollment application to the Regional Water Board Executive Officer. The enrollment application must be signed by designated representative of HRC certifying that the THP complies with the terms and provisions of this Order. Prior to enrollment,
Regional Water Board staff will evaluate the THP for compliance with the Order, and at that time may require additional measures for water quality protection as warranted. Timber harvesting activities may not commence until HRC receives written notification from the Regional Water Board Executive Officer that the THP is covered under this Order. It is anticipated that Projects which have had thorough
Regional Water Board staff involvement in the review and approval process will
receive written notification of coverage within ten (10) working days of receipt of a
complete application.

After the first five years, HRC must submit a notice of commencement of operation to the Regional Water Board at least 10 days prior to commencement of operations for a specific THP.

The Regional Water Board Executive Officer, upon finding that a plan may violate any of the terms of the Order, may at any time notify HRC that they must refrain
from commencing, or cease, operations.

VI. RESCISSION AND DENIAL OF COVERAGE

The Executive Officer may rescind or deny coverage for a THP under this Order if, based on substantial evidence, the Executive Officer makes any of the following
determinations:

1. The THP does not comply with Terms and Provisions of this Order;

2. The THP is reasonably likely to result in or has resulted in a violation or exceedence of any applicable Water Quality Standards, US EPA approved load allocation, or
other water quality requirement2;
3. The THP has varied in whole or in any part from the approved THP in any way that could adversely affect water quality;

4. The THP is the subject of an unresolved water quality or procedural issue including,
but not limited to, a non-concurrence filed by the Regional Water Board staff with
CAL FIRE;

5. The THP meets the Terms and Provisions of this Order, but may still result in a
discharge of waste that could adversely affect water quality from any of the
following:
a. An observable increase in sediment discharge from landslides, channel or streambank erosion, or surface or gully erosion associated with harvest
activities;
b. A measurable and significant increase in turbidity or suspended sediment
concentration as a result of harvest related activities;

6. Any operations on an individual, or multiple, THP(s) that would result in an average annual harvest rate in any subwatershed above 2% equivalent clearcut acres over

2 "Water Quality Requirements" means a water quality objective (narrative or numeric), prohibition, TMDL implementation plan, policy, or other requirement contained in a Water Quality Control Plan (Basin Plan) adopted by the Regional Water Board and approved by the State Water Board, and all other applicable plans or
policies adopted by the Regional Water Board or State Water Board, including, but not limited to, State Water Board Resolution No. 68-16, (Statement of Policy with Respect to Maintaining High Quality Waters in California).

any 10 year period that has resulted, or would be likely to result in any of the
following:
a. An observable increase in sediment discharge from landslides, channel or
streambank erosion, or surface or gully erosion associated with harvest
activities;
b. A measurable and significant increase in turbidity or suspended sediment
concentration as a result of harvest related activities; or

7. There are substantive errors or inaccuracies found in information submitted as part
of the THP and enrollment application package that, if known at the time of
application, would have resulted in a denial or limitation of coverage under this
Order.

Upon receipt of a written notice of rescission or denial of coverage for a THP under this
Order, the coverage of the THP under this Order is immediately terminated. Upon
termination, Discharger shall immediately cease all THP activities other than activities
necessary to control further discharges. Projects that are denied coverage may be required to submit a report of waste discharge for site-specific individual WDRs.

CERTIFICATION
All reports required by this Monitoring and Reporting program or other
information requested by the Regional Water Board determination of
compliance shall be signed by a duly authorized representative of HRC. Any
person signing a document under this requirement shall make the following
certification:

Re: DRAFT ORDER NO. R1-2019-0021 - Waste Discharge
Requirements For Nonpoint Source Discharges and Other
Controllable Water Quality Factors Related to Timber Harvesting
and Associated Activities Conducted by Humboldt Redwood
Company, LLC in the Upper Elk River Watershed
Humboldt County - Comments Filed on Behalf of Humboldt
Redwood Company

Dear Members of the Regional Water Quality Control Board and Mr. St. John:

We file the following comments on behalf of Humboldt Redwood Company, LLC
(Humboldt Redwood) on the above-referenced Draft Order for issuance of Waste
Discharge Requirements (WDRs) covering Humboldt Redwood's timber
management operations in the Upper Elk River Watershed. These comments supplement those of Humboldt Redwood Company also submitted today.

I. The Draft WDRs Reflect Serious Flaws in the Elk River TMDL,
Particularly as Improperly Modified by the State Water Board's
Approval Resolution; the Regional Board Should Revisit and Correct the
TMDL before Adopting new WDRs for Humboldt Redwood.

A. Humboldt Redwood's Concerns About the TMDL Were Never
Adequately Addressed.
During the Regional Board's development of the Upper Elk River TMDL, Humboldt
Redwood raised a number of concerns about the adequacy of the scientific and legal

www.pillsburylaw.com

North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board
April 15, 2019
Page 2

bases for the TMDL's zero load allocation and related elements of the TMDL. Those concerns were never adequately addressed, and they remain at the heart of the Elk River TMDL challenge. However, recognizing the validity of Humboldt Redwood's concerns, particularly regarding the feasibility of implementation, the Regional Board amended the TMDL toward the end of the TMDL process to clarify that the zero load allocation in the TMDL was "necessarily conceptual" rather than prescriptive.' Further, the Regional Board clarified that the zero load allocation is not a waste load
allocation or effluent limitation, and the Regional Board has discretion on how to implement it.?
Similarly, the Regional Board included language acknowledging the limits of feasibility on implementation of the Table hillslope indicators and numeric targets:
"The hillslope indicators and numeric targets in Table 2 are designed to 2
inform Board actions and can be incorporated into orders, as appropriate and to the maximum extent feasible." North Coast Basin Plan - June 2018 Edition
at 4-129

As reflected in the TMDL itself, the zero load allocation was not intended to be
prescriptive; to the contrary, it was expressly intended to be conceptual. However, we
are concerned that the additional requirements the Regional Board seeks to impose
are arbitrary and capricious and constitute an abuse of discretion; these requirements
are unnecessary to achieve the objectives of the TMDL and are infeasible.

1 The TMDL states:
"The zero load allocation is necessarily conceptual since, using current technology and techniques, no amount of land use restriction can physically result in zero loading of non- point source sediment (i.e., the control of all natural and anthropogenic sediment delivery from the tributary system)." North Coast Basin - Plan - June 2018 Edition at 4-131.
2 The TMDL also states: "The zero load allocation does not constitute an effluent limitation or a waste load allocation, and the Board has discretion on how to implement it in WDRs, waivers or other actions to
reduce and eliminate waste discharges."* North Coast Basin Plan - June 2018 Edition at 4-
131, 135.

B. The State Water Board Weakened Many of the Improvements
Without Justification In Its TMDL Approval Resolution.
Unfortunately, in its review and approval of the Upper Elk TMDL, the State Water
Board stated in its Finding 9 a number of understandings that Humboldt Redwood
views as inconsistent with the express language of the TMDL:

9. The State Water Board's understandings of the TMDL Action Plan's requirements and statements described above are (1) that hillslope indicators
and numeric targets in Table 2 apply throughout a discharger's area of land ownership and not solely in areas of active harvest, (2) that the North Coast Water Board's WDRs and any other orders for the two major landowners that
conduct timber harvesting will incorporate specific provisions that implement all of the hillslope indicators and numeric targets in Table 2, unless the regional board makes specific findings about why any omitted hillslope indicators or numeric targets are not appropriate or feasible, (3) the WDRs and any other orders for the two major landowners will also contain any additional
specific provisions to ensure that all anthropogenic discharges of sediment are
minimized and eliminated, and (4) in the absence of a future amendment to the
TMDL Action Plan, including an amendment based on successful
implementation of the Watershed Stewardship Program resulting in expanded sediment loading capacity in the impacted reach, the WDRs and any other orders will require the landowners to achieve the zero load allocation for all anthropogenic discharges of sediment as soon as feasible, but no later than 2031.3

In an October 15, 2017 letter to this firm, the State Board clarified its understanding
#3 as follows: "the WDRs and any other orders for the two major landowners will also
contain any additional specific provisions to ensure that all anthropogenic discharges of
sediment are minimized and eliminated to the extent feasible and, if not feasibly
eliminated, minimized, as soon as feasible but not later than 2031." [strikeout and
underline are as shown in the original October 15, 2018 letter to reflect the clarification].

Although the Regional Board had just approved Humboldt Redwood's WDRs in 2016 as part of the TMDL process, the State Board Resolution also directed the North Coast Regional Board to review Humboldt Redwoods WDRs and revise them "as

3 State Water Resources Control Board Resolution No. 20017-0046 Approving an Amendment of the
Water Quality Control Plan for the North Coast Region (Basin Plan) Incorporating the Action Plan for the Upper Elk River Sediment Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) In Chapter 4
(Implementation Plans) (August 1, 2017).

necessary to make them consistent with the State Water Board's understandings of
how the TMDL Action Plan will be implemented as described in finding no. 9."
Humboldt Redwood and Green Diamond Resource Company timely challenged the legality and validity of the State Board's Resolution in California Superior Court.
However, in a cooperative effort seeking issuance of WDRs that are achievable by the companies and consistent with the TMDL itself, the companies and the State Water Board agreed to a stay of the action pending the WDR issuance process.
Although Humboldt Redwood objects to the conditions that the State Board Order imposed on its approval of the TMDL, the State Board's findings nevertheless acknowledge the necessity that any additional requirements imposed in WDRs or other orders being "feasible and appropriate."

C. The Regional Board Should Revisit the TMDL and Address These
Flaws Before Imposing New WDRs.

Humboldt Redwood urges the Regional Board to review the TMDL before imposing the WDRs as proposed. The Regional Board should correct the invalid assumption that there is a cause and effect relationship between the current operations by Humboldt Redwood and the downstream impaired conditions. As Humboldt Redwood's letter states, the absence of improvement in the impaired condition downstream despite 20 years of modern forestry practices and aggressive sediment removal activities, should cause the Regional Board to revisit the primary assumptions and the increasingly burdensome additional measures the draft WDRs seek to impose under the TMDL and the State Board's August 2018 approval
resolution.

II. If the Regional Board Proceeds to Impose New WDRs, it Must Reflect the
Limits of its Authority in the New WDRs, Including Limitations on
Feasibility. In Addition, the Regional Board Should Correct the Flaws
Humboldt Redwood Identified in the 2016 WDRs.

The Regional Board adopted WDRs for Humboldt Redwood in November 2016 just after it adopted the Upper Elk River TMDL. Humboldt Redwood raised a number of objections to the WDRs but, nevertheless, determined to implement its requirements.
Pursuant to the State Board's August 2017 Order approving the Elk River TMDL, the
Regional Board notified Humboldt Redwood that it would reopen and update the
2016 WDRs to address the State Board's stated understandings which changed the
substantive requirements of the TMDL. The Regional Board requested that
Humboldt Redwood evaluate additional measures that could be added to Humboldt

www.pillsburylaw.com 4824-0940-0468.v1

North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board

Redwood's WDRs over and above the requirements that Humboldt Redwood had
proposed in its original Report of Waste Discharge and those additional objectionable measures the Regional Board had imposed in the 2017 WDRs. In response, Humboldt Redwood proposed additional measures in its February 1, 2019 submission, including additional wet weather restrictions and additional canopy retention requirements within existing Class II Riparian Management Zone (RMZ) buffer widths. However, with these measures Humboldt Redwood has reached the limits of feasibility. Nevertheless, the Regional Board has proposed to impose even more infeasible and inappropriate measures, including.

Expanded RMZs, referenced in the WDRs as "TMDL RMZs", which would
extend RMZ restrictions to 14,036 acres--64% of Humboldt Redwood's Elk
River timberlands.

An additional five-year moratorium on any further harvesting on 3300 acres
of Humboldt Redwood timberland in five subwatersheds that the Regional
Board deems high risk; this addition adds to a 3-year moratorium for all
acres within those watersheds under the 2016 WDRs except what were
harvested under a single Timber Harvesting Plan--despite no findings of sediment discharge from the Timber Harvesting Plan that was completed in 2018. This extends the harvest moratorium to eight years for much of Humboldt Redwood's acreage in these subwatersheds.

An unreasonable 8-year Timber Harvesting Plan enrollment process
requirement (extending the five-year requirement that was in the 2016 WDRs for an additional three years)
Further, the Regional Board proposes to continue with the required feasibility study addressing in channel sediment removal, which is intended to lead to the imposition
of remediation requirements for pre-existing instream sediment that is already in the watershed system as a result of natural processes and, perhaps, the legacy activities by prior landowners. As discussed below, those measures exceed the Regional Board's
authority, are inconsistent with the TMDL and are not feasible.
Finally, although it has endeavored to implement the overburdensome 2016 WDRs,
Humboldt Redwood must continue its legal objections to those requirements in excess of Humboldt Redwood's original ROWD and its February 1, 2019 submittal, as reflected in the Regional Board's record. Those concerns are reflected in our comments filed on behalf of Humboldt Redwood and Green Diamond on January 18, 2016; these comments are enclosed. Those comments and other pertinent Humboldt Redwood submissions regarding the 2016 WDRs are incorporated herein by
reference.

A. The Additional Measures the Regional Board Proposes Are Inconsistent with Regional Board Authority and the TMDL's
Acknowledged Limitations

1. The additional restrictions are not necessary and, therefore,
would not be proper to impose on Humboldt Redwood.

Humboldt Redwood's February 1 matrix demonstrates again that the requirements of
the 2016 WDRs already implement all the Table 2 hillslope indicators and numeric targets in the TMDL. In addition, the Regional Board has not provided sufficient justification for imposing these additional requirements. Therefore, additional restrictions are not necessary to implement the TMDL and, in fact, would be arbitrary and capricious.

2. The additional requirements violate the Water Code's and
Basin Plan's controllability and feasibility prerequisites.
The Regional Board has failed to demonstrate with substantial evidence that the additional measures it seeks to impose are necessary to protect water quality and meet the feasibility standard. As described above, the Porter-Cologne Act and the Basin Plan impose feasibility limitations upon the Regional Board. For all the reasons set forth herein, the measures added to the WDRs are infeasible, and the proposed
findings and the imposition of measures to mitigate or avoid such impacts are not supported by substantial evidence. In fact, much of the sediment that the objectionable measures target is not controllable, i.e., "may be reasonably controlled", as required by the Basin Plan.'

As reflected in the Basin Plan, "feasible" means "capable of being accomplished in successful manner within a reasonable period of time, taking into account economic, environmental, legal, social and technological factors."5 There is no evidence that the
Regional Board has adequately considered the required factors, including the economic effects of the proposed restrictions. Just the combination of the new "TMDL RMZs" and the now eight-year harvest moratorium on any further timber operations in the five designated "high risk" watersheds alone would cripple

4 "Controllable water quality factors shall conform to the water quality objectives contained herein. When other factors result in the degradation of water quality beyond the levels or limits established herein as water quality objectives, then controllable factors shall not cause further degradation of water quality. Controllable water quality factors are those actions, conditions, or circumstances resulting from human activities that may influence the quality of the waters of the state and that may be reasonably controlled."

Humboldt Redwood's Elk River Watershed operations. Humboldt Redwood's
ownership in is this watershed is made up of Timberland Production Zoned lands.
Nevertheless, these requirements would effectively remove from timber production
14, 036 acres (64 percent of Humboldt Redwood's Elk River ownership) by placing
them in the TMDL RMZs indefinitely. The harvest moratorium extension for five subwatersheds designated as "high risk" would keep an additional 3,343 acres for an additional five-year period. Further, the requirements associated with the pilot study to identify measures to remove sediment-both anthropogenic and nonanthropogenic (that was likely discharged previously by prior landowners under entirely different land use and forest management practices)is fundamentally unfair and inconsistent with the Regional Board's authority to regulate Humboldt Redwood's own discharges. The Regional Board has not provided the necessary justification for such
burdensome requirements.
Ironically, while there is significant evidence presented in Humboldt Redwood's submissions that the objectionable measures in the draft WDRs propose are infeasible for Humboldt Redwood to implement, there is little or is no evidence that these extraordinarily burdensome measures would actually contribute to the TMDL objective of easing the downstream impaired condition or the identified nuisance
conditions, let alone fixing them. This is the essence of infeasibility-incapable of being accomplished in successful manner, within a reasonable period of time (by 2031), taking into account economic, environmental, legal, social and technological factors. Further, the measures violate the Basin Plan's "controllable" standard in that
they are not targeted at reasonably controllable discharges of Humboldt Redwood.

B. The Objectional Provisions of the WDRs violate Constitutional
Limitations on Agency Regulatory Actions.

Many of the requirements of the proposed WDRs that Humboldt Redwood has
objected to would violate the principles set out in the U.S. Supreme Court's Nollan
and Dolan decisions. These decisions require rough proportionality and an essential
nexus between the demands and regulatory burdens the Regional Board is proposing to place on Humboldt Redwood in the WDRs and the impacts of the timber harvesting operations covered by Humboldt Redwood's ROWD and supplemental submission. There is no such proportionality or sufficient nexus here.
As explained in the Nollan and Dolan decisions, the Fifth Amendment takings clause prohibits the imposition of conditions that lack an essential nexus or rough proportionality to the permitted activity. The Constitution requires an essential nexus
between the particular case and a legitimate regulatory interest. Nollan v. California
Coastal Commission, 483 U.S. 825 (1987). Even when a nexus exists, the imposed

condition must be roughly proportional to the effects of the project. Dolan v. City of Tigard, 512 U.S. 374 (1994).
California courts have applied the principles from Nollan and Dolan to mitigation and regulatory requirements. Environmental Protection Information Center v. Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, 44 Cal. 4th 459 (2008) ("EPIC') (finding that a landowner may only be required to implement mitigation measures roughly proportional to a landowner's impact). The California Supreme Court found that mitigation measures which "[did] not differentiate between those events partially caused or exacerbated by timber harvesting and those that are not" went beyond the regulator's authority. Id. at 511. As the Court concluded, a landowner should bear no more "than the costs incurred from the impact of its activity." Id. The conditions
imposed in the draft WDRs lack both an essential nexus and proportionality.

Essential Nexus. To be valid, the conditions in the WDRs must have an essential
nexus to a legitimate government interest. The Regional Board is charged with the protection of waters within its jurisdiction. However, the Regional Board has not established the essential nexus between the downstream impaired conditions that it
seeks to correct and the upstream timber operations of Humboldt Redwood. Indeed,
the record shows that discharges from Humboldt Redwood's operations have
contributed significantly to reduced discharges from its timberlands, including from legacy sources. Further, many of the measures the draft WDRs seek to impose, including removal of pre-existing sediment (discharged previously by others) in Elk
River Watershed streams. There is no practical way to distinguish between naturally
occurring and anthropogenic sediment (let alone Humboldt Redwood-caused sediment) to satisfy the Supreme Court's direction quoted above. The Regional Board has not established a sufficient cause and effect connection between Humboldt
Redwood's current operations and the downstream impaired condition, which has
existed for many years even before Humboldt Redwood's acquisition and, therefore,
the essential nexus, between the requirements and restrictions it seeks to impose on Humboldt Redwood in the Upper Elk and the conditions it seeks to improve
downstream.

Proportionality. Even if the Regional Board had established the required nexus, the imposed conditions also must be roughly proportional to the activities to be permitted.
As the California Supreme Court has explained, the conditions must differentiate
between the effects of the proposed project and those that are not--a permittee cannot
be required to do more than mitigate the effects of its proposed activity.
As explained above, the conditions imposed by the WDRs are not supported by
substantial evidence and are not adequately linked to Humboldt Redwood's proposed

www.pillsburylaw.com 4824-0940-0468.v1

North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board

activities. Humboldt Redwood has submitted a ROWD and supplemental submission with significant evidence that they fully address and mitigate the effects of Humboldt Redwood's planned harvest activities. The Regional Board has gone beyond the parameters of the ROWD and supplemental 2019 submission without providing substantial evidence that they fail to mitigate the effects of Humboldt Redwood's planned operations in the watershed. Thus, the conditions in the WDRs do not satisfy
Dolan's rough proportionality standard because they exceed the level of mitigation allowable under the law by requiring Humboldt Redwood to mitigate beyond the effects of Humboldt Redwood's own proposed activities.
The proposed WDRs seek to require Humboldt Redwood to remediate environmental
impacts disconnected by both time and distance. The WDRs place a moratorium on activities in specific watersheds subject to Humboldt Redwood accepting responsibility for remediating environmental effects not caused by Humboldt
Redwood's operations and, in fact, caused and contributed to by many other factors. The Regional Board expects Humboldt Redwood to fix a problem that was decades in the making in the Lower Elk, far removed from Humboldt Redwood's land and its harvesting practices and activities. This condition is completely lacking in proportionality in light of the controls already to be implemented in the ROWD and Humboldt Redwood's February 2019 Supplemental submission.
The other objectionable conditions included in the draft WDRs also exceed the
Regional Board's authority and violate the essential nexus and rough proportionality standards. All are unnecessary and out of proportion with Humboldt Redwood's proposed activities. As Humboldt Redwood has demonstrated, the measures proposed in the ROWD, as supplemented by Humboldt Redwood's February 2019 submission, fully address the water quality effects of its proposed harvest activities. The restrictions and management measures that Humboldt Redwood objects to in its
detailed comments exceed the Regional Board's legal authority and violate the
constitutional restrictions described above.

III. Conclusion.

We ask the Regional Board to revisit and revise the TMDL before it issues WDRs to
Humboldt Redwood. If the Regional Board determines to proceed, we ask that the Regional Board revise the WDRs to be consistent with the limits of the Regional Board's authority and feasibility, as reflected in Humboldt Redwood's proposal.

Thank you for considering our comments.

Re: Proposed Order No. R1-2016-0004 Waste Discharge Requirements For Nonpoint Source Discharges and Other Controllable Water Quality Factors Related to Timber Harvesting and Associated Activities
Conducted by Humboldt Redwood Company, LLC In the Upper Elk River Watershed, Humboldt County
Dear Chairman Corbett, Members of the Regional Water Quality Control Board and
Mr. St. John:

We represent Humboldt Redwood Company (*Humboldt Redwood") and Green Diamond Resource Company ("Green Diamond") in connection with the Upper Elk River Total Maximum Daily Load (*TMDL") and Waste Discharge Requirement ("*WDRs") processes. We file these comments on behalf of Humboldt Redwood and Green Diamond to supplement the extensive comments submitted by Humboldt Redwood on this proposal. We incorporate by reference previous comments of Humboldt Redwood, Green Diamond and their experts on Upper Elk TMDL matters that are pertinent to these WDRs.
We note that the proposed WDRs for Humboldt Redwood rely extensively on the proposed sediment TMDL and Program of Implementation for the Upper Elk River ("TMDL Action Plan") and the Upper Elk River: Technical Analysis for Sediment

(*Technical Report") prepared by Tetra Tech, Inc. However, the Regional Board will have not completed the public review process, made appropriate adjustments in the proposal and taken action on the TMDL and Action Plan before the hearing on the proposed WDRs. We acknowledge that the Regional Board is accepting comments on the Tetra Tech report as part of the WDRs process. However, the Tetra Tech
Technical report is one of the primary bases for the TMDL and will be the subject of
comments filed on the TMDL and TMDL Action Plan.

As we indicated during the workshop and informational discussions for the TMDL and WDRs, Humboldt Redwood and Green Diamond (the "Companies") have continuing significant concerns legal, policy and technical-with the Regional
Board proposals and the Tetra Tech Report. Among other things, we challenge the assertion that the Tetra Tech report reflects the best available science, as it fails to take into account critical scientific information submitted by the Companies and scientific experts. Furthermore, the Tetra Tech Report is far more than a technical report submitted in support of the technical conclusions of the TMDL. Rather, it includes extensive recommendations for regulatory actions that the Regional Board will take to implement the TMDL. In addition, it assumes the validity of the regulatory recommendations in the Peer Review Staff Report and other documents Tetra Tech reviewed and synthesized for purposes of preparing its report. This as yet unreviewed, unapproved Report is the basis for an unreviewed and unapproved TMDL, which in turn is the basis for the proposed WDRs and the draconian
regulatory burden they would impose on Humboldt Redwood. Until the Regional
Board fully considers the adequacy of the Tetra Tech report, it would be improper in
the WDRs proceeding to assume the propriety of imposing the extensive regulatory requirements reflected in Tetra Tech's recommendations and the TMDL Action Plan.
The Companies will address these issues in separate comments on the proposed
TMDL and TMDL Action Plan, and those comments also will further address the
Tetra Tech report. In the meantime, we question the propriety of the extensive reliance in the WDRs process on the TMDL proposal, and underlying analyses. That

1 We note a discrepancy on the Regional Board's website that makes it unclear when the Regional Board actually intends to hold a hearing on the WDRs. As of the date of our comments, the Public Notice and the "Items for the March 10, 2016 Board Meeting" on the Tentative Orders section of the website list the hearing date for the WDRs as March 10. However, Mr. St. John has advised Humboldt Redwood that the March Regional Board meeting has been cancelled and that the hearing on the proposed WDRs will be held on April 7, which is also the date scheduled for the TMDL
hearing..

extensive reliance on conclusions from the TMDL-that have yet to be heard, adequately adjusted based on full and adequate consideration of the Companies' and the public's comment, and then properly adopted- -raises significant concerns. It implies that the Regional Board had already reached its conclusions regarding the TMDL before the WDRs were proposed, that the Regional Board is not open to adjusting its proposals based on consideration of scientific information and comment that differ with the assertions reflected in the proposals. We trust that the Regional
Board will ensure that it remains open to making those changes in the proposals and underlying scientific and regulatory conclusions that are necessary to cure significant
fatal flaws in the proposed WDRs.

Humboldt Redwood submitted a comprehensive Report of Waste Discharge
("ROWD") that is based on is extensive hillslope and instream monitoring and analysis
of current practices, consultation with experts and significant interaction with the Regional Board. Humboldt Redwood's proposal demonstrates that Humboldt Redwood's operations in the Upper Elk Watershed are not causing or contributing to the ongoing problems the staff has identified in the Lower Elk Watershed. Indeed, Humboldt Redwood has demonstrated that the combination of its program of addressing legacy sediment sources and its unique timber harvesting methods reflected in its ROWD will result in a net reduction of sediment from its Timber
Harvesting Plans and its operations overall in the Upper Elk Watershed and each of the subwatersheds in which Humboldt Redwood operates. The Companies also have
submitted extensive information demonstrating that their current operations are not contributing substantively to the problems in the impacted reach of the Lower Elk. Further, the Companies have demonstrated that the adverse conditions in the Lower Elk and their failure to improve are due to many other causes.
The problem of excessive sediment in the Elk River Watershed is far more complicated than portrayed in the proposed TMDL and WDRs. For example, sea level measured at the North Spit of Humboldt Bay since 1977 has the highest rate of projected rise along the California coastline at 18.6 inches per century (4.73mm/yr) (Russell 2012). This is largely because the land surrounding Humboldt Bay is subsiding. This combination of factors affects river hydraulics and related sediment transport capability. Sea level in this area is estimated to continue to rise 6 inches by 2030, 12 inches by 2050 and 36 inches by 2100 (Laird 2013).
Even for human-caused historic sediment contribution, a variety of historic practices
and actions other than timber operations have contributed to the deficient sediment transport and assimilation capacity of the Lower Elk River. Those additional causes
include:

www.pillsburylaw.com
4831-3753-9628.vl

Mr. John W. Corbett
Mr. Matthias St. John
January 18, 2016
Page 4

road building and diking in the floodplain itself,
lack of channel maintenance and riparian vegetation management, and
navigation improvements and hardening of the shoreline in Humboldt Bay.
These factors have had a dramatic adverse effect on sediment transport, deposition
and accretion in the Elk River floodplain. They have caused extensive sand deposition and channel alteration in the storage portion of the watershed and at the
mouth of Elk River. We continue to object to the Regional Board's inexplicable failure to acknowledge and take action to address those influences while maintaining
its singular focus on current timber harvest operations and remediation by Humboldt
Redwood and Green Diamond. The arbitrary and capricious nature of this failure is manifest in the Regional Board's proposed prohibition of harvesting in five subwatersheds deemed "high risk" by the Regional Board unless and until Humboldt Redwood proposes projects to remediate the Lower Reach. The acreage covered by this prohibition amounts to one fifth of Humboldt Redwood's ownership in the Elk River Watershed.

I. The Regional Board's Proposal to Prohibit Timber Harvesting
Operations in Five Humboldt Redwood Watersheds Pending
Remediation of Excess Instream Sediment Deposits in the Lower Reach of
the Elk River Watershed Has No Adequate Basis in the Record and
Would Exceed the Regional Board's Authoritv
The proposed WDRs are based on the unfounded conclusion that, because the problem in the Lower Elk is not improving, the problem must be associated with
Humboldt Redwood's current operations. Therefore, without acknowledging the
actual causes and the current factors that are preventing the Lower Elk from improving, the WDRs impose extensive additional restrictions and management measures-even to the point of prohibiting timber harvesting operations altogether in
five Humboldt Redwood subwatersheds-unless and until those conditions in the
impacted reach improve sufficiently. Humboldt Redwood and Green Diamond have voluntarily supported stewardship efforts to improve impaired conditions in the Lower Elk; but have consistently objected to any imposition of regulatory obligations to remediate the impaired conditions as a condition upon its operations.

Nevertheless, the WDRs would impose a harvesting prohibition that holds Humboldt
Redwood's operations hostage to as yet undefined remediation of the impacted reach for an undefined period of time-with the standard for obtaining regulatory relief
from these extreme limitations undefined, to be determined in the future. The
harvesting prohibition pending adequate improvement of the Lower Elk-which the
proposal asserts is dependent on remediation-is a back-door means of requiring

4831-3753-9628.vl

Mr. John W. Corbett
Mr. Matthias St. John

Page 5

Humboldt Redwood to undertake that remediation. As with other previous variations, this element of the proposed WDRs remains highly objectionable.
The proposed WDRs rely on the fact that the Lower Elk problem persists and, on that basis, assert that additional actions beyond those that Humboldt Redwood has proposed are necessary. The proposed WDRs imply that simply because there is an ongoing problem in the Lower Elk, the Regional Board has unlimited discretion to impose any requirements or restrictions on activities in the Upper Elk that are subject to the Regional Board's control. To the contrary, without establishing the necessary cause and effect relationship, the Regional Board has no such authority. Further, as
reflected in our comments below, the Regional Board's authority is limited even a where a cause and effect relationship is found.
Neither the proposed WDRs nor the Tetra Tech report establishes an actual cause and effect relationship between the activities for which Humboldt Redwood seeks
approval and the ongoing challenges in the Lower Elk that would be necessary to justify the objectionable measures the Regional Board has proposed. Further, they do not provide the necessary substantial evidence that these additional measures would, if imposed, actually have the desired effect of improving conditions in the Lower Elk--the proposal acknowledges great uncertainty. These additional measures are
highly objectionable and would impose an extensive, unnecessary regulatory burden on Humboldt Redwood. Humboldt Redwood requests that the Regional Board adjust the proposed WDRs to be consistent with Humboldt Redwood's ROWD and its
comments. As currently, proposed, the WDRs are arbitrary and capricious, and adopting them as written would reflect an abuse of discretion and would exceed the Regional Board's authority. The additional measures that exceed those proposed in Humboldt Redwood's ROWD are unjustified, substantively and procedurally, by law, facts and science.

The Companies again emphasize that remediation of excess historical sediment in the Elk River floodplain to reduce flooding is clearly a worthy objective. Green Diamond and Humboldt Redwood are actively supporting voluntary stewardship efforts to identify remedial solutions for the Elk River floodplain. However, this end does not justify the regulatory means the Staff has chosen here-imposing the obligation on Humboldt Redwood to remediate the floodplain or continue to forfeit any right to carry out timber harvesting operations that the Company has demonstrated are fully protective of water quality and the environment. Further, the Regional Board's worthy objective to remediate the impaired condition does not justify the Regional Board's ignoring the role of other watershed conditions that are actually contributing
currently to the impaired conditions.

II. The Regional Board's Proposed WDRs Improperly Add Unnecessarv,
Unreasonable and Infeasible Measures and Restrictions to Humboldt
Redwood's Robust Plan Reflected in its Report of Waste Discharge.

In addition to the proposed WDRs' highly objectionable harvest prohibition and
Lower Reach remediation requirements, Humboldt Redwood objects to the additional
management restrictions the WDRs seek to impose beyond the harvest prohibition,
including the:

Imposition of an annual average 2% harvest rate limit for Humboldt
Redwood's ownership in all sub-watersheds (10 year rolling average)
Expansion of and changes to Humboldt Redwood's existing Riparian
Management Zone protection measures
Expanded wet weather-related prescriptions, amounting to a
prohibition on timber operations permitted for over six months of the
year (October 15 through May 1)
Requirement to conduct a feasibility study for Control of Instream
Sediment Sources-

These measures inexplicably contradict the successes of the past 10 years and the basis for many significant regulatory approvals, which all document major improvements in Elk River watershed conditions that, unlike those targeted by the Regional Board here, are potentially related to Humboldt Redwood's timber harvesting operations. There is no evidence that the Regional Board's additional measures are necessary or would provide the improvements the Regional Board asserts it is targeting. As proposed, the WDRs are unreasonable and infeasible. They would impose unnecessary regulatory burdens and threaten the economic viability of
Humboldt Redwood's operations.

2 This requirement, applicable to sediment that has already found its way into the watercourse as : result of many different causes, including nature, has all the same flaws as those related to remediation of the Lower Elk River.

III. As Proposed, the WDRs Lack Substantial Evidence and Would Violate
the Prohibition in Water Code Section 13360 on Prescribing the Specific
Method of Achieving Compliance

Humboldt Redwood submitted a comprehensive ROWD proposal for its ownership in the Upper Elk River Watershed based on site-specific management objectives, and it addressed ownership and watershed-specific issues. These measures are supported by substantial evidence and are the product of many years of study, monitoring,
experience and dialogue with Regional Board staff. Humboldt Redwood supports all those provisions of the proposed WDRs that reflect the findings and practices presented in the ROWD.
The Regional Board has erred in proposing additional conditions that are inconsistent
with the ROWD and lack substantial evidence. These additional conditions lack the
robust scientific support the ROWD provided and are based on scientifically
indefensible conclusions. This approach fails to provide the necessary substantial evidence for doing so in relation to Humboldt Redwood's proposal. Further, this approach is a clear violation of the Water Code's prohibition on specifying the means
of compliance.

Section 13360 provides that no waste discharge requirement may specify "the design,
location, type of construction, or particular manner in which compliance may be had"
with a requirement, order, or decree. The permittee is specifically allowed to comply with the WDRs in any lawful manner.
As one California Court of Appeal has described, "Section 13360 is a shield against unwarranted interference with the ingenuity of the party subject to a waste discharge requirement." Tahoe-Sierra Preservation Council v. State Water Resources Control Board (1989) 2010 Cal. App. 3d 1421. Section 13360 "preserve[s] the freedom of persons subject to a discharge standard to elect between available strategies to comply with that standard."Id.

The Water Code authorizes the Regional Board to adopt requirements to meet water quality standards and protect beneficial uses, provided that those requirements are supported by substantial evidence. However, Water Code Section 13360 prohibits the Regional Board from dictating the means. of complying with those requirements. This
provision clearly would be violated by the addition of timber harvesting prescriptions and the outright prohibition of "harvesting activities" in the five subwatersheds.
Humboldt Redwood has crafted a proposal that results in a net reduction of sediment discharges over current conditions. That proposal reflects exactly the kind of ingenuity Section 13360 was designed to protect. The Regional Board's WDRs

www.pillsburylaw.com
4831-3753-9628.vl

Mr. John W. Corbett
Mr. Matthias St. John
January 18, 2016
Page 8

reflect a substitution of its judgment as to the type and extent of forest management measures that Humboldt Redwood should apply. In so doing, the Regional Board has usurped the ingenuity Section 13360 was intended to preserve. We believe the additional measures proposed by the Regional Board, including the outright prohibition on harvesting activities and other attempts to directly regulate timber harvesting activities themselves, violate this provision and clearly exceed the Regional Board's authority under the Water Code.

IV. As Proposed the WDRs Would Violate Constitutional Principles Outlined
in the Nollan and Dolan Decisions. The Prohibitions, Restrictions and
Management Measures Added to the Measures Included in Humboldt
Redwood's ROWD Lack a Fundamental Nexus and Proportionality to
Humboldt Redwood's Timber Harvesting Activities in the Elk River
Watershed.

The requirements of the proposed WDRs that Humboldt Redwood has objected to
would violate the principles set out in the U.S. Supreme Court's Nollan and Dolan decisions. These decisions require rough proportionality and an essential nexus between the demands and regulatory burdens the Regional Board is proposing to place on Humboldt Redwood in the WDRs and the impacts of the timber harvesting operations covered by Humboldt Redwood's ROWD. There is no such proportionality or sufficient nexus here.

As explained in the Nollan and Dolan decisions, the Fifth Amendment takings clause
prohibits the imposition of conditions that lack an essential nexus or rough proportionality to the permitted activity. The Constitution requires an essential nexus
between the particular case and a legitimate regulatory interest. Nollan v. California Coastal Commission, 483 U.S. 825 (1987). Even when a nexus exists, the imposed
condition must be roughly proportional to the effects of the project. Dolan v. City of
Tigard, 512 U.S. 374 (1994).
California courts have applied the principles from Nollan and Dolan to mitigation and
regulatory requirements. Environmental Protection Information Center v. Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, 44 Cal. 4th 459 (2008) ("EPIC") (finding that a landowner may only be required to implement mitigation measures roughly proportional to a landowner's impact). The California Supreme Court found that mitigation measures which "[did] not differentiate between those events partially caused or exacerbated by timber harvesting and those that are not" went beyond the
regulator's authority. Id. at 511. As the Court concluded, a landowner should bear no
more "than the costs incurred from the impact of its activity." Id. The conditions imposed in the draft WDRs lack both an essential nexus and proportionality.

Essential Nexus. To be valid, the conditions in the WDRs must have an essential
nexus to a legitimate government interest. The Regional Board is charged with the
protection of waters within its jurisdiction. This includes both the upper and lower reaches of the Elk River. However, by the Regional Board's own admission, the conditions imposed by the draft WDRs are not related to government interest in the Upper Elk River where Humboldt Redwood's activities are proposed to occur.
Rather, the Regional Board's stated interest is in the Lower Elk River. Further, the Regional Board does not provide a sufficient cause and effect connection and, therefore, the essential nexus, between the requirements and restrictions it seeks to impose on Humboldt Redwood in the Upper Elk and the conditions it seeks to
improve in the Lower Elk.
Proportionality. Even if the Regional Board had established the required nexus, the imposed conditions must also be roughly proportional to the activities to be permitted. As the California Supreme Court has explained, the conditions must differentiate
between the effects of the proposed project and those that are not- -a permittee cannot be required to do more than mitigate the effects of its proposed activity.
As explained above, the conditions imposed by the WDRs are not supported by
substantial evidence and are not adequately linked to Humboldt Redwood's proposed
activities. Humboldt Redwood has submitted a ROWD with significant evidence that
it fully mitigates the effects of the harvest activities and, in fact, results in a net reduction of sediment discharges in relation to existing conditions. The Regional
Board has gone beyond the parameters of the ROWD without providing substantial evidence that the ROWD fails to fully mitigate the effects of the project. Thus, the conditions in the WDRs do not satisfy Dolan's rough proportionality standard because it exceeds the level of mitigation allowable under the law by requiring Humboldt Redwood to mitigate beyond the effects of Humboldt Redwood's own
proposed activities.
The proposed WDRs seek to require Humboldt Redwood to remediate environmental impacts disconnected by both time and distance. The WDRs place a moratorium on activities in specific watersheds subject to Humboldt Redwood accepting responsibility for remediating environmental effects not caused by Humboldt Redwood's operations and, in fact, caused and contributed to by many other factors. The Regional Board expects Humboldt Redwood to fix a problem that was decades in the making in the Lower Elk, far removed from Humboldt Redwood's land and activities. This condition is completely lacking in proportionality in light of the zero net discharge effect of the measures proposed in the ROWD.
The other objectionable conditions included in the draft WDRs also exceed the Regional Board's authority and violate the essential nexus and rough proportionality

standards. The required expansion of RMZs, the two percent Clearcut Equivalent Acre limitation and the additional wet weather restrictions all are unnecessary and out of proportion with Humboldt Redwood's proposed activities. As Humboldt Redwood has demonstrated, the measures proposed in the ROWD fully address the water quality effects of its proposed harvest activities. The restrictions and management measures that Humboldt Redwood objects to in its detailed comments exceed the Regional Board's regulatory authority and violate the constitutional restrictions explained above.

V. The Regional Board's Proposed Action Results in a Flawed Initial
Study/Negative Declaration under the California Environmental Quality
Act.

The California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") provides for the evaluation of potentially significant environmental effects and the adoption of "feasible" measures that are found, on the basis of substantial evidence, to be necessary to avoid or reduce such an impact to less than minimal effects.
The Regional Board has failed to demonstrate with substantial evidence that the proposed project, meaning the activities covered by the ROWD, would result in a potentially significant environmental effects that require the specified measures to
avoid or reduce such potential to a level of insignificance. Further, the Regional
Board has failed to acknowledge the net reduction in sediment over existing conditions that result in cumulative benefits to the watershed rather than adverse
cumulative effects.

For all the reasons set forth herein, the measures added to the WDRs and reflected in
the draft Initial Study/Negative Declaration are clearly infeasible, and the proposed
findings and the imposition of measures to mitigate or avoid such impacts are not supported by substantial evidence.
CEQA Guidelines § 15364 defines "feasible" to mean "capable of being
accomplished in a successful manner within a reasonable period of time, taking into account economic, environmental, legal, social and technological factors." There is no evidence that the Regional Board has considered the required factors, including the economic effects of the proposed restrictions, which would cripple Humboldt
Redwood's Elk River Watershed operations.

VI. The Regional Board Should Eliminate the Unnecessary and Inefficient
Enrollment Approval Process. THPs That Meet the WDRs
Requirements. as Reflected In THP Approval Without Regional Board
Objection, Should be Enrolled Without Further egional Board Action.

As Humboldt Redwood explained in its comments, the Regional Board has the ability to ensure that the WDRs are properly implemented through its review of every THP. It is unnecessary and improper for the Regional Board to require that, in addition to
demonstrating compliance with the WDRs during the THP process, Humboldt
Redwood must request and wait to begin operations for an affirmative enrollment in
the WDRs. Unlike general waste discharge requirements, watershed-wide waste discharge requirements require Humboldt Redwood to continually monitor and
implement sediment and prevention actions throughout the entire watershed including
areas outside of the footprint of any individual THP. In exchange for shouldering this
financial and operational burden, the company should be assured of consistent and automatic enrollment of individual THPs that demonstrate compliance with the
WDRs as part of the standard THP approval process.

s * *
In conclusion, we request that the Regional Board reconsider and revise its proposed WDRs consistent with these comments and those of Humboldt Redwood Company.
Thank you for your consideration.

Mr. James Burke, Timberland Division
North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board
5550 Skylane Blvd., Ste. A
Santa Rosa, CA 95403-1072

Subject: Discharger Comment regarding NCRWQCB Draft Order No. R1-2019-0021
Dear Mr. Burke:
Humboldt Redwood Company (HRC) has reviewed the above referenced Draft Order (Waste Discharge
Requirements) for its pperations in the Upper Elk River watershed. Please consider the following
comments in preparation of a final Order for adoption. Our submission is being supplemented by legal
comments being submitted under separate cover by Wayne Whitlock.
We understand the NCRWQCB is seeking revision to the existing Water Quality Order R1-2015-0004 in
response to findings by the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) resolution (No. 2017-0046)
adopting the Upper Elk River TMDL Action Plan. Specifically (pursuant Finding 9) "that the North Coast
Water Board's WDRs and any other orders for the two major landowners that conduct timber harvesting
will incorporate specific provisions that implement all of the TMDL hillslope indicators and numeric
targets, unless the regional board makes specific findings about why any omitted hillslope indicators
or numeric targets are not appropriate or feasible." Related, we note the State Water Board also
provided instruction that "the WDRs and any other orders for the two major landowners will also
contain any additional specific provisions to ensure that all anthropogenic discharges of sediment are
eliminated to the extent feasible and, if not feasibly eliminated, minimized as soon as feasible but not
later than 2031" (amended via letter dated October 15, 2018).
Per NCRWQCB request and as a matter of record, HRC provided input (see Attachment A) this past February 1, 2019 as to how the cutrent Order R1-2016-0004 could be revised to address the SWRCB
resolution, Specifically, this input included, but was not limited to, further restriction of road use
during the extended wet weather period (October 15 - May 1) and additional requirements for
retention of well-distributed forest cover within the riparian management zones (RMZ) of Class III
watercourses. As the findings of Draft Order No. R1-2019-0021 réport, numerous existing measures are
already in effect to prevent and minimize sediment delivery in the Upper Elk River watershed, Not the least of these is HRC's commitment, now in the form of a requirement, to use uneven-age selection

1

silviculture watershed-wide, where feasible, based on forest stocking conditions, in place of the historic even-age clearcut management commonly practiced in the watershed prior to 2008. In addition, we
submitted a matrix clearly demonstrating how requirements of the current WDR (Order R1-2016-
0004) already fully implement all TMDL hillslope indicators and numeric targets. This matrix is worth
review by staff and. Regional Water Board (RWB) Members not fully familiar with HRC's Habitat
Conservation Plan (HCP), the California Forest Practice Rules (CFPRs), and additional specific
requirements of the existing WDR.
As explained in our February 2019 submittal, additional measures addressing wet weather road use are
consistent with scientific findings regarding control of anthropogenic road-associated sediment sources.
We included additional canopy retention requirements within existing Class III RMZ buffer widths to
address what we were told was a significant WQ concern, despite any empirical evidence to our
knowledge, or substantiated by the NCRWQCB that Class IlI RMZs are currently a source of sediment
delivery. We stand by these recommendations and find their inclusion into the new WDR Order (R1-
2019-0021) as acceptable and feasible to implement.
However, there are several requirements found in the new Draft Order to which HRC must adamantly
object as they are neither feasible, per legal definition, nor adequately explained and justified. We note
the requirement for feasibility is referenced as an important consideration in both the Upper Elk River
TMDL Action Plan and the SWRCB's adopting resolution. As you are aware, the Basin Plan defines
'feasible' as "capable of being accomplished in a successful manner within a reasonable period of time,
taking Into account economic, environmental, legal, social, and technical factors."*

Objections

1. 1.8.3. - The Draft Order seeks to implement additional TMDL RMZs' (Riparian Management
Zones) above and beyond those already in effect, out to inexplicable distances of 300 feet on
Class 1 and Il watercourses and 150 feet on Class III watercourses. If put into effect, these
TMDL RMZ', buffer widths would nearly double the amount of RMZ-associated restricted
acres compared to the current WDR Order and result in further restriction of HRC timber operations, across nearly two-thirds (14,036 acres) 64%) of the company's Elk River
ownership. Such restriction, when considered with the many factors that go into forest
management, including choice of appropriate silviculture and economics, is simply not
feasible, nor necessary to achieve water quality objectives.,

E The Draft Order cites Table 2 of the TMDL Action Plan and the Tetra Tech Report as justification*
for these extended buffer widths, however there is no explanation, scientific or otherwise, in
either of these documents; they simply appear. The only inference we can think of is that
these widths are similar to those used in the USFS Pacific North West Plan for public lands.
Those familiar with the USFS Plan are aware that extended riparian corridor widths were
intended to benefit terrestrial and aviary species by providing late seral forest migration
corridors; clearly something not applicable to the NCRWQC or SWRCB authority or jurisdiction,

2

HRC already has in place RMZs of adequate width to provide for the stated Numeric Targets of
the TMDL Action Plan including improvements in the quality/health of the riparian stand so as to
promote 1) delivery of wood to channels, 2) slope stability, and 3) ground cover (TMDL Action
Plan Table 2). HRC'S RMZs currently exceed those of the CFPRs and were adopted and
approved through multiple agency review, following several years of detailed watershed
analysis specific to Elk River, for the purpose of maintaining and restoring the very same
processes and conditions identified as the TMDL numeric targets. The agencies participating in
review and approval of HRC's riparian management zones include the California Department of
Fish and Wildlife, United States Department of Fish and Wildlife, NOAA Marine Fisheries,
California Geologic Survey, and CAL FIRE.

These existing RMZs work in combination with other requirements for the protection of water
quality including but not limited to the substantial geologic review every HRC Timber Harvest
Plan (THP) undergoes as described in the Draft Order's findings (Findings 57-61), watershed-
wide constraints on harvest acres set at the individual sub-basin level, established self-
imposed and now required silvicultural constraints, and limitations on frequency of harvest
within riparian areas (no more than once every twenty years). Those familiar with our
ownership in the Upper Elk River watershed can testify that forest characteristics found within
our riparian stands currently meet or are trending towards the TMDL's numeric targets for
delivery of wood to stream channels, slope stability, and ground cover under the current
enforceable management regime. 1:

It is important to recognize that many of these acceptable existing measures (i.e. no
clearcutting, licensed geologic review, CFPR restrictions on ground-based equipment on steep
slopes, etc.) apply to the 300 and 150 foot TMDL hillslope indicator areas upslope of HRC'S
RMZs. However, it remains economically essential that HRC maintain the right to occasionally
harvest groups of trees outside of HCP RMZs (but within proposed TMDL RMZ distances} up to
the 2.5 acre limits allowed under the CFPRs, as this practice provides for increased overall
logging production, which in turn keeps the cost of single-tree selective harvest acceptable.
Under certain stand conditions the inability to group harvest or otherwise reduce overstory
canopy to less than 50 percent (as the new TMDL RMZ prescription proposes) would create
environmental, legal, and economic conditions such that any harvest would be infeasible. The
creation of small forest openings produces full-light conditions beneficial to the regeneration
of future trees and necessary for the forest's achievement of maximum sustained production
(MSP) of long-term sustained yield (LTSY); legal requirements of the CFPRS. The proposed
new TMDL RMZ prescription would prohibit this.

Furthermore, as we discussed when this new measure was originally daylighted, it prevents the
use of restorative silvicultural prescriptions across nearly 6,600 acres (30%) of the ownership
where such management is currently allowed. This not only results in further adverse
economic impacts as it eliminates near term timber harvest, it also degrades the overall long
term productivity of the ownership by preventing HRC from restoring forest stocking levels
3

and associated growth rates, in one of the company's most productive, high site-class
management tracts, again adversely impacting long term sustained yield. This has additional.
adverse environmental consequences such as limiting carbon sequestration, economic
impacts in the form of short and long term reduced revenue, and legal impacts relative to
CFPR requirements for MSP relative to LTSY. Such restriction also, work against the water
quality objectives of the TMDL Action Plan relative to restoration of future large wood recruitment and increased overstory forest canopy. Bear and other animal damage,
hardwood competition, fungal pathogens, wind and fire are all very real environmental agents
affecting forest stand conditions. Foresters must maintain adequate silvicultural flexibility to
address the range of forest conditions encountered.

The proposal for extended TMDL RMZs is further problematic as it relates to Porter Cologne's intent for WDRs to establish requirements as to the nature of discharge rather than to prescribe
specific hillslope forestry prescriptions; the latter which clearly lies within the jurisdiction of
California's State Board of Forestry. No evidence has been presented to demonstrate sediment
is being discharged through the current WDR HCP RMZs from contemporary operations
upslope. Therefore, there is no or legal or otherwise justifiable cause for increasing the width
of riparian buffers as proposed. The 2015 Tetra Tech Report attributed less than 3 percent of
the total estimated anthropogenic sediment-delivery as originating from harvest related
surface erosion and open slope landslides, combined, in the most recent period assessed
(TMDL Action Plan, Table 1.). Presumably, in addition to large wood recruitment to streams
which occurs from distances within HRC's existing buffer widths, the expanded TMDL RMZ
buffers are intended to further control erosion (i.e. slope stability and ground cover), however
this erosion is not taking place under the current BMPs being applied. The proposal does not
pass the Basin Plan's feasibility standard as it accomplishes nothing from a water quality and
TMDL implementation perspective and is economically prohibitive for the landowner to
implement.

The SWRC Resolution (No. 2017-0046) is explicit in its findings for adopting the Upper Elk River
TMDL Action Plan. (Resolution Finding 9) "that the North Coast Water Board's WDRs and any other orders for the two major landowners that conduct timber harvesting will incorporate
specific provisions that implement all of the TMDL hillslope indicators and numeric targets,
unless the regional board makes specific findings about why any omitted hillslope indicators
or numeric targets are not appropriate or feasible." Consistent with that exception language,
Table 2 of the TMDL Action Plan specifically states hillslope indicators and targets are designed
to inform Board Actions and to be incorporated into orders as appropriate and feasible. (Draft
Order Finding 22), As explained herein, the staff's proposed additional measures are neither
appropriate nor feasible, and importantly there are already feasible measures in place
effectively addressing this specific hillslope indicator and its numeric targets.

As there are numerous overlapping measures already in place protecting riparian areas and
preventing hydrologic effect on discharge from timber harvest operations watershed-wide to

a level of non-significance, it is not necessary, and therefore not appropriate, to require extended TMDL RMZs, nor is it economically feasible for HRC to comply with such
requirement. Importantly, we note that the intent of this measure - to maintain forest canopy
in proximity to watercourses and throughout the watershed - will continue to be achieved
under HRC'S current predominantly selection silviculture practices; however, a carte blanche
requirement as currently proposed prohibiting ANY forest openings across 64 percent (14,036
acres) of the ownership is not feasible, nor does it represent an ecological best management
practice.

We respectfully ask that the NCRWQCB take these factors into account and make a finding, as
necessary, to this effect, removing, or at the very least replacing the language found in .B.3
with requirements acceptable to the landowner, consistent with best management practices.

2. I.A.4. - The - Draft Order No. R1-2019-0021 proposes a new 5 year moratorium on timber
harvest across 3,343 acres (15%) of HRC's ownership ('sensitive bedrock sub-basins') in the
Upper Elk River watershed. The current Order .No. R1-2016-0004 established a 5 year period
(2016-2021) in which harvest was limited in this area to a single THP (1-12-110 HUM). In
addition, both the current and proposed Orders establish numerous additional erosion control
requirements in this area to address local geologic and soil characteristics, many of which were
proposed by HRC. A portion of THP 1-12-110 HUM is the subject of a collaborative third-party
paired watershed study examining the measurable effects of timber harvest under the current
WDR erosion control prescriptions. The results of this study are due 2021 and scheduled to be
part of the discussion before the Board régarding future management in this area. We object to
the Draft Order No. R1-2019-0021 proposal to inexplicably restart the clock for this 5-year
period without just cause, which was due to sunset in 2021 pending NCRWQCB review.

To date, no Notice of Discharges or other significant sediment delivery have been discovered
or. reported as resulting from implementation of THP 1-12-110 HUM. Initiated in 2016 and
phased over a 3 year period, all timber harvest operations on this THP were completed in 2018.
Under current order and acceptable to HRC, this provides for a 3 vear period of no further
harvest in this area until 2021 in order to assess the efficacy of logging related erosion control
practices. The new Draft Order inexplicably and without justification extends this 'no harvest'
period to 2024, The Draft Order proposes to continue the current requirement for a 30 day
public comment period and hearing at the end of its 5-year moratorium in 2024, at which time
the Board may decide the extent to which further timber harvest in this area, if any, may take
place. As worded, this specific requirement brings significant new uncertainty regarding HRC's
ability to manage a significant portion of its Upper Elk River ownership over the next 5-10 years as there are no assurances HRC will be allowed to conduct timber harvest in this area of its
ownership in the future. This proposed additional delay in addressing this uncertainty, during
which time the company is deprived of any economic return on its investment in its timber

5

production zoned (TPZ) timberlands in excess of 3,300 acres, is not explained or justified and
wunwarranted and infeasible.

We propose an alternative approach to I.A.4 for NCRWQCB consideration. Maintain the
current 5 year period allowing for timber harvest to commence again as soón as 2021
following a public hearing before the NCRWQCB during which the results of the scientific
study and other relative considerations can be evaluated to inform any change in Best
Management Practices (BMPs) to be applied during the next forest management entry

3. I.H. - The Draft Order maintains requirements for a feasibility study for control of in-channel
sediment sources within HRC's ownership, We continue to contest the idea that pre-existing in-channel sediment, the source of which is both natural and anthropogenic, is a controllable
water quality factor subject to waste discharge requirements. This 'sediment source as
described by the Upper Elk River TMDL Action Plan is not the result of current and future forestry operations but is instead a pre-existing condition resulting from a combination of
natural and anthropogenic processes than cannot be sorted out with any reasonable.
confidence as to proportional cause or origin.

HRC does indeed seek to manage and influence instream sediment routing for the benefit of
water quality and aquatic habitat through prevention, to the extent feasible, and minimization
of new anthropogenic sediment loading from hillslope sources AND through the recruitment
and placement of large wood instream, and more recently through proposed floodplain
restoration activities. However, to require of its current operations a feasibility study for the
control of sediment already in channel and past the point of discharge, which by its very nature
has speculative potential for control, seems inappropriate and unreasonable within the context
of waste discharge requirements.

Restoration activities such as these, are something HRC does on a routine voluntary basis, often in partnership with NPOs and trustee agencies such as CDFW, NOAA Fisheries, and potentially
the State and Regional Water Boards. The projects are proposed as feasible considering
environmental and economic factors. A significant limiting factor for in and off-channel
sediment settling ponds in the Upper Elk River watershed is the terrain. All but the lower North
Fork and South Fork channels are situated within narrow valley walls, difficult to access and with
limited sediment storage opportunity, and with banks and side-slopes susceptible to erosión if
frequently disturbed. HRC does however implement voluntary restoration projects where the
terrain is favorable,

As the most recent example, HRC recently submitted a nearly one million dollar, shared cost
project to the SWRCB's 319(h) non-point source grant program for work along the North Fark
Elk River including relocation of a streamside haul road, placement of large wood into the
channel for habitat and sediment routing benefit, and restoration of floodplains for the
benefit of additional sediment storage and off-channel fish habitat. We report on voluntary

6

projects such as these, including effectiveness where there is a monitoring element, as part of
our annual WDR report to the NCRWQCB.

We note both the existing and proposed WDR Orders supersede and incorporate pre-existing Clean Up and Abatement Orders (CAOs) HRC inherited from the previous landowner addressing
all known controllable pre-existing sediment sources. The final remaining sites associated with
these CAOs are scheduled for treatment per the approved Master Treatment Schedule by*
October 15, 2020.

We respectfully request that the NCRWQCB remove this requirement for a feasibility study for
the speculative control of historically discharged, in-channel sediment, not related to the
Discharger's current or future operations applicable to these WDRs.

We think it most practical and effective for the NCRWQCB to continue to work with HRC to address
these three concerns prior to putting Draft Order No. R1-2019-0021 before the Board for adoption..
However, if RWB staff elects not to address these concerns prior to the June adoption hearing, then we
would ask that the Board not adopt the proposed Order at the June hearing but instead provide
direction to staff to work with HRC on these matters such that the result is a WDR acceptable to both
parties.

The TMDL Action Plan is explicit that "The Regional Water Board has discretion in developing WDRS
that- can allow individual dischargers to tailor a compliance strategy". To this end we provide acceptable language modification for these three items in Attachment B of this comment letter for
your consideration. We recognize the Board itself may be interested in specific language should the Board need to make modifications itself to the Draft Order at the June hearing prior to adoption. Again,
it is our understanding of the Porter Cologne Act that the RWB is to establish feasible to attain water
quality standards for which the Discharger is to provide methods by which to achieve.
The Upper Elk River TMDL Action Plan adopted by this Board back in 2016 is also clear that the zero load
allocation is *conceptual in nature* as it is physically infeasible to achieve in the absolute sense. The
proposed Draft Order, with our recommended modifications as outlined above, nonetheless achieves
the highest bar feasible for erosion control as intended by the 0 load allocation. And with these
modifications, the revised draft WDRs would ensure that all anthropogenic discharges of sediment are
eliminated to the extent feasible, and if not feasibly eliminated, minimized, as soon as feasible
consistent with the SWRCB's October 15, 2018 amended resolution and directive.

HRC's recommendations for changes to the proposed Order's "Specific Requirements', for the reasons
explained above, can be found in Attachment B - pages 36 -42 of the Draft Order.

Additional Comments
Attachment B to this letter also highlights important findings of Draft Order Findings sections (pages
1-35) along with a few recommendations.
While most findings are accurate including representation of the many requirements in place for the
protection and benefit of water quality and achievement of TMDL water quality standards, some, of the
findings weigh too heavily the conditions found downstream as a function of upstream timber practices,
both past and present. An over-simplified misrepresentation of cause and effect underlies much of the
regulatory action taken by the NCRWQCB over the last 20 years, including most recently the 0 load,
allocation for which the primary purpose is to justify excessive and unprecedented regulation of the new
upstream timberland owner, HRC. The fact that these past 20 years of substantial improvement in timber harvest practices, along with over 330,000 yards of clean up and abatement sediment control
(Draft Order Finding 67), which has collectively resulted in well-documented, significant declines in
sediment delivery, and improvements in upstream aquatic habitat conditions, have not resulted in
significant findings by the NCRWCB of improvements in downstream conditions relative to
achievement of water quality standards, should give the Agency pause as to the cause of these
persistent downstream conditions.
Little to no mention continues to be made of the fact that the infrequent flood-affected rural subdivision
lies completely within the FEMA designated Elk River floodplain. Nor does the discussion anywhere in
the Draft Order's findings, meaningfully relay the most recent science assimilated, at the request of the
NCRWQCB, in the 2018 Elk River Recovery Assessment (ERRA): Recovery Fromework. While the ERRA
report is referenced in Finding 75 relative to a 'modeled" maximum sediment reduction potential (30%),
which the ERRA found as insufficient to improve conditions downstream, the Draft Order does not
discuss this report's other findings critical to understanding the larger geographic setting controlling
the behavior and conditions of Elk River,

For example, the ERRA report found that changes in floodplain land use including livestock and dairy,
raads and bridges, and rural residential development, all affect stream channel, riparian vegetation, and
salmonid habitat conditions. The WQ commissioned report explains early settlement and land use in
the lower Elk River valley resulted in lasting, large-scale changes to historical vegetation patterns
including removal of an overstory forest condition which led to increased understory and extensive in-
channel vegetation condition, which without frequent removal, tends to lock' sediment into storage.
The historically extensive estuary that once was composed of tidal wetlands and a dense network of sinuous slough channels, much better suited to accommodate Elk River's sediment load, was diked and
converted to pasture so that by 1941 the Elk River channel planform was locked into the nearly identical
location is it today, unable to avulse over time in response to its sediment load as it would have
naturally. Tidal prisms which historically moved sediment out of the lower channel were altered by levees and tide gates. The historic land use practice of removal of large woody debris and vegetation to
improve flow conveyance for historic log drives, and to decrease flood frequency, was ended many
decades ago. HRC knows the NCRWQCB recognizes these factors as significant, in part because we see

them briefly referenced in the TMDL Action Plan, and yet we do not see them meaningfully discussed in
the findings section of this proposed Order,
Further, the ERRA analysis reveals a very telling locally convex-up section of the Elk River valley floor
longitudinal profile. This, naturally inherent, physical geologic feature, the ERRA reports, is explained is by
faulting or folding across the valley floor or a transition from a region of long term tectonic uplift to a
region of long term subsidence. Either way this geomorphic feature, completely independent of land
use practices, results in an entrenched channel through this area of up to 19 feet and a relatively narrow
floodplain confined by older river terraces, which results in large scale hydraulic constriction; in other
words an intrinsic geologic control that helps explain longitudinal trends in channel geometry, grain size,
and reach-scale response to sediment loads. The ERRA goes onto explain how this intrinsic condition
combined with hydraulics at the North Fork South Fork Elk River confluence create backwater
conditions that focus fine sediment. deposition immediately upstream in the impaired reach: These
inherent conditions affect how sediment is routed through the timpaired reach of Elk River, affected by
but also independent of land use history.

Again, we noté that despite the substantial decline in sediment production over the last 20 years
consistently reported by the NCRWQCB, inherent depositional reaches located on the Elk River flood
plain have continued to aggrade, albeit at a lesser rate, and will continue to aggrade, modeling indicates,
even with a 30 percent reduction in sediment loading. While we remain hopeful, it is unclear as to how
or why the ERRA believes a 30 percent reduction in sediment loading is attainable in the near term
consistent with the SWRCB's timeframe for recovery by 2031, as the extent to which additional
restrictions on HRC's timber operations including even a complete shut-down, which of course is not proposed, would result in an estimated reduction in sediment loading of less than 5 percent by our
account. The point of this commentary being that should the three measures currently proposed in
this Draft Order to which HRC objects be put into effect, they will not as the WDR itself notes in
Finding 75, result in or even contribute to the recovery of beneficial uses and the abatement of downstream nuisance flooding. in addition to the fact that these measures are infeasible to
implement, they show no promise of contributing to the objective of the TMDL-increasing the
downstream sediment loading capacity or significantly reducing upstream sediment loading.
It strikes me as important and appropriate, that with this emerging broader understanding of geomorphic setting and land use history beyond timber management, that the regulatory approach does
not remain entrenched in outdated assumptions and prejudice, such as wider stream buffers are
somehow the answer.

As the regulated discharger, and as partners with the NCRWQCB, we cannot support the proposed
Order R1-2019-0021, without our requested changes. We can however agree to additional restrictions
on wet weather road use and minimum canopy retention requirements within existing Class Ill
watercourse riparian buffers as presented and discussed with the NCRWQCB staff this past February.
These acceptable additional restrictions atop the existing WDRs reflect both rigorous best
management practices (BMPs) and the maximum limits of feasibility considering economic,
environmental, legal, social, and technical factors.

9

In addition to its multi-variate, overlapping regulatory requirements, the WDRs will continue to require a
robust and expensive monitoring and reporting program. All of this will continue to be implemented
within the context of the multi-disciplinary, multi-agency THP review process. And importantly, as the
toughest most restrictive regulatory private forest management BMPs in California and likely the
nation, they meet the conceptual 0 load allocation standards set by the Upper Elk River TMDL Action Plan intended to reduce anthropogenic sediment loading towards the conceptual 0 load allocation,
including a substantial margin of safety (MOS), until the sediment Joading capacity of the impacted reaches has been expanded and water quality standards are attained or determined unattainable.

5550 Skylane Blvd Ste A
Santa Rosa, CA 95403-1072

Dear Mr. St. John:

I apologize for the extended delay in responding to you Jetter of December 15, 2017 requesting imput regarding the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) Resolution No. 2017-0046. As you are aware, we sought and were given clarification by the SWRCB of the order in an additional letter to our counsel dated October 15, 2018. On behalf of our
entire organization we are deeply disappointed, after so much effort was put into the process
of adopting the Elk River TMDL and our subsequent WWDR that we find ourselves revisiting this issue. It was abundantly clear at the time of adoption of the TMDL it was the intent of your board for the WDR to be the mechanism where enforceable measures were developed. The TMDL was to provide guidance and goals and the zero-load allocation, was by its very nature, conceptual.,
I want to reiterate our concern that the SWRCB and the RWQCB have now adopted a policy that, if left unchanged, will result in our company being forced to cease all operations in Elk River in 12 years. Zero sediment discharge is an unattainable standard for our operations
We have implemented necessary measures for our operations, consistent with the intent of
the TMDL, to limit sediment discharge associated with our current management practices to a level of insignificance. The adoption. of a policy that requires the elimination of all discharges within the next 12 years is unattainable.
It has been made clear to us, it is not the intent of the RWQCB to force us to cease all
operations in Elk River. It is also clear that all parties involved in this process anticipate that progress will be made to address sedimentation, specifically within the lower Elk River watershed over this twelve-year time frame thereby allowing this order to modified. None
the less, our company is faced with the dire certainty, that without specific intervening action to modify this order within these twelve years, we will be prohibited from managing our
timberlands within Elk River in 2031,

You have asked for input as to how the current WDRS (Order R1-2016-0004) should be
revised to ensure the WDRs fully address the hillslope indicators and numeric targets listed
in Table 2 of the Upper Elk River TMDL Action Plan; and what additional specific provision(s)

Posi Office Bex 996, UNIN; CA BSAW2 Tel. (7071 A43-9180 mic.com, gevedwor

does HRC propose to ensure that all anthropogenic discharges of sediment are eliminated or minimized to the extent feasible.

HRC has carefully reviewed its current approved WDRs within the context of implementing Table 2 of the TMDL Action Plan for consistency with the SWRCB resolution. A 'crosswalk' (Attachment A) was developed to evaluate the extent to which the WDRs address all the TMDL indicator and numeric targets listed in Table 2: This crosswalk is helpful in
demonstrating how the existing WDRs implement the complete suite of hillslope indicators
and numeric targets. Additional provisions we are proposing to be incorporated into revised
WDRs are also shown in response to your request for further certainty that all discharge be
eliminated or minimized to the extent feasible. These additional provisions address wet
weather road use and timber operations within 300 feet of Class l and II watercourses and
150 feet of Class III watercourses. Specific WDR revisions are proposed in Attachment B.
The Upper Elk River: Technical Analysis for Sediment (Tetra Tech 2015) identifies roads and stream channels as the most significant anthropogenic sediment sources of the most recent period analyzed (2004-2011) compared to other controllable sources such as landslides and
surface erosion from harvest areas. Tetra Tech estimates harvest related landslides and
surface erosion sediment delivery combine to be less than 2 percent of total loading compared to roads, which are estimated to deliver 16 percent, and 38 percent from in- channel sources (Le. low order channel incision, bank erosion, and streamside landslides). While delivery from roads is effectively controlled and reduced through improved BMPs, in- channel sources are more complicated. Channel conditions have been altered by historic
practices which prior to the 1970s commonly used stream channels for transportation
corridors. These altered channel conditions are presumed to have higher rates of chronic erosion in response to winter storms than undisturbed channels. The practices which led to these in-channel conditions have long since been abandoned and are prohibited under the current WDRs and FPRs. Modern road building and harvesting techniques have relocated disturbance out of and away from sensitive riparian areas.
We are therefore left to consider what additional actions might be taken to eliminate and
minimize the effects of these past; tream channel impacts. Class I, II, and III watercourses
are currently afforded substantial protection during timber operations under the current. WDRs promoting the restoration of mature riparian forest structure and canopy cover, large
wood recruitment to channels, slope stability, and ground cover. Harvest-related peak flow effects have been addressed through harvest acre limitations established at the sub- watershed level. Stream restoration activities reflecting the most feasible approach for addressing stream channel conditions include:
> HRC's removal of over 170,000 cubic yards of sediment from stream channels at historic
crossing locations since 2008 HRC's North Fork Elk River Coho Help Act large wood introduction project (completed) Cal-Trout's Wrigley floodplain restoration project (completed by HRC) > Redwood Community Action Association (RCAA) and the North Coast Regional Land Trust (NRLT) joint floodplain restoration project on Martin Slough (completed; lower Elk River)

HRC/Trout Unlimited North Fork Elk River riparian road decommissioning large wood introduction, and flood plain restoration project recently submitted to the State Water Board's: 319h grant program, reflect the most feasible approach for addressing stream. channel conditions.

Riparian Zones (Existing and New Provisions]
1. Recognition that the characteristics found within 300 feet of either side of Class I and II watercourses, and within 150 feet of either side of Class III watercourses are the indicators
used to evaluate riparian forest conditions specific to delivery of wood to channels, slope
stability, and ground cover pursuant Table 2 of the TMDL Action Plan. We continue to ensure
these characteristics meet numeric targets through the combination of existing measures found in the WDRs along with new measures.
2. Existing measures occurring within these TMDL Action Plan prescribed indicator zones of
influence include, but are not limited to (1) primarily selection silviculture and total exclusion
of clearcutting; (2] use of a slope stability checklist and licensed geologic review for the identification and mitigation of slope stability issues; (3) no harvest zones adjacent Class I
and Il watercourses providing for maximum shade, wood delivery, slope and bank stability, and undisturbed ground cover; (4) established HCP riparian management zones (RMZs) which exclude the entry of heavy ground based equipment, require the retention of significant forest canopy cover and all down wood, and allow for only single-tree selection/no group harvest; (5) retention of 18 Jargest trees per acre within 100 feet of Class
watercourses; (6) no ignition of burning or mechanical site preparation within RMZ; (7) no harvest of Class III channel trees or trees located on unstable slopes adjacent Class I11
watercourses; (8) no watercourse crossings except at regulatorily permitted locations; (9)
additional riparian management requirements and harvest limitations for the WDR identified
High Risk Areas including the Clapp Gulch, Railroad Gulch, Tom Gulch, McCloud Creek, and portion of Lower South Fork Elk River sub-basins. 3. New proposed WDR provisions include (1) retention of a minimum of 50 percent post harvest
forest canopy cover well distributed throughout the HCP Class III RMZs; (2) exclusion of
group selection harvest areas from within Class III RMZs; (3) no new road construction or re- construction, ground-based logging or site preparation within 300 feet of a Class ] or II watercourse or within 150 feet of a Class III watercourse between October 15 and May 1.

Wet Weather Road Use /New Provisions]
1. Limit log hauling operations to permanent rocked all-season roads meeting HCP storm-proof
standards between November 15t and April 1st,
2. Require a minimum of 48 hours (two days) for roads to dry out following any rain-related shut down of hauling caused by a precipitation event of greater than 0.25 inches rainfall
within any 24-hour period before resuming log hauling. All other existing requirements for
specific road conditions to be met prior to resuming hauling continue to apply.
3. Require erosion control materials be stock-piled on site for all road construction activities
occurring between September 15th and October 15th, and that these materials to be applied
by the end of day prior to any day for which the National Weather Forecast is for a 'chance'
(30 percent or greater) of rain.

As noted above, the TMDL Action Plan identifies the characteristics of riparian zones 300 feet on either side of Class I and II watercourses, and 150 feet on either side of Class III watercourses, as the indicator for meeting numeric targets related to recruitment of wood to channels, slope stability, and ground cover. Actual riparian zones in the ecological sense rarely if ever extend 300 feet upslope of Class I and Il watercourses and 150 feet of Class IlI watercourses; however, activities occurring at these distances have the potential to influence processes within the actual riparian area HRC's approach to riparian conservation and restoration involves a suite of provisions nested within the 300-foot and 150-foot indicator
zones including licensed geologic review and exclusion of clearcutting throughout these
zones along with limitations on road construction and ground-based yarding operations.
The variable width riparian management zones (RMZ) and associated management restrictions found within the TMDL indicator widths have been established specific to the upper Elk River watershed in consultation with state and federal wildlife agencies for the purpose of maximizing large wood recruitment, riparian and aquatic temperature control,
and minimization of ground disturbance and related potential for sediment delivery. The forest characteristics found within the identified TMDL riparian zones resulting from current management indicate riparian health associated with active and potential wood recruitment, slope stability, and ground cover are all improving over time consistent with the goal of the TMDL's numeric target.
The current WDR prohibition of road construction and re-construction beginning September
15th and prohibition of ground-based yarding beginning October 18t, has proven infeasible
as these restrictions are excessive in shortening the logging season, particularly where seasonal wildlife restrictions for the Northern Spotted Owl and Marbled Murrelet prohibit timber operations until September 1% and September 15th, respectively; and have not demonstrated benefit for reducing and eliminating discharge, Analysis of coastal California weather patterns, including those performed by NCRWQCB staff, demonstrate October as a
seasonally dry month with minimal potential for erosion-producing precipitation in the first half of the month. The proposed modification above linking road construction and ground- based yarding restrictions to the indicators listed in Table 2 of the Action Plan will improve
the efficiency and feasibility of these measures.
We are optimistic you will find our proposed amendment to the WDR satisfy your request to address the SWRCB resolution.

Sincerely;
Is/ Dennis Thibeautt

Excerpt from Order No. R1-2016-0004

SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTSI
A. Forest Management 1 HRC shall utilize uneven-aged single-tree and small group selection silviculture as defined in California Code of Regulations, title 14, section 913.1 within its timberlands in the UER watershed. Variable Retention may be used in some instances to address certain stand conditions, such as high levels of whitewood. or hardwood species, animal damage, or general poor form and vigor due to past logging history. Other silvicultural methods that may be applied infrequently include Rehabilitation of Understocked Areas, Seed Tree Removal, and Sanitation Salvage. HRC shall not utilize the clearcut harvest method.

3. Subwatershed average annual harvest rates from the ROWD (Attachment D) fall near or below 2% equivalent clearcut acres averaged over any 10 year period and are generally reasonable. Harvest rates above this threshold may cause concern for cumulative mpacts on water quality. Where an individual, or multiple, THP(s) would result in an average annual harvest rate in any
subwatershed above 2% equivalent clearcut acres over any 10 year period, the Executive Officer may decline to enroll the THP(s), or portions of the THP, or may require additional mitigations or monitoring as a condition of enrollment.
4. Harvesting in High Risk Areas a. High risk areas are defined as those areas identified in HRC's ROWD amendment request dated October 4, 2016 submitted to the Regional Water Board with associated map titled Sensitive Bedrock Sub-Basin and Elk River
Geologic Map.

Waste Discharge Requirements

For

Nonpoint Source Discharges and Other Controllable Water Quality Factors Related to Timber Harvesting and Associated Activities Conducted by Humboldt Redwood
Company, LLC in the
Upper Elk River Watershed
Humboldt County

The California Regional Water Quality Control Board, North Coast Region, (hereinafter Regional Water Board) finds that:

OVERVIEW
1. The purpose of this Order is to update the 2016 Order so that specific requirements ensure that: 1) HRC manages its timberlands in the Elk River watershed in such a
manner that will lead to compliance with hillslope indicators and numeric targets from Table 2 of the TMDL Action Plan; 2) all anthropogenic discharges of sediment are eliminated to the extent feasible, and if not feasibly eliminated, minimized, as soon as
feasible to implement the TMDL zero load allocation; and 3) HRC implement the TMDL Action Plan by complying with the specific and general requirements and prohibitions as prescribed in this Order, which apply throughout its timberlands in the Elk River
watershed, not solely in areas with active timber operations.
2. The Elk River, one of the primary tributaries of Humboldt Bay and an important salmon spawning and rearing habitat, was identified in 1998 as impaired due to excessive
sedimentation/siltation and was subsequently placed on the federal Clean Water Act
• section 303(d) list. The impairment is primarily attributed to land use activities that have been occurring since the 1850s, including but not limited to timber harvesting, forest conversion, agriculture, grazing, road construction, and rural housing development. Water quality impacts resulting from this history of land management activities include:

Sedimentation and threat of sedimentation;
Impaired domestic and agricultural water quality;
Impaired spawning habitat; and Increased frequency and depth of flooding due to sediment.

3. The Upper Elk River (UER) Watershed (see Attachment A), comprises 44.2 square miles
of predominately timberland. in 1997, the Regional Water Board and other state
agencies began to receive reports from downstream residents of increased turbidity, channel filling and flood frequency that were resulting from timber management activities in the UER.

4. High sediment production during the period between 1988-1997 is due to several factors, including an approximate four-fold increase in logging under prior ownership of the primary Iandowner, the Pacific Lumber Company (PALCO). Additional factors include poorly regulated logging practices, a series of winters with above average
precipitation and a series of large storm events, and potentially the effects of a magnitude 7.2 earthquake off Cape Mendocino in 1992.
5. Over time, sediment transported from the UER has deposited in low gradient
downstream reaches and has resulted in ongoing aggradation, encroachment of
riparian vegetation onto relatively recent fine sediment deposits, and an increased
incidence of overbank flooding which has impacted the residential community for the past 20 years. The Technical Analysis for Sediment (Tetra Tech, Inc., 2015) estimated that approximately 640,000 cubic yards of sediment have accumulated within the past two decades in the low gradient stream reaches of the UER. In addition to elevated
sediment loads, hydromodification from channel stabilization, removal of large woody
material, dredging, and channel constrictions in lower portions of the watershed, such as bridges and roads, have diminished the ability of the river to assimilate increased
sediment loads.

6. This most recent period of increased disturbance, which peaked from the mid-1980s to 1998 and has gradually diminished through the present, is most closely attributed to the degradation of conditions in the impacted reacht, In 2008, the Humboldt Redwood Company (HRC) took ownership of PALCO's Elk River property, and is now the largest landowner in the UER, with 79 percent ownership. Prior to the transfer of ownership,
the Regional Water Board adopted waste discharge requirements (WDRs) for PALCO's
ownership in Elk River through Order No. R1-2006-0039.

7. Starting in 1997, the Regional Water Board issued a series of Cleanup and Abatement Orders (CAOs) that required the inventory, prioritization, treatment, and monitoring of existing sediment sources associated with land management activities, prevention of new sediment sources, and monitoring of in-stream sediment-related indices. Treatment of existing controllable sediment discharge sources (CSDS)? have been conducted under CAO Nos. R1-2004-0028 (for the South Fork and Mainstem Elk River)

1 The term impacted reach" applies to the North Fork Elk River below Browns Gulch, the South Fork Elk River below Tom Gulch, and the mainstem of Elk River from the confluence of the North and South Forks downstream
to Berta Road,
Sites that discharge or have the potential to discharge sediment to waters of the state in violation of water quality standards, that are caused or affected by human activity, and that may feasibly and reasonably respond, to prevention and minimization management measures.

and R1-2006-0055 [for the North Fork Elk River). By 2011, 80% of the top 100 sites with the greatest potential for environmental impact were treated. In 2012, HRC submitted a new master treatment schedule to inventory and schedule implementation
of treatment to control sediment discharge of the remaining CSDS in the watershed, which is included as Attachment C of this Order.

8. In September of 1998, the Regional Water Board issued Cleanup and Abatement Order No. 98-100, requiring cleanup and abatement of THP-related discharges by restoring damaged domestic and agricultural water supplies in the North Fork Elk River. HRC currently provides drinking water service to twelve residences, while seeking final resolution and termination of the CAO.

Following HRC's acquisition of PALCO's timberlands in 2008, HRC had been operating under Order No. R1-2006-0039, Elk River Watershed-specific Waste Discharge Requirements (WWDR) Issued by the Regional Water Board in 2006. Among other requirements, the WWDR included receiving water limitations, including rate of harvest
(ROH) limitations, which were established based on two scientific models intended to
limit peak flow increases and sediment discharge from harvest-related landslides. All Regional Water Board Orders that pertain to HRC's current activities were originally issued to PALCO and amended by Order No. R1-2008-0100 to reflect HRC's ownership of the former PALCO holdings.
10. The WWDR (Order No. R1-2006-0039) was not tailored to the management practices of HRC and did not comprehensively address HRC's obligations for cleanups and total maximum daily load (TMDL) implementation. An updated WDR would provide a more
comprehensive permit that reflects current watershed conditions, changes in management practices, and new technical analyses of watershed sediment conditions.

11. Therefore, on September 22, 2015, pursuant to Water Code section 13260(a), HRC submitted a report of waste discharges (ROWD) for its timber harvesting and related management activities. HRC's ROWD was subsequently amended on March 11, 2016
and October 4, 2016. The ROWD includes HRC's proposed long term strategy, including
measures designed to prevent or minimize water quality impacts from activities
associated with its forest management, including;
Timber harvesting; Road use, construction, reconstruction, decommissioning, repair, and
maintenance;
Measures to prevent or minimize controllable sediment discharge from roads,
skid trails, landslides, and other sources related to timberland management;
Retention of riparian vegetation to preserve and/or restore shade, supply large wood, filter sediment from upslope sources, help maintain and restore channel form and in-stream habitat, and moderate peak flows;
Treatment of controllable sediment discharge sources;
In-stream and riparian zone habitat restoration by enhancement of in-stream large wood for habitat restoration;

Implementation and Effectiveness Monitoring; and Watershed trend monitoring.
While the ROWD, including amendments, was deemed complete, it was not considered
fully adequate to meet all water quality requirements associated with Elk River. As
such, on November 30, 2016, the Regional Water Board adopted Order No. R1-2016-
0004, Waste Discharge Requirements for Nonpoint Source Discharges and Other Controllable Water Quality Factors Related to Timber Harvesting and Associated Activities Conducted by Humboldt Redwood Company, LLC In the Upper Elk River Watershed, Humboldt County [the 2016 Order]. The 2016 Order established specific requirements based largely on the ROWD, with additional measures as warranted to meet applicable water quality requirements. As discussed in Finding 27 below, subsequent to adoption of the 2016 Order, the State Water Resource Control Board's resolution (No. 2017-0046) adopting the Upper Elk River Sediment TMDL Action Plan (TMDL Action Plan)(Attachment E) included a finding (Finding 9) "that the North Coast Water Board's WDRs and any other orders for the two major landowners that conduct timber harvesting will incorporate specific provisions that implement all of the TMDL hillslope indicators and numeric targets, unless the regional board makes specific findings about why any omitted hillslope indicators or numeric targets are not appropriate or feasible." The State Water Board further required "the WDRs and any other orders for the two major landowners will also contain any additional specific
provisions to ensure that all anthropogenic discharges of sediment are eliminated to
the extent feasible and, if not feasibly eliminated, minimized as soon as feasible but not
later than 2031" (amended via a letter dated October 15, 2018). The State Water
Board's understanding of the TMDL is that absent amendment of the TMDL, "the WDRs and any other orders will require the landowners to achieve the zero-load allocation for all anthropogenic discharges of sediment as soon as feasible, but no later than 2031."

This Order modifies the 2016 Order to include revised requirements to fully implement
the TMDL hillslope indicators and numeric targets and ensure that all anthropogenic
discharges of sediment are eliminated or mimmized, and includes findings expanding
on how the requirements of the Order implement those indicators and targets.

REGULATORY ACTIONS IN THE UPPER ELK RIVER
12. CAL FIRE is the state agency responsible for overseeing timber harvesting activities through implementation of the Forest Practice Rules (FPR). (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, §5895 et seq.3) Under the Forest Practices Act, non-federal landowners proposing to harvest timber are required to have an approved timber harvest plan (THP) prior to commencing timber harvesting. The Regional Water Board, California Department of
Fish and Wildlife (CDFW), California Geologic Survey (CGS), and other agencies are

responsible agencies charged with the multidisciplinary review of THPs to ensure
compliance with applicable state laws.
13. The FPRs include rules for protection of the beneficial uses of water, including rules for enhanced protection in watersheds with listed anadromous salmonids. The FPRs
provide measures designed to prevent sediment discharge; (See FPR §§ 914, 934
[harvesting practices and erosion control]; $§ 923, 943 [prescriptions for construction,
reconstruction, use, maintenance, and decommissioning of roads and landings]: S5
916.4, 936.4 [requiring evaluation of sites that could adversely impact beneficial uses of water and treatment of such sites when feasible]). FPR S 916.9 requires that every timber operation shall be planned and conducted to comply with the terms of a total
maximum daily load (TMDL). The FPRs also provide measures to limit reductions in
riparian shade to moderate water temperature, Public Resource Code § 4581.71 specifies that a timber harvesting plan may not be approved if the appropriate regional
water quality control board finds, based on substantial evidence, that the timber
operations proposed in the plan will result in a discharge into a watercourse that has been classified as impaired due to sediment under Clean Water Act section 303(d). Full and proper implementation of the FPRs related to sediment discharge from timberlands can contribute greatly towards achieving water quality standards. (See e.g. RB1-2013- 0005 [FPRs are generally adequate to implement water quality standards from the Water Quality Control Plan for the North Coast Region (Basin Plan) if implemented correctly]). Accordingly, this Order relies in part upon the water quality protection provided by the FPRs. Additional protection measures are necessary to protect the beneficial uses of water for site-specific conditions, prevent nuisance, and to comply
with a TMDL load allocation.

14. HRC ownership in the Elk River watershed is covered by a multi-species state and federal Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP) approved in 1999. The HCP implements state
and federal Incidental Take Permits (ITP) issued for aquatic species including Chinook salmon, coho salmon, steelhead trout, southern torrent salamander, tailed-frog, red- legged frog, foothill yellow-legged frog, and the northwestern pond turtle in conformance with the state and federal Endangered Species Acts. The HCP includes a Watershed Analysis (WA) component for focused inventory and investigation of
conditions and processes related to mass wasting, surface erosion, riparian function,
stream channel, and aquatic habitat. The most recent WA iteration for the Elk River is
the Elk River/Salmon Creek Watershed Analysis (ERSC WA) Revisited, prepared by
HRC in June 2014. The ERSC WA establishes forest management prescriptions pertaining to slope stability, and riparian forest protection are established in consultation with multiple state and federal resource agencies. While the HCP and WA impose prescriptions and other requirements helpful for water quality protection needs and therefore can be relied upon in this Order, they cannot ensure full compliance with federal and state water quality laws, including protection of all the designated beneficial uses of water listed in Finding 17 below.

15. In spite of efforts to control sediment discharge, beneficial uses in the downstream impacted reaches remain impaired, the stream channel continues to aggrade, and flaoding frequency has increased. It appears that the river's capacity to transport sediment out of the aggraded reach is limited by hydrologic and geomorphic constraints and sediment continues to work its way down through the fluvial system. In addition, even with implementation of current management practices and restrictions, ongoing timber harvesting and associated activities will result in increased sediment discharge, further exacerbating the already impaired condition.
16. The Basin Plan, last updated in 2018, is the Regional Water Board's master water
quality control planning document. It identifies beneficial uses and water quality objectives for waters of the state, including surface waters and groundwater. It also includes programs of implementation to achieve water quality objectives.
17. The beneficial uses for the Upper Elk River and its tributaries include:
Municipal - Domestic Water Supply Non-Contact Water Recreation
(MUN) (REC-2)
Agricultural Supply (AGR) Commercial or Sport Fishing
(COMM)
Industrial Service Supply (IND) Cold Freshwater Habitat (COLD)
Industrial Process Supply (PRO) Wildlife Habitat (WILD

*Hydropower Generation (POW) Aquaculture (AQUA)
Water Contact Recreation (REC-1)

18. On May 12, 2016, the Regional Water Board approved the Action Plan for the Upper Elk River Sediment TMDL (TMDL Action Plan). On April 4. 2018, the United States Environmental Protection Agency approved the TMDL Action Plan, the final step in the process necessary for it to be amended into the Basin Plan, following approvals by the State Water Resources Control Board on August 1, 2017, and the Office of Administrative Law on March 8, 2018.
19. The TMDL Action Plan includes a phased total maximum daily load (TMDL) for
sediment and describes the implementation actions necessary to attain water quality standards in the Upper Elk River Watershed. The goal of the TMDL Action Plan is to achieve sediment related water quality standards, including the protection of the
beneficial uses of water in the upper watershed and prevention of nuisance conditions. The TMDL Action Plan establishes the sediment load consistent with current conditións
in the impacted reaches, identifies a process for assessing and implementing necessary

Waste Discharge Requirements -7
DRAFT Order No. R1-2019-0021 June 19, 2019

and feasible remediation and restoration actions, and describes a program of implementation to be considered and incorporated into regulatory and non-regulatory actions of the Regional Water Board and other stewardship partners in the watershed.
20. Site specific assessment of water quality conditions in the Upper Elk River Watershed confirm that sediment discharges from timberlands in the upper watershed and sedimentation in the impacted reaches, combining with other natural (e.g., tectonics, geology, soil characteristics, geomorphology, climate and vegetation) and anthropogenic (e.g., pre-Forest Practices Act logging, ranching, farming, roads, and residential development) factors exceed the water quality objectives for sediment, suspended material, settleable matter, and turbidity and result in adverse impact to several beneficial uses, including domestic water supplies (MUN), agricultural water supplies (AGR), cold-water habitat (COLD); spawning, reproduction and early development (SPWN); rare, threatened, or endangered species (RARE), and recreation (REC-1 and REC-2). Sedimentation in the impacted reaches also has resulted in conditions of nuisance, including increased rates and depth of annual flooding and loss
of property, use of property, access to property, and risk to human health and welfare.
21. The Technical Analysis for Sediment identifies the key sediment source categories that produce sediment in the Upper Elk River Watershed. Sediment discharges resulting from timber harvest and other land-management activities in the most recent analysis
time period (2004-2011) are (in order of significance): in-channel sources (headward channel incision, bank erosion, and streamside landslides), discharges from existing land use-related sediment discharge sites, other road-related discharges, and harvest- related discharges.
22. Water quality indicators and associated numeric targets outlined in the TMDL are not independently enforceable and are designed to measure progress towards attaining
water quality objectives for suspended material, settleable material, turbidity and sediment. The water quality indicators are divided into hillslope and instream, as identified in Tables 2 and 3 of the Action Plan, respectively. The Action Plan states that the hillslope indicators and numeric targets in Table 2 are designed to inform Board
actions and can be incorporated into orders, as appropriate and to the maximum extent
feasible. The instream water quality indicators and targets are designed to help assess the overall effectiveness of the program of implementation and confirm progress towards attainment of applicable water quality standards.
23. TMDLs must be established at levels necessary to attain and maintain the applicable
water quality standards with seasonal variations and a margin of safety (MOS) (40 CFR
§ 130.7(c)(1)). The TMDL represents the maximum amount of a pollutant that can be
discharged to a waterbody, taking into account critical conditions of stream flow,
loading, and water quality parameters. The TMDL is equivalent to the loading capacity of the waterbody for the pollutant in question.
24. The Upper Elk River Sediment TMDL is set equal to the loading capacity of the waterbody. The loading capacity of the Upper Elk River Watershed is defined as the

Waste Discharge Requirements •8;
DRAFT Order No. R1-2019-0021 June 19,2019

total sediment load (natural and management-related) that can be discharged into the Upper Elk River and its tributaries without impacting beneficial uses of water, causing an exceedance of water quality objectives, reducing the quality of high-quality water, or creating nuisance conditions. Because capacity for sediment is limited by the ongoing
aggradation in the impacted reaches, the loading capacity for additional sediment is
defined as zero until the capacity of the impacted reaches can be expanded.
25. The program of implementation identifies a combination of regulatory and non- regulatory actions that will lead to the attainment of water quality objectives, recovery
of beneficial uses, protection of high-quality waters, and prevention of nuisance conditions in the Upper Elk River Watershed. Phase 1 of the Upper Elk River Sediment TMDL Implementation Plan requires control of all existing and potential future
sediment sources in the upper watershed while the Elk River Recovery Assessment is
completed and the Elk River Watershed Stewardship Program is developed, initiated,
and successfully results in the activities necessary to expand the sediment loading
capacity of the impacted reaches and abate nuisance conditions.
26. WDRs are the primary regulatory mechanism utilized by the Regional Water Board to
control the nonpoint source pollution resulting from past and ongoing timber
harvesting activities, the dominant land use in Upper Elk River Watershed. Existing
adverse cumulative impacts from current and past land management practices combined with watershed characteristics (such as sensitive geology and altered bydrologic conditions) require that additional actions be taken beyond those currently being implemented in the Upper Elk River Watershed, Updated management actions are necessary to prevent continued impact to beneficial uses and contributions to downstream nuisance conditions that result from ongoing timberland management. The WDRs must consider the unique watershed factors that influence the discharge of sediment so as to properly update management practices and better manage watershed
effects.

27. In its resolution adopting the TMDL Action Plan, the State Water Board included the
finding that its "understandings of the TMDL Action Plan's requirements and
statements described above are (1) that hillslope indicators and numeric targets in Table 2 apply throughout a discharger's area of land ownership and not solely in areas of active harvest, (2) that the Regional Water Board's WDRs and any other orders for the two major landowners that conduct timber harvesting will incorporate specific provisions that implement all of the hillslope indicators and numeric targets in Table.2,
unless the regional board makes specific findings about why any omitted hillslope indicators or numeric targets are not appropriate or feasible, (3) the WDRs and any other orders for the two major landowners will also contain any additional specific
provisions to ensure that all anthropogenic discharges of sediment are minimized and
eliminated, and (4) in the absence of a future amendment to the TMDL Action Plan,
including an amendment based on successful implementation of the Watershed
Stewardship Program resulting in expanded sediment loading capacity in the impacted reach, the WDRs and any other orders will require the landowners to achieve the zero

DRAFT Order No. R1-2019-0021

load allocation for all anthropogenic discharges of sediment as soon as feasible, but no later than 2031." In a letter dated October 15, 2018, the State Water Board provided the following clarification to understanding 3 above, as follows: "the WDRs and any other orders for the two major landowners will also contain any additional specific provisions to ensure that all anthropogenic discharges of sediment are minimized and eliminated to the extent feasible and, if not feasibly eliminated minimized, as soon as feasible but not later than 2031" [strikeout and underline are from the original October
15, 2018 letter].

28. The Order provides a water quality regulatory structure for HRC to prevent and/or
address discharges of waste and other controllable water quality factors associated
with timber harvest activities in the UER watershed. The Order provides for
implementation of rigorous best management practices (BMP) prepared in collaboration with HRC, according to the sediment loading risk of subwatersheds (see Attachment A, Elk River Location Map). It provides a minimum 5-year interim program
where HRC will limit timber harvest activities in high risk areas to allow time for stewardship efforts (see Findings 66 through 68) to move forward and improve conditions in the impacted reach. High risk areas are defined as those areas identified in HRC's ROWD amendment request dated October 4, 2016 submitted to the Regional
Water Board with associated map titled Sensitive Bedrock Sub-Basin and Elk River
Geologic Map (see Finding 66).

29. Table 2 from the TMDL Action Plan describes Hillslope Water Quality Indictors and
Numeric targets. Hillslope indicators fall into four general categories; roads, harvest related, management discharge sites, and specific Upper Elk River watershed indicators. Following final adoption and approval of the TMDL Action Plan, Regional
Water Board staff evaluated the specific requirements of the 2016 Order to: 1)
determine whether the provisions are adequate to fully implement all the TMDL
hillslope indicators and numeric targets, and 2) where the provisions of the 2016 Order may not fully implement indicators and targets, request that HRC propose additional measures, where such feasible and appropriate measures exist, to implement the hillslope indicators and numeric targets. The results of that evaluation are described in Findings 34 through 79 below. The Regional Water Board found that in large part, the
2016 Order is expected to implement the TMDL Hillslope Water Quality Indicators but
may not be fully adequate to implement certain Specific Upper Elk River Watershed
Indicators. As such, following discussions with Regional Water Board staff, HRC
proposed revisions to specific provisions of the 2016 Order to implement TMDL hillslope targets and load allocation and on February 15, 2019, submitted the proposed
revisions. The revisions primarily address expanded riparian zone protection
measures and seasonal restrictions on hauling. This Order supersedes the 2016 Order
and establishes new requirements deemed necessary and appropriate by the Regional Wäter Board for HRC's Management Activities conducted within the Upper Elk River watershed to fully comply with the TMDL Action Plan.

30. This Order authorizes discharges from certain cleanup and restoration activities as well
as from ongoing timber harvesting and associated activities. Cleanup and restoration
activities may result in small short-term discharges associated with restoration work to
control sediment discharge from of roads, landings, skid trails, and watercourse
crossings and placement of large wood into streams or excavation to stabilize or
remove fill material stored in channels and adjacent riparian zones. The potential impacts of minor short-term discharges are outweighed by the benefits of long-term sediment control derived by such projects.
31. The ROWD, as amended in a request dated October 4, 2016, identified high-riskareas with respect to water quality. Sediment production from these high-risk areas, which are also located directly above and adjacent to the impacted reach of the South Fork Elk
River, is among the highest observed throughout the UER. The relative risk rating informs specific protection measures applicable to these high-risk areas, including
limited timber harvest actívities. (See Order Section I.A.4.)
32. The findings below describe reasonable waste discharge requirements for HRC timber management and associated activities in the UER watershed. In this case, a significant portion of in-channel sources are likely to be mobilized and transported to the
impacted reach over time, regardless of whether additional upslope timber harvesting occurs. In-channel sources include headward migration of low order channels, streamside landslides and unstable streambanks resulting from ground disturbances from past and on-going timber haryesting activities. Stringent controls are necessary to prevent exacerbation of these sources from continuing timber harvesting activities. The sediment source analysis estimated that approximately 56% of the sediment loading in the UER is from in-channel sources This increases the need to further
constrain any additional sediment inputs that are controllable in order to make

Waste Discharge Requirements -12- [ürte 19,2019
DRAFT Order No, R1-2019-0021

progress toward attainment of the load allocation and protection of beneficial uses. Therefore, this Order includes stringent waste discharge requirements designed tö minimize new sediment production and to control and remediate existing sediment inputs to the extent feasible. Monitoring will be required to determine whether implementation is leading to measurable improvements. In addition, limiting timber harvesting activities that are likely to generate additional sediment in high-risk areas is
appropriate, and the Watershed Stewardship Program (see Findings 76 through 79) will take active measures to improve downstream beneficial uses.
33. Findings below provide a discussion of HRC's management plan addressing water quality controls, including measures proposed in its February 1, 2019 submittal (Attachment F of this Order). This Order includes requirements in addition to those
HRC has proposed as deemed necessary by the Regional Water Board in order to implement water quality regulations contained in the Basin Plan, including hillslope indicators and numeric targets from Table 2 of the TMDL Action Plan and the zero-load
allocation. The additional requirements are based on information contained in the
evidentiary record that supports this Order, including the Technical Report and additional evidence that informed the Regional Water Board's decision to adopt the TMDL Action Plan. The Order incorporates and includes the following components: Measures to Prevent Sediment Discharge;
0. Forest Management;
O® Riparian Zones Protection;
O Roads Management; 0 Landslide Prevention;
o Wet Weather Restrictions; and o Limiting Timber Harvesting Activities in High Risk Areas Inventory and Treatment of Existing Controllable Sediment Sources;
Watershed Restoration Efforts; and
Monitoring and Reporting Program.

SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS AND RATIONALE
Measures to Prevent Sediment Discharge
34. Specific requirements to prevent new sediment discharge fall into several categories
discussed below, including forest management (including harvest rate límitations),
riparian protection, toads management, landslide prevention, and wet weather prescriptions. Management measures in separate categories often overlap, and also provide benefits relevant to other categories, For example, riparian protections and proper road management can help reduce landslides. The categories below are provided as a way to organize the discussion but should not be viewed in isolation.

Also, practices implemented to prevent and minimize elevated sediment discharges
may also help control elevated water temperatures. While the UER is not listed as impaired for temperature, removal of trees providing shade to watercourses and decreased channel depth due to in-filling of pools with sediment can result in elevated
water temperature. Due to the proximity of the UER to the ocean and the moderating

Waste Discharge Requirements -13- June 19, 2019
DRAFT Order No. R1-2019-0021

effects of the marine influences and stringent BMPs for control of sediment that include
significant tree retention the will provide shade along all watercourses, elevated water
temperatures are not anticipated to result from HRC's management activities,

Forest Management/Harvest Rate
5. Specific UER watershed hillslope indicators and associated numeric targets generally
address protection of channels and riparian zones from impacts related to ground
disturbance and tree removal. Hillslope indicators include headward incision in low-
order channels, actively eroding channel banks, peak flow, and characteristics of riparian zones. All of these indicators are interrelated and closely associated with the
effects of tree removal on hydrologic processes and hillslope and riparian ground disturbance. Tree removal can result in reduced interception, evaporation, and evapotranspiration of rainfall by forest canopy and can therefore potentially increase the peak flows and landslides (Lewis, 2003) (Reid and Lewis, 2007) (Pearse and Rowe,
1979). Tree roots enhance the strength of shallow soils, increasing the soil's ability to
resist failure. When trees are harvested, their roots gradually decay, reducing the
reinforcement they provide and increasing the potential for shallow landslides (Ziemer, 1981). Harvesting trees can potentially increase peak flows and decrease root strength, which can contribute to landslides and increase erosion throughout a watershed. These impacts can be reduced or prevented by limiting the intensity and rate of canopy
removal through silvicultural prescriptions designed to protect riparian zone function
and limit hydrologic changes related to upslope canopy removal.
36. Limiting the rate of harvest in a watershed is an important management variable to
control peak flow increases and the effects of loss of root strength due to tree removal.
Various studies cite specific thresholds for the rate of harvest, above which, cumulative impacts become more likely to occur and have linked specific processes to watershed impacts, such as increased peak flows from road and canopy removal (Lisle et al. 2000, Lewis et al. 2001), landslide related sediment discharge (Reid, 1998), road density (Cedarholm et al. 1981, Gucinski et al. 2001, Trombulak et al, 2000), or equivalent
clearcut area* (USDA Forest Service, 1974). It is unknown to what extent increased
impacts related to high harvest rates documented in these studies may be due to management practices in effect at the time of these studies that are not considered to be as protective as current practices or whether the impacts may be the result of changes in inherent watershed processes due to reductions in canopy and ground disturbance.

4 Equivalent clearcut area (ECA) is a widely used methodology developed by the USFS to account for the relative impacts of different types of silvicultural treatment. It assigns a weighting factor of one to clearcutting and a value less than one for partial harvesting silvicultural treatments. The weighting factor for a silvicultural treatment is multiplied by total area treated under each silviculture to arrive at a normalized disturbance calculation. Therefore, 100 acres of selection harvest, which is typically assigned a ECA factor of 0.5, would be counted as 50 equivalent clearcut acres.

37. HRC has implemented a significantly different silvicultural strategy from PALCO that
predominantly utilizes partial harvesting methods such as uneven-aged single-tree and small group selection (ROWD section 4.1). Partial harvesting results in post-harvest
conditions that are less susceptible to mass wasting and increased erosional processes as compared to clearcut harvesting. HRC does not utilize the clearcut harvest method and does not harvest old growth?. In addition, HRC's management practices include
measures to control erosion and sediment production.

38. Section 4.0 of the ROWD describes HRC's Forest Management Plan, including projected timber harvesting over a twenty-year period between 2015 and 2034 based on multiple management factors such as growth and inventory, forest canopy, protection of critical
terrestrial and aquatic habitat, and watershed analysis constraints. HRC's projected
harvest can be described as: 1) average annual harvest acreage (and equivalent clearcut
acres) and average overlapping crown canopy for each five-year period throughout the UER (ROWD Figure 4-2); as well as 2) for individual subwatersheds (ROWD Figures 4-3 and 4-4), HRC's projected harvest scenario shows increases in standing timber
inventory and yield over 20 years.

39, Watershed-wide average annual harvest rates proposed in the ROWD for each five-year
period vary between 466 and 605 acres (223 to 303 equivalent clear cut acres). These
rates are lower than required under the 2006 WWDRs, which allowed annual harvest rates of 1.9% in the North Fork and 1.8% and upwards in the South Fork. Based on the
transition to uneven-aged management under HRC's ownership, the proposed average
annual harvest rate for each five-year period through the year 2034 for the entire UER
watershed is less than 1.5% equivalent clearcut acres, the harvest rate above which
Klein etal. (2012) found elevated chronic turbidity levels.
Figures 4-3 and 4-4 of the ROWD show projected harvest acreage and overlapping overstory canopy by subwatershed in each five-year period over a 20-year time period. Modeled canopy changes for each five-year increment over the 20-year period generally show a balance between reductions in canopy due to harvesting and increases from regrowth. For the majority of individual subbasins, canopy changes tend to be positive (increased canopy) for the first three five-year periods, with some decreases. Decreases in canopy occur more frequently during the period between 2030 and 2034.
40. The numeric target for peak flows specifies limiting increases in peak flows related to timber harvesting in individual Class I1 and III catchment to less than 10% in ten years.
Significant challenges are presented when attempting to manage for specific peak flow
changes resulting from specific canopy reduction at a small catchment scale. Grant et al (2008) found the minimum detectable change in peak flow for site scale analysis to be

5 Variable Retention may be used in some instances as an alternative silviculture to address certain stand conditions, such as high levels of whitewood or hardwood species, animal damage, or general poor form and vigor due to past logging history. Other silvicultural methods that may be applied infrequently include Rehabilitation of Understocked Areas, Seed Tree Removal, and Sanitation Salvage.

‡10%. Annual variation in peak flows in small catchments can be up to two orders of magnitude. Grant et al also report that peak flow effects are not present in streams with slopes greater than 10%, which would include most Class II and III streams. The peak
flow model derived from work in Caspar Creek is widely used to estimate peak flow changes from canopy removal and a modified version of that model was used in the 2006 Elk River and Freshwater Creek WDRs. However, that model was not calibrated for drainage areas less than 25 acres, which would also exclude many Class II and III catchments in Elk River. Further confounding use of a specific peak flow target is that peak flow changes are greatest in early season smaller storms and low recurrence interval storms and diminish with increasing storm size and seasonal watershed
saturation. In addition, hydrologic effects from canopy removal typically recover to
near pre-harvest levels after approximately ten years due to revegetation (Keppeler, et al, 2003). HRC's partial harvesting strategy and prescriptions for canopy retention in riparian zones (discussed further in Findings 45 through 50) result in post-harvest
canopy retention within Class Il or IIl catchments that meet the numeric target of less
than 10% in ten years. Modeled changes in peak flows from canopy removal on HRC's timberlands in Elk River using the regression equation developed from the North Fork Caspar Creek (Lisle et al. 2000; Lewis et al. 2001; Cafferata and Reid, 2012), indicated. that implementation of the numeric target for peak flow can generally be met by limiting canopy reduction by appropriate harvest rate limits and robust riparian
buffers.

41. HRC's modeled harvest rates from Figure 4.3 of the ROWD (Attachment D) will comply
with hillslope numeric targets for peak flow. Average annual harvest rates in
subwatersheds fall near or below 2% equivalent clearcut acres averaged over any 10- year period in most subwatersheds. Harvest rates above this threshold would cause concern for cumulative impacts on water quality that have been observed from intensive logging practices in the past. Each timber harvest plan (THP) is evaluated individually for impacts to water quality and that review may reveal the need for additional constraints. Where an individual, or multiple, THP(s) would exceed this threshold of concern in any subwatershed, the Regional Water Board Executive Officer
may decline to enroll the THP(s), or portions of the THP, or may require additional mitigations or monitoring as a condition of enrollment (See also Section I.A.3 and
Section Vl.)

Riparian Zone Protection
42. Specific UER watershed indicators and numeric targets from the TMDL Action Plan associated with channel stability and riparian zone protection include the following:
Improvement in the quality/health of the riparian stand so as to promote: 1) delivery of wood to channels, 2) slope stability, and 3) ground cover within 300 feet of Class I and Il watercourses and within 150 feet of a Class III
watercourse;
No increase in the existing drainage network through headward incision in low
order channels; and
Decreasing length of channel with actively eroding banks.

43. Properly functioning riparian areas in UER can promote complexity in stream channels, both in the steep upper watershed as well as in the depositional reach. A riparian zone helps maintain healthy stream ecosystems and supports beneficial uses by:
Stabilizing banks through provision of root cohesion on banks and floodplains;
Filtering sediment and nutrients from upslope sources;
Supplying large wood to the channel, which maintains channel form and improves in-stream habitat complexity;
Helping to maintain channel form, in-stream habitat, and an appropriate
sediment regime through the restriction of sediment inputs or metering of sediment through the system;
Moderating downstream flood peaks through temporary upstream storage and
infiltration of flood water;
Helping maintain cool water temperatures through provision of shade and creation of a cool and humid microclimate over the stream; and
Providing both plant and animal food resources for the aquatic ecosystem in the form of, for example, leaves, branches, and terrestrial insects.
44. Alteration of physical processes in riparian zones have led to reduced forest stand complexity, including reduction in the number of trees available within riparian areas for recruitment to streams, increased surface erosion and landsliding, and destabilization of stream channels. Increased peak flows from tree removal can result in alteration of stream hydrographs by increasing the magnitude and shortening the duration of peak flows in watercourses. Changes in hydrographs can result in channel scour and increases in streamside landslides. Subsurface erosion of soil pipes is prevalent in the UER, particularly in swales above small headwater channels.
Preferential flow through soil pipes results in internal erosion of the pipe, which may produce guilies by tunnel collapse. Expansion of the existing drainage network by the process of headward erosion and upslope migration of channel initiation points likely resulted from a combination of hydrology (increased peak flow) and channel
disturbance from operation of heavy equipment and dragging logs in streams and riparian areas. Considerations of the interactions between sediment processes, water
temperature, and riparian trees are essential for evaluating and avoiding management- related impacts to streams. Due to the highly erosive nature of underlying geologic units, channels in the watershed are naturally vulnerable to destabilization, which has been exacerbated by logging Management of riparian zones must be designed to preserve and restore the function of riparian vegetation and hillslope processes,
including retention of adequate riparian zone trees and avoiding use of roads and heavy equipment on vulnerable hillslopes and swales. Impacts to channels can be reduced or prevented by excluding tractor yarding and minimizing peak flow increases by limiting
canopy removal through requirements for riparian zone protection and harvest rate
limits.

45. HRC's timber operations in riparian zones are subject to the ERSC WA prescriptions
designed to prevent or minimize sediment delivery to streams and maintain and
restore riparian forests for the benefit of shade canopy and large woody debris recruitment. These prescriptions are enforced through specific requirements for
timber harvest and road construction, re-construction, and maintenance activities. The
ERSC WA established riparian management zones (hereinafter referred to as HCP RMZs) with specified widths and prescriptions including the following.
No harvesting within 150 feet of the lower eight miles of the North Fork Elk
River, within 50 feet of all other Class I watercourses, and 30 feet of Class II
watercourses;
Retention of the 18 largest trees per acre within 100 feet of Class I
watercourses,
Large tree, down wood, and canopy retention requirements throughout the
remainder of the HCP RMZ;
Entry into Class I and II riparian zones are permitted no more than once every
20 years;
Additional hillslope prescriptions that restrict harvesting, road use/construction, and heavy equipment use on inner gorge slopes and headwall swales;
A "Hillslope Management Checklist" to identify areas that are vulnerable to mass
wasting:
No harvesting of Class III channel trees or trees located on unstable slopes
adjacent to Class III watercourses;
Silvicultural treatments in HCP RMZs to develop or maintain late seral forest
conditions, such as thinning from below or individual tree selection;
Unevenage silviculture practices and post-harvest conditions upslope from HCP
RMZS.
46. Section I.B of this Order establishes additional protection measures for watercourses and riparian zones throughout HRC's timberlands in the UER. This Order extends protections beyond the HCP RMZs to comply with the TMDL hillslope indicators and numeric targets. These expanded riparian protection zones are referred to as the TMDL
RMZs. This Order incorporates HCP RMZ prescriptions for riparian protection as
minimum protection standards but includes additional requirements within the TMDL
RMZs that achieve the following objectives: extend protections upslope beyond the HCP
RMZ widths, provide post-harvest tree retention standards, minimize ground disturbing activities, and eliminate activities near sensitive areas. These additional protection measures within the TMDL RMZs, include:
Implementation of prescriptions for HCP RMZs as described in Finding 48,
above;
Single tree selection silviculture in HCP RMZs for Class I, II, and III watercourses and within TMDL RMZs;
No group openings in the TMDL RMZs; Retention of 50% post-harvest overstory canopy within 300 feet of Class I and
II watercourses;

Retention of 50% post-harvest overstory canopy within 150 feet of Class III
watercourses;
Limits on ground-based equipment and enhanced erosion control practices in TMDL RMZS;
Avoidance of tractor crossings in unchanneled swales;
Retention of trees along the center line of swales and areas of subsurface flow
paths.

47. Section I.C of this Order establishes the following riparian zone management measures for high risk areas (hereinafter referred to as High Risk RMZs) that are in addition to
the HCP RMZ prescriptions specified in Section I.B. High Risk RMZs were established in
the 2016 Order and remain unchanged in this Order: High Risk RMZs for Class Il and IlI watercourses extend up to 200 feet and 100
feet, respectively, on either side of the channel or to the hy drologic divide; No harvesting between 30 feet and 20 feet of Class Il and IlI watercourses,
respectively;
Between 30 feet and 200 feet or to the hydrologic divide of Class It watercourses, retain a minimum of 60% post-harvest canopy coverage;
Between 20 feet and 100 feet or the hydrologic divide of Class III watercourse, retamn a minimum of 70% post-harvest conifer canopy coverage.

Control of Sediment from Roads
48. Road-related numeric targets from Table 2 include: 100% of road segments hydrologically disconnected from watercourses to the maximum extent feasible,
decreasing road surface erosion, and decrease in sediment delivery from new and
reactivated road-related landslides. Sediment TMDLs adopted for watersheds throughout the North Coast Region have identified logging roads as one of the most significant sources of anthropogenic sediment discharge. Logging roads can alter hillslope hydrologic processes and increase sediment discharge from surface and gully erosion and landslides. Roads can contribute to landsliding by undermining and oversteepening slopes and placing fill material on steep slopes. Roads also intercept and concentrate shallow groundwater and surface runoff, which can cause gully erosion and saturate vulnerable slopes, increasing the potential for failure. Road crossings of watercourses are subject to the force of high stream flows and failure usually results in direct delivery of sediment to streams. Road crossings of watercourses are one of the most common controllable sediment sources. Management practices have become
standard in timberlands throughout the North Coast to reduce the potential for road
related sediment discharge. Inventory and treatment of existing roads is addressed under a separate heading below.
49. A programmatic approach to road construction, reconstruction, maintenance, decommissioning, and regular inspections is essential to controlling sediment discharge
from roads. A widely used reference document for planning, designing, constructing, reconstructing, maintaining, and decommissioning roads on forestlands in the North

Waste Discharge Requiremepts -19-
DRAFT Order No. R1-2019-0021 June 19, 2019

Coast is the Handbook of Forest and Ranch Roads (Weaver and Hagans, 1994)4. The Handbook contains a comprehensive suite of measures for forestland roads that the
Regional Water Board consider adequate and necessary to control sediment discharge
from roads. Roads that have implemented all feasible site-specific sediment control measures as described in the Handbook are referred to as "storm-proofed." Storm-proofed roads incorporate the design features as summarized below into
construction of new roads or reconstruction of existing roads:
Hydrologically disconnecting road segments from watercourses and minimizing concentration of surface runoff by installing drainage structures at sufficient intervals to disperse runoff so as to avoid gully formation and minimize erosion of the road surface and inside ditches;
Identifying and treating potential road failures (mostly fill slope failures) that deliver sediments to streams;
Watercourse crossing shall be designed to minimize the potential for crossing failure and diversion of streams. Watercourse crossings shall be sized adequately to accommodate estimated 100-year flood flow, including wood and sediment;
Inspecting and maintaining roads annually; and
Wet weather road use shall be avoided or limited to well rocked, paved, or chip sealed surfaces.

50. Appendix B of the ROWD includes the description of sediment control measures for roads from HCP section 6,3.3, which largely rely on implementation of standards identified in Weaver and Hagans Handbook By 2014, HRC storm-proofed 206 miles of the approximately 260-mile active road system in the UER and decommissioned 50 miles. Implementation of these road prescriptions are established as specific requirements in Section I.D. of this Order. Section I.D.3. of this Order requires that all of HRC's roads in the UER shall be upgraded to storm-proofed standards by October 15, 2021. The management practices described above to control of road related sediment discharge establish specific requirements deemed adequate to implement TMDL numeric targets for common road indicators.

Landslide Prevention
51. Due to the weak geologic bedrock underlying much of the watershed, relatively high rates of tectonic uplift, and high annual precipitation rates, hillslopes throughout much of the UER are naturally vulnerable to landsliding. Many of the TMDL hillslope water quality indicators and numeric targets are related to landslides and management impacts to slope stability. Natural rates of landslide related sediment production vary based on the occurrence of landscape disturbance such as large storms, fires, earthquakes or other infrequent natural events. Timber harvesting and associated

ground disturbance can result in increased rates of shallow landslides on vulnerable slopes due to decreases in root strength, increased soil moisture, altering of hillslope hydrologic process, and oversteepening or loading slopes by cut and fill road
construction.

52. Tree roots can enhance the strength of shallow soils, decreasing the risk of landslide
activation. When trees are harvested, their roots gradually decay, reducing the reinforcement they provide and increasing the potential for shallow landslides. The loss of root strength gradually increases over a period of several years, with the critical
period of maximum loss occurring approximately 5 to 15 years after harvesting. As new roots grow into the space previously occupied by the older root system, the support they provide gradually increases. Loss of root strength varies with species and intensity of harvest. Interception, evaporation, and evapotranspiration of rainfall by forest canopy can reduce the volume of precipitation that infiltrates and remains in soils. Harvesting trees can therefore increase peak flows, which can contribute to landsliding and increased erosion. Vulnerability to shallow landsliding processes varies throughout a hillslope, primarily as a function of soil depth, slope gradient, contributing drainage area, subsurface hydrology, and soil characteristics.
53. Construction of roads, skid trails, and landings can also increase landsliding. Excavations on vulnerable areas to construct roads and skid trails can undermine steep slopes. In addition, fill material placed on steep slopes on the outboard edge of roads can fail. Such failures can trigger larger failures on slopes below, often displacing large volumes of debris which can be transported considerable distances down slope.
54. The TMDL sediment source analysis found that landslide-related sediment production
increased over two-fold above natural rates during the period between 1955 and 2001, with the highest rates (almost 5 times natural landslide rates) observed during the 1988 to 1997 time period. Open-slope landslides and road-related landslides were the dominant sediment sources during this period. Landslide-related sediment production has declined in the UER during subsequent time periods, notwithstanding large storm events that occurred in 2003 and 2006. Substantial dDeclines in landsliding rates are thought to be partially-the result of the HCP mass wasting avoidance strategy, which limits or precludes operations on areas identified as high landslide hazard as well as the
ERSC WA prescriptions for landslide prevention.

55. The 2006 WWDRs included a "zero landslide-related discharge" requirement for
harvest acreage in excess of the landslide reduction model limits. In 2008, Regional
Water Board staff in collaboration with PALCO staff and other interested parties
developed a methodology for evaluating enrollment of harvest acreage in excess of the
limits based on the landslide reduction model and monitoring compliance with the zero landslide discharge requirement. Applications for this additional acreage, referred to as "Tier 2" were evaluated in a watershed context, and were subject to a far more rigorous level of geologic review than standard THPs, including consideration of geomorphology, topography, engineering geologic characteristics, management history, and hydrology.

Waste Discharge Requirements - 214
DRAFT Order No. R1+2019-0021 June 19,2019

56. In 2008, Regional Water Board staff developed Monitoring and Reporting Program
(MRP) R1-2008-0071 in collaboration with PALCO and other interested parties to
establish a process to ensure compliance with Tier 2 zero discharge requirements. The
MRP specifies clear guidelines for application, review, and enrollment of THPs under: Tier 2. The MRP also requires that following harvest all Tier 2 units be inspected at a minimum two times per year to identify new landslides or enlargement of existing landslides. HRC submits annual Tier 2 monitoring reports to the Regional Water Board. To date, no sediment discharge from harvest related landslides in units enrolled under Tier 2 has been reported. The current inventory of landslides based on interpretation of aerial photographs from 2003, 2006, and 2010 is discussed in the Landslide Prevention section of this Order and provided as Appendix C of the ROWD. Section IV of this Order requires HRC to maintain and update the landslide inventory according to
the specifications described in the Monitoring and Reporting Program (MRP).
57. In addition to periodic air photo analysis, monitoring and reporting requirements included in Section IV of this Order rely upon annual field and helicopter fly-over inspections of harvested areas and road systems to evaluate the effectiveness of required measures to prevent landslides.
58. HRC's approach for evaluating landslide hazards includes ERSC WA prescriptions. As part of THP planning, a review of pertinent technical data is conducted to denote potential high risk slopes, including landslide inventories, regional geomorphic maps, stereoscopic aerial photographs, and a shallow landslide potential map developed using
the SHALSTAB landslide model. Appendix D of the ROWD (HCP section 6.3.3.7, ERSC
WA) includes the following prescriptions for hillslope management mass wasting
strategy:
A hillslope management checklist is used to identify areas that are particularly
vulnerable to mass wasting;
No harvesting or road construction or reconstruction on Class I inner gorges;
No harvesting or road construction or reconstruction on the following areas
without characterization and development of measures to protect water quality prescribed by a California Professional Geologist (PG);
o Inner gorges adjacent to class II or III watercourses; o Headwall swales;
O Other areas with very high mass wasting hazard (including slopes
greater than 60%); and
• Earthworks (skid trails, landings, road prisms, or other earthen structures) exhibiting characteristics identified in the hillslope management checklist.
59. In addition to the hillslope management mass wasting strategy described above, a comprehensive approach to preventing increases in landslide related sediment discharge resulting from timber harvesting and associated activities includes characterization of landslide hazards, designing projects to minimize impacts to slope

stability based on site specific hazards, and ongoing monitoring of landslide activity to better understand landslide patterns and modify management practices based on observed activity. The California Geological Survey Note 45 provides guidelines for Engineering Geologic Reports for Timber Harvesting Plans7, which must be prepared by a PG who is familiar with watershed characteristics. Section I.E. of this Order
establishes requirements for characterization of geologic hazards by a PG and development of site-specific mitigations. Characterization of landslide hazard should at a minimum consider the following information:
Existing hazard maps derived from slope stability models;
Available maps and reports;
Aerial photographs;
Field investigation and mapping; and Applicable studies and technical models.

60. The Engineering Geologic report must include an evaluation of potential effects on slope stability, surface soil erosion, and landslide related sediment discharge from the proposed management activity, identify problem areas, and describe specific mitigation
measures needed to minimize potential effects for identified areas of concern. The
mitigations should be based on the potential hazard process (likelihood of landslide initiation or acceleration in sediment mobilization or water flow, and the potential risk
to water quality or public safety). Where appropriate, mitigations shall include, but are
not necessarily limited to, the following:
• Limit canopy removal in areas with elevated landslide hazard;
• Limit activities upslope of existing landslide and on vulnerable portions of deep-
seated landslides;
Avoid road or skid trail construction on steep or vulnerable slopes; and
Stabilize existing landslides where applicable by methods such as planting,
drainage manipulation, buttressing, and other feasible engineering techniques.
61. This Order establishes enforceable provisions to prevent increases in sediment
discharge from landslides associated with HRC's timber harvest activities and meet
TMDL numeric targets related to landslides and slope stability. The provisions entail an
overall strategy that includes HRC's hillslope management mass wasting strategy from the ERSC WA, as well as additional measures included in their ROWD and those deemed
necessary by Regional Water Board to prevent management-related landsliding. These
are summarized below. as follows:
Harvest rates throughout HRC's ownership in the UER that must be less than those allowed under the limits set by the landslide reduction model under
the2006 WWDRs;
• Use of partial harvesting methods that retain a significant component of post-
harvest root strength;

• Review by a PG of all proposed activities, including harvesting and construction
or reconstruction of roads and watercourse crossings.

Wet Weather Requirements
62. Conducting timber operations during wet weather increases the potential for sediment production and discharge from roads, landing, and skid trails. Use of trucks and heavy equipment during saturated soil conditions can result in soil compaction, create ruts
which affect road drainage, and increase production of fine sediment. Typically, the
most effective way to prevent impacts from operations during saturated soil conditions
is to avoid operations during the period of the year when rain is likely to occur. This allows for timely implementation of seasonal erosion control, and the completion and stabilization of construction and reconstruction of roads, landings, skid trails and watercourse crossings. In the North Coast, over 90% of average annual precipitation falls between October 1 and May 1.

In order to minimize the impacts of conducting timber operations during wet weather and implement the TMDL numeric target of decreasing road surface erosion, section I.F of the Order establishes the following seasonal restrictions:
a. From October 15 to May 18, hauling shall be limited to permanent rocked all- season roads that meet the HCP storm-proofed standard and shall cease for a
period of 48 hours following any precipitation event that produces 0.25 inches
of rainfall within any 24-hour period.

b. Road construction or reconstruction may not take place from October 15 tr
May 1 except in response to failure of a road segment or watercourse crossing
resulting in ongoing or imminent sediment discharge.

From October 15 to May 1, ground-based yarding and site preparation are
prohibited. During this period, timber falling and cable yarding are permitted.

Limited Harvesting in High Risk Areas
63. Regional Water Board staff evaluated the relative risk of sediment production and
discharge in each subwatershed in the UER based on probabilistic landslide hazard,
bedrock geology, and observed sediment production from 2000-2011. This evaluation
was used to establish a ranking of relative risk to water quality of low, moderate, or high for each subwatershed. Similarly, section 5.4 of the ROWD identifies five
subwatersheds predominantly underlain by the Hookton Formation, a geologically young sandstone/siltstone bedrock unit that is highly vulnerable to surface erosion and mass wasting. These areas closely correlate with Regional Wäter Board assessment which includes Clapp, Tom, and Railroad Gulches, McCloud Creek, Mainstem Elk River, and the Lower South Fork Elk River, Sediment production from these subwatersheds, which are also located directly above and adjacent to the impacted reach of the South
Fork Elk River, is among the highest observed throughout the UER. Further refinement
of the relative risk ranking based on subwatershed sediment production, landslide hazard, and observations by field staff of areas dominated by the Hookton Formation, have resulted in identification of areas within portions of the six- subwatersheds identified above that are appropriately considered as high water quality risk for the purposes of this Order. The relative risk rating informs specific protection measures applicable in high risk areas, including limiting timber harvest activities.
In order to make progress toward attaining beneficial uses by further reducing sediment discharge from timber harvesting and associated activities, prevent nuisance conditions, and to meet the Regional Water Board-adopted zero load allocation for the UER watershed, while fully recognizing that halting all timber harvest activity in the
UER watershed is not necessarily feasible or helpful in promoting HRC's participätion in cleanup and restoration efforts, for the five year period following adoption of this Order
timber harvesting in the high risk areas is limited to units of THP 1-12-110 HUM, which
was approved by CAL FIRE on April 26, 2013 prior to the completion of the Upper Elk River TMDL and supporting Technical Reporti0. Following this five-year period, as outlined below, the Board may modify the harvest limitations of this Order.

harvest limitations in the high-risk areas. In providing the update, the Regional Water Board staff shall consider monitoring data and other relevant information to assess
whether water quality conditions in the impacted reach are improving and beneficial uses will be supported within a reasonable period of time. Staff will provide the update at a scheduled Board meeting, after providing notice and an opportunity for HRC and interested persons to comment. At the meeting, the Board will consider whether to reopen the Order, or continue the existing limited harvest provisions as outlined in I.A.4 of this Order. If the Board determines to reopen the Order to modify the limited harvest
conditions based on staff recommendations, comments, and evidence received, it will
provide further direction to staff on the conditions under which harvesting in the high risk areas may proceed. After a minimum 30-day public review and comment period,
the Board will consider a modified Order in a public hearing that addresses the limited
harvest provisions in high risk areas4.

65. Support for beneficial uses may result, but is not limited to, projects that focus on:
Flood flow routing improvement (e.g. replace earthen approaches to bridges with culverts and riparian plantation thinning) to reduce the current
flooding frequency in the impacted reach;
Reduction of the volume of stored sediment (e.g. slowing, trapping,
removing of accumulated sediment) in the impact reach to a level which reduces the current flooding frequency in the impacted reach; Water supply reliability (e,g. implement alternative supplies)12, and Infrastructure enhancement (e.g. roads, bridges, septic systems, houses) to alleviate impacts from flooding.

Inventory and Treatment of Controllable Sediment Discharge Sources
66. Timber harvesting and associated road construction and use have left disturbed areas
throughout the landscape that have the potential to discharge sediment over extended periods of time. These legacy sites, which should be treated as CSDS, may include failing or failed watercourse crossings, road failures, road surfaces, landslides, unstable
watercourse banks, soil stockpiles, skid trails, landings, exposed harvest units, or any
other site discharging or threatening to discharge waste or earthen materials.
67. The identification, evaluation, and treatment of CSDS are important components of a strategy to prevent or minimize ongoing sediment discharge in order to support
beneficial uses in the watershed, prevent nuisance conditions, and to also contribute
towards achieving Regional Water Board adopted sediment load allocations for HRC's

11 This Order specifically requires the Board to reconsider the limited harvest conditions of this Order within five years. It does not require modifications to the Order, and does not limit the Board's authority to reopen the
Order before or after the required five-year update if it determines changes are necessary.
12 Note: A project that provides reliable, permanent water supplies to those residents whose water supplies have been impaired by excess sediment from timber operations may ailso be considered for final resolution and

timberlands. The 2016 Order superseded the two existing CAO Nos. R1-2004-0028 and R1-2006-0055. The CAOs required off-road surveys of large tracts of land known to have experienced significant ground-based logging operations, in addition to inventories conducted during the development of individual THPs. As a result, over 12,300 acres have been surveyed since 2007 and 143 off-road CSDSs, primarily associated with skid trails, were identified. As of 2019, corrective actions had been
implemented at all inventoried sites in the North Fork Elk River. Ten CSDS remain in the South Fork Elk River, seven of which are located in the Railroad Gulch BMP Evaluation study (see Finding 86) control watershed and are scheduled for treatment upon completion of the study in 2021. The remaining three are located in current THPs and scheduled for treatment in 2019. The CAOs also addressed road-related CSDSs.
The CAOs required inventories of road related CSDS. To date, it is estimated that over
330,000 cubic yards of road related sediment has been controlled. All remaining road
related CSDS are scheduled to be treated by the end of 2021. Sites in the Railroad Gulch control watershed will not be treated until after completion of the study (see Finding 85) in 2021. Attachment C of this Order includes a master treatment schedule that
identifies the remaining potential sources to be treated. HRC will continue to treat
these sites annually according to the prioritization described in the master treatment schedule in Attachment C, as well as concurrently with timber operations for those sites located in the vicinity of THPs. In order to demonstrate continued progress in treating remaining sites, monitoring and reporting requirements in Section IV of this Order require that HRC provide annual reports identifying sites to be treated each year.
Submittal of monthly status reports will no longer be required. Order Section 1.D.4. requires treatment of the remaining CSDSs, lentified in Attachment Ç by October:15, 2021.

68. New active or potential sediment sources are identified through implementation of an
Annual Road Inspection Program (ARIP). This program requires that all accessible roads be inspected for maintenance needs at least once annually. CSDS identified by ARIP, storm-triggered inspections, and active THP inspections are typically scheduled and treated within one year of discovery during the drier months of the year (May- November) and will be included in annual reports pursuant to Section IV of this Order. Order Section I.D.5. requires that HRC address these new CSDS as they are identified and subsequently treated in accordance with the ARIP. Additional non-scheduled routine minor maintenance (i.e. shaping of road surface, cleaning of inboard ditches and culvert inlets, maintenance of energy dissipation/downspouts, and roadside brush maintenance) will also occur as needed in response to road inspection and results in directives by HRC management or Regional Water Board.
69. CSDS not previously identified are also addressed by preparation and submittal of Erosion Control Plans (ECPs) for individual THPs, ECPs must include an inventory of CSDS within the logging area of all THPs submitted by HRC. The inventory must include
a description of each CSDS and corrective actions that can reasonably be expected to
confrol sediment discharge from each source. Corrective action for each source must
be implemented during the life of the THP.

DRAFT Order No. R1-2019-0021

70. In addition, HRC must conduct annual inspection requirements of the THP project area
as outlined below, including appurtenant roads and harvest units where timber operations are or have been active. Inspections will be scheduled as follows:
Prior to October 16th - to ensure erosion control measures are in place;
Between October 16th and April 1s - Storm-triggered inspections following any storm that generates over 3 inches of rain falling in a 24-hour period; and
After April 1st - Inspection of THP areas including all appurtenant roads to
document any discharges resulting from the preceding winter period and to
schedule any required road maintenance or other corrective action.

In-channel Sediment Sources
71. As described in Finding 5, the sediment source analysis estimates that in-channel
sources such as low order channel incision, bank erosion, and streamside landslides, represent approximately 56% of the potential sediment load from UER. Due to limited access and the sensitive nature of riparian zones, controlling sediment discharge from
these in-channel sources can be difficult. Section I.H. of the Order requires that HRC conduct a Feasibility Study to evaluate potential projects or methods to control, trap, or meter sediment from in-channel sources in the UER before it can be transported to the
impacted reach.

72. The feasibility study shall identify potential projects or methods to reduce transport of sediment from tributaries in the UER to the impacted reach that may include design and implementation of small-scale pilot projects. If the pilot projects demonstrate the success of methods, HRC shall develop a plan to implement these methods on a wider
scale throughout the UER.

In-stream Restoration and Watershed Stewardship 73. In-stream restoration and enhancement work consisting primarily of large wood
placement to provide increased aquatic habitat complexity (e.g. pool development,
sediment sorting, shelter and refuge) has been implemented since the 1990s. In addition to on-property conservation, restoration, and enhancement activities, HRC is also partnering with the Regional Water Board, NGOs, and other agencies to address
chronic downstream health and safety concerns relative to water quality, domestic
water supply, winter storm flooding, and associated threats to public and private infrastructure HRC's participation includes voluntary financial and in-kind contributions to the Elk River Watershed Stewardship Program. HRC has indicated a willingness to continue development and implementation of in-stream restoration projects in the UER as well as a long-term commitment to participation in Watershed Stewardship to address beneficial use impairments in the impacted reach. The Monitoring and Reporting Plan in Section IV of the Order requires that HRC provide an
annual report to the Regional Water Board summarizing its participation in Watershed
Stewardship and other restoration efforts.

74. The purpose of the Watershed Stewardship Program is to convene a participatory
program that engages community members, residents, scientists, land managers, and
regulatory agencies in developing a collaborative planning process that seeks to enhance conditions in the Elk River watershed. The Watershed Stewardship Program will include the entire Elk River Watershed, and will work to accomplish the following
goals:
Promote shared understanding and seek agreements among diverse participants; and
Identify strategies and solutions to:
0 Improve the hydrologic, water quality, and habitat functions of Elk River;
0 Reduce nuisance flooding and improve transportation routes during high water conditions;
•0 Improve residential and agricultural water supplies; and
ó Promote coordinated monitoring and adaptive management.
75. The Watershed Stewardship Program also endeavors to incorporate and advance the findings of the Elk River Recovery Assessment (ERRA): Recovery Framework through the
Stewardship Program. The Recovery Assessment utilized a hydrodynamic and
sediment transport (HST) model to develop a suite of actions to recover beneficial uses in the Elk River. The ERRA HST model incorporates a larger geographic scope within the watershed than was considered in the TMDL., For example, management actions below the impacted reach are included in the model scenarios. The model highlights the necessity and efficacy of employing multiple types of management actions at
multiple locations to restore the Elk River's reduced assimilative capacity. The ERRA
findings suggest that to restore lost hydrologic function, increase supporting fish
habitat, and improve water quality conditions will require both stream remediation
(e.g, sediment removal, channel shaping, and riparian management) as well as
sediment source reduction from the upper watershed.

One of the scenarios modeled by the ERRA HST model evaluated a 30% reduction in suspended sediment entering the impacted reach. The model findings did not show that a 30% property-wide reduction alone would sufficiently improve conditions downstream to support beneficial uses or achiève TMDL allocations. The ERRA recommended pursuing opportunities to reduce sediment loading from the UER at
levels well above 30% to achieve meaningful benefits, This could be accomplished with a single project, or suite of projects in sub-basins known to produce high rates of suspended sediment, such às Tom Gulch. The ERRA HST model scenarios indicate five classes of actions needed to restore beneficial uses and reduce nuisance flooding; sediment reduction from the upper basin; mechanical channel rehabilitation; retention
and improvement of floodplain connectivity; infrastructure improvements; and estuary enhancements. The ERRA HST model provides technical support for the EIk River Watershed Stewardship Program to identify strategies and solutions to achieve TMDL
goals.

76. In addition to the work discussed in Finding 74, HRC may conduct various types of
restoration projects intended to improve fish habitat and control sediment delivery
from in-channel and near-stream sources. Restoration covered under the Order would
include projects such as:
Large wood augmentation for the purposes of improving fish habitat and sediment
routing Methods could include falling riparian zone trees or placement of logs
using heavy equipment;
Construction of off-channel sediment detention basins;
Streambank stabilization using large wood, excavation, planting, or other
bioengineering methods;
Removal or reconstruction of watercourse crossings and near-stream road
segments; and
Excavation of in-stream sediment deposits.

MONITORING AND REPORTING
77. Section IV of this Order contains monitoring and reporting requirements to achieve the following objectives:
a. Provide regular reports on all timber harvesting and associated activities covered under this Order, including harvesting, road use and construction, and
implementation of corrective action to control sediment discharge, in order to
evaluate compliance with requirements of this Order and consistency with the TMDL Action Plan;
b. Provide for a five-year summary report to evaluate the effectiveness of this
Order in contributing towards control of sediment discharge and watershed
recovery and providing an efficient mechanism to ensure water quality requirements are implemented for timber harvesting and associated activities in the UER;
c. Determine the effectiveness of management measures designed to protect water quality and inform adaptive management decisions; d. Identify potential new sources of sediment discharge and implement corrective
action in a timely manner;
e, Track HRC's participation in Watershed Stewardship efforts working towards recovery of beneficial uses in Elk River;
f. Track water quality trends; and, g. Help inform re-evaluation of the UER's assimilative capacity for sediment and sediment load allocations.
78. HRC conducts various types of monitoring, including water quality monitoring, and regular inspections of all roads; inspections for landslides, including annual and
periodic aerial photographic flights; all treated sediment sources included in the master treatment schedule (Attachment C) for road and non-road CSDS; and all CSDS identified in ECPs for individual THPs following implementation of corrective action.

Waste Discharge Requirements •30*
DRAFT Order No. R1-2019-0021 June 19, 2019

Inspections and Inspection Reports 79. HRC conducts inspections of: 1) all harvest areas during the period a THP is active and throughout the three-year erosion control maintenance period following completion of operations, 2) all treated CSDS, and 3) all roads on their ownership in the UER,
Regular inspection by HRC of those areas and activities described above are essential in ensuring the management practices designed to control sediment have been adequately implemented and are functioning properly, to identify areas where management practices are not functioning as intended or where additional corrective action is needed to control sediment discharge, and to allow for timely implementation of
additional corrective action when needed.

Inspection reports serve to document that inspections have been conducted as required and to provide Regional Water Board staff with a mechanism to evaluate effectiveness
of management practices designed to control sediment discharge.
Water Quality Monitoring
80. Water Quality Monitoring conducted by HRC includes the following: Aquatic trends monitoring of Class I stream habitat at seven locations for
channel substrate (pebble counts), pools, large wood, riparian canopy, water temperature, fish surveys, and channel cross sections; and
Hydrology and suspended sediment trends monitoring at nine locations throughout UER for discharge, and suspended sediment concentration.
Collecting data on in-stream physical habitat characteristics and suspended sediment loads and discharge is essential for tracking watershed conditions and trends and the distribution and movement of sediment throughout the watershed. These monitoring
data can also improve understanding of the spatial and temporal association between
sediment loads and management activities such as timber harvesting, sediment control
efforts, and restoration activities.

Annual Summary Report and Work Plan
81. By January 31 of each year, HRC must submit an annual summary report and work plan
describing all activities covered under this Order conducted during the previous year
and planned for the upcoming year. Annual reports will provide specific information on
the following activities: The total harvest acreage by THP number, silviculture method, and subwatershed;
Corrective action to treat CSDS from the master treatment schedule
(Attachment C), ARIP activities, ECPs for individual THPs, and any additional
sites identified during required inspections;
Road construction, reconstruction, or decommissioning;
All inspections and water quality monitoring; In-stream Restoration and Riparian Restoration activities; and

Waste Discharge Requirements -31-
DRAFT Order No. R1-2019-0021 June 19, 2019

Participation in Watershed Stewardship efforts.
HRC must certify in the annual work plan (and Regional Water Board staff verify during the CAL FIRE THP review and implementation process, including additional field inspections as warranted) that approved THPs comply with the requirements of the WDRs. Annual reports provide a mechanism for Regional Water Board to review and comment on activities planned for the coming year, track compliance with Order
requirements and progress in sediment control and restoration, and efficiently focus
staff resources and prioritize inspection efforts.

Five-vear Synthesis Report
82. By November 15, 2021, and every five years thereafter, HRC shall submit a report
summarizing current watershed conditions and any trends observed over the previous
five-year period, including water quality, effectiveness of measures to control sediment discharge, landslide rates and distribution, watershed recovery efforts, including - Watershed Stewardship. This will allow Regional Water Board, HRC, and other stakeholders to evaluate the effectiveness of the requirements of this Order and the Regional Water Board to modify them if warranted.

83. HRC conducts additional monitoring as described below to evaluate the effectiveness of
management practices in controlling sediment discharge.

Best Management Practice Evaluation Program (BMPEP)
HRC forestry staff inspects all completed stream crossing related roadwork to ensure HCP storm-proofing standards are correctly implemented and that each work site has been properly treated for erosion control in advance of the wet weather season. In coordination with ARIP and Storm-Triggered Inspections, these newly treated sites are specifically inspected for sediment prevention and minimization performance following
the first winter. Accessible sites then continue to be monitored over time per the ARIP
and storm triggered inspection requirements.

Railroad Gulch BMP Evaluation Study
HRC has designed and is implementing a paired watershed study in the Railroad Gulch
subwatershed The objective of the study is to collect and evaluate specific sediment production, storage, and delivery data to test the effectiveness of HCP prescriptions in limiting sediment production and delivery from potential sources (roads, landslides, bank erosion, upslope stream channel head-cutting, and harvest unit surface erosion) as it relates to its management practices. The study presents ten hypotheses that are intended to test whether THP-related HCP and ERSC WA harvest prescriptions are
effective at minimizing the impact that land management has on the delivery rate of fine sediment to Railroad Gulch. The hypotheses include overall THP effectiveness relating to mass wasting, stream channel erosion, and road-related sediment delivery.

PROCEDURE
THP Enrollment and Administration
84. During the first five years following adoption of this Order, HRC must apply to the - Regional Water Board Executive Officer for coverage of individual THPs as described below. After the first five years, an enrollment process is not required to commence operations for CAL FIRE-approved THPs that fully comply with requirements of this Order; however, HRC must submit a notice of commencement of operation to the Regional Water Board at least 10 days prior to commencement of operations for a
specific. THP.

85. THPs, or portions of a THP in the UER watershed, enrolled under Orders R1-2004-0030, •R1-2006-0039, or R1-2016-0004 priör to June 19, 2019 will retain coverage under, and be subject to the terms and provisions of those Orders.

86, The Regional Water Board Executive Officer, upon finding that a THP may violate any of the terms of the Order, may at any time notify HRC that they must refrain from
commencing, or cease, operations.
87. Regional Water Board staff will continue to review and inspect all proposed THPs in the UER watershed as part of the CAL FIRE review team pursuant to the FPRs. In addition,
staff will conduct regular inspections of harvest areas, roads, riparian zones, and unstable areas to verify and evaluate compliance with the requirements of this Order
and watershed conditions.

88. Prior to June 19, 2024 before operations may commence on an approved THP, HRC must apply for enrollment of the THP under this Order by submitting an enrollment application to the Regional Water Board Executive Officer. The enrollment application must be signed by a designated representative of HRC certifying that the THP complies with the terms and provisions of this Order. Prior to enrollment, Regional Water Board staff will evaluate the THP for compliance with the Order, and at that time may require additional measures for water quality protection as warranted and as consistent with this Order. Timber harvesting activities must not commence until HRC receives written notification from the Regional Water Board Executive Officer that the THP is covered
under this Order. It is anticipated that Projects which have had thorough Regional
Water Board staff involvement in the review and approval process will receive written notification of coverage within ten (10) working days of receipt of a complete
application.

89. Water quality issues identified on any particular THP and not resolved prior to THP approval by CAL FIRE, shall be resolved to the satisfaction of Regional Water Board Executive Officer, prior to enrolling that THP under this Order.

ADDITIONAL FINDINGS
90. The Regional Water Board finds that all the combined measures required under this Order, as itemized below, are protective of water quality standards and implement

Waste Discharge Requirements - 33v
DRAFT Order No. R1-2019-0021 June 19,2019

TMDL numeric targets, hillslope indicators and load allocation within the UER watershed: the transition from even-aged to uneven-aged management under HRC's ownership; harvest rate limits throughout the UER and for each subwatershed that limit canopy reduction and anticipated peak flow changes; HCP RMZ protections; TMDL RMZ protections, High Risk Area RMZs: geologic review of all harvest activities; wet weather limitations, management practices designed to prevent or minimize sediment discharge; cleanup and remediation of existing sediment source discharge sites; ongoing oversight of HRC's management activities through participation in the THP
review process; and the monitoring and reporting program.

91. State Water Board Resolution No. 68-16 Statement of Policy with Respect to Maintaining High Quality of Waters in California (Antidegradation Policy) requires that regional water boards, in regulating the discharge of waste, to maintain high quality waters of the state, require that any discharge not unreasonably affect beneficial uses, and not result in water quality less than that described in regional water board's policies. The Policy applies whenever: a) there is high quality water, and b) an activity which produces or may produce waste or an increased volume or concentration of waste that will discharge into such high-quality water. "Existing quality of water" häs been interpreted to mean the best quality that has existed since the Policy was adopted in 1968. Thus, the Regional Water Board must determine this "baseline" water quality and compare with current water quality objectives. If the baseline water quality is equal to or less than the objectives, the water is not "high quality" and the Policy does
not apply. In this case, the water quality objectives govern the water quality that must
be maintained or achieved. (Asociación de Gente Unida por el Agua v. Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board (2012) 210 Cal. App. 4th 1255, 1270 (AGUA).)
92. If baseline water quality is better than water quality objectives, the Policy applies and baseline water quality must be "maintained" unless the Board makes the requisite findings. To permit a proposed discharge that will degrade high quality water, the Board must find that the discharge: 1) will be consistent with maximum benefit to the people of the state; 2) will not unreasonably affect present and anticipated beneficial uses of the water; and 3) will not result in water quality less than that prescribed in
water quality plans and policies. (AGUA at 1278.) In addition, the Board must ensure the discharge is utilizing the "best practicable treatment or control" to ensure pollution or nuisance will not occur and that the highest quality consistent with the maximum benefit to the people of the state will be maintained. (id.)
93. Following a century of logging, and in particular, following the post-World War II era of intensive tractor logging, water quality conditions in Elk River in 1968 were likely already impacted by sediment Further impairment occurred after 1968 as a result of excessive and poorly-regulated logging and large storm events. The capacity of the UER for sediment is limited by the ongoing aggradation in the impacted reach and resulting nuisance conditions and compromised beneficial uses. Unless and until its capacity can be expanded through sediment remediation and channel restoration, nuisance
conditions abated, and beneficial uses supported, the Regional Water Board determined

Waste Discharge Requitements DRAFT Order No. R1-2019-0021 June 19, 2019

that the nonpoint source load allocation be defined as zero. Even with the implementation of current and much improved management practices and stringent restrictions described, ongoing timber harvesting and associated activities will result in some sediment discharge, further exacerbating the already impaired condition. Therefore, in addition to addressing existing, ongoing discharges, this Order addresses
water quality impacts that have already occurred.
94. This Order requires compliance with water quality objectives in receiving water in order to restore the beneficial uses, and requires compliance with water quality objectives in receiving water through implementation of stringent management
practices designed to minimize discharges including harvest rate restrictions, riparian
protection, roads management, landslide prevention, and wet weather prescriptions, limited logging activities in high risk areas, and continued efforts to inventory, prioritize and implement cleanup and remediation of existing sediment source
discharge sites. This Order authorizes discharges from certain cleanup and restoration
activities as well as from ongoing timber harvesting and associated activities. Cleanup
and restoration activities may result in small short-term discharges associated with
placement of large wood into streams or excavation to stabilize or remove fill material stored in channels and adjacent riparian zones. The potential impacts of minor short- term discharges are outweighed by the benefits of long term sediment control derived
by such projects.
To the extent that the UER had existing higher quality water in 1968, the Regional Water Board finds that the authorization of some sediment discharges from ongoing timber operations (subject to proper management and stringent restrictions) and
cleanups is necessary to accommodate important economic and social development in the area and is consistent with the maximum benefit to the people of the state. The
Regional Water Board recognizes that a significant portion of in-stream sources are likely to be mobilized and transported to the impacted reach over time, regardless of whether or not timber operations are conducted. Allowing some timber harvest activity to continue enables HRC's participation in cleanup and restoration efforts. The
Order requires control and remediation of existing sediment inputs to the extent
feasible and monitoring to determine whether implementation is leading to measurable
improvements. The Order also limits logging activity in the most sensitive areas to allow active measures to be taken by the Watershed Stewardship Program to improve downstream beneficial uses. The Order ensures that any new discharges are subject to
the best practicable treatment or control.

95. Compliance with the terms of this Order will further the TMDL Action Plan goals of minimizing and eliminating sediment discharges from HRCs timber operations in the
UER watershed. The monitoring and reporting program in Section IV of this Order is designed to provide a feedback mechanism to ensure that management measures are implemented and functioning as intended and provide data on in-stream sediment conditions. The Order provides for ongoing assessment of the effectiveness of management measures and progress in meeting TMDL load allocations.

Waste Discharge Requirements - 35-
DRAFT Order No. R1-2019-0021 June 19, 2019

96. To the extent that the Antidegradation Policy applies, the Order is consistent with the Policy because: 1) compliance with the Order will result in a net improvement over existing conditions and any degradation authorized by prior Orders; 2) implementation of management measures required by this Order constitute BPTC to control discharges from timber operations; and 3) the Regional Water Board finds the authorization of
some discharges is to the maximum benefit of the people of the state.
97. The Örder is consistent with the Policy for Implementation and Enforcement of the
Non-Point Source Pollution Control Program (Non-Point Source Policy).
Implementation of the Order will promote attainment of Water Quality Objectives and TMDL Action Plan requirements, The Order incorporates antidegradation requirements as described in Findings 93-98; describes management practices and
performance standards to be met; requires annual monitoring and reporting, and
cumulative reports to provide a feedback mechanism to the Regional Water Board on the effectiveness of the management practices; sets clear milestones for meeting
objectives; and states the consequences for failure to meet Order requirements, which
may include: modification of Order requirements to require additional management measures and mitigations, rescission of coverage for individual THPs and /or denial of
THP enrollment; and enforcement action for failure to comply with Order conditions
including reporting requirements.
98. As lead agency under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), the Regional Water Board provided notice of intent to adopt a subsequent mitigated negative declaration (SCH No. XXXXXXXXX) for this Order on March 14, 2019 (Cal. Code Regs, tit. .14, § 15162).13 The mitigated negative declaration reflects the Regional Water Board's
independent judgment and analysis. The Regional Water Board hereby determines that
the proposed project, with incorporated project design features and mitigation measures, will not have a significant effect on the environment. The documents and other material, which constitute the record, are located at 5550 Skylane Blvd, Suite A, Santa Rosa, CA 95403, The Regional Water Board will file a Notice of Determination within five days from the issuance of this Order. Mitigation measures necessary to reduce or eliminate significant impacts on the environment, and monitoring and reporting are incorporated as conditions of approval below.
99. The Regional Water Board has reviewed the contents of this Order, its accompanying Initial Study and Subsequent Mitigated Negative Declaration, written public comments and testimony provided after notice and hearing. The Order prescribes requirements that implement the Basin Plan, in consideration of relevant factors pursuant to water

id The draft Order and associated Initial Study and Subsequent Mitigated Negative Declaration developed pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) to analyze potential impacts from the proposed Order were originally released for public comment on December 4, 2015. Revisions to this Order do not alter the priginal analysis and conclusions that all project design features and mitigation measures will reduce
potential environmental impacts to a less than significant level.

code section 13263. This Order establishes requirements to implement the Basin Plan, prevent nuisance conditions, and attain beneficial uses in the watershed. The Order
supports the Regional Water Board adopted sediment load allocation for the UER
watershed, while still permitting discharges from timberland management, including
harvesting. This Order is a component of the Regional Water Board's overall strategy to restore ecosystem functions, abate nuisance flood conditions, attain ambient water quality objectives and recover beneficial uses. In-stream remediation and channel restoration is anticipated as a means of recovering the ecosystem functions of the impacted reaches of Elk River, in combination with reduction in sediment loads from
the upper watershed.

After the first five years, HRC must submit a notice of commencement of operation
to the Regional Water Board at least 10 days prior to commencement of operations
for a specific THP.
The Regional Water Board Executive Officer, upon finding that a plan may violate any of the terms of the Order, may at any time notify HRC that they must refrain from commencing, or cease, operations.

# VI. RESCISSION AND DENIAL OF COVERAGE
The Executive Officer may rescind or deny coverage for a THP under this Order if the Executive Officer makes any of the following determinations;
1. The THP does not comply with Terms and Provisions of this Order;
2. The THP is reasonably likely to result in or has resulted in a violation or exceedance
of any applicable Water Quality Standards, US EPA approved load allocation, or
other water quality requirement15,

45 "Water Quality Requirements" means a water quality objective (narrative or numeric), prohibition TMDL implementation plan, policy, or other requirement contained in a Water Quality Control Plan (Basin Plan) adopted by the Regional Water Board and approved by the State Water Board, and all other applicable pians or Ifootnote continued on next page)

3.  The THP has varied in whole or in any part from the approved THP in any way that could adversely affect water quality;
The THP is the subject of an unresolved water quality or procedural issue including, but not limited to, a non-concurrence filed by the Regional Water Board staff with CAL FIRE;

5. The THP meets the Terms and Provisions of this Order, but may still result in a discharge of waste that could adversely affect water quality from any of the following:
a. An observable increase in sediment discharge from landslides, channel or
streambank erosion, or surface or gully erosion associated with harvest
activities;
b. À measurable and significant increase in turbidity or suspended sediment
concentration as a result of harvest related activities;

6. Any operations on an individual, or multiple, THP(s) that would result in an average annual harvest rate in any subwatershed above 2% equivalent clearcut acres over any 10-year period that has resulted, or would be likely to result in any of the
following:
a: An observable increase in sediment discharge from landslides, channel or
streambank erosion, or surface or gully erosion associated with harvest
activities;
b. A measurable and significant increase in turbidity or suspended sediment
concentration as a result of harvest related activities; or
7. There are substantive errors or inaccuracies found in information submitted as part of the THP and enrollment application package that, if known at the time of application, would have resulted in a denial or limitation of coverage under this
Order.

Upon receipt of a written notice of rescission or denial of coverage for a THP under this
Order, the coverage of the THP under this Order is immediately terminated. Upon
termination, Discharger shall immediately cease all THP activities other than activities
necessary to control further discharges. Projects that are denied coverage may be
required to submit a report of waste discharge for site-specific individual WDRs.
