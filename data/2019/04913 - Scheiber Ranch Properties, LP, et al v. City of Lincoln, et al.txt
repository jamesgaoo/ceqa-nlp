1 INTRODUCTION

2 1. Plaintiffs SCHEIBER RANCH PROPERTIES, LP and ALBERT SCHEIBER

3 (collectively, "Plaintiffs" or "Scheiber") file this petition for writ of mandate and complaint for

4 declaratory and injunctive relief ("Petition"), directed to Defendant CITY OF LINCOLN

5 ("City") and Real Party in Interest RICHLAND DEVELOPERS, INC. ("Real Party"). Plaintiffs

6 challenge the City's December 12, 2017 certification of the Environmental Impact Report

7 ("EIR") and various land use approvals for the Village 5 project, a residential and commercial

8 development on approximately 4,775 acres located outside the City's city limits, in its sphere of
9 influence ("Project").

10 2. In certifying the EIR and approving the Project, the City prejudicially abused its
11 discretion and failed to proceed in the manner required by law, including but not limited to its
12 failure to comply with the substantive and procedural mandates of the California Environmental
13 Quality Act ("CEQA"), the State CEQA Guidelines, Title 14, California Code of Regulations,
14 section 15000 et seq. ("CEQA Guidelines"), and other applicable regulations and policies.
15 3. The conclusions reached in the EIR are not supported by substantial evidence.
16 The EIR does not provide adequate analysis of, or identify adequate mitigation measures for, the

17 Project's individual and cumulative impacts, including but not limited to its impacts on
18 agricultural resources, biological resources, hydrology and water quality, water supply,
19 transportation and circulation, and human health impacts from air emissions.

20 4. The City also failed to comply with its duty to prepare, circulate and certify an

21 EIR that reflects its independent judgment.

22 5. Finally, the City's approval of the Project, including the specific plan's open space

23 land use designations that arbitrarily and capriciously expanded on Plaintiffs' property for the

24 private benefit of Real Party, deprives Plaintiffs of their substantive due process rights and also

25 unlawfully takes their property without compensation.

26 6. Because the City prejudicially abused its discretion and failed to proceed in a

27 manner required by law, Plaintiffs request that the Court direct the City to set aside its actions to

28 approve the Project and certify the EIR.

PARTIES

2 7. Plaintiff SCHEIBER RANCH PROPERTIES, LP is a California Limited

3 Partnership that owns and operates agricultural land within the boundaries of the Project.

4 Plaintiff ALBERT SCHEIBER ("Mr. Scheiber") is general partner of SCHEIBER RANCH
5 PROPERTIES, LP (collectively, "Plaintiffs"). Plaintiffs reside and engage in agricultural

6 activities on property they own within the boundaries of the Project. Plaintiffs' goal is to ensure

7 the long term viability of agriculture in Placer County and governmental compliance with

8 CEQA and other laws of the State designed to protect the public and environment. The

9 Project's unanalyzed impacts will adversely affect the Plaintiffs' existing agricultural operations
10 as well as agricultural operations surrounding the Project. Plaintiffs are within the class of

11 persons beneficially interested in and aggrieved by the acts of the City and Real Party, as alleged

12 herein. Plaintiffs have a direct and substantial beneficial interest in ensuring that the City

13 complies with the laws relating to environmental protection, particularly CEQA, and Plaintiffs

14 are affected by the City's failure to prepare adequate environmental review of the Project.

15 Plaintiffs brings this petition on behalf of all others similarly situated that are too numerous to
16 be named and brought before this court as plaintiffs.

17 8. Defendant CITY OF LINCOLN ("City" or "Defendant") is a municipal
18 corporation, organized under the laws of the state of California, and exercising local government

19 power. The City is the CEQA "lead agency" for the Project. As lead agency for the Project, the
20 City is responsible for preparation of an environmental document that describes the Project and
21 its impacts, and, if necessary evaluates mitigation measures and/or alternatives to lessen or avoid

22 any significant environmental impacts.

23 9. Plaintiffs are unaware of the true names and capacities of Defendants DOES 1

24 through 10, and sue such respondents by fictitious names. Plaintiffs are informed and believe,

25 and on the basis of such information and belief allege, that the fictitiously named respondents

26 are also responsible for the actions described in this Petition. When the true identities and

27 capacities of these respondents have been determined, Plaintiffs will amend this Petition, with

28 leave of court if necessary, to insert such identities and capacities.

10 BACKGROUND FACTS

11 The Project and Its Impacts

12 12. The Project is located within unincorporated Placer County. Placer County has

13 embraced carrying its agricultural heritage into the future, having adopted "right-to-farm"

14 ordinance providing in relevant part, "It is the declared policy of the County of Placer to
15 preserve, protect and encourage the development and improvement of its agricultural land for
16 the production of food and other agricultural products." (Placer County Code, § 5.24.040.)

17 Consistent with Placer County's agricultural heritage, the area encompassing the Project consists
18 overwhelmingly of agricultural properties.

19 13. The Project represents typical suburban sprawl development that is more
20 appropriate for the 1970s than the 21st century. Of the 4,775 acres comprising the Project site,

21 approximately 3,640 acres, or 76.2 percent, is farmland that will ultimately be eliminated for the

22 Project. More than half of this farmland, or 2,002.95 acres, is admittedly "important farmland."

23 A significant amount of this farmland operates under existing Williamson Act contracts.

24 14. These thousands of acres of prime and important farmland would be destroyed in

25 favor of constructing approximately 8, 200 residential dwelling units and 4.6 million square feet

26 of commercial space. In addition to the direct elimination of this massive amount of farmland,

27 Placer County explains that the Project "overtly plans for incompatible uses (intensive

28

SOLURI
MESERVE 4
A LAW
CORPORATION Second Amended and Supplemental Petition for Writ and Complaint

residential development and commercial agricultural production) in close proximity," which will

2 result in significant environmental impacts.

3 15. Consistent with an antiquated suburban sprawl model of development, the City

4 failed to require any meaningful transit planning with the Project. As Placer County notes, "The

5 Draft EIR does not include a transit service plan for the Village 5 Specific Plan Area. A transit

6 a plan for the area is considered to be a vital element to a mobility package, in addition to

7 pedestrian, bicycle and NEV. .. Further, the Specific Plan documents are absent any mention of

8 future transit to the Specific Plan area.'
9 16. As recognized by Placer County, the Project's planning ignores transit in favor of

10 reliance on automobile circulation. The EIR correctly notes that the Project will trigger the need

11 for extensive improvements to roadway facilities throughout the area, and relies heavily as

12 mitigation on so-called "fair share" financial contributions by the Project.
13 17. Despite Placer County's repeated requests, the City refused to disclose in the EIR

14 the Project's "fair share" contributions to various roadway improvements, either in terms of an

15 estimated dollar number or even percentage of overall cost. As a result, the decision makers and

16 the public do not have adequate information available to determine whether the Project's "fair
17 share" contributions are likely to result in actual construction of the many identified
18 transportation improvements mitigating the Project's transportation impacts. The effectiveness

19 of the City's "fair share" mitigation strategy is unassessed and undisclosed.

20 18. Consistent with attempts to construct suburban development in existing rural

21 areas, water supply for the Project is speculative at best and, at worst, completely inadequate-
22 often described as "paper water" that will negatively impact existing active agricultural
23 operations relying on such water. Although the EIR claims that surface water supplies from

24 Placer County Water Agency and/or Nevada Irrigation District are more than adequate to supply
25 the Project, neither agency provided, nor can they, written confirmation that they will be able to

26 provide water necessary for buildout of the Project.

27 19. In light of the Project's questionable surface water supplies, the EIR claims that

28 water supply for the Project will purportedly consist of a combination of surface and ground

SOLURI
MESERVE 5
A LAW
CORPORATION Second Amended and Supplemental Petition for Writ and Complaint

1 water. However, the City and Real Party have made shifting and inconsistent representations

2 regarding Project water supplies throughout the City's administrative review process.

3 20. Since surface water supplies are inadequate, the Project includes as a component

4 the City's construction of six (6) new city-operated ground water wells to supply the Project in

5 addition to the City's existing five (5) wells. Thus, one critical element of the Project is to more

6 than double the City's ground water extraction wells. And yet, the EIR fails to demonstrate the

7 City's right to pump additional ground water and in fact indicates the City has no additional

8 rights to pump ground water.

9 21. In an attempt to allay reasonable concerns that additional ground water extraction

10 will negatively impact ground water supplies, the City suggested that it would limit the Project's

11 ground water use to 10 percent, without any explanation to how that arbitrary percentage relates

12 to actual physical conditions or impacts. What is more, Real Party contradicted this
13 representation, asserting publicly that the Project's ground water supply would likely be 25
14| percent. Further, the EIR suggests that the Project might need to rely on ground water for up to
15 75 of its water supply during dry years in accordance with the City's prior practice, which in the

16 past has led to over pumping of the aquifer. This express reliance on ground water to serve the
17 Project is made in the context of the City's failure to adequately document baseline ground

18 water conditions.

19 22. It is now universally acknowledged that surface and ground water are not distinct
20 but rather connected hydrologically. For example, reducing the ground water table may reduce
21 surface flows; and similarly, reducing the flow of a river or stream may reduce ground water
22 recharge. Here, the Project proposes to pave over thousands of acres of prime farmland that

23 currently enable ground water recharge and, by extension, surface flows within both Auburn and
24 Markham Ravines. The EIR conclusively asserts that storm water basins proposed as elements

25 of the Project will enable ground water recharge at the same rate as the existing thousands of
26 acres of agricultural land within the boundaries of the Project. However, no study or analysis

27 whatsoever supports this bare assertion.

28

SOLURI
MESERVE 6
A LAW
CORPORATION Second Amended and Supplemental Petition for Writ and Complaint

1 23. Through increased ground water pumping and reducing opportunity for ground

2 water recharge, the Project will result in reduced flows to both Auburn and Markham Ravines,

3 which provide habitat for both steelhead and chinook salmon. The EIR fails to adequately

4 document baseline conditions, much less analyze the Project's impact or identify all feasible

5 mitigation.

6 24. Similarly, the Project is predicted to result in construction activities within
7 streambeds within the jurisdiction of the California Department of Fish and Wildlife ("CDFW"),

8 a CEQA responsible agency for the project. In fact, the EIR's analysis of Project impacts to

9 salmon and steelhead is generally limited to construction impacts. As a CEQA responsible

10 agency with authority for issuing a streambed alteration agreement authorizing such activities,

11 the CDFW criticized the EIR's failure to document Project activities affecting streambeds,

12 aquatic and riparian habitats, stating, "The CEQA Analysis should state what, if any,
13 Department-jurisdictional features will be removed, disturbed, or otherwise altered by the

14 Project. ... The CEQA document should address direct (temporary and permanent), indirect,

15 and cumulative impacts expected to adversely affect biological resources."

16 25. CDFW also criticized the EIR's reliance on deferred mitigation for impacts to
17 biological resources. Rather than set forth specific mitigation, the EIR deferred such analysis

18 through reliance on future approvals or agreements with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the
19 U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and CDFW. The CDFW explained that this approach is circular
20 logic: "The Department cannot issue Notice of Determination based on a CEQA document,

21 which in turn relies on the Agreement for mitigation; it is circular logic."

22 26. In addition to water supply and biological impacts, the Project will result in the

23 direct elimination of approximately 3,640 acres of prime and important farmland. Yet the EIR

24 fails to meaningfully mitigate for the loss of agricultural land based on the City's legally-flawed

25 position that it has no duty to mitigate for loss of agricultural land separate from how that land

26 supports biological resources. Thus, other feasible mitigation measures for loss of agricultural

27 land, independent from biological impacts, are ignored.

- 27.

2 The City's flawed strategy for mitigating impacts is based on a "working draft"

3 habitat conservation plan, the Placer County Conservation Plan (*PCCP"), that is unapproved,
and indeed has not even been released for public review.

4 28.

5 CDFW sharply criticized the City's reliance on the "working draft" PCCP as the

6 extent of the City's duty to mitigate, explaining: "It is also incorrect to assume that if the PCCP

7 is adopted, the participation shall satisfy ALL mitigation requirements under CEQA."
The Project's Open Space

8 29.

0 The City's General Plan requires new development to provide 40 percent gross

10 area for open space, and further provides that the following can be used toward meeting that
requirement:

11 Public parks

12 Public and private golf courses
13

14 Natural areas to be permanently retained as open space, such as streams, floodways,
wetlands, and other water features

15 Land utilized for trails

16 Land within buffer areas

17 Land within utility corridors

18 Land utilized for natural open space

19 30. With respect to "natural areas," the City's General Plan Policy OSC-1.4 provides
20 that land within a 100-year floodplain will be designated as open space as

21 well as "all land

22 located within a minimum of 50 feet from the center channel of all perennial and intermittent

23 streams and creeks providing natural drainage, and to areas consisting of riparian habitat."
31.

24 The Specific Plan purports to satisfy the General Plan's 40 percent open space

25 requirement by providing 1,558 acres of open space for the Project's 4,775 total gross acres.
32.

26 The Project's 1,558 acres of open space is comprised of the following land use

27 designations: 838.5 acres of Open Space Preserve ("VOSP"), 208.2 acres of Natural Open

28 Space ("'VOSN"), 149.2 acres of Park, 19.5 acres of Linear Park, and 343.5 acres of Village

CORPORATION Second Amended and Supplemental Petition for Writ and Complaint

1 Open Space Ag Preserve ("VOSA"), which is an existing open space area" exclusively for the

2 existing Lincoln High School Farm property."

3 33. The Specific Plan prohibits all urban development within the VOSP designation.

4 The Specific Plan bluntly states, "Construction of buildings in VOSP and VOSN is prohibited."

5 The only allowed uses in the VOSP zone are parks, open space, trails and "resource
6 protection/restoration." The Specific Plan does not provide for any variance from this

7 prohibition.

8 34. The Specific Plan designates 101 acres of Plaintiffs' property as VOSP. Thus,
9 should urban encroachment resulting from the Specific Plan require Plaintiffs' to cease their

10 existing agricultural operations on their Property, the Specific Plan's VOSP designation will

11 prevent any development on this large portion of Plaintiffs' property.

12 35. Although the City's General Plan imposes a requirement that development

13 projects provide 40 percent open space, less than 14 percent of Real Party's 1,762 acres is
14 designated open space. By contrast, approximately 48 percent of Plaintiffs' property within the
15 Specific Plan area is designated as open space. On information and belief, other landowners in

16 the Specific Plan area have an even higher percentage of open space assigned to their properties

17 resulting from the Specific Plan's expansive VOSP designation.

18 36. The Project's VOSP and VOSN designations on Plaintiffs' property, and the
19 resulting development prohibition, extend geographically well beyond Auburn Ravine's 100-
20 year floodplain as designated in FEMA flood hazard maps.

21 37. Plaintiffs raised concern about the expansive VOSP designation on their land and

22 its impact on future development potential if encroaching urban land uses made continued
23 agricultural operations infeasible. Specifically, Plaintiffs questioned whether "[Plaintiffs']

24 property [is] being used as mitigation for future development impacts elsewhere within the

25 proposed Village 5?" The City unambiguously answered in the Project's FEIR:

26 [N]o. nothing in the Village 5 Specific Plan precludes the Scheibers from
27 developing their property in the future [but that] the proposed PCCP requires a 400-foot setback from the centerline of Auburn Ravine. The [Specific Plan] was
28 developed to comply with the PCCP. Even if the PCCP is not adopted by the County, various state and federal laws would require full preservation or

SOLURI
MESERVE 9
A LAW
CORPORATION Second Amended and Supplemental Petition for Writ and Complaint

mitigation to develop the ravine area, which would fall to the Scheibers. As such,
2 the Schieber property is not being used as mitigation for future development impacts elsewhere within the proposed Village 5 Specific Plan.

3 38. In a further response to Plaintiffs' concerns, the Specific Plan justified its

4 expansive VOSP designation on Plaintiffs' property stating that it "corresponds with the Draft

5 Placer County Conservation Plan (PCCP) ... Uses within and access into the VOSP areas are

6 restricted pursuant to the Draft PCCP or a Conservation easement."

7 39. The Specific Plan's and FEIR's characterizations of the PCCP were false.

8 However, at all times during the City's review and approval of the Specific Plan, PCCP was not

9 released for public review and so there was no way for Plaintiffs to know this.

10 Procedural History

11 40. The City released a notice of preparation ("NOP") for the Project in May of 2014.

12 The City received numerous comment letters raising concerns about the availability of water to

13 supply the Project, environmental impacts associated with water supply, impacts and mitigation

14 related to elimination of agricultural lands, compatibility issues associated with allowing urban
15 uses in close proximity to the remaining agricultural lands outside the Project area, and impacts

16 to biological resources, including wetlands and sensitive species.

17 41. The Draft Environmental Impact Report ("DEIR") was released on August 26,

18 2016, for the statutory minimum 45-day public comment period that ended on October 11, 2016.

19 CDFW identified numerous deficiencies in the DEIR's analysis and mitigation of biological
20| impacts. The Placer County Air Pollution Control District ("PCAPCD") raised concerns about

21 the DEIR's analysis and unsupported finding regarding the potential health risk impact to future

22 sensitive receptors within the Project due to emissions of toxic air contaminants, and

23 recommended mitigation measures to address the impact that the City rejected. Placer County,
24 the City Open Space Committee and California Farm Bureau Federation submitted comments
25 regarding the DEIR's failure to set forth adequate mitigation for agricultural impacts. Plaintiffs

26 also submitted public comments in these areas.

27 42. The City, its consultants, and Real Party held one or more meetings to discuss how

28 to respond to public comments on the Draft EIR. On information and belief, Real Party was a

SOLUR!
MESERVE 10
A LAW
CORPORATION Second Amended and Supplemental Petition for Writ and Complaint

decision-maker on whether to perform additional environmental review in response to requests

2 for additional study by the City of Rocklin, Placer County, CalTrans and other commenters.
3 Real Party was also a decision-maker on whether to impose additional mitigation for traffic
4 impacts and, if so, how to structure such mitigation.

5 43. On information and belief, the City and Real Party held numerous other meetings

6 regarding how to address other comments on the Draft EIR, as well as many other prior
7 meetings regarding the preparation and content of the Draft EIR. On information and belief,

8 Real Party was a decision-maker on issues including, but not limited to: whether and how to

9 analyze Project impacts, whether to identify impacts as significant, how to analyze mitigation
10 measures and project alternatives, and other substantive decisions concerning the approach to
11 the environmental review process required by CEQA.
12 44. On information and belief, neither the Draft EIR, nor Final EIR reflected the
13 City's independent judgment. The City a released a Final EIR on July 19, 2017. The Final EIR
14 failed to respond in good faith to public comments made by Placer County, CDFW, PCAPCD,
15 the City Open Space Committee, California Farm Bureau Federation and Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs
16 submitted extensive comments detailing how the Final EIR's responses to comments were

17 inadequate and, in fact, reinforced the flaws in the DEIR's analyses.
18 45. On December 12, 2017, the City Council certified the EIR and approved the
19 Project. The City filed a Notice of Determination ("NOD") on December 14, 2017.
20 46. On information and belief, the City's certification of the EIR and the Project
21 approvals did not reflect the City's independent judgment.

22 Subsequent Release of the PCCP

23 47. On June 21, 2019, more than 18 months after the City's approval of the Specific
24 Plan, the PCCP was released for public review.

25 48. The subsequently-released draft PCCP revealed that it in no way supports the
26 Specific Plan's development prohibition within the expansive VOSP area, and confirmed
27 Plaintiffs' fears.

28

SOLURI
MESERVE 11
A LAW
CORPORATION Second Amended and Supplemental Petition for Writ and Complaint

1 49. The Draft PCCP contradicts the City's representations that the expansive VOSP

2 designation "corresponds" to the PCCP. In fact, the VOSP designation goes well beyond the

3 PCCP. The VOSP designation imposes much more significant restrictions on development than

4 the PCCP. The Specific Plan prohibits all urban development within the VOSP. By contrast, no

5 development is prohibited by the PCCP. Instead, the PCCP merely imposes an impact fee-in

6 certain situations-on any such development.

7 50. The subsequent release of the Draft PCCP also revealed that the Specific Plan's

8 characterization of the PCCP is false. The Specific Plan asserts, "Uses within and access into

9 the VOSP areas are restricted pursuant to the Draft PCCP or a conservation easement." In fact,

10 the PCCP does not restrict uses is within the VOSP. This is particularly true with respect to

11 Plaintiffs' property that has been used for agricultural purposes for decades since the PCCP

12 allows development without any mitigation fee whatsoever for a project that "does not require
13 coverage under the Plan."
14 51. The subsequent release of the Draft PCCP also reveals that the Specific Plan's
15 expansive VOSP extends geographically well beyond the City's own General Plan. Neither the

16 Specific Plan nor its EIR explain the scope of the VOSP in reference to any document other than

17 the PCCP. Tellingly, neither the Specific Plan nor its EIR explain the City's General Plan
18 Policy OSC-1.4, which states that open space which provides for open space within 50 feet from

19 the centerline of perennial streams like Auburn Ravine. The VOSP, by contrast, would impose

20 an open space of 400 feet, or 800 percent of the distance mandated by the General Plan.

21 Moreover, the VOSP distance would be measured from the ordinary high water mark of Auburn

22 Ravine, and not the centerline as set forth in the City's General Plan. Thus, the Specific Plan
23 would impose as open space an area more than eight times that required by the City's General

24 Plan.

25 52. By describing its VOSP open space only in reference to a draft document that was

26 not available for public review until 18 months after Project approval, the City effectively

27 shielded this issue, and the City's misrepresentations to Plaintiffs, from public disclosure. The
28 purpose of this strategy was to conceal from the public that the City was relying on the PCCP as

SOLURI
MESERVE 12

CORPORATION Second Amended and Supplemental Petition for Writ and Complaint

1 pre-text. The real reason that the City dramatically increased the size of the VOSP was to

2 minimize the amount of open space required on lands owned or controlled by Real Party. In so
3 doing, the City and Real Party conspired to shift the burden of satisfying the City's 40 percent

4 open space requirement from the project applicant, Real Party, onto properties owned by others,

5 thereby maximizing the development density of property owned by Real Party and, by

6 extension, Real Party's revenue from property it controls.

7 53. By defining the scope of the VOSP in reference to a document that was not yet a

8 subject to public review when the Project was approved, the City and Real Party intended to

9 thwart any party from obtaining the evidence necessary to learn of the scheme to enrich Real
10 Party at the expense of other property owners within the 4,775 acre Specific Plan area.
11 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

12 54. This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this Petition pursuant to
13 Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5, and Public Resources Code sections 21167,
14 21168 and 21168.5.

15 55. Venue for this action properly lies in the Superior Court for the State of
16 California in and for the County of Placer pursuant to section 394 of the Code of Civil

17 Procedure.

18 56. This Petition is timely filed in accordance with Public Resources Code section
19 a 21167, subdivision (c). The City filed a NOD for the Project on December 14, 2017.
20 57. Plaintiffs have complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.5 in serving
21 notice of this action to the City on January 11, 2018. (Exhibit 1).

22 STANDING

23 58. Plaintiffs have standing to assert the claims alleged in this Petition because it is

24 beneficially interested in this matter, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 1086.

25 Plaintiffs live, work, and/or conduct business within unincorporated Placer County and will be
26 directly impacted by the Project. Unless the relief requested herein is granted, the environment
27 will be adversely affected and injured by the City's failure to comply with CEQA in approving
28 the Project and certifying the EIR.

2 Plaintiffs also actively participated in the administrative process conducted by the

3 City to determine the Project's environmental impacts and to ensure the City complied with

4 CEQA and all other applicable laws in processing the application for the Project.
IRREPARABLE HARM

5 60.

6 The City's failures, set forth in this Petition, constitute a prejudicial abuse of

7 discretion within the meaning of the Code of Civil Procedure and CEQA. (See Code Civ. Proc.,
§§ 1085, 1094.5; Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21168, 21168.5.)

8 61.

9 Plaintiffs have no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.

10 If the City's actions regarding the Project are effectuated, Plaintiffs and the environment will be

11 irreparably harmed. No money damages could adequately compensate for that harm.
PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL DOCTRINE

12 62.

13 Plaintiffs bring this action as a private attorney general pursuant to Code of Civil

14 Procedure section 1021.5, and any other applicable legal theory, to enforce important rights
affecting the public interest.

15 63.

16 •Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will confer a significant benefit on

17 the general public by requiring the City to carry out their duties under CEQA before approving
the Project.

18 64.

19 Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will also result in the enforcement
of important rights affecting the public interest by compelling the City to engage in a fair,
20 objective, and legally adequate analysis of the Project's environmental impacts, and to ensure
21

22 that the public has a meaningful opportunity to review and comment on these impacts and
mitigation measures for that Project.

23 REQUEST TO PREPARE ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD

24 65. Plaintiffs elect to prepare

25 the administrative record in this action pursuant to
Public Resources Code, section 21167.6, subdivision (b)(2).

1 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

2 Violations of CEQA

3 (Public Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.)

4 66. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained in

5 Paragraphs 1 through 65 as though fully set forth herein.

6 67. The City prejudicially abused its discretion in certifying the EIR. The City did not

7 proceed in the manner required by law and its decisions in approving the Project and certifying

8 the EIR are not supported by substantial evidence. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21168.5; Vineyard

9 Area Citizens for Responsible Growth v. City of Rancho Cordova (2007) 40 Cal.4th 412, 426.)

10 These legal deficiencies include, without limitation, the following:

11 The Project Description Is Vague, Incomplete, and Unstable

12 68. CEQA requires that an EIR include an accurate project description, and that the

13 nature and objective of a project be fully disclosed and fairly evaluated in an EIR. (San Joaquin
14 Raptor Rescue Center v. County of Merced (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 646, 655.) An EIR should

15 contain a "sufficient degree of analysis to provide decision-makers with information which

16 enables them to make a decision which intelligently takes account of environmental
17 consequences." (CEQA Guidelines, § 15151.)

18 69. The EIR's project description is deficient because numerous details of the

19 proposed Project are missing, inconsistent, or shifting throughout the administrative review
20 process, including, without limitation, the following:

21 a. The EIR claims that the proposed Agricultural Overlay Zone ("AG
22 Overlay") allows existing agricultural uses to continue. However, the EIR fails to

23 explain what existing uses will continue, or what constitutes a "new" agricultural use that

24 would require a discretionary use permit from the City.

25 b. The EIR fails to explain the compensatory ratio used to mitigate for the

26 elimination of agricultural land.

C.

2 The EIR provides a shifting and legally inadequate description of the

t sources of water supply for the Project and the infrastructure necessary to supply that

water.

d.

un The EIR provides inadequate description of those elements of the Project

6 requiring a streambed alteration agreement from CDFW.

7 70. The EIR Fails to Adequately Define the Project's Baseline

8 In order to determine whether project's impacts will be significant, CEQA

o requires lead agencies to compare the impact of a proposed project to the "physical

10 environmental conditions in the vicinity of the project, as they exist at the time the notice of

11 preparation is published." These conditions serve as the project's "baseline." (CEQA

12 Guidelines, § 15125.) The description of a project's baseline ensures that the public has "an

13 understanding of the significant effects of the proposed project and its alternatives." (CEQA

14 Guidelines, § 15125, subd. (a).) Accurately determining the baseline environmental conditions

15 is crucial to accurately evaluating a project's impact. (E.g., San Joaquin Raptor/Wildlife Rescue

16 Ctr. v. County of Stanislaus (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 713.)
71.

17 The EIR's description of baseline conditions is alternatively incomplete and

18 inaccurate, infecting and invalidating the entirety of the EIR's environmental analysis. These

19 flaws include, without limitation, the following:

a.

20 The EIR fails to adequately describe the City's, PCWA's and NID's water

21 rights in sufficient detail to allow a meaningful discussion of whether adequate supply

22 exists and the environmental impacts associated with supplying surface water to the
Project.

23 b.

24 The EIR fails to adequately analyze and document existing ground water

25 conditions, including how susceptible the aquifer is to overdraft. In fact, the EIR

26 misleads the public by stating that ground water is stable when authoritative sources

27 provide that ground water levels in the area have been steadily declining over the past 40

years.

2 connection between ground water in the area and Auburn and Markham Ravines.

3 d. The EIR fails to adequately analyze and document the presence of special

4 status species and associated critical habitat in the area potentially impacted by the

5 Project.

6 The EIS/EIR Fails to Adequately Analyze Significant Environmental Impacts

7 72. CEQA requires that an EIR describe the proposed project's significant

8 environmental effects. Each must be revealed and fully analyzed in the EIR. (Pub. Resources

9 Code, § 21100, subd. (b), CEQA Guidelines, § 15126.2, subd. (a).)
10 73. The EIR fails to provide decision makers with sufficient analysis in numerous
11 respects including, without limitation, the following:
12 a. The EIR fails to adequately analyze and disclose the Project's impact on
13 loss of agricultural lands and production, including both direct conversion of agricultural
14 land and indirect interference with existing agricultural operations including the
15 prohibition on agricultural spraying, conflicts with Williamson Act contracts, and
16 cumulative agricultural impacts.

17 b. The EIR fails to adequately analyze whether water supplies exist to serve
18 the Project, including how those water supplies may be reduced as a result of global
19 climate change.

20 C. The EIR fails to adequately analyze the various environmental impacts
21 associated with supplying surface and ground water for the Project.

22 d. The EIR notes the need for groundwater modeling to determine impacts on
23 the aquifer from additional groundwater pumping due to the project, but defers such
24 modeling to a future undisclosed date.

25 e. The EIR fails to adequately analyze the Project's impact on reducing
26 ground water recharge in the area.

5 The EIR fails to adequately analyze and disclose the Project's impacts on

6 transportation and circulation, including but not limited to its failure to identify the
geographic scope of analysis and the Project's impact on transit service.

7 h.

8 The EIR fails to adequately analyze the Project's operational human health
risk impacts resulting from exacerbating TAC emissions.

9 The EIS/EIR's Mitigation Measures are Legally Inadequate

10 74.

11 "An EIR shall describe feasible measures which could minimize significant

12 adverse impacts." (CEQA Guidelines, § 15126.4, subd. (a)(1).) An EIR may not defer the
formulation of mitigation measures to a future time, but mitigation measures may specify
13 performance standards that would mitigate significant effects and may be accomplished in more

14

15 than one specified way. "Impermissible deferral of mitigation measures occurs when an EIR

16 puts off analysis or orders a report without either setting standards or demonstrating how the

17 impact can be mitigated in the manner described in the EIR." (Preserve Wild Santee v. City of
Santee (2012) 210 Cal.App.4th 260, 280-281.)

18 75.

19 The EIR fails to set forth, and the City fails to adopt, all feasible mitigation

20 measures for significant impacts, including but not limited to the following:

a.

21 Project-level and cumulative loss of agricultural lands and indirect impacts
to agricultural operations.

22 b.

23 Biological impacts, due to the EIR's flawed assumption that compliance

24 with the "working draft" PCCP would satisfy all mitigation requirements under CEQA.

C.

25 Operational air quality impacts associated with exacerbating TAC-related
health risks to sensitive receptors located within the Project.

26 d.

27 Impacts associated with supplying water to the Project.

CORPORATION Second Amended and Supplemental Petition for Writ and Complaint

1 76. The EIS/EIR improperly defers analysis and formulation of mitigation measures.

2 For example:

3 a. The EIR improperly relies on an unapproved and undisclosed "working

4 draft" habitat conservation plan to mitigate for impacts to biological and agricultural

5 resources.

6 b. The EIR improperly relies on obtaining various future approvals and

7 agreements with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,

8 and CDFW to mitigate various biological impacts.
9 C. The EIR improperly relies on merely obtaining a streambed alteration

10 agreement as mitigation for Project implementation actions requiring a streambed

11 alteration agreement.

12 d. The EIR fails to adequately disclose all information necessary to assess the
13 effectiveness of the Project's reliance on "fair share" mitigation for various transportation
14 impacts.

15 e. Since the City could not obtain firm written commitments from water

16 suppliers to provide water supply for the full Project, the City is instead deferring the
17 requisite analysis and commitment of water supply to future subdivision approvals.
18 Failure to Recirculate the EIR Due to Significant New Information

19 77. CEQA requires a lead agency to recirculate an EIR whenever the addition of
20 information, after the close of public comment, would deprive the public and public agencies
21 with the a ability to comment "upon a substantial adverse environmental effect of the project or a
22 feasible way to mitigate or avoid such an effect (including a feasible project alternative) that the
23 project proponents have declined to implement." (CEQA Guidelines, § 15088.5, subd. (a);
24 Laurel Heights Improvement Ass'n v Regents of Univ. of Cal. (1993) 6 Cal.4th 1112.) Plaintiffs
25 submitted comments demonstrating that: (a) the Project's agricultural impacts were more
26 significant than disclosed in the EIR, and (b) the EIR failed to identify feasible mitigation
27 measures for admittedly significant agricultural impacts, including measures that had been

-

2 adopted by other public agencies. The City violated CEQA by not recirculating the EIR upon
receipt of this information.

3 Failure to Adequately Respond to Comments

4 78.

5 The FEIR offers conclusory statements, unsupported by specific reference to

6 explanatory information, that are insufficient to adhere to CEQA's public participation

7 requirements. (See CEQA Guidelines, § 15088, subd. (c); People v. County of Kern (1976) 62
Cal.App.3d 761.)

8 79. In particular, responses to comments including but not limited to Response A9-1,
9 A9-2, A9-3, A9-4, A9-5, A9-6, A9-7, A9-13, 11-3, 11-7, 11-11, 13-3, 13-6, 13-8, 13-9, 13-10,

12 14-14, 14-15, 14-16, 14-17, 14-18, 110-7, fail to meet CEQA standards for reasoned
consideration of public input.

13

14 Findings Not Supported By Substantial Evidence

80.

15 The City's Findings violate the requirements of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines.
For example, the Findings fail to identify the changes or alterations that are required to avoid or
16| substantially lessen the Project's significant environmental effects (CEQA Guidelines, §15091,
17

18 subd. (a)(1); the Findings are not supported by substantial evidence (CEQA Guidelines,

5 EIR Does Not Reflect the City's Independent Judgment

6 81. CEQA requires a lead agency to prepare and circulate an EIR that reflects the lead
7 agency's independent judgment, and not the judgment of the project applicant. CEQA also

8 requires the lead agency to independently review and analyze the EIR that is prepared for a
9 I project. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21082.1.) Even where an EIR is prepared by a project
10 applicant, the lead agency "is responsible for the adequacy and objectivity of the draft EIR."
11 (CEQA Guidelines, § 15084, subd. (e).)

12 82. The City failed to prepare and circulate an EIR that reflects the City's independent
13 judgment. The City allowed the Real Party to make decisions about how to prepare the EIR and
14 how to comply with CEQA, including, without limitation, whether and how to analyze Project
15 impacts, whether to identify impacts as significant, whether and how to structure mitigation for
16 significant impacts, and how to respond to public comments. On information and belief, the
17 EIR reflects the Real Party's judgment and not the City's judgment.
18 83. By failing to prepare, circulate, and certify an EIR reflecting the City's
19 independent judgment, the City failed to proceed in a manner required by law.

12 88. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained in

13 Paragraphs 1 through 87 as though fully set forth herein.
14 89. The City will physically invade upon Plaintiffs' property for the purpose of
15 constructing a fence that will exclude Plaintiffs from their own property. The Specific Plan's

16 EIR explains, "Following construction, and during project operation, permanent fencings and
17 educational signage would be installed around all open space preserves to protect sensitive areasl

18 from human or vehicular encroachment."

19 90. Even if a physical fence is not constructed, the Specific Plan's expansive VOSP
20 designation on Plaintiffs' property denying all development rights is an uncompensated

21 regulatory taking of Plaintiffs' property in violation of the Fifth Amendment.
22 91. The Specific Plan's Policy 3.4.1 provides, "Preserve and protect the Auburn

23 Ravine and Markham Ravine corridors as permanent open space and provide public access with

24 perimeter trails and crossings, where feasible." Thus, the effect of the VOSP designation, with

25 or without the permanent fencing, is to unduly burden Plaintiffs by creating a massive public

26 open space on Plaintiffs' property without compensation.

RE: Notice of Commencement of Action against the City of Lincoln

Dear Ms. Scanlon:

Please take notice, under Public Resources Code section 21167.5, that Scheiber
Ranch Properties, LP and Albert Scheiber intend to file a petition for writ of mandate
under the provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code
section 21000 et seq. ("CEQA"), against the City of Lincoln ("City") and Real Party in Interest Richland Developers, Inc. The petition challenges the City's December 12, 2017 certification of the Environmental Impact Report and various land use approvals for the
Village 5 project, a residential and commercial development on approximately 4,775
acres located outside the City's city limits, in its sphere of influence ("Project"). The
lawsuit will be based on violations of CEQA, as discussed more fully in the Project's
administrative and environmental review proceedings. The exact nature of the allegations and relief sought is described in the Petition for Writ of Mandate that Plaintiffs plan to file on January 12, 2018.
