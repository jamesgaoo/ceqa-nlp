Notice to Attorney General of Filed CEQA Petition - 1-

1 TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA:

2 A) PLEASE TAKE NOTICE, under Public Resources Code Section 21167.7, and Code of
3 Civil Procedure Section 388, that on December 9. 2019, the CALAVERAS PLANNING
A COALITION filed a petition for writ of mandate and complaint against the CALAVERAS 10 0 A COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS (Board), and the COUNTY OF CALAVERAS in

Calaveras County Superior Court. The petition alleges that the Board violated the California

8 Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) in connection with the approval of the 2019 General Plan

9 Update and related planning documents. The petition alleges that the Board violated CEQA by

10 (1) failing to adequately analyze, adopt, and implement mitigation measures, (2) failing to
11 analyze alternatives, (3) inadequately responding to public comments on the EIR, and (4) failing
12 to make proper findings of fact. The petition also alleges that the Respondents violated land use
13

14 law, by approving a general plan that is neither comprehensive nor internally inconsistent. The

15 petition also alleges that the Respondents are unlawfully withholding public record. A copy of

16 the petition is enclosed with this notice.

17

18 B) THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SHOULD ACTIVELY PARTICIPATE IN THIS CASE
19 BECAUSE AT RISK ARE THE INTEGRITY OF STATE ENVIRONMENTAL, LAND
20
USE, AND PUBLIC DISCLOSURE LAWS.
21

22 Under normal circumstances, the paragraph above would provide sufficient notice to the

23 Attorney General. In reply, a letter from the Attorney General's Office (A.G.) would ask the

24 Petitioner to inform the A.G. if and when the case goes to appellate court. That would be the end

25 of the correspondence. But, these are not normal circumstances. If justice is to prevail to protect
26 the residents and resources of California, then we must move beyond boilerplate notices and
27 form letter responses.
28

Notice to Attorney General of Filed CEQA Petition -2-

1) THE RESPONDENTS' LEGAL INTERPRETATION WOULD GUT CEQA.

2 The Respondents' justification for rejecting mitigation measures is that such measures do not
3 provide the flexibility the County desires to promote economic development and property rights.
A 0D Mitigation measures under CEQA are required to be enforceable commitments. (CEQA
Guidelines, sec. 15126.4, subd. (a)(2).) They are not excessively flexible by definition. If the
County's excuse were to prevail, then every local government and every agency could avoid
cc adopting any and all mitigation measures using the same excuse. This is inconsistent with the

9 court's repeated acknowledgment that CEQA "should be interpreted to afford the fullest possible
protection to the environment within the reasonable scope of the statutory language." 10

11 (Communities for a Better Environment v. California Resources Agency (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th
12
98, 110; citing Laurel Heights Improvement Association v. Regents of University of California 13

14 (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 390.)

15

16 2) THE RESPONDENTS' LEGAL INTERPRETATION WOULD GUT GENERAL PLAN

17 LAW.

18 The Respondents contend that they can begin the general plan process by identifying the key
19 issues that need to be addressed as required by the government code, but then indefinitely defer
20
actually following through and planning to address those issues. If a local government can defer 21

22 addressing general plan issues indefinitely, then the requirement for a local government to

23 complete a comprehensive general plan would become meaningless.

24

25 3) THE RESPONDENTS' LEGAL INTERPRETATION WOULD GUT THE PUBLIC
26 RECORDS ACT AND THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION.
27
The Respondents contend that virtually any document not finalized by the government qualifies 28

Notice to Attorney General of Filed CEQA Petition -3-

a as a draft document, and can be withheld from the public under the California Public Records

2 Act, to protect the deliberative process privilege of the agency in deciding not to finalize the
60 document. If this interpretation of the law prevails, this exception would swallow the rule that

public documents must be available to the public. Any agency or local government could hide
its most embarrassing mistakes or secrets simply by making a decision not to finalize a draft
document. This expansive interpretation of the exceptions is contrary to the California 7

8 Constitution, which calls for the narrow interpretation of exceptions to the release of public
records. (California Constitution, article I, section I, 3, subdivision (b)(1).)
10

11 C) THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SHOULD ACTIVELY PARTICIPATE IN THIS CASE
12
BECAUSE THE INTERESTS OF STATE AGENCIES ARE AT RISK.
13

14 The Petitioner was pleased that three state agencies participated in the GPU process. The Board

15 of Forestry and Fire Protection reviewed the Draft Safety Element, and made specific

16 recommendations for improvements to meet the state's interest in fire safety. The Department of

17 Conservation commented on agricultural lan'd protection through the use of conservation
18 easements, and on the importance of mandatory mitigation measures to lessen or avoid
19
otherwise significant impacts. The Department of Fish and Wildlife expressed concern for special
20

21 status species.

22 As you can see from the attached letters the Petitioner sent to those agencies, the

23 recommendations of those agencies to the County fell on deaf ears.

24

25 D) THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SHOULD ACTIVVELY PARTICIPATE IN THIS
26 CASE BECAUSE RESOURCES OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ARE AT RISK.
27

28 The Attorney General is empowered by law to guard the natural resources of the State of

Notice to Attorney General of Filed CEQA Petition -4.

- California against unlawful waste and destruction. The aforementioned efforts to gut land use

2 and environmental law would justify immediate action by the Attorney General anywhere they
3 were perpetrated in California. But, Calaveras County is not just "anywhere." Calaveras County
4
is blessed with a wealth of natural resources. It has tens of thousands of acres of productive farm
5
0 and rangelands. It has tens of thousands of acres of productive forest lands, in both public and

7 private holdings. These lands provide habitat for the State's fish and game, and for dozens of

8 special status species in need of careful management. Flowing through watersheds in Calaveras

9 County, are the mighty Mokelumne River, the vibrant Calaveras River, and the turbulent

10 Stanislaus Rivers, which provide water and power to distant farms and to urban developments in
11 the San Joaquin Valley and in the East Bay.
12

13 Rather than conserving natural resources and preserving open space lands, implementation of

14 the Calaveras County 2019 General Plan Update is expected to have significant unmitigated

15 impacts including the conversion of farmland, the destruction of oak woodlands, and the loss of

16 habitat. As noted above, this is because the County rejects measures to mitigate these impacts

17 that are routinely applied in other jurisdictions throughout California.
18

19 E) THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SHOULD ACTIVELY PARTICIPATE IN THIS CASE
20

21 BECAUSE THE LIVES OF PEOPLE IN CALAVERAS AND NEIGHBORING

22 COUNTIES DEPEND UPON IT.

23 This case is about more than the integrity of the law, more than the interests of state agencies, and

24 more than the protection of natural resources. This case is also about saving the lives of

25 Californians. Indefinitely deferring fire safety efforts, delaying emergency response funding, and
26 making fire safety measures in new development optional threatens lives. Exempting
27

28 commercial, industrial, and residential development for tourists from fire safety reviews and fire

Notice to Attorney General of Filed CEQA Petition -5-

1 safety mitigation measures threatens lives. Allowing residential development by right on parcels

2 no matter how dry, how fuel-laden, how windswept, and how isolated from emergency services
m v threatens lives. All of these threats are all part of the 2019 Calaveras County General Plan

5 Update. All of these combine to create unreasonable risks of loss of life.

6

7 It is true that there is class of people in Calaveras County who have the money and ability to

8 live and work where ever they wish. They can afford to choose to reduce and avoid the worst fire

9 risks, or to bear those risks for the sake of solitude and a view. However, most of the people in

10 Calaveras County have to take the jobs they can get, and live in the homes they can afford, where
11 ever those may be, regardless of the risks. Often these people are parents living with young
12

13 children. It is especially for the health and safety of these families that the County must establish

14 a foundation of fire safe building and zoning codes, upon which all legitimate development is

15 based. This is more than a matter of public safety, it is a matter of human decency. These people

16 depend on the County to protect them from unnecessary catastrophe in accord with land use law.

17 Calaveras County saw tens of thousands of acres burn in the Butte Fire in 2015. The State's own
18 studies indicate that a major risk of climate change in the region is an increase in wildfires. The
19 Board of Forestry and Fire Protection identified what Calaveras County needed to do address
20

21 wildfire safety, but the County chose to defer those efforts indefinitely.

22 Once a fire starts in Calaveras County, it can easily spread to neighboring counties. While it is

23 one thing for Calaveras County to impose unreasonable fire risks on its own people in a

24 misguided effort to promote local economic growth and property rights, it is far beyond the
25 jurisdiction of Calaveras County to impose that unreasonable risk on the lives of Californians in
26 neighboring counties. This exercise of misguided extra-jurisdictional power needs to be checked
27
by the Attorney General.

7 RE: The Calaveras County General Plan Update (GPU) allows County NOT to address key fire safety issues identified in the Board of Forestry's 2015 review of the draft safety

8 element - The supervisors are to adopt plan in early September.
Dear Ms. Hannigan:
My name is Tom Infusino, and I am Facilitator of the Calaveras Planning Coalition. The CPC is
10 a group of community organizations and individuals who want a healthy and sustainable future for Calaveras County. We believe that public participation is critical to a successful planning process. United behind eleven land use and development principles, we seek to balance the conservation of local agricultural, natural and historic resources, with the need to provide jobs,
housing, safety, and services.
12 1. Have the BOF's 2015 concerns been addressed to your satisfaction?
13 I am writing to you because in 2015 the Board of Forestry reviewed the Calaveras County draft
14 safety element. (Attachment BOF Review 2015.) That review identified a number of medium and high priority shortcomings in the Draft Safety Element regarding fire safety. These
15 shortcomings could have devastating effects in a County where 89% of the land is classified as having either high or very high fire risk.

16 During the Calaveras County Planning Commission hearing on the General Plan Update held in May and June of 2019, Planning Director Maurer indicated that he has been in regular contact
17 with you regarding the Safety Element. He did not indicate that you had any outstanding
concerns.

18 If in fact you do not have any lingering concerns about the Safety Element, then you may find

19 the content of this letter surprising, as we at the CPC have grave concerns. On the other hand, if you' do have lingering concerns regarding the adequacy of the Safety Element, please make them known to the Calaveras County Board of Supervisors before early September, when they are
20 scheduled to adopt the GPU.

21

22 2. The GPU has grave fire safety implications.

23 1

24

Many aspects of the General Plan Update pose a serious fire safety threat.

3 One threat is the extension of groundwater-dependent and intensive commercial and industrial development into forestlands and rangelands isolated from fire protection services. This increases the risk of ignitions in steep places with dry fuels and winds, without piped fire-flows, accessed by minimal rural roads, with lengthy response times for firefighters. Under these conditions, a wildfire could easily get out of control. As you can see from the land use designation table commercial recreation (including destination resorts) and industrial facilities will be allowed' in areas without public water. (Attachment 2 - Land Use Element, Table LU-1.) Those designations could expand beyond the lands on the current land use designation map through future general plan amendments, as there are no fire safety limitations to prevent such amendments. (Attachment 2 - Land Use Element, LUD Map, page LU11.)
A second threat is the expansion of "Agritourism." Many of these groundwater-dependent commercial uses will happen on isolated forests and ranchlands designated for Resource Production. Many of these uses are by right or ministerial permits, and therefore will not have
fire hazard impacts reduced by CEQA review and mitigation measures. (Attachment 3 -
17.16.20 Permitted Uses include Agritourism; Attachment 4 - Resource Production Element,
10 RP-1A, Attachment 5 - Agritourism Performance Standards; Attachment 6 - Agritourism Defined.) These land use designations dominate the county's high and very high wildfire risk
11 areas. (Attachment 3 - Land Use Element LUD Map, page LU11; Attachment 7 - Wildfire Risk Map.) Many of these lands are far from fire stations, where limited fire crews cover extensive
12 mountainous districts, where response times are long. (Attachment 8- Fire Stations; Attachment
9 - Fire District Maps.)
13 As you well know, when a wildfire gets out of control in these sorts of areas, it can instantly
14 wipe out families, homes, businesses, and the essential assets in major agricultural and forest operations that took generations to accrue. The 2015 Butte fire in Calaveras County is had some of those devastating characteristics. (Attachment 10 - Butte Fire Article.)
15
A third threat is the cumulative impacts of the aforementioned land uses in the context of a
16 changing climate. As the area gets less rain, water will become scarcer, and fire risk will increase. As forests type convert from conifers to oak woodlands, commercial forest lands are
17 likely to be converted more developed uses. This is especially likely along the Highway 4 corridor where TPZ land is immediately adjacent to existing communities in the very high fire
18 risk zone. (Attachment 11 - 2015 Open Space Map.) The Resource Production Element calls
for the County to amend its code to allow for the immediate rezone of lands that owners seek to remove from the TPZ. (Attachment 4 - Resource Production Element, Measure RP-3A.) 19
Of course, these fire safety challenges are in addition to the ordinary challenges associated with
20 retaining volunteer firefighting crews, maintaining reliable equipment, and keeping up with the demand for services in a County with no development impact mitigation fees for emergency
21 services, etc.

22

Given these fire safety threats, and in the wake of the 2015 Butte Fire, you would think that the
2 GPU would ensure prompt implementation of all the instructions in the BOF 2015 Safety Element review to protect the county residents, homes, and businesses. The good news is the

3 GPU's Safety Element does include policies reflecting the BOF recommendations. The bad news is that:
(a) the Implementation Measures do not commit the County to do anything to improve fire safety by any particular time, (b) there are no specified fires safety requirements on new development projects, (c) there is no recognition that some areas are too dry, windy, steep, fuel laden, and poorly accessible that they are inherently unsafe for new developments (residential, special event,
tourist lodgings, manufacturing, etc.) that will concentrate people in those areas, (d) there remains no coordinated post-fire recovery plan for the people, plants, and animals in the 2015 Butte Fire burn scar.

8 3. The GPU's Safety Element has four major flaws that will undermine achievement of the
fire safety objectives inherent in the BOF's 2015 review.

(a) The Implementation Measures do not commit the County to do anything to improve
10 fire safety by any particular time.

11 Many of the requests of the 2015 BOF review of the Safety Element were superficially incorporated into policies and implementation measures. However, the Safety Element deferred
12 adoption of the fires safety implementation measures to an unspecified time in the future. The Safety Element includes no deadlines or priorities for implementing the following fire safety
13 measures: S-3A to update the County Code to improve fire safety, S-3B to review fire district standards, S-3C to create a fire safety standards reference, S-3H to assist with fire district impact
14 fee adoption, S-31 to formulate county standards and ordinances for fire safety, S-3J to amend
the County Code to address post-fire rehabilitation, S-3K to create post-fire recovery plans, S-3N
to evaluate the fire safety of the existing affordable housing stock, S-30 updating community
15 plans to include wildfire safety, S-3Q securing funding for dead tree removal, and S-3U adopting an ordinance allowing the installation of temporary communication facilities during
16 emergencies. (Attachment 12 - Safety Element.) This is critical weakness, as the GPU includes dozens of deferred programs without priorities or implementation deadlines. The only hope of
17 getting fire safety reforms implemented is for people to convince the Supervisors that it is a priority during the Board's annual selection of general plan measures to implement. (Attachment
18 2 - Land Use Element, Tentative Annual Work Plan Measure LU-1.A.)

19 (b) Fires safety requirements for new development projects remain optional.

20 While new discretionary developments will get reviewed for fire safety as requested by the BOF, the County's application of fire safety measures to these projects remains optional.
21 Implementation measure S-3S indicates that fuel reduction plans for new developments "should" consider fuel reduction in common areas, "should" address recording fuel management
22 easements, and "should" encourage projects to become Firewise Communities. Thus, all these

23 3

24

25

26

27

28

fire safety efforts remain optional. Similarly, while measure S-3W calls for CalFire and fire districts to review proposed new developments, it only requires the County to "consider" the recommendations in those reviews. Again, the fire safety efforts for new developments remain optional. (Attachment 12 Safety Element.)
The Community Wildfire Protection Plan provides guidance not only for meeting building requircments, but also for maintaining fire safe landscapes and communities. (See pp. 34-84 of
the CWPP at http://www.calavcrasfiresafecouncil.org/CWPP.html) Clearly we know how to
construct and maintain safer communities. However, unless optional Safety Element implementation measures become required, we will continue to build less fire safe neighborhoods, in less fire safe communities. If we are going to keep local employees and residents safe, this has got to change.

(c) There is no recognition that some areas are so dry, windy, steep, fuel laden, and poorly accessible that they are inherently unsafe for new developments that will concentrate people in those areas.
The overarching land use policy in the GPU is that every legal lot in the natural resource, 10 residential, or mixed-use designations is suitable for residential development, no matter how dry, windy, steep, fuel laden, and poorly accessible. (Attachment 2 - Land Use Element, Table LU-
11 1.) In addition, the GPU applies land use designation, policies, and implementation measures for residential, commercial, and industrial development across the entire land use map of the
12 County, regardless of the unsafe fire conditions on the landscape. (Attachment 2 - Land Use Element, LUD Map, page LU11; Attachment 7 - Wildfire Risk Map.) This error is compounded,
13 as future zoning is required to be consistent with these land use designations, again regardless of the unsafe fire conditions on the landscape. Development proposals can be approved and built if

14 they are consistent with these inherently unsafe general plan land use designations and zoning categories. In these areas, CEQA's fire safety impact mitigations measures are considered "infeasible," because they would make development too expensive. If we are going to keep local
15 residents and employees safe, this has got to change.

16 It is true that there is a class of people in Calaveras County who have the money and ability to live and work where ever they wish. They can choose to avoid fire risks. However, the majority
17 of the people in Calaveras County have to take the jobs they can get, and live in the homes they can afford. where ever those may be. Where these parents live, their young children live with
18 them. It is for the health and safety of these people that the County must establish a foundation of fire safe building and zoning codes, upon which all legitimate development is based. This is

19 more than a matter of public safety, it is a matter of human decency. These people depend on the County to protect them from unnecessary incineration. Please help us to convince the Board of
Supervisors that providing for the safety of the people of Calaveras County is not a burden they
20 should unload, but an honor they should embrace.

(d) There remains no coordinated post-fire recovery plan for the people, plants, and
2 animals in the 2015 Butte Fire burn scar.

Section 8 of the BOF review calls for burn area recovery plans, the use of stat-of-the-art fire safe building techniques in redevelopment, and the restoration of wildlife habitat.
Nearly four years have passed since the Butte Fire burned through Calaveras County. A lot has been done. Emergency erosion control, hazardous material clean-up, and hazard tree removal have been done. PG&E has paid settlement funds, and road reconstruction efforts are under way.
A new CWPP is in place identifying fire safety projects for future funding. However, these
efforts continue to be independent, un-coordinated, and haphazard. There remains no post-fire recovery plan for the people, plants, and animals that reside in the burn scar. Opportunities are being missed to underground utilities, to build more fire safe buildings, to restore critical habitat, and to reconfigure transportation dead-ends and bottlenecks.
Today, nearly four years later, many families that remain in the burn scar are still living in substandard conditions as they wait to rebuild their homes. Meanwhile, the brush returns among the down logs and limbs across the dry and unshaded landscape. Residents fear the next round
of fire will come soon.
10
4. Please convey your concerns to the Board of Supervisors.
11 The Board of Forestry has been given the responsibility to review and comment on updates to
12 safety elements. (Government Code, Section 65302.5.) You have completed your obligation by
reviewing the Draft Safety Element in 2015. We at the CPC thank you for your effort.
13 We realize that you are busy, and under no obligation to take any further action on behalf of the
14 45,000 people who reside in Calaveras County. However, 80% of Calaveras County is in a State
Responsibility Area. Thus, the County's fire safety failures today are likely to cost the State of California a great deal in firefighting costs in the future. So, we humbly request that you
15 communicate any lingering fire safety concerns of the BOF to the Calaveras County Board of Supervisors before they approve the GPU in early September. We have done all we can. They
16 do not listen to us. They listened to you. Please comment as if somebody's life depends upon it; because somebody's life does.

RE: Calaveras County General Plan Update was altered by Planning Commission and
Supervisor's review contrary to your recommendations, and needs your expert review and
10 recommendations by early September.
Dear Ms. Wilber:
l1 My name is Tom Infusino, and I am Facilitator of the Calaveras Planning Coalition. The CPC is
12 a group of community organizations and individuals who want a healthy and sustainable future for Calaveras County. We believe that public participation is critical to successful planning

13 process. United behind eleven land use and development principles, we seek to balance the conservation of local agricultural, natural and historic resources, with the need to provide jobs, housing, safety, and services.
14 I. The GPU's Potential Impacts to Farm, Forests, and Rangeland are Significant.
15 I am writing to you because on August 9, 2018 you commented on the Calaveras County General
16 Plan Update DEIR. (Attachment 1- DOC Letter.) As you know, the General Plan Update will affect the use of private land throughout the County for decades, including hundreds of
17 thousands of acres of farmland, forests and rangelands.

Many aspects of the General Plan Update pose: threat to the long-term productivity of farms,
18 forests and rangelands.

19 Of course, the agricultural and forest lands adjacent to community centers are most likely to be converted as water and sewer are extended to them. (See Attachment 2 - Map of Ag. Land
20 adjacent to community centers, Attachment 3 - Water & Sewer Service Areas.) In fact, the
General Plan Update supports development of agricultural lands around community centers
21 when infrastructure and services are extended to them. (Attachment 4, Land Use Element, Policy
LU 1.2. & LU 1.4)
22

23 1

24

25

26

27

1 In addition, the extension of intensive groundwater dependent residential and commercial
N m development into rangelands could dry up the only economical source of water for local ranches. (Attachment 4, Land Use Element, Table LU-1 - shows groundwater-dependent development in rural areas, Attachment 5 - Well Yield and Water Availability Map; Attachment 4 - LUD Map, page LU11.) In addition, with the expansion of "Agritourism", many of these groundwater- dependent commercial uses will happen on forests, farms, and ranches by right or ministerial permits, and therefore will not have impacts reduced by CEQA mitigation measures. (Attachment 7 - 17.16.20 Permitted Uses include Agritourism; Attachment 6 -- Resource Production Element, RP-1A, Attachment 8 -- Agritourism Performance Standards; Attachment 9
-- Agritourism Defined.)

N Third, the location of these residential and commercial uses in isolated and fire prone areas adjacent to agricultural and forest operations dramatically increases the risk of a wildfire. (Attachment 10 - Wildfire Risk Map) Such a fire can instantly wipe out the essential assets in
8 major agricultural and forest operations that it took generations to accrue. The 2015 Butte fire in
Calaveras County is a good example of such devastation. (Attachment 11 - Butte Fire Article.)

Fourth, while these adverse effects would be bad enough on their own, they are likely to be worse due to the cumulative impacts of climate change. As the area gets less rain, water will
10 become scarcer, and fire risk will increase. As forests type convert from conifers to oak woodlands, commercial forest lands are likely to be converted to other uses. This is especially
11 likely along the Highway 4 corridor where TPZ land is immediately adjacent to existing
communities.
12 Of course, these adverse effects on agriculture are in addition to the other challenges that will
13 make it difficult to sustain operations in the future: trade wars, foreign competition, lack of a viable business succession plan, energy and transportation costs, and local hostility to conservation easements. It is not surprising that data in the General Plan Background Report 14 indicates that over 189,000 acres of rangeland and over 32,000 acres of farmland went out of production in Calaveras County between 2000 and 2014.• (Attachment 12 - Table 12 Ag. Land
15 Loss 2000-2014.)

16 Given these threats to agriculture, you would think that the County would place high priority
on following your advice to preserve a sustainable agricultural land base in the General Plan
17 Update. Unfortunately, you would be wrong to think that.

18 IL. Your letter asked the County to do four things.
Regarding the potential for conversion of agricultural land, you specifically asked the County to 19 do four things:

20 "All mitigation measures that are potentially feasible should be considered. A measure brought to the attention of the Lead Agency should not be left out unless it is infeasible based on its
21 elements. The Department suggests that the County consider the adoption of an agricultural land
mitigation program that will effectively mitigate the conversion of agricultural land."
22

L

2 "Mitigation via agricultural conservation easements can be implemented by at least two
alternative approaches: the outright purchase of easements of the donation of mitigation fees to a

wu local, regional, or statewide organization of agency whose purpose includes the acquisition and stewardship of agricultural conservation easements."

You encouraged the County to use the model mitigation policies in the California Council of
Land Trusts' guidebook.

You asked the County to provide you with notices of hearings and staff reports. (Attachment 1 -
DOC Letter.)

III. The Draft FEIR included the conservation program changes you suggested.

0 After your comment, County staff proposed changes to the General Plan Update in the Draft Final EIR, in compliance with the suggestions in your DEIR comment. It included an interim agricultural land conservation program with specific mitigation standards to be implemented immediately upon adoption of the GPU. This would be followed by drafting, approval, and adoption of a long-term program. (Attachment 13 - New Policy in Response to DOC Comment.)

10 IV. The Planning Commission gutted the program, and the Supervisors let them.

11 In June of 2019, the Planning Commission eliminated the interim conservation program that

12 would have required the acquisition of conservation casements at specified mitigation ratios.

13 Also, the Planning Commission deferred adoption of the long-term conservation program to an unspecified time in the future, without explaining why deferral was needed. This is critical, as

14 the GPU includes dozens of deferred programs without priorities or implementation deadlines. The only hope of getting an agricultural land conservation program is for people to convince the Supervisors that it is a priority during the Board's annual selection of general plan measures to

15 implement. (Attachment 14 - Tentative Mitigation Policy RP-1F, Attachment 15 - Tentative
Annual Work Plan Measure LU-1.A.)

16 Finally, the Planning Commission allowed in-lieu fees to be spent on rangeland improvement

17 projects that are not linked to long-term land conservation. It is not clear that there is a sufficient nexus to charge an ag. land conversion fee and spend it on rangeland enhancement projects.

18 In July, the Supervisors did not vote to cure the harm done by the Planning Commission.

19 Did the County provided you with notice of the Planning Commission's May and June GPU

20 hearings, or the Board of Supervisor's July GPU hearing, and the corresponding staff reports, As you requested in your DEIR comment letter?

21 V. There are missing pieces in the agricultural conservation part of the GPU.

22 Because the impacts of the GPU on farm, range, and forests lands are likely to be so significant, and because the impact mitigation program has been gutted, it is even more problematic that

23 3

24

25

26

27

28

there are essential pieces missing from the Resource Production Element, and the Open Space &
N c Conservation Element.

Government Code, Section 65565 identifies the required contents of a general plan that contains a section on agricultural land conservation. If there is an agricultural land element, it must identify priority lands for conservation, establish policies and objectives to support the long-term protection of agricultural land, and establish implementation measures to achieve the policies and objectives. (Government Code, sec. 65565, subds. (a)(1)(K), (a)(2), (a)(3).) While the soil mapping data was not timely made available to the County, there was no excuse for not providing some of the other information in the GPU.
The following information, maps, and data should be in the Resource Production Element but are
not despite the availability of the data:
-parcels subject to conservation easements, (Attachments 16-19.)
-the total acreage of land within two miles of land zoned for housing, business, or industry,
(Attachment 2 - Williamson AG Preserve & A1 near housing.)

10 -identification and designation of priority land for conservation. The County set no priorities.

11 -objectives for the long-term protection of agriculture. The County adopted no objectives. ("An objective is a specified end, condition, or state that is an intermediate step toward attaining a
12 goal. It should be achievable and, when possible, measurable and time-specific." [OPR, 2017 General Plan Guidelines, p. 381.) (See Attachment 6 - Resource Production Element,
13 Attachment 20 - Conservation & Open Space Element.)

How can County decisionmakers in the future know if they have succeeded in conserving 14 enough acres of priority agricultural lands if the Resource Production Element and the Conservation and Open Space Element designate no land as a conservation priority, and adopt no
15 objectives for the long-term protection of agriculture?

16 VI. Please Review the Resource Production and Conservation/Open Space Elements.

17 The Department of Conservation has been given the responsibility to review and comment on general plan amendments that include an agricultural land conservation component. 45 days
18 prior to adoption, the city of county is supposed to send the Department the proposal. The
Department reviews it and makes recommendations. The jurisdiction considers those
recommendations prior to approval. Has the County sent you the latest draft of its proposed 19 elements since the Planning Commission completed its review on June 13, or the Board of Supervisors completed their review on July 31?
20 Given the substantive changes that weaken the Resource Production Element's ag. land
21 conservation program, and the many missing pieces of the elements relating to ag. land conservation, we hope that you will review and comment on the element prior to the BOS

c 1 y Please send a letter to the Board of Supervisors asking them to reconsider the modification of your suggestion. Ask them to comply with CEQA by adopting a proper mitigation measure. Ask them to include the missing ag. land conservation information in the Resource Production Element. If there is somebody else in your Department that does these reviews, please forward this email to them. As the citizens who hope to benefit from your agency's expertise, we would very much appreciate your expert review and recommendations.

8 RE: Calaveras County General Plan Update (GPU) was altered by Planning Commission
9 and Supervisor's review contrary to your recommendations, and needs your expert comments by early September.
10 Dear Ms. Bartlett:

11 My name is Tom Infusino, and I am Facilitator of the Calaveras Planning Coalition. The CPC is a group of community organizations and individuals who want a healthy and sustainable future
12 for Calaveras County. We believe that public participation is critical to a successful planning process. United behind eleven land use and development principles, we seek to balance the conservation of local agricultural, natural and historic resources, with the need to provide jobs, 13 housing, safety, and services.

14 1) We agree that implementation of the GPU may result in the take of listed species.

15 I am writing to you because on August 13, 2018, you commented on the Calaveras County General Plan Update DEIR. (Attachment I - CDF&W Letter.) As you know, the General Plan Update will affect the use of private land throughout the County for decades, including tens of 16 thousands of acres of forests, rangeland, and riparian habitats.

17 Many aspects of the General Plan Update, in combination with climate change, pose a threat to the long-term viability of special status species.
18 Of course, the rangelands and forest lands adjacent to community centers are most likely to be
19 converted as water and sewer are extended to them. (See Attachment 2 - Map of Ag. Land adjacent to community centers, Attachment 3 - Water & Sewer Service Areas.) In fact, the General Plan Update supports development of such lands around community centers when 20 infrastructure and services are extended to them. (Attachment 4, Land Use Element, Policy LU 1.2. & LU 1.4)
21

22

23

28

With the expansion of Agritourism, there will be additional lodges and commercial uses in

2 previously isolated habitat areas. Many of these uses will be allowed by right or administrative permit, so that no CEQA review or impact mitigation will occur. (Attachment 5 - 17.16.20 Permitted Uses include Agritourism; Attachment 6 - Conservation and Open Space Element,
3 COS #, Attachment 7 - Agritourism Performance Standards; Attachment 8 - Agritourism
Defined.)
While these adverse effects would be bad enough on their own, they are likely to be worse due to
the cumulative impacts of climate change. As the area gets less rain, water will become scarcer,
. and habitat will degrade for many species. As forests type-convert from conifers to oak woodlands, commercial forest lands, and the habitats therein, are likely to be converted to other developed uses. This is especially likely in the Stanislaus River Watershed along the Highway 4 corridor, is where TPZ land is immediately adjacent to existing communities. (Attachment Open Space Map.)
co Given these threats to sensitive species habitat, and the potential for economically harmful development injunctions under the Federal Endangered Species Act, you would think that the County would place a high priority on following your advice to preserve a suitable habitat and sustain viable populations of special status species. Unfortunately, you would be wrong to think
10 that.

11 2) Many mitigation actions are not specified and scheduled as you requested.

12 Your letter correctly requested that mitigation measures "be specific, enforceable, and feasible
actions." Your letter went on to note that, "Mitigation measures should establish performance
13 standards" and "describe when mitigation measures will be implemented, and explain why the measure is feasible." (Attachment 1, p. 3.)
14 Unfortunately, many of the mitigation measures in the Conservation and Open Space Element do
not conform to your request. (Attachment 6 - Conservation and Open Space Element.)
15 For example, Implementation Measure COS-3C indicates that the County will develop riparian
16 setback standards, but does not specify minimum setbacks that apply in the interim, and does not say when the County will get around to developing standards. Implementation Measure COS-4B
17 calls for establishing mitigation measure for biological resources. Again, there is no list of specific feasible measures to choose from, no performance standards, and no indication when the
18 County will establish the mitigation measures. Similarly, Implementation measure COS-4C calls for pursuing a habitat conservation plan for tiger salamander and red-legged frog, but is does not
19 say when they County intends to do this. Implementation Measure-4E calls for establishing protection for migration corridors, but does not say when this will be done. This latter flaw is

20 crucial, as the GPU contains dozens of mitigation provisions without any priority for implementation. While development under the GPU will begin immediately, God only knows

21 when the mitigation programs will be put in place.
In the interim, project-level mitigation will be identified by the project applicant's biologist for
22 reducing the impacts of invasive species and reducing impacts to riparian corridors. (See COS-

23 2

24

25

26

27

28

4K, COS-4N) There are no minimum standards for riparian corridor protection, because the
Planning Commission removed them. 2 It is important to understand the very limited scope of the impact mitigation under the GPU. To reduce the requirements on developments, an important feature of the GPU is that it precludes
reducing impacts by applying standards tö ministerial projects. By way of contrast, many
FL2'0 jurisdictions have objective standards in their general plans and zoning ordinance that establish streamside setbacks, open-space and habitat mitigation ratios, and other impact reducing measures so that all developments in the area (discretionary or ministerial) contribute to impact reduction. This allows more projects to be developed before habitat elimination places stricter limits on development. The Planning Commission and the Board of Supervisors specifically rejected this concept for the GPU. The project-level mitigation of impacts to biological resources, biologically sensitive communities, invasive species, streams and wetlands, riparian
7 corridors, wildlife corridors will only occur for discretionary projects. (See COS-4H, 41, 4K, 4L, 4N, 40, 4P.) These are only a fraction of the impacting land uses in the County.
8
3) Your bat-roosting mitigation requests were not accepted.
Your bat roosting mitigation requested multiple survey visits. Your mitigation requested that
10 replacement roosts be in place a year prior to the project development. Your mitigation indicated that the project would not be implemented until the roosts are documented to be in use by the bat
11 species. Your mitigation indicated that roost structures should be removed outside the critical hibernation and maternity seasons. (Attachment 1, pp. 5-6.) These safeguards are needed to
12 ensure that impacts are effectively reduced. None of these safeguards made it into the County's mitigation measure. (See COS-4P.)
13 4) Were you notified of the Planning Commission and Board of Supervisor's hearings?

14 Did the County provided you with notice of the Planning Commission's May and June GPU hearings, or the Board of Supervisors' July GPU hearing, as you requested in your letter?
15 (Attachment 1, p. 8.)
Please send a follow-up letter to the Board of Supervisors asking them to reconsider your
16 suggestions. Ask them to comply with CEQA by adopting proper mitigation measures. If there
is somebody in else in your Department that sends these letters, please forward this email to them.
17 As the citizens who hope to benefit from your agency's expertise, we would very much appreciate your expert recommendations. Please send me a copy of what you send to the County.

INTRODUCTION Pd

2 1. Petitioner Calaveras Planning Coalition ("CPC") challenges Respondents County of
m t nn Calaveras' and Calaveras County Board of Supervisors' ("BOS") November 12, 2019, approval
of the General Plan Update ("GPU"), because it violates land use law. (Government Code, sec.
65300, et. seq.) The text of the GPU's Resource Production, Conservation & Open Space, and
Safety elements are lacking components specifically required by the law, including objectives for
6 the long-term protection of agricultural lands and objectives to protect communities from the
7 unreasonable risk of flooding. Also, the GPU is not comprehensive in its treatment of open space

8 conservation for public safety and wildlife habitat. As a result, the implementation of the GPU
will pose unnecessary risks to life and property due to wildfire by allowing residential,

10 commercial, and industrial development by right and by ministerial approval on even the most

11 isolated, dry, steep, and windswept slopes. Such by right and ministerial approvals under the GPU
will also put special status species at unnecessary risk of habitat loss, whereby the county could
12 face the prospect of a premature injunction of local economic activity by the federal government
13 [mito protect those species. In addition, such injunction would impact families that depend upon
14 healthy local economy to survive.

15 2. The GPU also indefinitely defers definitive planning decisions regarding key general plan

16 issues including level of service requirements for emergency response providers; level of service

17 requirements for water and sewer; emergency service impact fees; transportation impact fees and
benefit basin fees; bypass roads; open space zoning; and wildlife corridors. The deferral of
18 planning decisions is indefinite despite the fact that the County spent an additional 11 years
19 working on the GPU after the aforementioned issues were identified as key in 2008. As a result,
20 the County has avoided its responsibility to address legitimate state interests in the GPU and has

21 denied our local communities, economy, and environment the benefits to be derived from sound

22 and lawful planning.

23 3. In addition, the GPU is not comprehensive in its treatment of community plans, having
failed to include the 2013 Copperopolis Community Plan and having unnecessarily rescinded
24 without replacement the essential texts of community plans for Ebbetts Pass, Arnold,
25 Avery/Hathaway Pines, Murphys/Douglas Flat, and Valley Springs. This not only betrays the
26 trust of hundreds of local residents who worked to draft those plans, but it also leaves these
27 communities without the means to address long standing and ongoing community specific land

28 use challenges. In some instances where a community plan was included in the GPU, the

Petition for Writ of Mandate -2-

-) n -*

- County's changes to the plan drafted by residents have resulted in conflicts between the policies

2 of the plan and the land use designation maps for those communities. This interjects additional

m v 1nlo and unnecessary uncertainty into the development marketplace, increasing risks and raising costs,
4. Furthermore, the Petitioner challenges the Respondents' certification of the program
environmental impact report ("EIR") for the GPU, pursuant to the California Environmental
Quality Act ("CEQA"), Pub. Res. Code § 21000 et seq. Some mitigation measures required to be
mandatory are phrased as optional while others are improperly deferred. As a result, many of the
7 GPU's two dozen significant impacts associated with wildfire risk, traffic congestion, noise, air

8 pollution, conversion of agricultural lands, destruction of cultural and historical resources, and

9 degradation of fish and wildlife habitat will be more severe, when they can and should have been

10 further reduced. The PEIR is also inadequate as an informational document under CEQA,
because still other mitigation measures and alternatives have been completely rejected with little 11 or no analysis. In addition, mitigation measures were rejected by the Respondents using legally
12 inadequate findings. As a result, the Respondents' approval is uninformed and not supported by
13 the analyses and findings of fact that are required under CEQA. CEQA requires valid analyses
14 and findings to demonstrate to the public that the government did everything feasible to protect

15 environmental health and safety. All of these potential violations were pointed out in comments

16 on the draft program EIR ("DEIR") made by individuals, organizations, and experts from

17 government agencies and repeated through written and verbal pleas to the Planning Commission
and to the Board of Supervisors. Nevertheless, the Respondents still perpetrated the violations
18. and failed to adequately respond to the comments on the DEIR as required by law.
19 5. The Petitioner, CALAVERAS PLANNING COALITION, requests that this Court set aside
20 Respondent CALAVERAS COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS' November 12, 2019,

21 approval of the General Plan Update, the Findings of Fact, the Statement of Overriding

22 Considerations, and certification of the PEIR due to violations of CEQA and land use law and

23 require Respondents to comply with these laws prior to making any subsequent approval of the
General Plan Update.
24 6. Finally, the Petitioner seeks the Respondents' release of the 2011 Mintier "Draft" General
25 Plan under the California Public Records Act and the California Constitution. (Gov. Code, sec.
26 6250 et seq.; Cal. Const., art I, sec. 3, subd. (b)(1).) I, By improperly withholding this document

27 which was executed under a public contract exceeding $900,000 and prepared after three rounds

28 of public meetings across the county which were attended by over a thousand participants over

2 suppressing informed public debate relating to the health, safety, and welfare of the people of
3 Calaveras County for decades to come.

PARTIES ün O 7. Petitioner, CALA VERAS PLANNING COALITION, is a project of the Community
Action Project, which is an unincorporated association fiscally sponsored by Ebbetts Pass Forest
Watch, a 501-c-3 non-profit corporation. The CPC is a group of community organizations and
8 individuals, friends and neighbors, who want a healthy and sustainable future for Calaveras
9 County. They believe that meaningful public participation is critical to a successful planning
process. United behind eleven land use and development principles, they seek to balance the 10

= 9 02 conservation of local agricultural, natural, and historic resources with the need to provide jobs,
housing, safety, and services.
8. The members of CPC and their families live in the Sierra Nevada foothills of Calaveras
County. Because they care about their neighbors, CPC members want to maintain the quality of 14 their unique communities and to pass that on to newcomers and future generations. Because they
15 have a strong sense of place, CPC members want to preserve the capability of open space lands to
16 produce food, fiber, minerals, water, habitat, and the scenic beauty that both blesses their lives
They want to preserve that productivity for newcomers and future 17 and provides local jobs.
generations. Because they feel honored to live in the State of California, CPC members accept 18 the responsibility to enforce the land use, environmental, and public information requirements 19 conferred by the Constitution and the laws of the State of California for the benefit of CPC
20 members, the people of Calaveras County, and for future generations. The CPC includes
21 members who reside in Calaveras County, particularly in or around the communities of Arnold,
22 Murphys, Hathaway Pines, Copperopolis, and Valley Springs; and in the Butte Fire burn scar.

23 9. Respondent, CALAVERAS COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS (hereinafter, "the
Board") is the governing body of respondent, COUNTY OF CALAVERAS ("County"), a
provide municipal 24 political subdivision created under the laws of the State of California to
25 governance over private lands north of Tuolumne County, south of Amador County, east of San
26 Joaquin County, and west of Alpine County. (Gov. Code, sec. 23105.) The Board is responsible
27 for adopting and implementing a legally adequate general plan, for complying with CEQA, and
28 for maintaining and providing access to public records.

real parties in interest have been determined the petitioner will, with the leave of the court if
12 necessary, amend this petition to insert such identities and capacities.
13

14 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

15 12. A petitions for writ of mandamus is an acceptable means of seeking judicial review of

16 government decisions under CEQA, land use law, and the Public Records Act. (Camp v. Board

17 of Supervisors (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 334, 348;, Government Code, secs. 6258, 65301.5, Public
Resources Code, secs. 21168, 21168.5.) This court has jurisdiction over this action in mandamus
18 pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure, Sections 1085, et seq., and 1094.5, that require
19 that County's action be set aside if the County has prejudicially abused its discretion. A
20 complaint for injunctive and declaratory relief is also appropriate. This court has authority to

21 grant declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure, Sections

22 525 and 1060; Government Code Section 6258, and Public Resources Code, Section 21168.9.

23 This action is timely having been filed within 30 days of the County's November 12, 2019 CEQA

24 notice of determination, within 90 days of the County's November 12, 2019 adoption of the GPU,
and within 3 years of the Petitioner's multiple request for the 2011 Mintier General Plan made
25 between July 4, 2017 and August 20, 2019. (Public Resources Code, sec. 21167, subd. (c);
26 Government Code, secs. 65009, subd. (c)(1)(A); and Code of Civil Procedure, sec. 338.) This

27 court is the proper venue pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure, Sections 395 and 393,

o m7 4 N that identify the defendant/respondents' location as the appropriate venue for both civil actions in
general and civil actions against public officials.
EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES
13. The petitioner has met the requirement that it exhaust administrative remedies prior to
filing this action. (Public Resources Code, sec. 21177.)
14. In the16 months that preceded the Board's approval of the GPU, CPC members and their

7 attorney repeatedly submitted arguments and evidence to the Planning Department, the Planning

8 Commission, and the Board of Supervisors encouraging the County to correct the legal flaws in
the GPU and its EIR. These were sufficient to exhaust administrative remedies for causes of

9 action one and three. The CPC also made both written and verbal requests for the 2011 Mintier

10 General Plan of the Planning Commission and the Board of Supervisors. These were sufficient to

11 exhaust administrative remedies for cause of action 2. Further details are provided below.

12 15. About a week before the Board of Supervisors approved the GPU on November 12, 2019,

13 the County released draft findings of fact. On November 10, 2019, the CPC sent the Board of

14 Supervisors comments encouraging the Board of Supervisors to fix the flaws in the finding. On

15 November 8, 2019, the CPC sent in comments encouraging the Board of Supervisors to fix the
alternatives treatment in the DEIR. On November 7, 2019, the CPC sent in comments

16 encouraging the Board of Supervisors to fix flawed mitigation measures in the EIR, and to correct

17 the flawed responses to comments on the DEIR. These comments reinforced prior efforts to

18 exhaust the administrative remedies for cause of action three.

19 16. On July 16, 2019, the CPC sent a written request to the current Board of Supervisors to

20 waive previously claimed privileges and release the 2011 Mintier General Plan. This was

21 followed up by a verbal request on August 20, 2019. These actions are sufficient to meet the

22 exhaustion requirement of the Public Records Act for cause of action two. This was the third
Board of Supervisors to fail to honor the CPC's request for the document. The previous two

23 Boards of Supervisors, elected in 2014 and 2016, were also asked to provide the document, but

24 refused to do so. The Petitioner waited to be denied three times before troubling this court to

25 provide judicial relief.

26 17. Prior to and during the July 30 and 31, 2019, Board of Supervisors public hearing on the

27 GPU, the CPC sent the Board of Supervisors a series of memos encouraging the Board of

28 Supervisors to correct flaws in the GPU and its EIR. Copies of these memos were sent to the

Petition for Writ of Mandate -6-

D »

P Planning Department and the Deputy County Counsel in charge of land use. These contribute to

2 meeting the exhaustion requirements for causes of action one and three.

m t 18. On June 27, 2019, the Planning Commission rejected general plan amendments requested
by the CPC, and recommended that the Board of Supervisors adopt the GPU. The CPC requested

u an appeal hearing before the Board of Supervisors to address the CPC requests that were not
included in the GPU recommended by the Planning Commission. (Government Coe, sec. o 65354.5.) This request for a hearing was denied. This exhausted any requirement that may be

19. Prior to and during the Planning Commission's May and June 2019 hearings on the GPU, recommendations.

10 the CPC sent the commission a series of comments encouraging the commission to correct flaws
in the GPU and its EIR and to inquire regarding the release of the 2011 Mintier General Plan. 11 Copies of these comments were sent to the Board of Supervisors, to the Planning Department, and
12 to the attorney from the County Counsel's Office responsible for land use. These contribute to
13 meeting exhaustion requirements for causes of action one, two, and three.
14 20. Prior to the Planning Commission hearing, on January 14 and 15 of 2019, the CPC
15 requested that the Board of Supervisors hold one more public workshop to discuss the complex

16 issues regarding tmzjthe GPU. The Board declined to do so, deferring any discussion to the later
GPU public hearing. In January, March, and April of 2019, the CPC sent three memos supported 17
by evidence encouraging the Board to fix flaws in the Introduction and Land Use Element of the
18 GPU, the flaws in the GPU EIR, and the flaws in the Community Planning Element. Copies of
19 these memos and evidence were sent to the Planning Department and the Planning Commission.
20 These contribute to meeting exhaustion requirements for causes of action one and three.

21 21. On August 13, 2018, the CPC sent in comments on the GPU DEIR, identifying parts of

22 the document that needed to be revised to comply with CEQA. Similar comments were sent in by

23 Department of Conservation, Department of Fish and Wildlife, the Center for Biological
Diversity, and the Central Sierra Environmental Resource Center. The CPC facilitator included
24 in the comments a hand written cover letter encouraging the Planning Director to call if he was
25 interested in working together "to preserve housing value and freedom of movement, to protect
26 the peace and safety of communities, to defend our forests, range and recreational lands, and to

27 restore economic opportunity." He did not call. Such comments were sufficient to exhaust

28 remedies for cause of action 3.

Petition for Writ of Mandate -7-

22. Since the beginning of the GPU process in 2006, the CPC enthusiastically participated in

Na0 Au the General Plan Update, submitting many comments to encourage the County to comply with
CEQA and land use law and to release the 2011 Mintier General Plan. The Planning Commission
was reacquainted with many of these documents in an email on January 24, 2019.
23. CPC members participated actively and diligently from the beginning of the process in
January of 2006 through its completion in November of 2019 by providing testimony in formal
public hearings as well as copious written comments regarding the GPU and its EIR. The

8 truncated Board review of the GPU on July 30 and 31 of 2019 did not include discussion of CPC

9 concerns regarding the legal adequacy of the GPU and the EIR and the harm that would result

10 from these violations. Ultimately the Board ignored the CPC concerns and approved the GPU in
a manner contrary to the law, placing general plan "progress" ahead of legal compliance. Only

11 after doing everything it could to try to get the Board of Supervisors to complete a valid General

12 Plan Update and EIR did the CPC trouble the court for judicial relief.

13

14 STANDING: BENEFICIAL INTEREST & PUBLIC INTEREST

15 24. A petitioner must have a private or public beneficial interest at stake in order to have

16 standing. (Code of Civil Procedure, sec. 1086; People ex rel Younger v. County of El Dorado
(1971) 5 Cal.3d 480, 491; Citizens for Sensible Development of Bishop Area v. County of Inyo

17 (4th Dist. 1985) 172 Cal.App.3d 151, 158.) The petitioner has private interests at stake, and the

18 petitioner shares in the public interests that are at stake. These public interests include fire safety,

19 agricultural land conservation, wildlife habitat protection, environmental impact reduction, and
access to public records.
20

21 25. CPC members and the public rely upon Calaveras County to conserve rangelands for

22 agricultural production, for jobs, for habitat protection, for fire safety, for scenic beauty, for water

23 quality and quantity, and to continue the rich cultural legacy of working the land. CPC membersl
and the public have already seen thousands of acres of rangeland go out of production since the

24 turn of the 21st century. CPC members and the public saw tens of thousands of acres of private

25 land burn in the Butte Fire in 2015. Because the GPU does not include the required objectives

26 for the long-term conservation of rangelands, the approval of the GPU threatens both private and

27 public interests in agricultural production, jobs, habitat protection, fire safety, scenic beauty,
water quality and quantity, and the future of working the land.

28

Petition for Writ of Mandate -8-

D

2 26. CPC members and the public rely on the County to comply with CEQA to evaluate and
adopt feasible measures and alternatives proposed by agency experts and the public to reduce

A 0 environmental impacts. The County instead approved a GPU with significant and unavoidable
impacts to private and public interests. These impacts include traffic congestion, air pollution,
conversion of agricultural lands, destruction of historic resources, and the degradation of fish and
wildlife habitat. The County refused to evaluate any policy alternative that might reduce or
eliminate those impacts including alternatives proposed by the CPC. The County rejected as

8 infeasible, without meaningful analysis or supportive substantial evidence, the mitigation

9 measures proposed by agencies and the public including those proposed by the CPC. The County
rescinded without replacement community plans for Ebbetts Pass, Arnold, Avery/Hathaway

10 Pines, Murphys/Douglas Flat, and Valley Springs that included measures that would have

11 reduced the local impacts of the GPU. CPC members who live in some of those communities

12 were particularly harmed, as they worked especially hard to keep those community plans in place.

13 27. CPC members, the press, and the public rely on the County to maintain and to provide

14 public records so that the people can remain informed about the people's business. It is in the

15 interest of all adult citizens to be informed about government actions So that we can effectively
exercise our Constitutional right to seek the redress of grievances and to vote as our informed

16 conscience dictates. The County has refused to release the 2011 Mintier General Plan and,

17 thereby, continues to prevent people from including its wisdom in the general plan. This also

18 prevents people from determining for themselves if the Supervisors made a mistake by rejecting

19 the 2011 plan, sight unseen. Two such Supervisors currently serve on the Board. By not

20 releasing the plan, the County withholds from the electorate information relevant to their choice

21 among candidates for Supervisor. CPC members are particularly harmed because they worked

22 very hard over approximately four years participating in the development of the 2011 Mintier
General Plan.

23 28. Approval of the GPU and the FEIR will cause irreparable harm to CPC and public

24° interests by failing to conserve agricultural lands as required by the Government Code, and by

25 causing significant impacts to the human environment that should have been reduced or avoided

26 pursuant to CEQA. The County's wrongful failure to release the 2011 Mintier General Plan

27 irreparably harms the ability of citizens to effectively exercise their Constitutional right to seek
the redress of grievances and to vote their preference.

28

Petition for Writ of Mandate -9-

29. The California Environmental Quality Act is designed to help local governments identify

2 and mitigate the potentially significant impacts of their actions for the benefit of their people.

3 Land use law is designed to conserve agricultural lands to promote the agricultural production,
A fire safety, habitat protection, water resources, and scenic beauty that people enjoy. The Public

1no Records Act is designed to allow members of the public to learn about the public's business.
30. Thus, as described above, CPC members have particular beneficial interests at stake in the
County's compliance with land use law, CEQA, and the Public Records Act. The public also has
beneficial interests at stake. The CPC humbly accepts the serious responsibility to defend these
important public interests. The Petitioner's interests in this matter fall squarely within the zone of
interests protected by land use law, CEQA, the Public Records Act, and the California

10 Constitution. The petitioner is precisely the class of party that this body of law was designed to

11 protect.

12 IRREPARABLE HARM
13 31. The Respondents' actions will result in irreparable harm to the petitioner and the public at
14 large. First, the Respondents' failure to release the 2011 Mintier General Plan will cause

15 irreparable harm by impeding citizens in the exercise their Constitutional right to seek the redress

16. of grievances related to the general plan and to make an informed vote for Supervisor. Second,

17 the Respondents' GPU will cause irreparable harm by failing to properly conserve rangeland and,
thereby, recklessly contribute to the irreparable loss of agricultural production, sensitive species
18 habitat, scenic beauty, water quality and quantity, and the very lives of people stuck in wildfires.
19 Third, the Respondents, through a flawed FEIR and findings, will cause unnecessary and
20 irreparable harm through significant impacts including traffic congestion, air pollution,

21 conversion of agricultural lands, destruction of historic resources, and the degradation of fish and

22 wildlife habitat, by implementing the GPU without the feasible measures to protect resources.

23 Finally, by rescinding community plans without replacement and, thereby, eliminating existing
mitigation measures that would have reduced the local impacts of the GPU, the Respondents have
24 irreparably harmed the members of the Petitioner and the public who reside in and around those
25 communities and have caused good people to question their faith in the integrity of their local
26 government.

7 FACTUAL BACKGROUND

8

9 DESCRIPTION OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

10 33. The area in controversy is Calaveras County. It begins in the east at the crest of the Sierra

11 Nevada Mountains between the steep canyons of the Mokelumne River on the north and the
Stanislaus River on the south. Much of the land in the higher elevation is administered by the
12 Stanislaus National Forest and is used for timber harvesting, mining, grazing, and recreation.
13 Since the 1990's, timber harvest and other activities have been modified to protect habitat for
14 additional sensitive species, to maintain viable species populations, and to keep these sensitive

15 species off the endangered species list. Timber harvests on these lands have been the subject of

16 collaborative efforts to reduce fire danger, improve forest health, protect sensitive species habitat.

17 and produce wood products. Selected segments of the Mokelumne River totaling about 37 miles
from Salt Springs to Pardee Reservoir have been designated Wild and Scenic by the State of
18 California and are being managed to maintain the outstanding and remarkable historic and
19 recreational resources of the river corridor. In the region that includes Calaveras County, the state
20 of California expects climate change to result in much less precipitation, reduced habitat for many

21 wildlife species, and increased risk of loss from wildfires.

22 34. Adjacent to and interspersed with these public lands, are private timber lands where

23 harvesting is regulated by the California Board of Forestry in accord with state law. The

24 environmental impacts of this private logging on wildlife habitat and watershed health and its
long-term sustainability have been the subject of contested ligation and administrative advocacy.
25 Along the Highway 26 and Highway 4 corridors much private timber land is immediately
26 adjacent to existing community centers. As climate changes (MoJaffect the productivity of these

27 timberlands, development for other uses becomes more likely.

28

35. The county is bisected by Highway 49 from north to south and lies between the
2 Mokelumne River and the Stanislaus River. Calaveras is part of the historic Mother Lode and the
mtn high Sierra. Communities have developed in the oak woodlands and savannahs of the foothills
and in the mixed conifer forests of the mountains. Some of the forested communities east of
Highway 49 are considered "disadvantaged" and "legacy communities" where old economic
mainstays like timber mills and mines have faded. The GPU lists Mokelumne Hill, Mountain 6 Ranch, Railroad Flat, San Andreas, Valecito, and West Point as such legacy communities. A
7 couple of these communities are not served by public sewers. Other communities like Arnold and

8 Murphys are more prosperous tourist and retirement communities. In some community centers

9 served by public sewers, the systems have reached their capacity. Steep and isolated canyons

10 along with high fuel loads in this area result in a very high fire risk. Some communities are still
recovering from the 2015 Butte Fire that caused two fatalities and burned over 70,000 acres and 11 475 residences.
12 36. West of Highway 49 to the San Joaquin County border, the County is dominated by gently
13 sloping and flat oak woodlands and rangeland where the risk of rapidly moving windswept fires is
14 still high. In addition to livestock, rangelands produce a wealth of ecosystem services including

15 carbon sequestration; water filtration, retention and aquifer recharge; fire fuel reduction from

16 grazing; habitat for bees; plant diversity; and open space, view sheds and recreation. In spite of

17 its many practical and cultural benefits, rangeland has been going out of production at an
alarming rate since the turn of the 21St century. Lands designated and zoned for agriculture are
18 also allowed by right to engage in a number of commercial, manufacturing, and recreational uses
19 regardless of how dry, how isolated, and how windswept they are, which can pose public safety
20 risks and create the potential for resource conflicts. Also in the county's western rolling foothills

21 are the communities of Copperopolis and Valley Springs, both of which are close enough to jobs

22 centers in San Joaquin County to attract commuters, which has made them among the most

23 populated communities in the county.

24 PROJECT DESCRIPTION
25 37. The project in question is the update of the Calaveras County General Plan with the
26 exception of the Housing Element which was updated separately. Every city and every county in

27 California is required to have a publicly available general plan that covers seven topics: land use,l

28

Petition for Writ of Mandate - 12-

NOUA w circulation, housing, conservation, open space, safety and noise. As allowed by the Government
Code, the GPU combines some elements and adds other elements.
38. In addition to maps and other diagrams, a general plan includes goals, policies, objectives,
standards, and implementation measures. A general plan is supposed to be a problem solving
document that assesses future needs and identifies methods to meet those needs.

00 39. The GPU includes a set of land use designations that identify the types of uses allowed on
residential, commercial, industrial, and resource production lands. The GPU includes a land use

9 map that applies these designations to every parcel of private land in the county. The Housing

10 Element seeks to provide the opportunity for the production of a broad spectrum of housing types

11 for individuals and families with a broad spectrum of incomes. The Circulation Element maps

12 the transportation network needed to serve some growth in communities, and the Public Facilities

sewer, and public services.

13 and Services Element includes policies that might help meet needs of communities for water,

14 40. A general plan is supposed to do more than just provide for development in community

15 centers. A general plan is not complete without also conserving natural, historic, and cultural

16 resources; providing open space for wildlife habitat and agricultural activities; providing for

17 peace and quiet; and meeting public safety needs. Thus, in an attempt to meet these requirements,

18 the Calaveras GPU includes a Conservation and Open Space Element, a Resource Production
Element, a Noise Element, and a Safety Element. .

19

20 41. What makes the GPU controversial is not so much what is in the plan but what is missing
from the plan after 13 years of work. Missing from the GPU are the Water Element, the Energy

21 Element, and the Economic Development Element previously drafted but excluded by the Board

22 of Supervisors. Missing from the GPU are the existing community plans for Ebbetts Pass,

23 Arnold, Avery/Hathaway Pines, Murphys, and Valley Springs that have addressed ongoing local

24 land use concerns for decades. Missing from the GPU are the new community plans drafted for

25 Copperopolis and Valley Springs to address these unique and growing communities. Missing

26 from the GPU are objectives, standards, and implementation time frames to provide guidance and
accountability for general plan implementation. Missing from the GPU administrative record is

27 the 2011 Mintier General Plan which was the product of the first four years of work on the

28 general plan update. Missing from the GPU are measures proposed by agency experts and the
public to reduce the impacts of implementing the GPU as such proposed measures have in similar
places throughout the State of California.

N 42. The GPU began in 2006 with an evaluation of the 1996 General Plan by Mintier and

A W Associates consulting firm. That evaluation identified substandard provisions throughout the
1996 General Plan. From 2007 through 2011, Mintier and Associates (later known as Mintier-

5 Harnish) assisted the County with the GPU process. With the first Administrative Draft General
Plan 80% complete, the Mintier-Harnish contract was allowed to

6 expire. Mintier was paid

7 $909,236. Planning Director Willis then engaged Raney Planning & Management to draft the
background settings section for the EIR for $50,000. The county eventually contracted with

8 Raney in November 2012 to write a new Administrative Draft General Plan and the EIR for

9 $299,960. Amy Augustine & Associates was later hired in May 2013 to write most of the general

10 plan elements while Raney was to focus on the EIR. With a contract extension in 2014,
Augustine's total compensation was $113,630.

11

12 43. A 2014 draft general plan was circulated for public comment. The Board of Supervisors

13 sent the draft plan to the Planning Commission in 2015, where much of the expert advice that

14 went into the plan was edited out by the Commission. The Board of Supervisors designated the

15 Planning Commission's version as the "project description" in 2016 and began the EIR process.
In 2018, the DEIR was circulated for public review. In May and June of 2019, the Planning

16 Commission again edited additional expert advice out of the GPU. The Board reviewed that plan

17 on July 30 and 31, 2019, and adopted that plan with only minor modifications on November 12,
2019.

18

19 DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT IMPACTS

20

21 44. In accord with the California Environmental Quality Act, the state and local governments
are required to adopt feasible measures to reduce the otherwise significant impacts of their

22 discretionary decisions. These measures are to be enforceable commitments that will be capable

23 of reducing impacts in a timely fashion. Throughout the GPU process, the CPC provided

24 examples of mitigation measures routinely applied in other places to reduce the impacts of

25 development allowed by general plans. The CPC repeatedly pointed out the need for the
measures to include language that would commit the County to implement the measures in a
timely fashion.
26

27 45. However, the County refused to adopt these mitigation measures, and, as a result, the

28 DEIR identified 25 significant and "unavoidable" impacts that would result from implementing
the general plan. These impacts include loss of life and property to wildfire, traffic congestion,

Petition for Writ of Mandate -14-

N noise, air pollution, conversion of agricultural lands, destruction of cultural and historical

cn resources, and the degradation of fish and wildlife habitat. While the list of significant impacts
got shorter in the Final EIR, it still included traffic congestion, air pollution, conversion of
agricultural lands, loss of visual character, destruction of historic resources; and the degradation

Un of fish and wildlife habitat, including oak woodlands

7 APPROVAL PROCESS

8 A. General Plan Update Chronological Factual Background

9

10 46. January 2006. Interim Planning Director Robert Selman held a study session for the

11 Board of Supervisors (BOS). He identified updating the 1996 General Plan as the number one

12 priority for the Planning Department. The BOS was uncertain about the necessary scope of the

13 update and how the county would tackle the issue of sprawling development and infrastructure

14 costs. The groups that would later become the Calaveras Planning Coalition (CPC) supported a

15 comprehensive update of the general plan using rural smart growth principals to reduce sprawl.
Ultimately, the County BOS hired Mintier and Associates to evaluate the 1996 Calaveras County

16 General Plan and identify needed updates.

17 47. October 2006. The County released the final version of the Calaveras County General

18 Plan Evaluation on October 12. It is a 69-page report noting a the need for a comprehensive update

19 of the general plan to meet state standards. Previously, the County released a redacted version of

20 the draft general plan evaluation after detailed written Public Records Act request from the

21 CPC. On October 16, the BOS agreed to develop community plans for each of the communities
in District 2 on the same track as the community plans for Valley Springs and Copperopolis.

22 (Ultimately, the General Plan Update (GPU) would not include community plans for Valley

23 Springs and Copperopolis.)

24 48. December 2006. Mintier and Associates submitted : work plan for completing the General

25 Plan Update in two years at a total cost of $1.35 million including $1 million for consultants,

26 $200,000 for County staff, and $150,000 for work on the circulation element. In April 2007, the

27 BOS held a workshop to review the Mintier and Associates work plan. The Board ultimately

28 hired Mintier and Associates as the general plan consultant. (Ultimately, the GPU would take 13
years and was done by other consultants.)

Petition for Writ of Mandate -15-

D

2 49. June 2007. Over 500 people, including CAP and CPC members, actively participated in
the first round of Community Workshops on the General Plan held by the County and moderated

A by Mintier and Associates. The CPC presented two volumes of input on to aid the County and its
consultants in developing : background report. The comments and documents submitted
provided background information on the preservation of open space and oak woodlands.
(Ultimately the County would reject standards for Natural Resource Land mitigation and oak
woodland mitigation.)
50. August 2007. The Board of Supervisors agreed 1) to have the Planning Department
provide limited technical assistance to communities developing community plans, 2) to include in
the GPU community plans completed prior to the initiation of the General Plan EIR, and 3) to

10 provide further assistance for community planning if the county received grant funding. The CPC

11 facilitator led a group of more than 20 speakers who spoke in favor of concurrently updating the

12 Community Plans during the General Plan Update. The Calaveras Council of Governments

13 would later receive a $204,648 grant from Caltrans and provide $51,162 in matching funds to

14 update the Valley Springs Community Plan in partnership with the County and two non-profit

15 organizations. (Ultimately, the County would rescind, without replacement, community plans for
Ebbetts Pass, Arnold, Avery-Hathaway Pines, Murphys, and Valley Springs.)

16 51. October 2007. At a Board of Supervisors workshop on the General Plan vision, the

17 Planning Department and two supervisors expressed direct support for the Awahnee Principles,

18 which promote the prevention of sprawl through community-centered development, preservation

19 of open space, developments supplied by surface water, growth balanced with infrastructure

20 capacity, mixed use development, greenbelt and wildlife corridors, and other smart growth

21 principles. All supervisors agreed denser development was needed to protect water rights and

22 maximize infrastructure. The Calaveras Enterprise newspaper headline read, "A New Vision for
Calaveras: No More Sprawl." At visioning meetings throughout the county in December 2007,

23 planning staff and consultants provided copies of the Ahwahnee Principles to the attendees.

24 52. March 2008. The County solicited public comments on its draft baseline report to identify

25 existing conditions in the County. The CPC submitted an approximately 100-page document

26 (including attachments) of comments on the General Plan Draft Baseline Report to help correct

27 errors and add documentation not included in the report. (Ultimately, the County would relegate

28 maps and data that were required to be in the GPU to a document similar to the Baseline Report.)
In July of 2008, Stephane Moreno's tenure as the Development Director ended. John Taylor was

Petition for Writ of Mandate -16-

L

2 hired as the interim director for a year during the search for a "permanent" director. (There
would be three additional planning directors hired and one additional interim director that served

3 twice before the GPU would actually be completed.)

4 53. August 2008. The Board of Supervisors approved the public development of a Water

5 Element for the General Plan Update. This began a seven-month stakeholder process that led to

6 the completion of the Water Element. Both CPC staff and members were active in this process,

7 which was led and funded (with $150,000) by the Calaveras County Water District and aided by

8 the participation of outside consultants and County staff. After two rounds of public workshops,

9 the general plan consultants released a summary report that reflected public input: the Issues &

10 Opportunities Report. The report identified a list of key issues that needed to be addressed in the
GPU. (Planning for many of these issues would be deferred indefinitely.) The report included

11 the Draft Vision and Guiding principles for use and inclusion in the GPU. The Board of

12 Supervisors accepted the report.

13 54. February 2009. CAP staff and CPC members testified before the Board of Supervisors in

14 support of the Draft Agriculture Element as presented by the Agricultural Coalition. CPC staff

15 also sent in a letter of support for the draft Water Element, expressing hope that it would be
improved by future staff, consultants, the public, and environmental review. The BOS directed

16 County staff to use the draft Agriculture, Forestry, and Minerals elements as the basis for an

17 element in the GPU. In July of 2009, after Agricultural Coalition members worked with County

18 staff to refine the draft element, the BOS again directed County staff to use it as a basis for an

19 element in the General Plan Update.

20 55. February 2010. The new Planning Director, George White, and the new General Plan

21 Coordinator, Brenda Gillarde, met with the CPC, and we gave them a briefing on what had
transpired regarding the General Plan Update since 2006. In March of 2010, the County and its

22 consultants Mintier and Associates moderated the 2-hour GPU Alternatives Workshops. Over

23 200 people participated in five locations throughout the county. Many CPC participants attended

24 the workshops and supported reasonably paced and community-centered growth, referred to as

25 Alternative B. Over half the tables at the workshops supported this alternative. The CPC also
submitted written comments on the alternatives.

26

27 56. In April of 2010, a unanimous vote of the BOS supported a general plan preferred
alternative which would reduce Residential-Agriculture lands (5 acres per parcel maximum

28

»

density) by over 130,000 acres, and increase Agricultural Lands (40-80 acres per parcel
N m t1n0 maximum density) by over 160,000 acres.
57. On June 1, 2010, the Calaveras County Board of Supervisors agreed to include the Valley
Springs Community Plan map developed through more than a year of public stakeholder meetings
as an alternative for analysis in the EIR for the General Plan Update. A competing community
plan a map developed by a committee appointed by Supervisor Toffaneli was to be used in the
project description for analysis in the EIR. However, neither map was considered in the General
7 Plan Update EIR.

8 58. In January of 2011, Planning Director George White resigned and General Plan

9 Coordinator Brenda Gillarde went on leave. In November of 2011, the CPC met with the next

10 Planning Director, Rebecca Willis, to give her a history of the previous 5-years of the General

11 Plan Update process. Though the general plan update text was nearly complete, Director Willis
was not satisfied with the product and expressed her concern that many of the provisions of the
12 Mintier General Plan would be met with "opposition and criticism," including the mandatory
13 language. The contract with Mintier-Harnish was allowed to quietly expire without extension.
14 59. On November 22, 2011, CPC staff and volunteers testified at the Board of Supervisors in

15 support of the Planning Department's recommendations to draft a general plan map that reduced

16 the build-out capacity of the General Plan and integrated the community plan maps, promoted

17 clustering of the residual development capacity on agricultural lands, and embraced citizen input.
The Board of Supervisors approved all of these recommendations.
18 60. In December 2011, the Board of Supervisors held a General Plan Study session to consider
19 the fate of two of the draft "optional" elements. At that time, the BOS retained the water element.
20 While they decided not to include an Economic Development Element, they indicated that some

21 parts of it may be added to the other remaining elements. (Eventually, the Water Element would

22 be excluded from the GPU as well.)

23 61. In February of 2012, the Board of Supervisors held a Study Session on Draft 1 of the a
General Plan Update land use maps. CPC staff and members testified and sent in written 24 comments on the map. They also spoke in opposition to a proposal that would include an anti-
25 planning "Agenda 21" resolution in the GPU. Our comments included a sample of what the CPC
26 felt was a more balanced and accurate statement for the general plan text regarding real estate

27 property rights, the public interest, and government authority. (The protection of property rights

28

and economic development would ultimately be used as an excuse for rejecting impact mitigation
2 measures in 2019).

c L 62. In April of 2012, the CPC and its member group, MyValleySprings.com, sent in parcel
specific comments on the Draft 1 General Plan Map. These comments expressed concerns
regarding fragmentation of natural resource lands and the need to reduce the impacts of future 5 development on riparian corridors. (The mitigation standards for these two issues would be
6 rejected in 2019). They also identified other low impact development principles that would need
7 to be included in the general plan text.

8 63.On May 24, 2012 CPC facilitator Tom Infusino spoke at the Planning Commission

9 meeting in support of including the Paloma and the Mountain Ranch Community Plans in the

10 Calaveras County GPU. These local plans had previously been hashed out by the local residents
at well-attended public meetings and were approved by near unanimous agreement of the 11 residents. The Planning Commission supported these community plan maps and the planning
12 process that created them.:
13 64. On November 13, 2012, the Board of Supervisors, on the advice of Director Willis, hired
14 new consultants, Raney Planning and Management, to finish the General Plan Update even

15 though the Supervisors had not read the text of the plan prepared by Mintier-Harnish that was

16 "80% complete." (The public has consistently been denied access to the Mintier-Harnish Plan as

17 well.) The County's contract with the new consultant included a scope of work that precluded the
consultant from using the word "shall" in General Plan goals and policies. (This aversion to
18 commitment would taint the validity of the mitigation measures in the GPU EIR.) In May 2013,
19 Amy Augustine was hired to write most of the GPU elements. The "optional" Water Element
20 was dropped from the GPU, which would result in planning for key water and wastewater

21 infrastructure issues being deferred indefinitely. It would take another seven years after hiring

22 Raney for the GPU to be adopted.

'23 65. Despite these disappointments, the CPC continued to encourage and support the County in
its GPU efforts. On December 10, 2012, CPC staff assisted CPC member group, Citizens for San 24 Andreas, during its meeting to discuss the San Andreas Community land use map with the
25 Planning Department. The Planning Director and the General Plan Coordinator identified steps
26 toward adoption of the San Andreas Community Plan and the San Andreas Mobility Plan.
27 66. On December 13, 2012, CPC staff, member groups, and volunteers sent in letters to the

28 Planning Commission regarding the Sawmill Project and spoke at the Planning Commission

Petition for Writ of Mandate -19-

hearing that had been continued from September. After a hearing that lasted over four hours, the
Commission voted 3 to 2 to send the project to the Board of Supervisors with a recommendation
üA w for denial without prejudice as suggested by the Planning Director. Work processing this
complicated specific plan diverted staff time from the General Plan Update.
67. In March of 2013, the CPC completed and handed in 36 pages of comments on the draft
environmental setting sections of the GPU EIR along with a disk of additional background
materials. In those comments the CPC advised the County to correct the environmental setting
co sections for aesthetics and agriculture, because those sections left out important facts, conditions,
and trends known to the County. However, the County did not make these changes and repeated

9 the same omissions in the Draft Environmental Impact Report (DEIR) in 2018.

10 68. On March 19, 2013, the CPC testified at the BOS hearing regarding the Draft 2 Land Use

11 Designation Maps. The CPC appreciated the staff review of comments on the Draft 1 map,
acknowledged inclusion of community plan maps, supported community-centered development,
12 supported reducing the impacts of development on Resource Production lands, and explained the
13 need to substantiate buildout estimates with evidence in the record.

14 69. On April 12, 2013, the CPC sent the Planning Department a letter asking that the

15 General Plan Update text be drafted before scoping and before the EIR was prepared. Scoping

16 determines the scope, focus, and content of an EIR, and, according to CEQA Guidelines Section

17 15083 "has been helpful to agencies in identifying the range of actions, alternatives, mitigation
measures, and significant effects to be analyzed in depth in an EIR." At the Board of Supervisors
18 meeting on May 14, 2013, the CPC provided testimony regarding the need to produce a Public
19 Review Draft General Plan Update text prior to scoping and completing an EIR. The BOS gave
20 direction to the Planning Department to do so. Supervisor Callaway publicly thanked the CPC for

21 the timely advice on this issue

22 70. On June 27, 2013, the CPC sent a letter to the Planning Department on the General Plan

23 Update growth projections and their implications. The letter outlined the need for infrastructure
capable of serving the growth projections and the challenges of financing that infrastructure.
24 (The adopted GPU indefinitely defers planning to finance infrastructure.)
25 71. By the August 16, 2013, deadline, the CPC sent in our General Plan Update topics and
26 text suggestions in response to the County's July invitation to do so. First, we summarized the

27 topics that had been identified over the prior 7 years of the General Plan Update process. These

28 included topics we raised in our previous comments as well as topics raised by people in public

Petition for Writ of Mandate -20-

p workshops and memorialized in the 2008 Issues and Opportunities Report. Next we noted the
2 need to include county-wide mitigation programs for development impacts. The fourth section of
D W u our comments made recommendations for properly incorporating the text of the community
plans. As suggested by the County, our final section identified selected policies from draft
optional elements for inclusion in the mandatory elements of the General Plan Update text.
72. In the autumn of 2013, after orchestrating changes in the GPU process that resulted in a
text rewrite, non-committal policies, the elimination of optional, yet vitally important, elements,
A and years of delay, Rebecca Willis resigned as Planning Director. Former Planning Director and
8 former Chief Administrative Officer Brent Harrington was hired for the interim year during the
search for a permanent Planning Director, primarily to keep the general plan update moving

10 forward.

73. In January of 2014, the CPC presented the STARS (State Approval Requirements) Project 11 to the BOS. This project would establish clear mitigation standards for the County to use when
12 reviewing applications for development projects.. It would also help development applicants
13 avoid significant impacts and reduce community objections. At no time during the GPU process
14 did the Board publicly consider this concept.
15 74. Brent Harrington, interim Planning Director, gave his final report to the Board of

16 Supervisors. He recommended that the Board drop the Community Plans from the General Plan

17 Update and add updated community plans as amendments to the General Plan at some point in
the future. The new Planning Director, Peter Maurer, attended this Board of Supervisors' 18 meeting. In March of 2014, the CPC met with Peter Maurer to brief him on the history of the
19 General Plan Update.
20 75. In December of 2014, the County released the Public Review Draft General Plan for

21 public review and comment. This document was prepared by Amy Augustine and edited by the

22 Planning Department staff. The majority of the public comments were short communications

23 from land owners concerned about the land use designation the County proposed for their

24 property on the land use designation map. In contrast, the CPC sent in over 100 pages of
comments and dozens of attachments relating to the text of the GPU.
25 76. On June 30, 2015, the Board of Supervisors held a workshop to give the Planning Director
26 instructions on how to move forward with the General Plan Update in the light of major public

27 comments. The BOS indicated that it would not include a Water Element in the General Plan

28 Update and that it would only include Community Plans from San Andreas and District 2 in the

Petition for Writ of Mandate -21-

General Plan Update. (The GPU adopted in 2019 would follow this direction.) The plans from
Valley Springs, Copperopolis, and the Highway 4 corridor would not be included. The
Supervisors directed the Planning Commission to review public comments on the 2014 Draft
General Plan with planning staff and the general plan consultant and to make changes as needed.
77. Over the course of several meetings in the summer and fall of 2015, the Planning

0 N O Commission did not actually address public comments on the 2014 Draft General Plan, but
instead began re-writing the General Plan as Commissioners saw fit. The Commission rewrote
the Vision and Principles, removing language that in its opinion advanced the public interest

9 while adversely affecting property rights. The Commission also refused to include the detail in
the general plan called for in the state's General Plan Guidelines and removed open space

10 protections from the Land Use Element and the Resource Production Element. Commissioners

11 sought to create a general plan that does the least required by state law. In doing so, the Planning

12 Commission minimized and often ignored the County's obligation to promote the health, safety,

13 and wellbeing of its citizens. It ignored the County's responsibilities to commit to implement

14 programs to mitigate the environmental impacts of the general plan. All of these changes to the

15 GPU were done by the Planning Commission before the Draft EIR was prepared for the plan.

16 Contrary to the intent of CEQA, none of the environmental impact analyses that are supposed to
be considered by the Planning Commission when making GPU changes were available to inform

17 the Commissioners or illuminate the public debate.

18 78. In November of 2015, the CPC submitted a 17-page Public Records Act request with 31

19 attachments for the Mintier-Harnish (formerly Mintier & Associates) "draft" General Plan. The
CPC hoped to see if any
20 of the ideas therein should be considered for inclusion in the General

21 Plan Project Description or if the Mintier General Plan should be considered as an alternative to

22 the General Plan Project Description in the Draft Environmental Impact Report. Ultimately the
County would deny this request for the Mintier General Plan and all other requests. (For the facts

23 relating to this cause of action see below, Public Record Act Request Chronological Factual

.24 Background.)

25 79. In July of 2016, the Planning Commission included in the Draft General Plan only a few

26 token policies from the existing and proposed community plans. This was in contrast to the

27 existing community plans that addressed unique local concerns in more detail.

28 80. In August and September of 2016, the Planning Commission reviewed site specific land
use designation requests to change the draft general plan's land use designation map. These

Petition for Writ of Mandate -22-

-

2 changes would have allowed the conversion of thousands of acres of natural resource and

u working lands to residential and commercial uses. Many of these lands are in areas not served by

4 public water and without regional road funding mechanisms. These requests would have

5 exacerbated the excess capacity for development during the life of the proposed general plan.

6 Ultimately, approximately 13,000 acres of the approximately 18,000 acres of requests were
denied.

7

8 81. In October of 2016, the Board of Supervisors designated the draft General Plan edited by
the Planning Commission as the project description for purposes of the environmental impact
report. The CPC submitted our written concerns regarding the draft general plan to the Board of

10 Supervisors. Our letter listed the need to include community plans for Copperopolis and Valley

11 Springs, the need to fill the fiscal holes in the plan, the need for an open space action plan, the

12 need for more clarity in the plan language, and the need to add more measures to reduce the harm
from new development under the plan.

13 82. In January of 2017, the County issued a notice that it would be completing an

14 environmental impact report for the General Plan Update. In February, CAP/CPC volunteers and

15 staff wrote, edited, printed, and delivered an 80-page general plan scoping document to the

16 Calaveras County Planning Department. The document included a 20-page guide to CEQA

17 compliance along with specific direction for the analysis of impacts to agricultural lands, land use

18 planning, greenhouse gas emissions, circulation, recreation, noise, and growth inducement. The

19 comments also included 15 folders of documents demonstrating how other counties have

20 evaluated and mitigated impacts to agricultural lands, air quality, biological resources, child care,
open space, fire safety, climate change, economic development, historic resources, and

watersheds.

21

22 83. On June 22, 2018, the County released a Draft Environmental Impact Report for the GPU.

23 There was a comment period for the public and government agencies to respond to the draft EIR.

24 In July, the Planning Department also held a public meeting to take verbal comments on the draft

25 EIR. In August of 2018, the CPC sent in comments on the GPU draft EIR, identifying parts of

26 the document that needed to be revised to comply with CEQA. Similar comments on the DEIR

27 were sent in by the Department of Conservation, the Department of Fish and Wildlife, the Center
for Biological Diversity, and the Central Sierra Environmental Resource Center (CSERC). Over
400 pages of comments were submitted.

28

Petition for Writ of Mandate -23-

0 NOuA0- 84. On January 14 and 15 of 2019, the CPC requested that the Board of Supervisors hold one
more public workshop to discuss the complex issues regarding the GPU and its EIR. (M7) The
Board declined to do so, deferring any discussion to the later GPU public hearing. In January,
March, and April of 2019, the CPC sent three memos supported by evidence that encouraged the
Board to fix flaws in the Introduction and Land Use Element of the GPU, flaws in the GPU EIR,
and flaws in the Community Planning Element. Copies of these memos and the supporting
evidence were sent to the Planning Department and the Planning Commission
85. In March of 2019, the County issued a Draft Final EIR with responses to comments on the

9 DEIR and revisions to the text of the DEIR. Prior to and during the May and June Planning
Commission hearings on the GPU, the CPC sent the Commission a series of comments

10 encouraging the Commission to correct flaws in the GPU and its EIR. The CPC also asked about

11 the release of the 2011 Mintier General Plan. Copies of these comments were sent to the Board

12 of Supervisors, the Planning Department, and the attorney from the County Counsel's office

13 responsible for land use.

14 86. Across eight dates in May and June of 2019, the Planning Commission conducted a public a

15 hearing on the GPU and the DEIR. The Planning Commission addressed only a few selected

16 flaws identified in the EIR by public and agency comments. At no time did the Planning

17 Commission consider the list of flawed responses that the CPC submitted. Primarily, the
Planning Commission made changes to the text of the GPU based upon concerns raised by the

18 Commissioners themselves. The hearing was public in the sense that the public was allowed to

19 watch, not in the sense that public concerns raised in testimony were regularly and uniformly
addressed by the Commission.
20

21 87. While the map of the 2016 Draft General Plan Update was not changed much by the

22 Planning Commission in 2019, there were substantial changes made to the text. In 2015 and

23 2016, the prior Board of Supervisors directed the Planning Department to eliminate the existing
plans for Valley Springs, Arnold, Murphys, and Avery/Hathaway Pines. None of the Supervisors

24 who voted for those directions are currently on the Board of Supervisors. While some current

25 Planning Commissioners expressed their frustration with so many community plans being

26 eliminated from the Community Planning Element, they ignored suggestions to make

27 recommendations contrary to the earlier Board's directions. The Commission also refused to

28 include the draft plans for Valley Springs (2017) and Copperopolis (2013).

Petition for Writ of Mandate -24-

0a0A0 N 88. Commissioner Kelly Wooster promoted many changes to the Resource Production
Element and the Conservation and Open Space Element. Specific streamside setbacks for
developments were removed in favor of those recommended by a project applicant's biologist.
Pending development of a County mitigation plan, the detailed and comprehensive Oak
Woodland Implementation Policy in the draft plan was deleted in favor of a measure that defers
to the minimum required state mitigation. Farmland conversion mitigation will be delayed
pending the receipt of Department of Conservation mapping data, and there are no specified
mitigation measures or ratios. Despite the fact that the Agricultural Coalition provided mitigation

9 guidelines to the County in 2011, mitigation for the conversion of Resource Production land has

10 been deferred until the development of new guidelines, and the plan fails to include specified
mitigation for use in the interim. In addition, a number of general plan policies and

11 implementation measures were explicitly limited in their application to discretionary projects

12 subject to CEQA review. Therefore, projects currently allowed by ministerial approvals or by

13 right will not be conditioned to assist the County in reducing adverse impacts on oak woodlands,

14 biological resources, riparian corridors, air pollution, and odors.

15 89. Priorities for the long list of deferred implementation measures in the general plan remain

16 unspecified. Instead, the plan calls for the Board of Supervisors annually to select
implementation priorities for the coming year based upon the recommendations of the Planning

17 Director. This is critical as many of the implementation measures in the General Plan Update are

18 simply a promise to do more planning and program development at an unspecified time in the

19 future. The biggest of these efforts will be reviewing, updating, and adding over 40 County

20 ordinances to deal with issues like light and glare, landscaping, zoning for historic centers,

21 agritourism expansion, noise, state fire safety regulation conformance, grading, and determining

22 when connection to public sewer system is mandatory.
90. In addition, there are over 80 other implementation measures, while not necessarily

23 associated with ordinance changes, remain without a specified priority or deadline. However,

24 when asked to identify the costs and personnel requirements for each of these tasks after plan

25 adoption, Planning Director Maurer indicated he was not sure that he could do it. As a result,

26 only after the Board of Supervisors has made its annual selection of tasks for implementation will

27 the relevant staff and funding requirements be identified. The overall magnitude of staff and
funding requirements for the entire GPU remain unpredicted.

91. Although the Calaveras Planning Coalition submitted extensive written comments and had
Nm t00A many people speak on each day of the hearing in May/June 2019, the Commission refused most
of the general plan improvements offered by the CPC. Furthermore, the Commission refused to
address CPC concerns regarding the inadequacy of the Final Environmental Impact Report
(FEIR). Despite approximately 30 minutes of public testimony asking for the Commission to
take 21 specific actions to correct the County's responses to comments on the DEIR, the
Commission was silent on the subject. Despite a CPC memo and testimony explaining flaws in
the FEIR impact analyses, flaws in the mitigation measures, and flaws in the alternatives analysis,
8 the Commission was silent on those subjects as well. By unanimous vote, on June 27, 2019, the

9 Planning Commission forwarded their edited GPU to the Board of Supervisors with a

10 recommendation for adoption.
92. In June of 2019, the CPC requested an appeal hearing before the Board of Supervisors to 11 address the CPC requests that were not included in the GPU recommended by the Planning
12 Commission. This request for a hearing was denied.
13 93. Prior to and during the July 30 and 31 Board of Supervisors public hearing on the GPU,
14 the CPC sent the Board of Supervisors a series of memos encouraging the Board of Supervisors
15 to correct flaws in the GPU and its EIR. Copies of these memos were sent to the Planning

16 Department and the Deputy County Counsel in charge of land use.

17 94. On July 30 and 31, 2019, the Board of Supervisors held a public hearing to address the
GPU and its EIR. Unfortunately, the General Plan adoption hearing was characterized by a lack 18 of responsiveness to both public and Supervisor concerns. Individual comments were limited to
19 three minutes on each element, which forced speakers to condense and, consequently, minimize
20 multiple complex land use and public policy issues. Tom Infusino, Facilitator of the Calaveras

21 Planning Coalition (CPC), expressed his exasperation with the two days of special meetings.

22 "They were paced and a conducted more like a calf-roping than a public hearing," he said.

23 95. During discussion of the Resource Production Element, Infusino implored the supervisors
to correct the damage done by the Planning Commission to the measures to mitigate impacts to 24 agricultural land, streamside zones, oak woodlands, and sensitive species habitat. He warned that
25 letting some development projects destroy habitat without mitigation, when combined with the
26 effects of climate change, would result in rapidly pushing local sensitive species populations to

27 the brink of extirpation. This could result in a federal injunction on development. This would

28 prevent other development project proponents from exercising their property rights. He

Petition for Writ of Mandate -26-

NO0 A W. N exclaimed, "If you don't restore the mitigation proposed by your experts, you won't be protecting
the environment or property rights."
96. The hearing concluded Wednesday July 31, 2019, with a discussion of the Community
Plans that were being eliminated by the Board. Members of the CPC read long lists of names of
people from multiple communities who signed petitions asking for the retention of the community
plans. CPC members held up pictures of some of those people that were captioned with requests
like "Plan for Arnold," "Plan for Murphys," and "Plan for Copper." Muriel Zeller of the CPC

8 reminded supervisors that in 2007, the public was told "to go forth and plan, and we did." Colleen

9 Platt of MyValleySprings.com said communities had trusted that their community plans would be

10 included in the General Plan Update. She said the Board had betrayed that trust. She encouraged
the Board, "To find the backbone and will... to include all Community Plans in the General

11 Plan."

12 97. Neither the Planning Commission during its May and June, 2019, GPU hearing nor the

13 Board of Supervisors during its July 30-31, 2019, GPU hearing addressed the CPC's concerns

14 regarding inadequate responses to comments on the GPU DEIR.

15 98. On July 31, 2019, the Calaveras County Board of Supervisors unanimously directed staff

16 to prepare the paperwork needed for the Board to adopt the updated General Plan. The Board's
direction concluded a two-day review of the General Plan's ten elements. The GPU would rescind

17 the existing community plans for Arnold, Avery/Hathaway Pines, Murphys/Douglas Flat, and

18 Valley Springs.

19 99. In the week prior to meeting, the County posted the Board of Supervisors' November 12,

20 2019, Agenda Packet. Subsequent to the agenda posting, the CPC sent the County a series of

21 memos identifying flaws in the responses to comments on the EIR, flaws in the treatment of

22 mitigation measures, flaws in the treatment of alternatives, and flaws in the findings of fact. In
addition, the CPC submitted a set of newspaper articles chronicling the GPU process from 2010

23 to 2018. The CPC also submitted for the record its correspondence regarding ongoing GPU

24 concerns with the Board of Forestry and Fire Protection, the Department of Conservation, and the

25 California Department of Fish and Wildlife. Furthermore, the CPC sent in a series of photos

26 depicting fire hazards along local roadways. None of this information was sufficiently moving to

27 the Board of Supervisors to trigger any further changes to the GPU. The GPU, the FEIR, the

28 Findings of Fact, and the one-page Mitigation and Monitoring Plan were unanimously adopted by

4 B. Public Record Act Request Chronological Factual Background

5 100. Beginning in 2006 and continuing through 2011, Calaveras County employed Mintier-

6 Harnish Planning Consultants (known as Mintier & Associates at the time of their hiring) to assist

7 in preparing a general plan update. This involved many community meetings to identify county

8 assets and deficiencies, to identify general plan issues and opportunities, to write a draft vision
statement, and to identify a draft land use map. All of these work products became public
documents. The last work product that Mintier-Harnish prepared was the text of the General Plan

10 Update.

11 101. Around or at the end of 2011, the Mintier-Harnish contract with the County was allowed

12 to expire after then Planning Director Rebecca Willis expressed a desire to go in a different
direction.
13

14 102. On November 13, 2012, the Board of Supervisors, on the advice of Director Willis, hired

15 new consultants, Raney Planning and Management, to finish the General Plan Update, even
though the Supervisors had not read the text of the plan prepared by Mintier-Harnish.

16 103. On behalf of the Calaveras Planning Coalition, on three occasions Tom Infusino

17 informally encouraged the County to release the Mintier General Plan to the public. The CPC

18 hoped that the professional suggestions in the plan, made after years of public workshops, could

19 prove useful as the general plan update moved forward. Also, the CPC was curious about the

20 quality of the final work product secured after over six years and over $900,000 in public

21 spending. On June 17, 2014, he made a verbal request for the document from Planning Director
Maurer while meeting with him to discuss the Economic Development Element. Mr. Maurer said

22 he would think about it. On August 14, 2014, in the absence of an affirmative response from the

23 Planning Director, Mr. Infusino made a verbal request for the document from the Planning

24 Commission. They did not provide the document. On October 18, 2014, he made a verbal request

25 for the document from the Board of Supervisors. The Board of Supervisors did not follow up on
that request.
26

27 104. On November 24, 2015, having had no success with informal requests, Mr. Infusino
presented a formal written request to Planning Director Maurer, the custodian of Planning

28 Department records, for the Mintier General Plan pursuant to the California Public Records Act.

Petition for Writ of Mandate -28-

D N

4 N m tn.t The formal request was 17 pages long and included an additional 31 supporting attachments. The
request explains why the document must be disclosed. The document would have been useful in
making suggestions to improve the 2014 Draft General Plan text under public review at that time
The request became the topic of local press coverage. On December 4, 2015, a letter to Mr.
Infusino from County Counsel's Office denied the Public Record Act Request on behalf of the
Planning Director. On December 8, 2015, Mr. Infusino encouraged the Board of Supervisors to
exercise its discretion to release the Mintier General Plan. The Board did not act on this request.
105. On December 18, 2015, in accord with the Calaveras County Code, Mr. Infusino
0g submitted a formal request to appeal to the Planning Commission the decision of the Planning

9 Director to deny the public record request. Again this was the topic of press coverage.

10 106. On December 21, 2015, Director Maurer sent a letter indicating that the denial of the a

11 Public Records Act request that was addressed to him was not made by "Planning Department
staff" and was therefore not appealable to the Planning Commission. Thus he decided to avoid
12 Planning Commission review of his own decision. On December 30, 2015, Mr. Infusino asked
13 County Counsel's office if it agreed with and could explain Director Maurer's letter of December
14 21.

15 107. On January 5, 2016, concerned that Director Maurer's decision regarding the lack of

16 Planning Commission appellate jurisdiction to review his prior decisions was tainted by self-

17 interest and that the time for appealing it would soon lapse, Mr. Infusino sent a letter to the Chair
of the Planning Commission seeking: 1) a hearing on the Planning Director's decision regarding
18 the appellate jurisdiction of the Planning Commission, 2) a hearing on the Planning Director's
19 denial of the Public Records Act request, and 3) any other method of getting these items on the
20 Planning Commission agenda for review.
21 108. Later on January 5, 2016, Ms. Julie Moss-Lewis of County Counsel's Office provided

22 Mr. Infusino a letter indicating that neither the Planning Commission nor the Board of

23 Supervisors had jurisdiction to hear an appeal of the denied Public Records Act request. On

24 January 25, 2015, Mr. Infusino contacted County Counsel Megan Stedtfeld regarding the need for
a due process hearing regarding the denial of the Public Records Act request. There was no
25 response. The denial of the public record request from the CPC and a similar a request from the
26 Calaveras Enterprise was reported in the press.

cJaüA.- 109. On March 25, 2015, the CPC made comments on the Draft General Plan Update text that
had been circulated by the Planning Department. In those comments the CPC called for a return
to a transparent general plan update process. "We strongly encourage the County to find a way to
include the community plan information more fully in the general plan update, to restore the
Vision Statement and Guiding Principles, and to release the Mintier and Associates draft general
plan to those who want to see it. It may have pearls of wisdom that we should include in the
General Plan Update."
110. On February 16, 2017 the CPC made scoping comments in advance of the preparation of
the draft environmental impact report for the General Plan Update. "Scoping has been helpful to
a agencies in identifying the range of actions, alternatives, mitigation measures, and significant

10 effects to be analyzed in depth in an EIR." (CEQA Guidelines, sec. 15083, subd. (a).)

11 In those scoping comments the CPC again warned the County not to continue to withhold the
Minter General Plan and to evaluate the plan in the DEIR as an alternative.
12 13 111. On July 4, 2017, the CPC sent a letter to the Planning Commission and to the Board of
Supervisors explaining the recent ruling of the California Supreme Court on the importance of
14 looking at alternatives to land use projects with significant environmental impacts. (Banning

15 Ranch Conservancy v. City of Newport Beach (2017) 2 Cal.5th 918.) The CPC wrote, "it was a

16 disastrous and indefensible step backward for past Boards of Supervisors to refuse to let the

17 public even look at the Mintier General Plan alternative. We urge you to reconsider this mistake
before it is too late for you to rectify it." On August 13, 2018, the CPC commented on the Draft
18 EIR for the General Plan Update. That DEIR did not consider the Mintier General Plan as one of
19 the alternatives. Our comments on the DEIR asked the County to evaluate the Mintier General
20 Plan as an alternative in the Final EIR.

21 112. In January of 2019, three different Supervisors took office. In April of 2019, the County

22 responded to comments made on the DEIR. The County rejected the CPC's request to consider

23 the Mintier General Plan as an alternative in the EIR. At the Planning Commission hearing in
May of 2019, the CPC inquired whether, since the DEIR now referenced the Mintier General
24 Plan, would the County be including it in the administrative record. County staff responded in
25 the negative. On July 16, 2019 the CPC asked the new Board of Supervisors to waive any
26 alleged privileges and to release the Mintier General Plan. On August 20, a CPC member

27 requested that the Board put the matter on an agenda so it could waive the privileges and release

28 the Mintier General Plan. The Board did not do so. In part out of concern for judicial efficiency,

w the CPC did not rush to involve the court in this matter, but it instead waited until three different

A Boards of Supervisors refused to release the Mintier General Plan before seeking judicial relief.

C. Chronology of facts listing instances the County ignored multiple efforts to help it
produce a valid General Plan Update Draft EIR in compliance with CEQA
113. Prior to preparing the DEIR, the County was urged (in some instances repeatedly) not to

8 make the very CEQA mistakes it did make in the DEIR. Ignoring efforts to help the County

9 comply with CEQA suggests that the many errors in the DEIR are not inadvertent mistakes by

10 staff, but are more likely intentional violations by the County, which is determined to violate a
law with which it does not agree.

11

12 114. For example, on September 14, 2010 letter, the CPC sent a letter to Planning Department

13 Staff member Dave Pastizzo, urging the County to properly quantify impacts and provided good
and bad examples from other EIRs. The CPC reiterated this requirement and reference the 2010

14 letter in its February 16, 2017 scoping comments. Nevertheless, in 2018 the DEIR failed to

15 properly quantify impacts in the sections evaluating air pollutants, greenhouse gases, agriculture,
and energy. This suggests that the County's actions are intentional.

16

17 115. For second example, on March 12, 2013, the CPC commented on draft environmental

18 setting sections to be used later in the General Plan Update DEIR. In those comments the CPC

19 advised the County to correct the environmental setting sections for aesthetics and agriculture,

20 which left out important facts, conditions, and trends known to the County. However, the County
did not make these changes and repeated the same omissions in the DEIR. (See CPC GP DEIR

21 Comments, pp. 4.1-3 to 4.1-7, 4.2-2 to 4.2-3.) Because the County and its consultants made no

22 effort to correct the omissions and misleading information that were previously identified, their
actions are most likely intentional.

23

24 116. For a third example, on July 22, 2015, the CPC explained in an email to the Planning

25 Commission that it had to make a commitment to implement policies in the General Plan if it

26 wanted to count them as mitigation measures. That email was copied to the Planning Director and
to County Counsel. Nevertheless, the Planning Director's Draft EIR tried to claim that such

27 noncommittal language in the plan and similar noncommittal provisions under consideration will
qualify as mitigation measures.

28 117. For a fourth example, on February 16, 2017, the CPC provided "scoping comments"
prior to the County's drafting of the EIR. "Prior to completing the draft EIR, the Lead agency

Petition for Writ of Mandate -31-

D

may also consult directly with any person or organization it believes will be concerned with the
Nmt..0 environmental effects of the project. Many public agencies have found that early consultation
solves many problems that would arise in more serious forms later." "Scoping has been helpful to
agencies in identifying the range of actions, alternatives, mitigation measures, and significant
effects to be analyzed in depth in an EIR. " (CEQA Guidelines, Section 15083.) In these scoping|
comments the CPC laid out a set of instructions for the County to follow to comply with CEQA
in the General Plan Update DEIR.
118. In these 2017 scoping comments the CPC also explained to the County that the DEIR
oo summary must include "the areas of controversy, and the issues to be resolved." (CEQA

9 Guidelines, sec.15123; CPC Scoping Comment, p. 1-5.) The CPC explained that the DEIR

10 would be flawed if it did not "provide a sufficient project description to provide proper

11 quantitative analyses of impacts." (CPC Scoping Comment, p. 1-5.) The CPC noted that the
environmental setting section needed to present the current situation on the ground using data 12 from a variety of sources. (CPC Scoping Comment, pp. 1-6 to 1-8.) The CPC explained the
13 importance of following the logical steps in impact analyses without jumping to conclusions.
14 (CPC Scoping Comment, pp. 1-8 to 1-10.) The CPC noted the importance of considering a broad

15 range of alternatives including the Mintier General Plan and a version of the general plan that

16 includes the Valley Springs Community Plan. (CPC Scoping Comment, pp. 1-14 to 1-18; pp.

17 2.3-10 to 2.3-12.) The CPC again explained the importance of adopting feasible and mandatory
mitigation measures to reduce potentially significant impacts and to commit "to specific
18 performance criteria" when deferring mitigation program design. (CPC Scoping Comment,
19 pp. 1-10 to 1-13.)
20 119. The scoping comments also proposed mitigation measures for agricultural,

21 greenhouse gas, land use, recreation, traffic, and growth inducing impacts. (CPC Scoping

22 Comment, pp.2.1-11 to 2.1-15, 2.2-3 to 2.2-4, 2.3-9, 2.5-2, 2.6-4 to 2.6-7, 2.7-5.) The scoping

23 comments included attachments with samples of mitigation measures regarding air quality,

24 biological resources, child care, open space, fire safety, greenhouse gas emissions, economic
development, historic preservation, and water impacts. (CPC Scoping Comment, pp. 3-1 to 3-
25 4; CPC Scoping Comment Attachments.) Nevertheless, the Draft General Plan Draft EIR
26 released by the County in 2018 failed to comply with these requirements for the executive
27 summary, the project description, the existing setting, the impact analyses, the alternatives, and

28

Petition for Writ of Mandate -32-

»

1 the mitigation measures. Nor did the DEIR discuss the mitigation measures proposed in the

2 scoping comments.

3 120. For a fifth example, in a July 4, 2017 email, the CPC explained to both the Planning

4 Commission and the Board of Supervisors the importance of the California Supreme Court's

5 2017 decision in the Banning Ranch Conservancy case. The CPC advised the County to consider
the Mintier General Plan as an alternative in the general plan DEIR. The County did not do so.
6 (CPC GP DEIR Comments, p. 6-1 to 6-3.)
7 121. In summary, despite all the efforts from 2010 to 2017 to help the County to comply with

8 CEQA, in 2018, the County released a Draft General Plan Draft EIR that made the very mistakes

9 the County was warned not to make. The flaws in the executive summary, the project description,

10 the existing setting, the impact analyses, the alternatives, and the mitigation measures all could

11 have been avoided if the County simply followed the guidance provided before, during and after
the scoping process.
12 122. For a sixth example, in part in response to comments on the DEIR, County's staff and
13 consultants recommended that the County rephrase some of the mitigation measures and add new
14 feasible mitigation measures. These included measures to reduce impacts from new development

15 to on resource production lands, riparian corridors, and oak woodlands. (Maurer, Planning

16 Commission Staff Report, May 22, 2019, Attachment 1.) Instead of relying on the advice of its

17 own experts, in June of 2019, the Planning Commission modified the measures to reduce their
scope and delay their applicability. Upon being apprised of the grave risks to local wildlife and
18 the local economy, the Board of Supervisors refused to discuss or address this issue during its
19 July 2019 GPU hearing. These multiple examples of the County repeatedly refusing to comply
20 with CEQA suggest that the many errors are not inadvertent mistakes. Instead, these are more

21 likely to be intentional violations by a County bent on violating a law with which it does not

22 agree.

23
D. Chronology of facts listing instances County Officials actively discouraged including
24 mandatory policies in the General Plan Update
25

26 123. The law requires that mitigation measures be mandatory and enforceable. When a

27 mitigation measure takes the form of a program to be adopted in the future, there must be a

28 commitment on the part of the lead agency to implement the program to achieve specified

Petition for Writ of Mandate -33-

D

NO0A0 N standards. The intent to avoid making such policy commitments in the Calaveras County General
Plan Update has been voiced in many ways by many public officials during the General Plan
Update process.
124. For example, during or before October 2011, then Planning Director Rebecca Willis
expressed her concern that many of the provisions of the Mintier General Plan would be met with
"opposition and criticism," including the mandatory language. (Harnish memo to Willis, 10-11-
11, p. 3.)

0o 125. For a second example, in 2012, the County entered into a contract with a new general

9 plan consultant to complete a general plan and EIR. It is well-established fact that a general plan

10 with significant environmental impacts is required to adopt feasible and mandatory mitigation

11 measures. Usually, these are included as policies in the plan itself. (CEQA Guidelines, 15126.4,

12 subd. (a)(2).) Nevertheless, the County's contract with the new consultant, approved by the Board

13 of Supervisors on November 13, 2012, included a scope of work that precluded the consultant
from using the word "shall" in General Plan goals and policies.

14 "Raney will incorporate the County's comments on the previous Administrative Draft

15 General Plan, including the global approach to the wording of the goals and policies to eliminate the word shall." (November 13, 2012, BOS Agenda Submittal Item 17, General
Plan Reney Contract, p. 21.)

16

17 This strongly suggests that the failure to commit to mitigation measures in the General Plan and

18 its EIR is not accidental on the part of the County. In fact, the County was so determined to

19 avoid any such commitment that it specifically precluded the general plan consultant's use of the

20 word "shall" in the plan as part of its legally binding contract with the County. (General Plan

21 Reney Contract, pp. 5, 21.) Ultimately the County would imply the word shall back into its

22 policies, though the mandatory nature was frequently undermined by other words, or the lack of
specified time for performance. . (GPU Introduction, page INT-7.)

23 126. For a third example, on February 2, 2015, Planning Commissioner Kelly Wooster

24 submitted written comments on the County's Draft General Plan. Those comments reflect a

25 consistent disagreement with mandatory mitigation measures included in the plan to deal with the

26 impacts of hillside development, water supply, visual screening, traffic congestion, open space

27 conversion, soil erosion, streamside development, greenhouse gas emissions, scenic resources,

28 biological resources, and cultural resources. He was also concerned that the County might be
found in violation of its plan in the future if it does not meet the obligations of its mandatory
policies. (Wooster Comments on 2014 Draft GP, pp. 2, 10, 11, 12.)

Petition for Writ of Mandate -34-

N-
No0 DW 127. For a fourth example, on June 30, 2015, the Board of Supervisors held a general plan
workshop. At that workshop, County Counsel advised the Board not to specify deadlines for the
completion of tasks in the General Plan for they could be held legally accountable for not meeting
those deadlines. (On July 22, 2015, the CPC sent an email to the Planning Commission
encouraging it to make specific commitments to mitigation measures in the GPU.)
128. For a fifth example, in July of 2015, the Planning Commission decided to scrap the

8 provisions of the General Plan Vision Statement drafted in 2008. The 2008 statement had been

9 completed at the recommendation of the Grand Jury after three rounds of public workshops on the

10 General Plan held throughout the County. The Commission decided instead to draft their own
vison statement that included a guiding principle to avoid specificity in the general plan. (See

11 September 22, 2016, Planning Commission Recommended Draft General Plan, Introduction, p.
1.)

12

13 129. a For a sixth example, in December of 2015, when the amended vision statement went to

14 the Board of Supervisors for approval then Supervisor Steve Kearny expressed his support for
vague and flexible general plan provisions.

15

16 130. For a seventh example, during the Planning Commission review of the plan in 2019,
Commissioner Wooster repeatedly resisted including any provision in the GPU that would have

17 the effect of committing the Board of Supervisors to a particular action or of limiting the

18 discretion of the Board for fear that they would be held accountable for failing to meet their

19 commitments. Rather than applying prescriptive or performance standards to development

20 applications, Commissioner Wooster wanted the Board of Supervisors to have broad discretion to

21 approve or disapprove a project on a case by case basis, to the extent possible. It is the very

22 nature of CEQA and general plan law for a county to identify its commitments and to identify the

23 standards it will use in exercising its discretion. These are essential parts of the planning process
that allow the rest of the government, and the people in the private and non-profit sectors, to

24 collaborate with the Board of Supervisors to achieve the goals of a general plan.

3 GENERAL PLAN LAW

4

un A) Requirements

6 131. Many of the requirements of general plan law are summarized in court opinions. As the

7 California Supreme Court explained last year in City of Morgan Hill v. Bushey:

8 Although zoning and general plans implicate local concerns and are often addressed by local governments, these arrangements also raise issues of "statewide concern." (DeVita, supra, 9 Cal.4th at p. 784.) So the Legislature has the constitutional power to enact laws limiting local government power over land use. (See DeVita, at pp. 772-773, 776, 784; see

10 also Lesher, supra, 52 Cal.3d at p. 544; Committee of Seven Thousand, supra, 45 Cal.3d at

11 pp. 510-512.) The Planning and Zoning Law of the State of California (§ 65000 et seq.) is an example: It requires every county and city in California to adopt a general plan.

12 (Lesher, at p. 535.) A general plan sets a county's or city's development policies and objectives, and must contain a "land use element" that "designates the proposed general

13 distribution and general location and extent of the uses of the land for housing, business, industry, open space, ... public buildings and grounds, solid and liquid waste disposal

14 facilities, greenways, ... and other categories of public and private uses of land." (§ 65302,
subd. (a).)

15 (City of Morgan Hill v. Bushey (2018) 5 Cal.5th 1068, 1079.)

16 132. As the California Supreme Court explained in 2016:

17 To ensure that localities pursue "an effective planning process" (§ 65030.1), each city and county must "adopt a comprehensive, long-term general plan" for its own "physical

18 development" as well as "any land outside its boundaries which in the planning agency's
judgment bears relation to its planning." (§ 65300.) When adopting general plans,

19 localities must "confront, evaluate and resolve competing environmental, social and

20 economic interests." (Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Board of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 571, 276 Cal.Rptr. 410, 801 P.2d 1161 (Goleta Valley).) Because of its broad scope,

21 long-range perspective, and primacy over subsidiary land use decisions, the "general plan has been aptly described as the 'constitution for all future developments' within the city or

22 county." (Id. at p. 570, 276 Cal.Rptr. 410, 801 P.2d 1161.) Accordingly, "[t]he process of

23 drawing up and adopting these revisions often becomes, essentially, a *constitutional convention, at which many different citizens and interest groups debate the community's

24 future." (Fulton & Shigley, Guide to California Planning (4th ed. 2012) p. 118.) "During the preparation or amendment of the general plan, the planning agency shall provide

25 opportunities for the involvement of citizens, California Native American Indian tribes,

26 public agencies, public utility companies, and civic, education, and other community groups, through public hearings and any other means the planning agency deems

27 appropriate." (§ 65351.) A legislative body must refer its proposal to a number of listed
public entities before dopting or amending a general plan. (§ 65352.) Planning

28 commissions must hold at least one public hearing and make a written recommendation to the legislative body; legislators must hold at least one public hearing before acting on the

Petition for Writ of Mandate -36-

-

2 recommendation. ($§ 65353-65356; see § 65354.5 [a planning agency authorized to approve or amend a general plan must "establish procedures for any interested party to file a written request for a hearing by the legislative body" and must provide public notice of any hearings].)"

a (Orange Citizens for Parks and Recreation v. Superior Court (2016) s Cal.5th 141, 152-153,
[emphasis added].)

7 133. In that case, the California Supreme Court went on to explain:

8 A general plan may be issued in "any format," including "a single document" or "a group of documents relating to subjects or geographic segments of the planning area" (§ 65301,

9 subds. (a), (b)), so long as it "comprise[s] an integrated, internally consistent and compatible statement of policies for the adopting agency" (§ 65300.5). It also must

10 include development policies, "diagrams and text setting forth objectives, principles,

11 standards, and plan proposals," and seven predefined elements-land use, circulation, conservation, housing, noise, safety, and open space. (§§ 65302, subds. (a)-(g), 65303.)

12

13 (Orange Citizens for Parks and Recreation v. Superior Court (2016) s Cal.5th 141, 153, [emphasis
added].)

14 134. The court continued:

15

16 Until 1971, the general plan was " 'just an "interesting study,' which did not bind local

17 land use decisions. (de Bottari v. City Council (1985) 171 Cal.App.3d 1204, 1211, 217 Cal.Rptr. 790 (de Bottari).) But now [t]he propriety of virtually any local decision

18 affecting land use and development depends upon consistency with the applicable general plan and its elements.' " (Goleta Valley, supra, 52 Cal.3d at p. 570, 276 Cal.Rptr. 410,

19 801 P.2d 1161, quoting Resource Defense Fund v. County of Santa Cruz (1982) 133

20 Cal.App.3d 800, 806, 184 Cal.Rptr. 371; see §§ 65359 [requiring that specific plans be consistent with the general plan], 66473.5 [same with respect to tentative maps and parcel

21 maps], 65860 [same with respect to zoning ordinances], 65867.5, subd. (b) [same with respect to development agreements].) "A zoning ordinance that conflicts with a general

22 plan is invalid at the time it is passed." (Lesher Communications, Inc. v. City of Walnut Creek (1990) 52 Cal.3d 531, 544, 277 Cal.Rptr. 1, 802 P.2d 317 (Lesher).) In addition, the

23 general plan must be internally consistent. "Internal consistency requires that diagrams

24 in the land use, circulation, open space, and natural resource elements reflect the written policies and programs of those elements." (Barclay & Gray, California Land

25 Use & Planning Law (35th ed. 2016) p. 23.) In other words, "the requirement of consistency .. infuse[s] the concept of planned growth with the force of law."

26 (deBottari, supra, 171 Cal.App.3d at p. 1213, 217 Cal.Rptr. 790.) " 'An action, program, or project is consistent with the general plan if, considering all its aspects, it will further

27 the objectives and policies of the general plan and not obstruct their attainment.'

[emphasis added].)

a u p W 135. The court finally concluded its summary of general plan law:
The Government Code guarantees the public a role in adopting and amending a ***239 general plan. (§ 65300 et seq.) "The process ... is structured to transcend the provincial.

7 Public participation and hearings are required at every stage, in order to obtain an array of viewpoints." (Goleta Valley, supra, 52 Cal.3d at p. 571, 276 Cal.Rptr. 410, 801 P.2d

8 1161.) The Governor's Office of Planning and Research encourages local governments to structure their procedures to facilitate public involvement and suggests making planning materials available in different languages, conducting advertising and outreach to different

10 segments of the community, holding events in familiar and welcoming spaces, and providing "access to information about the issues that are being addressed by the

11 process." (Governor's Office of Planning & Research, General Plan Guidelines, supra, at

12 p. 144; see id. at pp. 144-148.) At a more basic level, meaningful public participation in the planning process requires that the public have access to the general plan. Since

13 1984, the Government Code has mandated that "[c]opies of the documents adopting or amending the general plan, including the diagrams and text," be made available to the

14 public "one working day following the date of adoption" or "two working days after
receipt of request for a copy." (§ 65357, subd. (b)(1), (2).)

15

16 (Orange Citizens for Parks and Recreation v. Superior Court (2016) 2 Cal. 5th 141, 154.)

17 136. As explained by the court, a general plan is supposed to be comprehensive, in that it

18 addresses development and conservation issues to the full degree that they are present in the

19 jurisdiction. (Government Code, sec. 65301, subd. (c).) A General Plan may include area plans to
meet the specific needs of an area.

20 137. A general plan is intended to be "an integrated, internally consistent and compatible

21 statement of policies.' (Government Code, sec. 65300.5, [emphasis added].) As explained on
page

22 13 of the 2003 General Plan Guidelines, internal consistency means that "Each element's

23 data, analyses, goals, policies, and implementation programs must be consistent with and

24 complement one another." While consistency among elements means that, "All elements of a
general plan, whether mandatory or optional, must be consistent with one another." (See

25 Concerned Citizens of Calaveras County v. Board of Supervisors (1985) 166 Cal.App.3d 90.)

26 138. Many general plan elements are required to include specific and up to date information

27 helpful to the public and private sector in making development decisions. For example, the

28 circulation element must identify, not only the location of roads, but also the location of other

Petition for Writ of Mandate -38-

D

-

2 public utilities, as these are also essential for future development. (Government Code, sec. 65302,

3 subd. (b).) The conservation element "shall identify" rivers, creeks, streams, and riparian habitats.
(Government Code, sec. 65302. subd. (d)(3).)

A 139. The open-space element must include an action plan "consisting of specific programs

4o which the legislative body intends to pursue in implementing its open-space plan." (Government
Code, sec. 65564.) "If there is an agricultural land element, it must identify priority lands for

7 conservation, establish policies and objectives to support the long-term protection of agricultural

8 land, and establish implementation measures to achieve the policies and objectives. (Government
Code, sec. 65565, subds. (a)(1)(K), (a)(2), (a)(3), [emphasis added].)

9 140. The safety element addresses "the protection of the community from any

10 unreasonable risks associated with wildland and urban fires." "It shall also address

11 evacuation routes, military installations, peak load water supply requirements, and minimum road

12 widths and clearances around structures, as those items relate to identified fire and geologic

13 hazards." (Gov. Code, secs. 65302, subd. (g)(1), [emphasis added].) It must include a set of goals

14 policies and objectives for the protection of the community from the unreasonable risk of fire. It

15 must include implementation measures to avoid or minimize "wildfire hazards associated with

16 new land uses" These measures must locate new essential public facilities outside of high risk fire
areas, or identify measures to minimize fire damage to those facilities. These measures must

•17 design adequate infrastructure to provide safe access for emergency vehicles. (Gov. Code, secs.

18 65302, subd. (g)(3), [emphasis added].)

19 141, The safety element also shall identify information on flood hazards including, flood

20 hazard zones, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) maps, information from the

21 Army Corps of Engineers, dam failure inundation maps, Department of Water Resources (DWR)

22 floodplain maps, levee protection zones, historical data on flooding, and planned development
in flood zones. It must develop a "set of comprehensive goals policies and objectives" to protect

23 communities from the unreasonable risk of flooding. (Government Code, sec. 65302, subd. (g)(2),

24 [emphasis added].)

B) Standards for review

NO 0 AU 1) A general plans actual compliance with each substantive provision of the
Government Code is judged de novo as a matter of law.

142. Calaveras County has made its own contributions to the understanding of general plan
law. As the Court of Appeal explained in 1985:

8 In reviewing the plan before use, we have in mind that the adoption of a general plan is legislative act; the wisdom or merits of a plan are not proper subjects of judicial scrutiny

9 (Selby Realty Co. v. City of San Buenaventura (1973) 10 Cal.3d 110, 118, 109 Cal.Rptr. 799, 514 P.2d 111.)

10

11 Nonetheless, before 1982, California courts had recognized that general plans were not
immune from review by courts. The courts noted the Legislature had enacted statutes that

12 imposed mandatory duties on local agencies in connection with their adoption of
general plans, and, if a local agency violated such a statute, the courts acted to remedy the

13 violation of state law. Thus, in Camp v. Board of Supervisors (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 334 176 Cal.Rptr. 620, the court said: "Section 65302 enumerates the nine elements which

14 plan *shall include,' and describes the contents of each. The word 'shall' is to be construed

15 as mandatory in this context. (Gov.Code, §§ 5, 14.) The County must accordingly 'have general plan that encompasses all of the requirements of state law.' (Save El Toro Assn. V.

16 Days (1977) 74 Cal.App.3d 64, 72 [141 Cal.Rptr. 282].) If the plan adopted for it does not reflect substantial compliance with those requirements, the Board and other responsible

17 agencies of the County have failed in the 'performance of an act which the law specially enjoins.' [1] 'Substantial compliance, as the phrase is used in the decisions, means

18 actual compliance in respect to the substance essential to every reasonable objective

19 of the statute,' as distinguished from 'mere technical imperfections of form.'

20 (Concerned Citizens of Calaveras County v Board of Supervisors (1985) 166 Cal.App.3d 90, 95-
96, [emphasis added].)

21 143. The court in that case continued:

22 In 1982, the Legislature expressly authorized judicial review of general plans by adding

23 article 14 (commencing with § 65750) to chapter 3 1 of division 1 of title 7 of the

24 Government Code (hereafter article 14).2 (Stats.1982, ch. 27, § 2, pp. 47-51.) Article 14 generally sets forth procedures for bringing actions to challenge a general plan, provides

25 for certain limitations on remedies (not here pertinent), and places certain duties on cities
and counties whose plans are found not to comply substantially with law. (Ibid.)

26 Immediately relevant here is section 65751: "Any action to challenge a general plan or any element thereof on the grounds that such plan or element does not substantially

27 comply with the requirements of Article 5 (commencing with § 65300) shall be brought pursuant to section 1085 of the Code of Civil Procedure."

4 "We draw certain conclusions from the Legislature's enactment of article 14. The first is

5 that the Legislature unmistakably intends that general plans continue to be subject to judicial review for substantial compliance with state statutes. The second is that, by
requiring actions to be brought under section 1085 of the Code of Civil Procedure (§ 65751), the Legislature intended no change in the standard of review of general plans by the courts. Thus, before 1982, it was recognized that an action to challenge adoption of a

8 general plan was properly brought under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085. (Bownds V. City of Glendale (1980) 113 Cal.App.3d 875, 884, 170 Cal.Rptr. 342; Karlson v. City of

9 Camarillo (1980) 100 Cal.App.3d 789, 798, 161 Cal.Rptr. 260.) As this court recently acknowledged, the appropriate standard of review is whether the local adopting agency

10 has acted arbitrarily, capriciously, or without evidentiary basis. (Environmental Council v

11 Board of Supervisors (1982) 135 Cal.App.3d 428, 439-440, 185 Cal.Rptr. 363.) Because the question of substantial compliance is one of law, this court need not give deference

12 to the conclusion of the trial court. (Twain Harte Homeowners Assn. V. County of Tuolumne, supra, 138 Cal.App.3d at p. 674, 188 Cal.Rptr. 233.)"

13

14 (Concerned Citizens of Calaveras County v Board of Supervisors (1985) 166 Cal.App.3d 90, 96.)

15 .....145. The court in Garat v. City of Riverside came to same conclusions in 1991:
General plan adequacy is reviewable under traditional mandate principles. (§ 65751.) On

16 appeal, we conduct an independent review of the plan's adequacy; the question of

17 whether there has been substantial compliance with the laws related to general plans is one of law, and therefore the conclusion of the trial court is not entitled to any

18 deference. (Kings County Farm Bureau v. City of Hanford (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 692, 742, 270 Cal.Rptr. 650.)

19 (Garat v. City of Riverside (1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 259, 292.)

20

21 146. In 2004, the court in Federation Hillside and Canyon Association echoed the standard
that substantial compliance means actual compliance.

22 A general plan is legally adequate if it substantially complies with the requirements of

23 Government Code sections 65300 to 65307. (Gov.Code, § 65751.) "'Substantial
compliance means actual compliance in respect to the substance essential to every

24 reasonable objective of the statute,' as distinguished from *mere technical imperfections

25 of form.' [Citations.)" (Camp v. Board of Supervisors (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 334, 348,
176 Cal.Rptr. 620.) A petitioner may challenge a general plan on the ground that it

26 does not substantially comply with these statutory requirements by way of petition for
writ of mandate under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085. (Gov.Code, § 65751.)

N 2) A general plan is internally inconsistent when one part of an element

mv n contradicts another part of the same element.
147. As noted above,
[T]the general plan must be internally consistent. "Internal consistency requires that

0 • diagrams in the land use, circulation, open space, and natural resource elements reflect the written policies and programs of those elements. (Barclay & Gray, California Land Use & Planning Law (35th ed. 2016) p. 23.)

8 (Orange Citizens for Parks and Recreation v. Superior Court (2016) 2 Cal. 5th 141, 153.)

9

10 148. That court later noted that a general plan needs consistency and clarity to function:

11 A general plan and its specific plans have been described as a "yardstick"; one should be able to "take an individual parcel and check it against the plan and then know which uses

12 would be permissible." (Barclay & Gray, Curtin's California Land Use & Planning Law, supra, at p. 31.) "[P]ersons who seek to develop their land are entitled to know what the

13 applicable law is at the time they apply for a building permit. City officials must be able to

14 act pursuant to the law, and courts must be able to ascertain a law's validity and to enforce it." (Lesher, supra, 52 Cal.3d at p. 544, 277 Cal.Rptr. 1, 802 P.2d 317.)

15

16 (Orange Citizens for Parks and Recreation v. Superior Court (2016) 2 Cal. 5th 141, 159.)

17 149. Calaveras County made its own contribution to this case law:

18 "Section 65300.5 provides that "In construing the provisions of [article 5, on the scope of

19 general plans], the Legislature intends that the general plan and elements and parts thereof comprise an integrated, internally consistent and compatible statement of policies for

20 the adopting agency." This statute has been uniformly construed as promulgating a judicially reviewable requirement "that the elements of the general plan comprise an

21 integrated internally consistent and compatible statement of policies." (Sierra Club v.

22 Board of Supervisors (1981) 126 Cal.App.3d 698, 704, 179 Cal.Rptr. 261; see Environmental Council v. Board of Supervisors, supra, 135 Cal.App.3d at pp. 439-440,

23 185 Cal.Rptr. 363; Karlson v. City of Camarillo, supra, 100 Cal.App.3d at pp. 800-804, 161 Cal.Rptr. 260; Save El Toro Assn. v. Days (1977) 74 Cal.App.3d 64, 72, 141 Cal.Rptr. 282.)

97, [emphasis added].)
26

27 150. The court continued by noting that consistency must be interpreted in light of the
purposes of a general plan:

28

Petition for Writ of Mandate -42-

-

2 The requirements of internal integration and consistency in section 65300.5 must be read in light of the recognized purposes of a general plan. In Neighborhood Action Group v.

3 County of Calaveras (1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 1176 at page 1183, 203 Cal.Rptr. 401, we recently described those purposes as follows: "The general plan is atop the hierarchy of

4 local government law regulating land use. It has been aptly analogized to 'a constitution
for all future developments.' (See O'Loane v. O'Rourke (1965) 231 Cal.App.2d 774, 42

5 Cal.Rptr. 283.) The Legislature has endorsed this view in finding that 'decisions

6 involving the future growth of the state, most of which are made and will continue to be made at the local level, should be guided by an effective planning process,

7 including the local general plan, and should proceed within the framework of
officially approved statewide goals and policies directed to land use, population growth

co and distribution, development, open space, resource preservation and utilization, air and

O water quality, and other related physical, social and economic development factors.' (§
65030.1.)"

10

11 (Concerned Citizens of Calaveras County v. Board of Supervisors (1985) 166 Cal.App.3d 90, 97,
[emphasis added].)

12 151. That court concluded:

13 "If a general plan is to fulfill its function as a "constitution" guiding "an effective planning

14 process," a general plan must be reasonably consistent and integrated on its face. A document that, on its face, displays substantial contradictions and inconsistencies cannot

15 serve as an effective plan because those subject to the plan cannot tell what it says should happen or not happen. When a a court rules a facially inconsistent plan unlawful and

16 requires a local agency to adopt a consistent plan, the court is not evaluating the

17 merits of the plan; rather, the court is simply directing the local agency to state with
reasonable clarity what its plan is.

18

19 (Concerned Citizens of Calaveras County v. Board of Supervisors (1985) 166 Cal.App.3d 90, 97,
[emphasis added].)

20 152. This type of internal consistency in general plan legislation must be distinguished from

21 finding that a particular development proposal is consistent with a general plan, for the standards

22 applied by the court are different. As explained by the California Supreme Court in Orange

23 County Citizens for Parks and Recreation:

24 A city's determination that a development approval is consistent with its general plan has been described by some courts as "adjudicatory" ( San Franciscans Upholding the

25 Downtown Plan V. City & County of San Francisco (2002) 102 Cal.App.4th 656, 678, 125

26 Cal.Rptr.2d 745) and by others as "quasi-legislative" (Endangered Habitats League, Inc. V. County of Orange (2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 777, 782, 32 Cal.Rptr.3d 177). Where a

27 consistency determination involves the application of a general plan's established land use a designation to a particular development, it is fundamentally adjudicatory. In such

28 circumstances, a consistency determination is entitled to deference as an extension of a
planning agency's " "unique competence to interpret [its] policies when applying them in

Petition for Writ of Mandate -43-

D D

its adjudicatory capacity.' " (San Franciscans Upholding the Downtown Plan, at p. 678, 125 Cal.Rptr.2d 745.) Reviewing courts must defer to a procedurally proper consistency finding unless no reasonable person could have reached the same conclusion.

A (Orange Citizens for Parks and Recreation v. Superior Court (2016) 2 Cal. 5th 141,155.)

C) Zoning law, General Plan Law, and CEQA are integrated to facilitate both
orderly development and environmental protection.
153. California's planning, development, and environmental protections laws are intended to
co form an integrated system to so that both man and nature can exist in productive harmony. (See
Pub. Resources Code, sec. 21001, subd. (e); Banning Ranch Conservancy v. City of Newport
Beach, (2017) 2 Cal.5th 918.) Land use planning is a multi-stage process. At the top of this
10 pyramid is the General Plan. The purpose of a general plan is to facilitate orderly development.
11 Virtually all subordinate discretionary land use approvals must be consistent with a valid general
12 plan. (Neighborhood Action Group v. County of Calaveras (1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 1176, 1184.)
13 The general plan includes text and a map identifying the general land use designation for each

14 parcel of land in the County (residential, commercial, agriculture, industrial, forestry, etc.). These

15 land use designations indicate the potential for development of the property at some time during
the life of the general plan. Often this level of development is only possible when other future
16 events coincide such as the securing of water rights, the completion of infrastructure, the
17 acquisition of government grants, etc. At least, the plan provides policies that address housing,
18 circulation, resource conservation, open space preservation, safety, and noise. It may contain

19 other optional elements. (Gov. Code, secs. 65300, et seq.) A general plan may include special

20 policies for a selected part of the County in an area plan or community plan, to address unique

21 local needs. When a general plan addresses these issues, it may mitigate the impacts of new
development, and thereby facilitate subsequent project approvals.
22 154. Below the general plan on the hierarchy is a specific plan. This is a plan for new
23 development of a limited part of the county, like Saddle Creek. (Gov. Code, secs. 65450. et
24 seq.) It includes a plan to finance the extension of infrastructure to the area. These specific plans

25 are often built-out in phases over time.

26 155. Below the General Plan and the Specific Plan is zoning. (Gov. Code, secs. 65800, et seq.)

27 "In contrast to the long-term outlook of the general plan, zoning classifies the specific, immediate

28 uses of land." (Governor's Office of Planning and Research, 2017 General Plan Guidelines, p.

Petition for Writ of Mandate -44-

D

L

2 235.) Zoning identifies what the property can be used for today. Zoning can be controversial in

3 part because of this immediacy. This isn't about some possible land use that might happen after
number of conditions precedent, this is something that can happen right away. The categories on

4 the zoning map must be consistent with the land use designations on the general plan map. Thus.

5 it would usually not be correct to a rezone a parcel in a residential general plan designation into an

6 industrial zoning category. Once a parcel is identified a on a valid general plan, and is given

7 consistent zoning, a project proponent can develop a number of uses by right. Other uses

8 compatible with the zoning must be subject to discretionary approval by the County, and may
trigger environmental review.

9 156. Below zoning in the pyramid are the discretionary project approvals, such as

10 subdivision tentative maps, parcel maps, and use permits (Gov. Code, sec. 66473, et seq.). By

11 applying these integrated laws, a county can plan for needed infrastructure, provide for necessary

12 market-rate development, support below market-rate affordable housing, protect consumers and

13 the public from unsafe buildings, and avoid unnecessary harm to the environment.

14 CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORDS ACT

15

16 157. The California Public Records Act is nicely summarized in case law.

17 158. The California Supreme Court explained the reasoning behind the Public Records act a

18 couple of years ago:

19 Enacted in 1968, CPRA declares that "access to information concerning the conduct of

20 the people's business is a fundamental and necessary right of every person in this state." (§ 6250.) In 2004, voters made this principle part of our Constitution. A provision|

21 added by Proposition 59 states: "The people have the right of access to information concerning the conduct of the people's business, and, therefore, ... the writings of public

22 officials and agencies shall be open to public scrutiny." (Cal. Const., § art. I, § 3,subd. (b)(1).) Public access laws serve a crucial function. "Openness in government is

23 essential to the functioning of a democracy. 'Implicit in the democratic process is the

24 notion that government should be accountable for its actions. In order to verify accountability, individuals must have access to government files. Such access permits

25 checks against the arbitrary exercise of official power and secrecy in the political
process.' (International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, Local 21,

26 AFL-CIO v. Superior Court (2007) 42 Cal.4th 319, 328-329, 64 Cal.Rptr.3d 693, 165 P.38
488 (International Federation).)

27

28 (City of San Jose v. Superior Court (2017) 2 Cal.5th 608, 615, [emphasis added].)

Petition for Writ of Mandate -45-

D

159. The court continued by summarizing the basic rules of the Public Records Act:

2 "CPRA establishes a basic rule requiring disclosure of public records upon request. (§

3 6253.) In general, it creates "a presumptive right of access to any record created or maintained by a public agency that relates in any way to the business of the public

4 agency." (Sander v. State Bar of California (2013) 58 Cal.4th 300, 323, 165 Cal.Rptr.3d 250, 314 P.3d 488, italics added.) Every such record "must be disclosed unless a statutory
5 exception is shown.' (Ibid.) Section 6254 sets out a variety of exemptions, "many of which are designed to protect individual privacy." (International Federation, supra, 42
6 Cal.4th at p. 329, 64 Cal.Rptr.3d 693, 165 P.3d 488.) The Act also includes a catchall

7 provision exempting disclosure if "the public interest served by not disclosing the record
clearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure." (§ 6255, subd. (a).)"

8

9 (City of San Jose v. Superior v. Court (2017) 2 Cal.5th 608, 616.)
160. The court defined the term public record:
10 We begin with the term "public record," which CPRA defines to include "any writing
11 containing information relating to the conduct of the public's business prepared, owned, used, or retained by any state or local agency regardless of physical form or
12 characteristics.' (§ 6252, subd. (e); hereafter "public records" definition.) Under this

13 definition, a public record has four aspects. It is (1) a writing, (2) with content relating to
the conduct of the public's business, which is (3) prepared by, or (4) owned, used, or
14 retained by any state or local agency

15 (City of San Jose v. Superior Court (2017) 2 Cal.5th 608, 617.)

16 161. The court then explained that public records include those in the constructive possession

17 of a government entity:
Appellate courts have generally concluded records related to public business are subject to
18 disclosure if they are in an agency's actual or constructive possession. (See, e.g., Board

19 of Pilot Comrs. for the Bays of San Francisco, San Pablo and Suisun v. Superior Court
(2013) 218 Cal.App.4th 577, 598, 160 Cal.Rptr.3d 285; Consolidated Irrigation Dist. V.
20 Superior Court (2012) 205 Cal.App.4th 697, 710, 140 Cal.Rptr.3d 622 (Consolidated Irrigation).) "[A]n agency has constructive possession of records if it has the right to
21 control the records, either directly or through another person." (Consolidated Irrigation,
at p. 710, 140 Cal.Rptr.3d 622.)
22

23 (City of San Jose v. Superior V. Court (2017) 2 Cal.5th 608, 623.)

24 162. In Humane Society of the United State, the Third District Court of Appeal explained the

25 public interest balancing test:

26 Where the public interest in disclosure of the records is not outweighed by the public
interest in nondisclosure, courts will direct the government to disclose the requested
27 information. (See CBS, supra, 42 Cal.3d at pp. 656-657, 230 Cal.Rptr. 362, 725 P.2d

28 470] [names, home addresses and applications of persons who obtained concealed weapons permits must be disclosed]; New York Times Co. v. Superior Court (1990) 218

D

- Cal.App.3d 1579, 1585-1586, 268 Cal.Rptr. 21 [disclosure of names and addresses of

2 excessive water users ordered]...) [1] Conversely, courts have upheld the government's

3 refusal to release public records when the public interest in nondisclosure clearly outweighed the public interest in disclosure. (Times Mirror Co. V. Superior Court (1991)

4 53 Cal.3d 1325, at pp. 1345-1346, 283 Cal.Rptr. 893, 813 P.2d 240 [governor's
appointment schedules and calendars properly withheld to protect public interest in

5 decisionmaking process and governor's security]; Wilsonv. Superior Court (1996) 51

6 Cal.App.4th 1136, at p. 1141, 59 Cal.Rptr.2d 537 [no disclosure of applications for appointment to county board of supervisors due to chilling effect on applications and

7 negative impact on decisionmaking process].)" (City of San Jose, supra, 74 Cal.App.4th at pp.1018-1019, 88 Cal.Rptr.2d 552.)

8

9 (Humane Society of the United States v. Superior Court (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 1233, 1255,
[emphasis added].)
10 163. The court also noted that the burden of proof that the exception to disclosure applies falls

11 on the government entity seeking to withhold the public record:

12 The burden of proof as to the application of an exemption is on the proponent of

13 nondisclosure, who must demonstrate "that on the facts of the particular case the public interest served by not disclosing the record clearly outweighs the public interest served by

14 disclosure of the record." (§ 6255, italics added.) In other words, the proponent of nondisclosure must establish "clear overbalance" on the side of nondisclosure.

15 (Michaelis, Montanari & Johnson v. Superior Court (2006) 38 Cal.4th 1065, 1071, 44

16 Cal.Rptr.3d 663, 136 P.3d 194; City of San Jose, supra, 74 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1018-1019. 88 Cal.Rptr.2d 552.)

17 (Humane Society of U.S. v. Superior Court (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 1233, 1255 [emphasis
added].)
18 164. The court went on to explain how to weigh the public interest:

19 "Openness in government is essential to the functioning of a democracy." (International

20 Federation, supra, 42 Cal.4th at p. 328, 64 Cal.Rptr.3d 693, 165 P.3d 488.) Accordingly, the CPRA provides a presumption of openness "[t]he records at issue are

21 presumptively open because they contain 'information relating to the conduct of the

22 public's business.' " (Id. at pp. 336-337, 64 Cal.Rptr.3d 693, 165 P.3d 488.) This court has previously discussed how to weigh that general public interest in the balance. " 'If the

23 records sought pertain to the conduct of the people's business there is a public interest in disclosure. The weight of that interest is proportionate to the gravity of the

24 governmental tasks sought to be illuminated and the directness with which the

25 disclosure will serve to illuminate.' (Citizens for a Better Environment v. Department of Food & Agriculture (1985) 171 Cal.App.3d 704, 715, 217 Cal.Rptr. 504 (Citizens for a

26 Better Environment), italics added.) The existence and weight of this public interest are conclusions derived from the nature of the information.' (Connell v. Superior Court

27 (1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 601, 616, 65 Cal.Rptr.2d 738 (Connell); accord, County of Santa
Clara, supra, 170 Cal.App.4th at p. 1324, 89 Cal.Rptr.3d 374.)

(Humane Society of the United States v. Superior Court (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 1233, 1267-1268,
2 [emphasis added].)
165. Finally, the court explained the responsibility of the government to provide public records
after redacting privileged parts:

5 Section 6253, subdivision (a), provides, Any reasonably segregable portion of a record shall be available for inspection by any person requesting the record after
6 deletion of the portions that are exempted by law." As a general principle, " "where nonexempt materials are not inextricably intertwined with exempt materials and are
7 otherwise reasonably segregable therefrom, segregation is required to serve the objective of the [CPRA] to make public records available for public inspection and copying unless a 8 particular statute makes them exempt.' The burden of segregating exempt from nonexempt materials, however, remains one of the considerations which the court can take into account in determining whether the public interest favors disclosure under section
10 6255." (ACLU, supra, 32 Cal.3d at p. 453, fn. 13, 186 Cal.Rptr. 235, 651 P.2d 822.)

11 (Humane Society of United .States. v. Superior Court (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 1233, 1274,
12 [emphasis added].)
13 166. Government Code. Section 6259, subdivision (b), explains the procedures for concluding
14 a public records act case:

15 If the court finds that the public official's decision to refuse disclosure is not justified under Section 6254 or 6255, he or she shall order the public official to make the
16 record public. If the judge determines that the public official was justified in refusing to make the record public, he or she shall return the item to the public official without
17 disclosing its content with an order supporting the decision refusing disclosure.

20 CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT

21

22 167. This case is brought in part pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act
("CEQA").
23

24 1) CEQA protects both the environment and informed self-government.
25 168. Like the California Public Records Act passed shortly before it, CEQA a has a strong
26 public disclosure component. As the Third District Court of Appeal explained:

27 "[t]he purpose of CEQA is to protect and maintain California's environmental quality.

28 With certain exceptions, CEQA requires public agencies to prepare an EIR for any project

Petition for Writ of Mandate -48-

pd they intend to carry out or approve whenever it can be fairly argued on the basis of
2 substantial evidence that the project may have a significant environmental effect . .. ."

3 (Communities for a Better Environment, supra, 103 Cal.App.4th at pp. 106-107, fns.

4 omitted.) The California Supreme Court has "repeatedly recognized that the EIR is the

5 'heart of CEQA.' [Citations.] 'Its purpose is to inform the public and its responsible
officials of the environmental consequences of their decisions before they are made.
6 Thus, the EIR 'protects not only the environment but also informed self-government.'
7 (Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. v. Regents of University of California (1993) 6
8 Cal.4th 1112, 1123, original italics.)"

O (Center for Sierra Nevada Conservation v. County of El Dorado (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1156,

10 1169. [emphasis added])

11 2) An EIR is prepared after an Initial Study concludes that a discretionary project 12 may have significant impacts on the environment.
13 169. CEQA defines a "significant effect" as a "substantial, or potentially substantial, adverse
14 change." (Pub. Res. Code, § 21068.) This means that an activity has a significant effect if it "has a
15 the potential to degrade the quality of the environment." (See also 14 Cal. Code Reg. § 15382;

16 Azusa Land Reclamation Company, Inc. v. Main San Gabriel Basin Watermaster (1997) 52 Cal.

17 App. 4th 1165, 1192.) The CEQA Guidelines require a mandatory finding of significance for a
project with "possible environmental effects which are individually limited but cumulatively 18 considerable." "Cumulatively considerable" means that the incremental effects of an individual
19 project are considerable when viewed in connection with the effects of past projects, the effects of
20 other current projects, and the effects of probable future projects." (14 Cal. Code Reg. § 15065(c);
21 Communities For a Better Environment v. California Resources Agency (2002) 103 Cal. App. 4th
22 98, 114; Kings County Farm Bureau v. City of Hanford (1990) 221 Cal. App.3d 692, 720-721.

23 42.) CEQA applies to discretionary activities undertaken by a public agency. Pub. Res. Code con

24 21080. CEQA requires environmental review when a project has the potential for significant
impacts. (Pub. Res. Code § 21151; 14 Cal. Code Reg. § 15061. See Mountain Lion Foundation
25 Fish & Game Commission (1997) 16 Cal. 4th 105, 119 ["[T]he Legislature intended CEQA to
26 apply to discretionary projects, even when the agency's discretion to fully comply with CEQA is
27 constrained by the substantive laws governing its actions"]; Friends of Westwood, Inc. V. City of

28 Los Angeles (1987) 191 Cal. App.3d 259, 267.) The County is subject to CEQA as a local agency

with permit authority over development activities. (Pub. Res. Code § 21151.)

0 au A0 170. The term "CEQA Guidelines" is really a misnomer, for they are formally adopted state
regulations. (14 Cal.Code Reg., sec. 15000, ff.) As a result, the Courts give great weight to the
CEQA Guidelines, except when a provision is clearly unauthorized by the CEQA statute, or is
clearly an erroneous interpretation of the CEQA statute. (Concerned McCloud Citizens v.
McCloud Community Services District (App. 3 Dist. 2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 181.)
171. As part of CEQA review, the agency undertakes an "Initial Study" of the project. (14 Call
Code Reg. § 15063.) If such Study demonstrates that the project will not have a significant effect

on

9 the environment, the agency makes a "negative declaration" to that effect. (Pub. Res. Code §

10 21080(c.).) If the "Initial Study" determines that the project may have a significant effect on the

11 environment, an Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") is required. (Pub. Res. Code § 21151.
Santa Monica Chamber of Commerce , supra, 101 Cal. App. 4th at 792.)

12 172. CEQA'S fundamental policy is that all public agencies "shall regulate such activities so

13 that major consideration is given to preventing environmental damage."(Laurel Heights

14 Improvement Assn. v. Regents of University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 390; Pub. Res.

15 Code § 21000(g.).) The "primary means" by which the legislative goals of CEQA are achieved is

16 the preparation of an EIR. (Laurel Heights, supra, 47 Cal.3d at 392; Pub. Res. Code §§21080(d),
21100, 21151; 14 Cal. Code Reg. §15080.) The EIR has been described as "an environmental

17 'alarm bell' whose purpose is to alert the public and its responsible officials to environmental

18 changes before they have reached ecological points of no return." (Laurel Heights, supra, 47

19 Cal.3d at 392; County of Inyo v. Yorty (1973) 32 Cal. App.3d 795, 810.) An EIR is intended to

20 serve as "an environmental full disclosure statement." (Rural Land Owners Assn. V. City Council
of Lodi (1983) 143 Cal. App.3d 1013, 1020.)

21

22

23 3) The Final EIR evaluates impacts, considers project alternatives, proposes
mitigation measures, and responds to comments on the Draft EIR.

24

25 173. A notice of preparation announces that an EIR will be prepared. (CEQA Guidelines, sec.

26 15082.) By participating in "scoping,' expert agencies and the public can provide early input

27 regarding their suggestions for impact analyses, mitigation measures, and alternatives. (CEQA

28 Guidelines, sec. 15083.) Next, the lead agency prepares a Draft EIR (DEIR), often with the
assistance of consultants. Among other things, the DEIR contains: description of the

Petition for Writ of Mandate -50-

NOüA0 N environmental setting, an analysis of potentially significant impacts, mitigation measures for
significant impacts, an evaluation of alternatives, and an assessment of cumulative impacts.
(CEQA Guidelines, secs. 15125 to 15130.)
174. The agency circulates the DEIR for additional input from outside agency expert and
public comments. (CEQA Guidelines, sec. 15087.) The final EIR contains the agency's
responses to these comments. These agency must respond to each "substantial" environmental
comment. The response must be in writing, and at the same level of detail as the comment.

g When rejecting a proposal in a comment, the agency must explain why based upon substantial

9 evidence. (CEQA Guidelines, sec. 15088.) This iterative process of comment and response

10 provides the agency with the opportunity to correct analytical flaws and to reduce the impacts of
projects, so that the EIR can meet the legal standard of "a good faith effort at full disclosure."

11 (CEQA Guidelines, sec. 15151.)

12 175. CEQA is designed to inform decision makers and the public about the potential,

13 significant environmental effects of a project. (CEQA Guidelines § 15002(a)(1).) In addition, an

14 EIR must identify mitigation measures and alternatives to the project which may reduce or avoid

15 the project's significant adverse impacts, thus accomplishing CEQA's basic statutory goals. (See

16 Laurel Heights, supra, 47 Cal.3d at 400-403; Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Board of Supervisors
(1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 564; Pub. Res. Code §§ 21002.1, 21100.)

17

18 4) Mitigation measure proposals need to be evaluated in a Program EIR.

19 176. A program EIR is completed for a large scale planning approval like a general plan. a

20 (CEQA Guidelines, sec. 15168) Site specific analysis is often not available at the time a program

21 EIR is completed. However, this does not prevent adequate identification of significant effects of

22 the largescale planning approval at hand. (14 Cal. Code Reg. § 15152(c.).) This does not excuse
the lead agency from adequately analyzing reasonably foreseeable significant environmental

23 effects of the project and does not justify deferring such analysis to a later tier EIR or negative

24 declaration. 14 Cal. Code Reg. § 15152(b).

25 177. When approving projects that are general in nature (e.g. general plan amendment),

26 agencies must develop and approve whatever general mitigation measures are feasible. (Citizens

27 for Quality Growth v. City of Mount Shasta (3 Dist. 1988) 198 Cal.App.3d 433, 442.) The

28 mitigation measures must be incorporated into the plan. (Sierra Club V. City of San Diego (2014)
231 Cal.App.4th 1152, 1173.) When a program EIR identifies significant impacts on drainage,

Petition for Writ of Mandate -51-

- water supply, traffic, wastewater management, and/or fire protection, certification without
2 adoption of the feasible mitigation measures is an abuse of discretion under CEQA. (City of

3 Marina v. Board of Trustees (2006) 39 Cal.4th 341.)

5) Adopted mitigation measures must be a mandatory commitment of the agency.
178. CEQA requires that mitigation measures be enforceable commitments to reduce or avoid
n significant environmental impacts. (Neighbors for Smart Rail v. Exposition Metro Line
Construction Authority (2013) 57 Cal.4th 439, 445; CEQA Guidelines, sec. 15126.4, subd. (a)(2).) co a "The purpose of these requirements is to ensure that feasible mitigation measures will actually be
implemented as a condition of development, and not merely adopted and then neglected or
10 disregarded." (Federation of Hillside & Canyon Associations v. City of Los Angeles (2000) 83

11 Cal.App.4th 1252, 1260-1261.)
179. When an agency adopts a plan that includes planned future development, it must actually 12 mitigate the impacts that can be anticipated at that time, regardless of future tiers of review.
13 (Koster v. County of San Joaquin (1996) 47 Cal. App. 4th 29, 39-40.) It is not adequate mitigation
14 to simply promise to meet some goal in the future, without any criteria for how this will occur.
15 (See e.g., [Vineyard Citizens]; Gray v. County of Madera (2008) 167 Cal. App. 4th 1099, 1118

16 ["[W]e conclude that here the County has not committed itself to a specific performance standard.

17 Instead, the County has committed itself to a specific mitigation goal. '].); King County Farm
Bureau v. City of Hanford (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 692, 728 [It is a fatal flaw to rely on a 18 "mitigation agreement" when the EIR presented no evidence that it was feasible].).
19 An agency must commit to implement a mitigation measure using mandatory language.
20 Otherwise, it does not qualify as a mitigation measure. (CEQA Guidelines, sec. 15126.4, subd.
21 (a)(2); California Clean Energy Committee v. City of Woodland (2014) 225 Cal. App.4th 173,

22 199.)

23
6) Under specified limited circumstances an exception allows mitigation measures to 24 be deferred.
25 180. There is an exception to the requirement to adopt specific mitigation measures at the time
26 of project approval. In some instances, it will not be possible to select the specific mitigation
27 measures from a suite of potentially feasible measures until a later phase of project development.
28

Petition for Writ of Mandate -52-

H

2 This often the case when the EIR is for a general plan or specific plan, and there are insufficient
details available on the construction projects that will follow.

3 181. This exception is limited, and burdened by many requirements, because, as the court

4 explained:
Numerous cases illustrate that reliance on tentative plans for future mitigation after

6 completion of the CEQA process significantly undermines CEQA's goals of full

7 disclosure and informed decision making; and consequently, these mitigation plans have

8 been overturned on judicial review as constituting improper deferral of environmental

9 {Slip Opn. Page 23} assessment. (See, e.g., Gentry v. Murrieta (1995) 36 Cal.App.4th
1359 , 1396 ( Gentry ) [conditioning a permit on "recommendations of a report that had

10 yet to be performed" constituted improper deferral of mitigation]; Defend the Bay v. City

11 of Irvine (2004) 119 Cal.App.4th 1261, 1275 [deferral is impermissible when the agency

12 "simply requires a project applicant to obtain a biological report and then comply with any

13 recommendations that may be made in the report"]; Endangered Habitats League, Inc. v.

14 County of Orange (2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 777 , 794 ["mitigation measure [that] does no

15 more than require a report be prepared and followed,.. without setting any standards"
found improper deferral]; Sundstrom , supra , 202 Cal.App.3d at p. 306 [future study of

16 hydrology and sewer disposal problems held impermissible]; Quail Botanical Gardens

17 Foundation, Inc. V. City of Encinitas (1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 1597, 1605, fn. 4 [city is

18 prohibited from relying on "post approval mitigation measures adopted during the

19 subsequent design review process"].)

20 (Communities for a Better Environment v. City of Richmond (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 70, 92-93.)

21 182. Thus, before deferral is permitted, the agency must demonstrate that there is an actual

22 need to defer specifying the mitigation measure. (San Joaquin Raptor Rescue Center v. County
of Merced (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 645, 670-671 [Mitigation deferral is improper unless there is a

23 reason for the deferral].) Deferral may be permissible if the agency displays a commitment to

24 mitigating the impacts, lists a menu of feasible mitigation measures, and identifies performance

25 criteria that the measures must satisfy. (Sacramento Old City Association v. City Council of

26 Sacramento (3d Dist. 1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 1011, 1028-1029.) An agency may not defer

27 adopting specific mitigation measures by adopting merely a "mitigation goal" without specific

28 a performance criteria and a menu of feasible mitigation measures. Similarly, merely committing
to study an impact or the feasibility of its mitigation in the future is not sufficient. (See Gray v.

Petition for Writ of Mandate -53-

D

- County of Madera (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1099, 1118-1119; California Clean Energy Committee
~ V. City of Woodland (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 173, 197-199 [ A promise to prepare a fair share plan
ün AW in the future, without any commitment to mitigate the impact is an inadequate mitigation measure
under CEQA.) Mitigation measures are improperly deferred when there is no commitment to a
specific performance criteria, and the mitigation is not in place at the time of project

o implementation. (Cleveland National Forest Foundation v. San Diego Association of
Governments (2017) 17 Cal.App.5th 413, 443 [Lead agency cannot defer mitigation without
7 committing to meet performance standards]; POET v. California Air Resources Board (2013) 218

8 Cal.App.4th 681.)

9

10 7) To inform decisionmakers and the public, an EIR must evaluate a reasonable

11 range of potentially feasible alternatives to the project that have the potential to
reduce impacts
12 183. An alternatives analysis is supposed to look at a broad range of alternatives to reduce
13 project impacts and to inform decision makers and the public. This is especially true when it is in
14 a Program EIR like the one in question. (CEQA Guidelines, secs. 15126.6, 15168.) "[T]he

15 discussion of alternatives shall focus on alternatives to the project or the location which are

16 capable of avoiding or substantially lessening any significant effects of the project, even if those

17 alternatives impede to some degree the attainment of project objectives, or would be more

18 costly." (CEQA Guidelines, sec. 15126.6, subd. (b)(1).) There needs to be sufficient information
about the alternative to allow the deccisionmakers to make a rational choice. (Save Round Valley
19 Alliance v. County of Inyo (2007) 157 Cal.App.4th 1437 [A decision to approve an alternative

20 analysis based upon the "barest of facts" and "vague and unsupported" conclusions" precluded

21 informed decisionmaking and public participation and was therefore an abuse of discretion.].)

22 184. An EIR should "identify any alternatives that were considered by the lead agency but

23 were rejected as infeasible during the scoping process and briefly explain the reasons underlying
the lead agency's determination." (CEQA Guidelines, sec. 15126.6, subd. (c); Save Round Valley
24 Alliance l County of Inyo (2007) 157 Cal.App.4th 1437 [A lead agency must explain why a
25 suggested alternative is rejected as either unable to be accomplished, not satisfying the goals of
26 the project, or not advantages to the environment.]; California Clean Energy Committee v. City of
27 Woodland (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 173, 205-206 [In rejecting an alternative an agency must

28 disclose the analytic route it traveled from substantial evidence to action].)

Petition for Writ of Mandate -54-

üA w 185. These analyses of feasible mitigation measures and of a reasonable range of alternatives
are crucial to CEQA's substantive mandate that significant environmental damage be
substantially lessened or avoided where feasible. (Pub. Res. Code §§ 21002, 21081, 21100;
CEQA Guidelines, 14 Cal. Code Reg. §15002(a)(2) and (3). Laurel Heights, supra, 47 Cal.3d at

6 392, 404-405.) Ultimately, CEQA requires agencies to adopt feasible mitigation measures in

7 order to substantially lessen or avoid otherwise significant environmental effects. (Pub. Resources

8 Code, secs. 21002, 21081, subd. (a); CEQA Guidelines, secs. 15002, subd. (a)(3), 15021, subd.
(a)(2), 15091, subd. (a)(1).)

9

: 5 8) Written responses to comments Responses to comments must meet standards.

11 186. CEQA has clear requirements for responding to comments on a DEIR. (CEQA

12 Guidelines, sec. 15088.) "The lead agency shall respond to comments raising significant

13 environmental issues received.." "The written response shall describe the disposition of

14 significant environmental issues raised." "[W]hen the lead agency's position is at variance with
recommendations and objections raised in the comments" the response "must be addressed in

15 detail giving reasons why specific comments and suggestions were not accepted. (Ibid.

16 [emphasis added]; see also Banning Ranch Conservancy V. City of Newport Beach (2017) 2

17 Cal.5th 918.) When provided with examples of mitigation measures implemented elsewhere, an

18 agency must either implement them or explain why not. (Sierra Club v. County of San Diego

19 (2014) 231 Cal.App.4th 1152, 1173.) "There must be good faith, reasoned analysis in

20 response. Conclusory statements unsupported by factual information will not suffice." The

21 level of detail contained in the response, however, may correspond to the level of detail provided
in the comment. "The response to comments may take the form of a revision to the draft EIR or

22 a may be a separate section in the final EIR." (CEQA Guidelines, sec. 15088.)

23 187. From its earliest days to the present, over four decades of CEQA case law has noted the

24 importance placed on adequate responses to comments. Where comments cause concern that the

25 agency may not have fully evaluated the project and its alternatives, these comments may not

26 simply be ignored. "There must be good faith, reasoned analysis in response." (People v.
County of Kern (1974) 39 Cal.App.3d 830, 841-842.)

27 a .....188. CDF's response to a comment regarding the efficacy of a mitigation measure was

28 it inadequate where it contained no analysis of the issues, contained no specific information
justifying the rejection of the concern, and referenced a report that was unavailable.

Petition for Writ of Mandate -55-

D
(Environmental Protection Information Center, Inc. v. Johnson (1985) 170 Cal.App.3d 604.) "In
n keeping with the statute and guidelines, an adequate EIR must respond to specific suggestions for
O0 A w mitigating a significant environmental impact unless the suggested mitigation is facially
infeasible. (San Francisco Ecology Center v. City and County of San Francisco (1975) 48
Cal.App.3d 584, 596 [122 Cal.Rptr. 100]; Concerned Citizens of South Central L.A. v. Los
Angeles Unified School Dist., supra, 24 Cal.App.4th at pp. 841-842.) While the response need not
be exhaustive, it should evince it good faith and a reasoned analysis. (San Francisco Ecology
7 Center, supra, 48 Cal.App.3d at p. 596; Guidelines, § 15088, subd. (b).)" (Los Angeles Unified
8 School Dist. V. City of Los Angeles (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1019, 1029.)
9 189. Ignoring non-duplicative public comments is prejudicial error. (Environmental Protection
10 and Information Center v. California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (2008) 44

11 Cal.App.4th 459.) An inadequate response to even one substantive comment can be enough to

12 justify a writ of mandate remanding the decision to the lead agency. (Gallegos v. California State
Board of Forestry (1978) 76 Cal.App.3d 945, 952-955.) 13

14 9) Project approvals may include a findings of fact rejecting infeasible mitigation
15 measures and alternatives, and a statement of overriding considerations.

16 190. To reject as infeasible a measure to mitigate a significant impact, a lead agency must have
a
17 valid finding that the proposed mitigation measure is infeasible. The agency must show that

18 there is some economic, environmental, legal, social, or technological barrier that makes
implementing these measures impossible. (CEQA Guidelines, sec. 15364.) It is an abuse of 19 discretion to reject alternatives or mitigation measures that would reduce adverse impacts without
20 supporting substantial evidence. (Sierra Club v. County of San Diego (2014) 231 Cal.App.4th
21 1152, 1175-1176.)

22 191. To reject additional mitigation measures, a lead agency may claim that the other

23 mitigation measures adopted will be sufficient to reduce the impact to a level of insignificance.

24 However, a lead agency must have substantial evidence that mitigation is feasible and will be
effective. (Gray v. County of Madera (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1099, 1116-1118.) "A clearly 25 inadequate study is entitled to no judicial deference." (Laurel Heights Improvement Association
26 of San Francisco v. Regents of the University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 422 &409 fn.
27 12.)

28

NOD AW 192. If choosing among multiple measures that will be more than sufficient to reduce an
impact to a level of insignificance, then an agency can exercise its preference in choosing which
measures to adopt.
193. Finally, where an agency finds that significant adverse effects remain, even after the
implementation of all feasible mitigation measures, the agency must balance the economic
benefits of the project against its environmental harm to determine if the project should proceed.
(14 Cal. Code Reg. § 898.1(g); Pub. Res. Code § 21081(d), 14 Cal. Code Reg. § 15093.) This

o "statement of overriding considerations," as the last step in the analysis, provides critical
information to the public to fulfill the law's public disclosure requirement - that the EIR function

10 as "a document of accountability" and "informed self-government." (Sierra Club v. State Board of

11 Forestry, supra, 7 Cal.4th at 1229 [The board retains the power to approve a plan that has

12 significant adverse effects upon the environment, so long as it justifies its action in light of

13 "specific economic, social, or other conditions.") Thus, "The EIR process protects not only the

14 environment but also informed self-government." (Laurel Heights, supra, 47 Cal.3d at 392.)

15 10) Two standards of review apply in CEQA cases.

16 194. Pursuant to Public Resources Code §21168, a writ of mandate may issue where the

17 agency has committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion. Abuse of discretion is established if the

18 agency has not proceeded in the manner required by law OR if the agency's decision is not
supported by substantial evidence.

19

20 195. Therefore, as the California Supreme Court has explained, there are two standards that
apply to the review of CEQA decision.

21

22 While judicial review of CEQA decisions extends only to whether there was a prejudicial abuse of discretion, "an agency may abuse its discretion under CEQA either by failing to

23 proceed in the manner CEQA provides or by reaching factual conclusions unsupported by substantial evidence. (§ 21168.5.) Judicial review of these two types of error differs significantly: while we determine de novo whether the

24 agency has employed the correct procedures, 'scrupulously enforc[ing] all legislatively mandated CEQA

25 requirements' (Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Board of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553,

26 564), we accord greater deference to the agency's substantive factual conclusions."

27 (Vineyard Area Citizens for Responsible Growth, Inc. v. City of Rancho Cordova, supra, 40
Cal.4th at p. 435; See also Mount Shasta Bioregional Ecology Center (2012) 210 Cal.App.4th
181, 194-196.)

28

Petition for Writ of Mandate -57-

- 196. When an

2 agency fails to include information in an EIR, it has made a procedural mistake,

3 and the issue is decided de novo as a matter of law. Such allegations in this case include illegal
reliance on optional measures as mitigation, illegal deferral of mitigation, failure to evaluate

4 mitigation measures in the body of the EIR. failure to adopt an adequate mitigation monitoring

5 plan, failure to describe feasible alternatives, failure to evaluate a reasonable range of alternatives,

6 and inadequate responses to comments on the DEIR..

7 197. When an agency fails to make an adequate finding of fact, the issue is decided using the

8 substantial evidence test. Such allegations in this case include inadequate findings rejecting
mitigation measures.

9

10 11) Both an informationally inadequate EIR and inadequate findings may be

11 prejudicial.

12 198. To justify a writ of mandate, an error in complying with CEQA must be prejudicial rather
than harmless.
13

14

15 199. If the alleged violation is that the agency failed to proceed in accordance with the law by
producing an EIR that is informationally inadequate, then prejudice exists when the public or

16 decisionmakers have been deprived of substantial relevant information about the project's likely

17 significant effects. (Neighbors for Smart Rail v. Exposition Metro Line Construction Authority

18 (2013) 57 Cal4th 439.) However, if an information error made is irrelevant to the analysis, or

19 does not result in an inaccurate assessment of potential impacts, then the error is not prejudicial.

20 200. If an agency fails to reveal the logical route taken from substantial evidence in the record

21 to the agency's ultimate decision and action, then prejudice exists when the decision or action

22 threatens harm to the natural or human environment, or the decision or action vitiates the validity
or integrity of the approval.

23 201. The guiding principle in the review of projects under CEQA is that CEQA must be

24 interpreted so as to afford the fullest possible protection to the environment. (Laurel Heights,

25 supra, 47 Cal.3d at 390; Friends of Mammoth v. Board of Supervisors (1972) 8 Cal.3d 247, 259.)

26 EIRs demonstrate to an apprehensive citizenry that the agency has analyzed and considered the

27 ecological implications of its action. (Sierra Club, supra; No Oil, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles
(1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 86; EPIC v. Johnson, supra, 170 Cal. App.3d at 609-11.)

a u p 202. The Petitioner re-alleges the facts set forth in paragraphs 1 - 201 of this petition.

7 A) THE GENERAL PLAN UPDATE FAILS TO INCLUDE PARTS AND

8 INFORMATION REQUIRED BY THE GOVERNMENT CODE. (Government

9 Code, secs. 65300.5, 65301, 65302, 65565,)

10 203. A general plan is not in conformity with the law unless it is in substantial compliance

11 with the requirements of the Government Code. To be in substantial compliance, it must be in

12 actual compliance in respect to the substance essential to every reasonable objective of the statute,

13 as distinguished from technical or form imperfections. (Federation of Hillside and Canyon Assn.
V. City of Los Angeles (2004) 126 Cal.App.4th 1180.)

14

15 1) THE GENERAL PLAN RESOURCE PRODUCTION ELEMENT FAILS
TO INCLUDE PARTS AND INFORMATION REQUIRED BY

16 GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION 65565.

17

18 201. If there is an agricultural land component in the general plan, it must identify "All parcels

19 subject to a conservation easement", "The total acreage of agricultural land that is located within

20 two miles of land zoned for housing, including rural residential uses, business, or industry in the

21 land use element," "priority lands for conservation," and "objectives ... to support the long-term

22 protection of agricultural land", (Government Code, sec. 65565, subds. (a)(1)(B), (a)(1)(G),

23 (a)(1)(K), (a)(2), (a)(3), [emphasis added].) "An objective is a specified end, condition, or state
that is an intermediate step toward attaining a goal. It should be achievable and, when possible,

24 measurable and time-specific." (OPR, General Plan Guidelines 2017, p. 392, [emphasis

25 added].) A proper inventory of open space lands is an essential component of a complete general

26 plan. (Save El Toro Association v. Days (1977) 74 Cal.App.3d 64.)

27 202. These requirements are an essential part of achieving the reasonable objective of general

28 plan law. The law seeks to preserve open space land, "not only for the maintenance of the
economy of the state, but also for the assurance of the continued availability of land for the

Petition for Writ of Mandate -59-

D

w t production of food and fiber, for the enjoyment of scenic beauty, for recreation and for the use of

un E natural resources. Toward that end, since 1970 the law has demanded that, "cities, counties, and
the state at the earliest possible date make definite plans for the preservation of valuable open-
space land and take positive action to carry out such plans." (Government Code, sec. 65561.)
Open space land "is a limited and valuable resource that must be conserved whenever possible."
(Government Code, sec. 65562.)

O 00 203. The General Plan Update includes an agricultural land component in its Resource
Production Element. The Resource Production Element does not identify all parcels subject to

10 conservation easements, despite the efforts of CPC members to provide some of this information,

11 The Resource Production Element does not identify the total acreage of agricultural land within

12 two miles of land zoned for housing, business, or industry in the land use element, despite the fact

13 that the County has a map that depicts this. The Resource Production Element does not establish

14 objectives for the long-term protection of agricultural land. Therefore, the Respondent's General
Plan Update is not in compliance with Government Code, Section 65565.

15 204. On May 29, 2013, CPC member Muriel Zeller asked the County to include a map of

16 existing conservation easements in the General Plan Update. Such a map was a generated by the

17 County in 2015. On January 12, 2016, CPC member Muriel Zeller emailed Planning Director
Maurer to encourage him to make some corrections to the

18 map. In a memo on March 20, 2019,
the CPC recommended that this sort of material be included in the General Plan Update as

19 required. That memo went to the Planning Commission, and to the Board of Supervisors, and to

20 their advisors in the Planning Department and in the Office of County Counsel. The Planning

21 Commission did not follow that recommendation to correct the error during its general plan

22 hearings from May through June of 2019. In a memo on July 29, 2019, the CPC again

23 recommended that the Board of Supervisors include this information in the General Plan Update.

information

24 The CPC even provided copies of available County maps that could be used to bridge some of the

25 gaps. During their hearings on July 30 and 31, of 2019, the Board of Supervisors
saw fit to neither discuss this issue. nor to include this information in the General Plan Update.

26 Therefore, the CPC exhausted its administrative remedies on this issue.
.....205. This violation goes to

27 the essential substance of the purpose of general plan law, and is

28 highly prejudicial. This is because it interferes with both the state's and the petitioner's desires to
locally achieve a major state purpose of California general plan law: to conserve open space
whenever possible. (Government Code, sec. 65562.) Agricultural lands produce many consumer,

products, historical connections, cultural and ecosystem benefits valued by the Petitioner. The

2 productivity of these lands is often a function of their proximity to one another. When grouped
together agricultural lands can avoid conflicts with residential or industrial land uses. When
linked together, rangelands can provide habitat blocks and migration corridors for wildlife
species. Maps identifying existing long-term conservation easements are needed to help to
identify the proverbial missing pieces of the puzzle: the additional nearby lands suitable for long-
term conservation to strengthen the network of agricultural lands. Also, maps of agricultural
A lands within two miles of existing development help to identify key conservation parcels that may
00 be under great pressure to develop. This in turn helps to identify priorities for securing long-term
conservation easements. The lack of these accurate maps makes setting conservation priorities

10 difficult, and the lack of priorities makes the acquisition of the most productive long-term

11 easements difficult. The lack of these accurate maps in the General Plan interferes with the
County's ability to achieve the reasonable legislative objectives of making definite plans at the
12 earliest possible date to conserve open space and to "take positive action to carry out such plans."
13 (Government Code, sec. 65561.) Thus the violation goes to the essential substance of preserving
14 open space, and is highly prejudicial to the interests of the Petitioner.

16 2) THE GENERAL PLAN SAFETY ELEMENT FAILS TO INCLUDE

17 PARTS AND INFORMANTION THAT ARE REQUIRED BY
GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION 65302.
18 206. The safety element must develop a "set of comprehensive goals policies and objectives"
19 to protect communities from the unreasonable risk of flooding. (Government Code, sec. 65302,
20 subd. (g)(2)(B), [emphasis added]).) The safety element must also include a "set of goals
21 policies and objectives… for the protection of the community from the unreasonable risk of

22 wildlife fire " (Gov. Code, sec. 65302, subd. (g)(3(B), [emphasis added].) An objective is a

23 specified end, condition, or state that is an intermediate step toward attaining a goal. It should be
achievable and, when possible, measurable and time-specific." (OPR, General Plan Guidelines
24 2017, p. 392, [emphasis added].)
25 206. The GPU contains goals and policies but no objectives to protect communities from the
26 unreasonable risk of flooding, and the unreasonable risk of wildfire.

27 .....207. Early in the General Plan Update process, on June 1, 2007, the CPC brought the issues of

28 flood control and fire safety to the County's attention by providing background information to the

N Community Development Director Stephanie Moreno. The CPC repeatedly requested that the
County include objectives in its General Plan Update. For example, on March 20, 2015, in the
CPC's comments on the 2014 Draft General Plan, the cover letter states, "It is also disappointing

u A that there are few measureable objectives that provide targets for achievement in the near-term
and long-term." That was followed by a specific critique of the fire safety section of the Draft
General Plan. For a second example, on February 17, 2017, the CPC sent in scoping comments in
anticipation of the GPU EIR. The cover letter indicated that attached to the comments were the

c OPR General Plan Guidelines. The letter encouraged the County to follow the general plan

9 structure, "complete with quantified objectives." Also included as an attachment was the states
guide Fire Hazard Planning. In a memo on July 29, 2019, the CPC recommended that the Board

10 of Supervisors specifically include flood control objectives in the General Plan Update. During

11 their hearings on July 30 and 31, of 2019, the Board of Supervisors did discuss flooding and fire

12 safety, but did not include objectives in the GPU. On November 8, 2019, the CPC sent the

13 Supervisors a copy of a letter to the Board of Forestry and Fire Protection, detailing CPC's

14 ongoing concerns about fire safety. On November 9 and 10 of 2019, the CPC sent the Board of

15 Supervisors numerous photographs of the deficient and unsafe fire access roads in the County.
Therefore, the CPC exhausted its administrative remedies on this issue.

16 .....208. The violation is both substantive and prejudicial, because it interferes with both the

17 essential objective of the general plan law, and with the Petitioner's desire, to locally achieve the

18 'state's purpose of protecting our families, friends, and neighbors from the unreasonable risks of

19 flooding and wildfires. The violation allows the County to further delay identifying the

20 immediate flood control and fire safety actions needed. The lack of specified intermediate steps

21 delays action on the highest priority flood control and fire safety tasks by simply not identifying

22 them. The lack of achievable, measurable and time-specific objectives leaves the general plan
update's flood control and fire safety treatment without the clarity of action and accountability

23 needed. Thus, this violation is both substantive and highly prejudicial.

and diagrams helpful to both the public and private sector in making development decisions.

D

2 (a) REQUIRED CIRULATION ELEMENT COMPONENTS ARE

3 RELEGATED TO THE BACKGROUND REPORT.

4 210. The circulation element is mandatory element that must identify, not only the location

5 of roads, but also the location of other public utilities, as these are also essential for future
development. These include maps of water and wastewater service boundaries, and electrical
6 transmission lines. (Government Code, sec. 65302, subd. (b).) A circulation element must also
7 include the water and wastewater facility needs of disadvantaged legacy communities.

8 (Government Code, sec. 65302.10.) The circulation element can be amended no more than 4

9 times per year. (Government Code, sec. 65358, subd. (b).) Such an amendment involves a

10 process of consultations, public input and a hearing of the Board of Supervisors. (Government

11 Code, secs. 65351-65356.) The Public Facilities Element of the General Plan Update indicates
that it is supposed to meet the requirements of the circulation element to provide the general
12 location of local public utilities, including those needed by disadvantaged communities. Such
13 dividing or combining of required elements is allowed. (Government Code, sec. 65301, subd.
14 (a).)

15 211: The Technical Background Report (TBR) is not part of the General Plan, and by its own

16 terms can be amended at any time without public input, despite past difficulties with the accuracy

17 of information in the Draft Baseline Report (2008) and the Draft Background Report (2014). In
addition, according to the Planning Director's testimony at the Planning Commission the
18 document merely reflects conditions in snapshot in time, and will not be maintained in an updated
19 state.

20 212. The county incorrectly relegated to the TBR the following map and data required by the

21 Government Code to be in the General Plan Update:

22 -water service boundaries,

23 -wastewater service boundaries,
-electrical transmission lines,
24 -water facility needs of disadvantaged communities,
25 -wastewater facility needs of disadvantaged communities.

2 213. The Resource Production Element of the GPU is its agricultural land component. If there

mv is an agricultural land component in the general plan, it must identify "All parcels subject to a
contract executed pursuant to the Williamson Act". The Williamson Act provides reduced
property taxes so long as property owners agree to conservation easements for agricultural or

U natural lands.

6 214. Instead of including the information in the General Plan Update, the County relegated to

7 the Technical Background Report information on the lands subject to Williamson Act contracts.

8 (c) REQUIRED SAFETY ELEMENT COMPONENTS ARE

9 RELGATED TO THE BACKGROUND REPORT.

10 215. Among the requirements of the Government Code, the safety element shall provide

11 historical flood data on repetitive loss properties, and -flood hazard zone maps showing the

12 location of essential public facilities, existing structures, roads, and utilities. (Government Code,
sec. 65302, subd. (g).)
13

14 216. The Technical Background Report, is not part of the General Plan, and by its own terms

15 can be amended at any time without public input. According to the Planning Director's testimony
at the Planning Commission the document is a one-time snapshot of data that will not be

16 maintained in an updated state: The following maps and data required by the Government Code to

17 be in the Safety Element of the General Plan Update are instead improperly relegated to the

18 Background Report:

19 -historical flood data on repetitive loss properties,

20 -flood hazard zone maps showing the location of essential public facilities, existing structures,
roads, and utilities.

21 217. On March 20, 2019, the CPC sent the Planning Commission and the Board of

22 Supervisors a memo on the flaws in the GPU Introduction and the Land Use Element. On pages

23 5 6 and 6 of that memo the CPC explained how, "The General Plan Background Report misplaces

24 and mistreats information that must be in the general plan elements." On July 29, 2019, the CPC

25 sent a memo the Board of Supervisors a listing items to fix in the GPU. Pages 2 to 4 of that

26 memo listed the data and maps missing from the Resource Production Element, the Safety

27 Element, and the Public Facilities Element, and relegated to the Technical Background Report.
Neither the Planning Commission nor the Board of Supervisors chose to make those corrections.

28 Thus, the CPC has exhausted its administrative remedies regarding this issue.

218. The above violations are prejudicial to the state and to the Petitioner because they
2 undermine (1) undermine the role of the state and the public in the review of general plan
amendments, (2) they cut of legal recourse to correct errors in general plan amendments, (3) they
allow the County to exclude required factors from affecting future land use decisions, and (4)
they undermine the enforcement of land use laws designed to protect the public's health, safety,
and environment.
O 219. First, the violations alleged above are highly prejudicial to the Petitioner, as they exclude
the essential role of public and outside agency review from the general plan amendment process.
Many general plan elements are required to include specific and up to date information helpful to
the public and private sector in making development decisions. However, the General Plan

10 Update relegates much of this required information to the Technical Background Report, (AKA

11 "General Plan Background Report") which by its own terms is "separate from the General Plan."
The GPU explains that as information becomes outdated, since it is not included in the body of
12 the general plan, it can be updated "without the necessity of undergoing a general plan
13 amendment process." (GPU Introduction, p. INT-7.) Of course, it is that very general plan
14 amendment process that provides for the public and agency scrutiny and correction of mistakes in

15 background information. (Government Code, secs. 65302, subd (g)(5); 65302.5, 65351-65352.5.)

16 Such mistakes were found by the public and public agencies in the 2008 Baseline Report, and the

17 2014 Background Report. Eliminating public and agency review from the general plan update
process risks perpetuating errors that could harm public health, public safety, the environment,
18 and the productivity of Resource Production lands.
19 220. Second, the violations alleged above are highly prejudicial to the Petitioner, because they
20 cut of legal recourse to correct future errors in the GPU. If required maps and data are allowed to

21 exist outside the plan, then there is no legal recourse for correcting them if they become outdatedl

22 or erroneously changed by the County. For example, the County included the transportation plan
from the 1985 General Plan in the 1996 General Plan, and did not updated it for another 23 maps
decade, despite the fact that subsequent Regional Transportation Plans included more current
24 maps. (Mintier & Associates, Calaveras County General Plan Evaluation, 10/12/06, pp. 31-32.)
25 If this were to happen again, and the court has allowed these maps to exist outside the plan, there
26 would be no legal recourse for updating them.

27 221. Third, the above violations are highly prejudicial to the state and to the Petitioner,

28 because they allow the County to exclude from future development decisions key information that

Petition for Writ of Mandate -65-

D

2 would otherwise affect the decisions. The General Plan Update states that the information in the
General Plan Background Report "may inform but does not affect implementation of the general

e plan." (GPU Introduction, p. INT-7.) The reason that the information is required to be in the
general plan element is SO that it WILL affect implementation of the general plan. The reason for
including in a general plan information on agricultural land conservation easements, on water and
wastewater utilities, and on the location of flood hazards relative to essential public services, is

7 precisely so that the information WILL be considered when private and public land use decisions

8 are made by investors, Planning Commissioners, and County Supervisors. For example, when

9 individual landowner requests for land use designations were reviewed in by the Planning

10 Commission, a frequent and relevant questions from the Commissioners was is the property
served by the Calaveras County Water District (CCWD)? Maps and information are required in :

11 general plan so that the County must consider them, and so the information will affect future land

12 use decisions. If all the County needs to do to avoid key general plan requirements in future land

13 use decision is to instead put the map or information in a something called a background report,

14 then a County could avoid all sorts of general plan consistency requirements, including the most

15 basic requirement that development projects be consistent with the land use designation map.
Allowing future development decisions to be made based upon the whim of local officials,

16 without the factual considerations legally required to protect the public's health, safety, and the

17 environment is highly prejudicial to the state and to the Petitioner.

18 222. Fourth, these violations are highly prejudicial to the state and to the Petitioner, as they

19 undermine the enforcement of land use laws designed to protect public health, public safety, the

20 environment, and the productivity of resource production lands. A key aspect of general plan law

21 is that discretionary development project must be consistent with the general plan. (Friends of
"B" Street v. City of Hayward (1980) 106 Cal.App.3d 988.) If critical information about

22 conservation lands, infrastructure needs, and flood control are allowed to be relegated to a

23 "background report," then the County could approved discretionary development projects in

24 conflict with planning requirements designed to protect public health, public safety and the

25 environment. There would be no legal recourse under land use law to seek judicial review of

26 these projects, because there is no law requiring discretionary projects to be consistent with
something called a "background report." There would be no

27 way to hold the Board of

28 Supervisors accountable for their abuse of discretion in approving such a development project.
Vesting such land use power without accountability is contrary to the modern principles of

Petition for Writ of Mandate -66-

2 California land use law, and contrary to our nation's foundational principle of checks and
balances. The County's scheme would have this Court abdicate its legal oversite power.

4 B) THE GENERAL PLAN UPDATE DOES NOT COMPREHENSIVELY

5 ADDRESS CRITICAL ISSUES. (Government Code, sec. 65301, subd. (c).)

6 223. The Petitioner re-alleges the facts set forth in paragraphs

7 222 of this petition.
224. A general plan is supposed to be comprehensive, in that it addresses development and
conservation issues to the full degree that they are present in the jurisdiction. (Government Code.
sec. 65301, subd. (c).)

10

11 1) THE 13-YEAR GENERAL PLAN UPDATE FAILED TO COMPLETE

12 THE PLANNING PROCES FOR DOZENS OF CRITICAL ISSUES THE

13 COUNTY IDENTIFIED, AND INDEFINITELY POSTPONES
COMPLIANCE WITH GENERAL PLAN LAW.

14

15 225. To ensure that localities pursue "an effective planning process" (§ 65030.1), each city and

16 county must "adopt a comprehensive, long-term general plan" for its own "physical

17 development." (Government Code. sec. 65300.) When adopting general plans, a locality must
"confront, evaluate and resolve competing environmental, social and economic interests."

18 (Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Board of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 571, 276, [emphasis

19 added].) A general plan is supposed to be comprehensive, in that it addresses development and

20 conservation issues to the full degree that they are present in the jurisdiction. (Government Code,

21 sec. 65301, subd. (c).) A general plan also must include development policies, "diagrams and tex;

22 setting forth objectives, principles, standards, and plan proposals," and seven predefined

23 elements-land use, circulation, conservation, housing, noise, safety, and open space.
(Government Code, secs. 65302, subds. (a)-(g), 65303.) The General Plan Guidelines explain

24 that, "The initial stages of outreach allow stakeholders to identify community strengths, assets,

25 priorities for future development, and areas for improvement and, thus, to start the process of

26 formulating a vision for the future." (OPR, 2017 General Plan Guidelines, p. 28.)

27 226. As the court stated in Concerned Citizens of Calaveras County:

28

Petition for Writ of Mandate -67-

» )

- If the plan adopted does not reflect substantial compliance with those requirements, the

2 Board and other responsible agencies of the County have failed in the "performance of an act with the law specially enjoins. " "Substantial compliance, as the phrase is used in the
m t 1o A decisions, means actual compliance in respect to the substance essential to every reasonable objective of the statute," as distinguished from "mere technical imperfections
of form."

(Concerned Citizens of Calaveras County v Board of Supervisors (1985) 166 Cal.App.3d 90, 95-
96, [emphasis added].)

227. During the preliminary stages of the GPU, the County properly identified key issues that
needed to be confronted and resolved in the GUP process. The 2006 evaluation of the 1996
General Plan identified many serious flaws in the 1996 General Plan that needed to be corrected
in the GPU. One major problem was that the implementation programs did not have "clear 10 measureable outcomes and timelines." One problem with the Land Use Element is that it did not
11 meet the requirements for consistency with the airport land use plan. A problem with the
12 Circulation Element is its inconsistency with the Regional Transportation Plan. A problem with
13 the Safety Element was the lack of evacuation routes, minimum road widths, and peak water lode

14 requirements. (Mintier and Associates, Calaveras County General Plan Evaluation, 10/12/06.)

15 228. The 2008 Issues and Opportunities Report listed additional issues that needed to be
16 addressed in the GPU. These issues were identified by local residents at workshops throughout

17 the County, confirmed by the County's expert planning consultant, and accepted by the Board of

18 Supervisors. Page 7 of the report noted the need to preserve open space with conservation
easements, the need to protect wildlife corridors and the need to protect oak woodlands. Pages 9
19 to 11 of the report indicate the need to preserve community identity, and to provide for local
20 control of design review, and to preserve agricultural lands. Page 18 of the report indicated that
21 infrastructure fees were inadequate, and sewer capacity was inadequate in some areas. The report
22 noted the need for new development to mitigate its impacts, to connect to sewer systems, and to

23 be approved only after infrastructure and impact fees are in place. Page 19 of the report noted the

24 need to require water conservation and recycling. Page 21 of the report notes the need to provide

25 for transit, community by-pass roads, and pedestrian facilities. Page 22 of the report
acknowledges that the County lacks funding for necessary transportation improvements. Page 24
26 lists the need to address truck traffic, to restructure traffic impact fee programs, to fund bike and
27 pedestrian improvement projects, and to make more effective economic development of the

28 airport. Page 25 notes the need to improve emergency response times, to employ additional fire

Petition for Writ of Mandate -68-

D

fighters and law enforcement officers, and to provide for emergency evacuation routes. Page 27

2 of the report indicated that the GPU would address fire and flood safety to protect County
m v residents. Page 28 of the report indicated the need to increase revenues for law enforcement and
emergency service facilities and personnel, and to develop necessary standards to decrease risks
from wildfire fires and floods. Thus, if the County completed a general plan that addressed those 5 issues, and included diagrams, goals, policies, objectives, standards, and programs, it would have
been in compliance with the law.

a) The GPU does not address the following development and
conservation issues to the degree that they are present in Calaveras
County.
10 229. However, rather than completing a General Plan Update that addressed these issues, after
11 a 13 year planning process, the Supervisors refused. After authorizing CCWD to lead a
12 collaborative stakeholder process, with expert advisers, the Supervisors refused to adopt the Drafi
13 Water Element. After hiring consultants to complete the draft Energy Element, the Board of

14 Supervisors refused to adopt it. After preparing new community plans for Copperopolis and

15 Valley Springs, the Supervisors refused to adopt them. After the Planning Department worked

16 with the Agricultural Coalition to refine standards to mitigate the loss of Agricultural land, the
Planning Commission eliminated them from the GPU. After experts identified feasible measures 17 to mitigate the loss of oak woodlands, the Planning Commission eliminated them from the GPU.
18 230. Unfortunately, rather than confronting and resolving the critical planning issues it
19 identified early in the GPU process, the GPU instead simply restates the needs and defers dealing
20 with them until an unspecified time in the future.
21 231. For example, look how the GPU addresses the problems identified in the 2006 evaluation
22 of the 1996 General Plan. The implementation programs in the GPU still do not have "clear
23 measureable outcomes and timelines." There is still no current analysis of the consistency of the
24 Land Use Element with the Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan, and the analysis is deferred in

25 implementation LU-3A to an unspecified time in the future, if it becomes a BOS priority.

26 (Response to CPC Comments on the DEIR, Number 11-102.) When asked to fix a list of

27 inconsistencies between the Circulation Element and the RPT, the County refused to address the
inconsistencies. (Response to CPC Comments on the DEIR, Number 11-157.) The identification
28

Petition for Writ of Mandate -69-

D

- of designated evacuation routes has been deferred by implementation measure S-1C to an

2 unspecified time in the future, if it becomes a BOS priority.

0 v Wn 232. The GPU's handling of the Issues and Opportunities Report topics reflect a similar
pattern of restating the problem and deferring decisions on key matters to unspecified times in the
future, if they become a BOS implementation priority. Addressing wildlife corridors and oak
woodland mitigation is deferred by implementation measures COS-4E and 4D. Community
design standards are deferred in implementation measure LU-4A to an unspecified time in the
future, for unspecified communities. Agricultural land conservation is deferred under
8 implementation measure RP-1F. The issues of infrastructure fees being too low and transportation
improvement funds being insufficient are deferred in implementation measures C-1C, C-2D, and
10 C-2E. The issue of water conservation is deferred by implementation measure PF-2H. The issue

11 of truck traffic and noise is deferred by implementation measure N-1C. The issue of emergency

12 response times is deferred by implementation measures S-1B, PF-1A, PF-1B, and PF 4A. The

13 issue of identifying evacuation routes is deferred by implementation measure S-1C. The issue of
the need for law enforcement officers is deferred by implementation measure PF-4A. The issue of
14 funding emergency services is deferred by implementation measure PF-4C.
15

16 233. As a result of the pervasive indefinite deferral of decisions about the key issues that
needed to be addressed in the General Plan Update, the GPU is not complete. If a BOS were
17 allowed to simply perpetually defer confronting and resolving the most important planning issues
18 in the county, then the requirement for adoption of a general plan would be meaningless.
19 Obviously, that was not the intention of the legislature when it passed land use law.

20 234. Throughout the GPU process the CPC encouraged the County to address these issues.
21 The CPC participated in the stakeholder group that drafted the Water Element. The CPC sent in

22 letter of support for the Agriculture and Forestry Element that included mitigation standards for

23 the loss of Resource Production lands. On August 13, 2013, the CPC reminded the County of the

24 issues that had been identified in the GPU process, and sent in suggestions for including key
provisions of the ousted Water, Energy, and Economic Development elements in the mandatory 25 elements of the GPU. In scoping comments on February 16, 2017, the CPC sent in samples of
26 agriculture sections from the general plans of 11 other jurisdictions to help the County address its
27 agriculture issues. The need to specify timeframes for implementing measures to reduce impacts
28 was a consistent theme in the CPC comments on the DEIR. On November 7, 2019, the Petitioner

Petition for Writ of Mandate -70-

sent a memo to the Board of Supervisors, the Planning Director, and to a representative of County

2 Counsel's Office, encouraging the County to correct this flaw in the GPU. The Board did not.

3 Thus, the Petitioner exhausted its administrative remedies.

4 235. This violation is both substantive and prejudicial to the Petitioner. It is substantive

5 because it has direct bearing on the central requirement of general plan law: that a County have

6 general plan. The County took 13-years to complete a plan originally expected to be completed

7 in 2 years, and that was 80% complete in four years. The dominant content of that plan is not
time specific objectives or immediately applicable standards, but over 120 implementation
8 measures, the completion of which is deferred to an unspecified time in the future. If a County
9 can indefinitely postpone planning, then the requirement for a comprehensive general plan is
10 meaningless.

11 236. This violation is prejudicial to the Petitioner, and others in the public, who worked so
12 hard to help the county actually complete a valid general plan. But more than that, this violation
13 is highly prejudicial to all who will suffer the harm associated with the County's failure to timely

14 plan to address key issues. Homes and families will be at risk if the Board delays getting the

15 sheriff and the fire departments the resources they need to keep people safe. If the Board delays,

16 thousands of acres of ranches and timberlands threatened with going out of production due to
drought and wildfire may not get the assistance they need to adapt to changing conditions. If the
17 Board delays, new businesses and developments will not have clear standards to meet for projects
18 approval.
19 237. This violation is prejudicial to the Petitioner because it removes judicial oversite from
20 local land use decisions. If the GPU is found lawful, since the GPU includes no time-specific
21 objectives, and the vast majority of implementation measures have no timelines, the County

22 cannot be held legally accountable under land use law for failing to complete any of these

23 implementation measures during the two decade plan horizon. Thus, privately motivated

24 economic development could continue under the Land Use Element, the Housing Element, and

25 the existing zoning code, in the absence of the public interest motivated efforts that should come
from the Resource Production Element, the Conservation and Open Space Element, and the
26 Safety Element. If a different Board of Supervisors is elected, the public interest components of
27 the GPU could be implemented, while the implementation measures needed for economic
28 development get deferred. Again, vesting such broad land use power without accountability is

Petition for Writ of Mandate -71-

2 contrary to the modern principles of California land use law, and contrary to our nation's
foundational principle of checks and balances. The County's scheme would have this Court
abdicate its legal oversite power.

00au 2) By removing some community plans without replacement, the General
Plan Update does not comprehensively address the need for community plans.

238. A General Plan may include area plans to meet the specific needs of an area.
(Government Code, sec. 65302.4.) For example, Calaveras County includes many diverse
unincorporated communities. These communities have different populations from around 100 in
Wallace to around 4,000 in Arnold and Rancho Calaveras. They have different elevations,

10 climates, and natural landscapes; from the hot oak savanna around Valley Springs to the snowy

11 conifer-covered slopes around Arnold. Some areas have public water supplies and public

12 wastewater treatment, while others rely on wells and septic systems. Some local economies draw

13 their strength primarily from working the land, while others prosper primarily by serving visitors

14 Thus, it is not surprising that these diverse communities would have special needs, which have
been accommodated in community plans for decades. The County included updating these

15 community plans in its 2007 work plan for the GPU

16 237. However, twelve years later in 2019, the GPU still does not comprehensively address this

17 need for community plans. In fact, the GPU took a huge step backwards. It wipes out every

18 policy from the existing community plans along the Highway 4 Corridor: Ebbetts Pass, Arnold,

19 Murphys/Douglas Flat, and Avery/Hathaway Pines. (Community Planning Element, p. CP-1.

20 ['With adoption of this plan, those community plans will be rescinded."l) These policies have

21 been serving these communities well for decades. These community-specific policies address
unique local needs, and many are not replicated in the GPU.

22 238. Also, the GPU leaves two of the more populous and growing communities in Calaveras

23 County (Copperopolis and Valley Springs) without community plans, despite the years of effort

24 and expense to complete these plans under County supervision.

25 ..239. The Copperopolis Community Plan began with a community survey in 1992, followed by

26 a vision statement in 2001, and a 54-page draft community plan in 2005. This effort culminated

27 in the Community Advisory Committee working with the Planning Director and a County
Supervisor to develop a shortened, 3-page community plan in 2013.

28

Petition for Writ of Mandate -72-

2 240. The Valley Springs Community Plan effort began in 2007. It continued through 2010
with the production of a draft plan. A competing plan was also developed in 2010. The two plans

A were blended and presented to the County Planning Department and the Supervisor representing
the area in 2016, in time for inclusion in the environmental impact report. In January 2017, the
Planning Director submitted to the Planning Commission a pared down version of the blended
plan (four and a half pages a of text) suitable for inclusion in the Community Planning Element.

8 The matter was pulled from the agenda of the Planning Commission, and remained stalled for the

o next two years and ten months through the GPU approval in November of 2019. That GPU
approval then rescinded the existing Valley Springs Community Plan. During that period 34-

10 month period, many of the Planning Commission cancelled many of its twice-monthly meetings
for lack of agenda items.

11

12 241. Despite the lack of policies to address development issues in these two communities, the

13 2019 GPU Land Use Designation Map still directs large amounts of future development in and

14 around these two communities. Many issues, including the presence of two water utilities, the

15 intersection of two highways, and flooding concerns, complicate future development in Valley
Springs. Future development in Copperopolis is complicated by Lake Tulloch overcrowding, the

16 traffic constraints of the bridge, the lack of an updated basin plan to cover needed road

17 construction, and the huge excess of land targeted for development relative to future demand.

18 The Planning Department has recognized the need to update the Valley Springs community plan

19 since 1983. The need for a community plan in Copperopolis was noted in 1992.

20 242. The County has claimed that these plans could not be completed during the County's

21 marathon 13-year general plan update process, but will be completed at an indefinite time in the
future. The Copperopolis Plan is complete, and has been since 2013. The Valley Springs

22 Blended Plan is complete, and has been so since 2016. A fully staff-vetted Valley Springs
Community Plan has been available since 2017.

23

24 .....243. If needed and completed plans cannot be adopted now, what good is the County's

25 unenforceable promise of future adoption? To deny these communities the policies they need to

26 address their unique needs in the face of new development is to fail to comprehensively address
the need for community plans.

27 244. The CPC has repeatedly asked the County to include updated community plans in the

28 GPU. The CPC supported updating the Valley Springs Community plan in Input for the General
Plan Background Report, submitted to the County on June 1, 2007. The CPC encouraged the

Petition for Writ of Mandate -73-

County to include community plans the GPU in Section 4 of its Comments on General Plan
2 Update Request for Input, submitted to the County on August 16, 2013. The CPC again asked the
3 County to include community plans on pages LUC-21 to LUC-22 of its comments on the 2014

4 Draft General Plan submitted to the County on March 20, 2015. The CPC again supported

4 including the Valley Springs Community Plans in the GPU on pages 2.3-10 through 2.3-12 of its
scoping comments submitted to the County on February 16, 2017. The CPC also asked for 6 community plans to be included in the GPU in comments on the GPU DEIR in 2018. On July 24,
N 2019, the CPC submitted to the Board of Supervisors videos explaining the need the GPU to
include community plans in Arnold, Murphys, Avery/Hathaway Pines, and Valley Springs. On
9 July 29, 2019, the Petitioner sent a memo to the Board of Supervisors, the Planning Director, and

10 to a representative of County Counsel's Office, stating in bold print that, "By removing some

11 community plans without replacement, the General Plan Update does not comprehensively
address the need for community plans." During the Board of Supervisors hearing on July 31, 12 2019, the CPC read the names of people who requested that their community plans be included in 13 the GPU, and held up photos of some of these people. Thus, the CPC has exhausted its remedies 14 regarding this issue.
15 included policies relating to the 245. This violation is substantive. The community plans
16 mandatory elements in the general plan. Without these policies to address local issues, the GPU is

17 not complete for these communities.

18 246. This violation of the comprehensiveness requirement is prejudicial to the Petitioner that
worked so hard to get the County to comply with this requirement. More than that, this violation 19 highly prejudicial to the people who live in or around the affected communities, including the
20 members of the Petitioner who live in and around Arnold, Hathaway Pines, Murphys, and Valley
21 Springs. The result is an unbalanced plan that places the Land Use Element above the other

22 elements designed to address the needs of such development. The Land Use Designation Map of

23 the Land Use Element was updated for these communities to accommodate community-centered

24 development under the GPU. However, the community specific policies that would have
addressed the challenges posed by that development were neither updated nor included in the 25 GPU.

3) The General Plan Update does not comprehensively address the need for

N fire safety.

( tn 247. Substantively, the Government Code requires that a general plan include "a safety element
for the protection of the community from any unreasonable risks associated with ... wildland and
urban fires." "It shall also address evacuation routes, military installations, peak load water

6 supply requirements, and minimum road widths and clearances around structures, as those items

7 relate to identified fire and geologic hazards." (Gov. Code, secs. 65302, subd. (g)(1).) It must
include a set of goals policies and objectives for the protection of the community from the
8 unreasonable risk of fire. It must include implementation measures to avoid or minimize "wildfire
9 hazards associated with new land uses" These measures must locate new essential public facilities
10 outside of high risk fire areas, or identify measures to minimize fire damage to those facilities.

11 These measures must design adequate infrastructure to provide safe access for emergency

12 vehicles. (Gov. Code, secs. 65302, subd. (g)(3).) Procedurally, to assist in this effort, a County is

13 required to submit a draft safety element to the Board of Forestry for review. If a County does not
accept the recommendations of the Board of Forestry, it must explain why in writing. (Gov.
14 Code, sec. 65302.5, subd. (b)(3) & (b)(4).)
15
a) The GPU has grave fire safety implications. 16
248. Many aspects of the General Plan Update pose a serious fire safety threat.
17 One threat is the extension of groundwater-dependent and intensive commercial and industrial
18 development into forestlands and rangelands isolated from fire protection services. This
19 increases the risk of ignitions in steep places with dry fuels and winds, without piped fire-flows,
20 accessed by minimal rural roads, with lengthy response times for firefighters. Under these
21 conditions, a wildfire could easily get out of control. As can be seen from the land use
22 designation table, commercial recreation (including destination resorts) and industrial facilities
23 will be allowed in areas without public water. (See Land Use Element, Table LU-1.)

24 Those designations could expand beyond the lands on the current land use designation map

25 through future general plan amendments, as there are no fire safety limitations to prevent such

26 amendments. (See Land Use Element, LUD Map, page LU11.)

27 249. A second threat is the expansion of "Agritourism." Many of thèse groundwater-dependent

28 commercial uses will happen on isolated forests and ranchlands designated for Resource

Petition for Writ of Mandate -75-

Production. Many of these uses are by right or ministerial permits, and therefore will not have

2 fire hazard impacts reduced by CEQA review and mitigation measures. (See County Code,
Permitted Uses include Agritourism, Agritourism Performance Standards; Agritourism, defined,
and Resource Production Element, RP-1A.) These land use designations dominate the county's
high and very high wildfire risk areas. (See Land Use Element LUD Map, page LU11; Technical
Background Report, Wildfire Risk Map.) Many of these lands are far from fire stations, where
limited fire crews cover extensive mountainous districts, where response times are long. (See Fire
7 Stations Map; Fire District Maps.) The safety element could have limited such development to
8 areas meeting specified fire safety criteria, or to areas designated as fire safe on an overlay map.

9 It does not. The conservation element could have identified priority agricultural lands for

10 conservation to promote fire safety. It does not.

11 250. When a wildfire gets out of control in these sorts of areas, it can instantly

12 wipe out families, homes, businesses, and the essential assets in major agricultural and forest

13 operations that took generations to accrue. The 2015 Butte fire in Calaveras County is had some

14 of those devastating characteristics.

15 251. A third threat is the cumulative impacts of the aforementioned land uses in the context of

16 a changing climate. The state climate change adaptation strategy identifies the need for local

17 governments in the region to plan to avoid the increased fire risk from climate change. As the

18 region gets less rain, water will become scarcer, landscapes drier, and fire risk will increase. As
forests type convert from conifers to oak woodlands, commercial forest lands are likely to be
19 converted more developed uses. In Calaveras County, this is especially likely along the Highway|
20 4 corridor where Timber Production Zone (TPZ) land is immediately adjacent to existing

21 communities in the very high fire risk zone. (See 2015 Open Space Map.) The Resource

22 Production Element calls for the County to amend its code to allow for the immediate rezone of

23 lands that owners seek to remove from the TPZ. (Resource Production Element, Measure RP-
3A.) Of course, these fire safety challenges are in addition to the ordinary challenges associated
24 with retaining volunteer firefighting crews, maintaining reliable equipment, and keeping up with
25 the demand for services in a County with no development impact mitigation fees for emergency
26 services, etc.

27 252. Given these fire safety threats, and in the wake of the 2015 Butte Fire, one would think
28

Petition for Writ of Mandate -76-

2 that the GPU would ensure prompt implementation of all the instructions in the BOF 2015 Safety

3 Element review to protect the county residents, homes, and businesses. The bad news is that:

4 (1) the GPU Implementation Measures do not commit the County to do anything to improve fire
safety by any particular time,
(2) there are no specified fires safety requirements on new development projects,
(3) there is no recognition that some areas are too dry, windy, steep, fuel laden, and poorly

O op • accessible that they are inherently unsafe for new developments (residential, special event,
tourist lodgings, manufacturing, etc.) that will concentrate people in those areas,
(d) there remains no coordinated post-fire recovery plan for the people, plants, and animals in

10 the 2015 Butte Fire burn scar.

11

12 This demonstrates the failure of the safety element to comprehensively address the fire safety
challenges of the area.

13

14 b. The GPU's Safety Element has four major flaws that will

15 undermine achievement of the reasonable fire safety objectives of state

16 general plan law, as those objectives are identified in the BOF's 2015
safety element review.

17

18

19 (i) Many of the Implementation Measures do not commit the County to do anything to improve fire safety by any particular time.
20

21

22 253. Many of the requests of the 2015 BOF review of the Safety Element were superficially

23 incorporated into policies and implementation measures. However, the Safety Element deferred

24 adoption of the fires safety implementation measures to an unspecified time in the future. The

25 Safety Element includes no deadlines or priorities for implementing the following fire safety

26 measures: S-3A to update the County Code to improve fire safety, S-3B to review fire district

27 standards, S-3C to create a fire safety standards reference, S-3H to assist with fire district impact

28 fee adoption, S-3I to formulate county standards and ordinances for fire safety, S-3J to amend
the County Code to address post-fire rehabilitation, S-3K to create post-fire recovery plans, S-3N

Petition for Writ of Mandate -77-

to evaluate the fire safety of the existing affordable housing stock, S-30 updating community
c 00 440 plans to include wildfire safety, S-3Q securing funding for dead tree removal, and S-3U
adopting an ordinance allowing the installation of temporary communication facilities during
emergencies. This is critical weakness, as the GPU includes over 120 deferred ordinances and
programs without priorities or implementation deadlines. The only hope of getting fire safety
O reforms implemented is for people to convince the Supervisors that it is priority during the
Board's annual selection of general plan measures to implement. (Land Use Element, Tentative 7 Annual Work Plan Measure LU-1.A.)
8

9
(ii) Fires safety requirements for new development projects
remain optional. 10

11 254. While new discretionary developments will get reviewed for fire safety as requested by
12 the BOF, the County's application of fire safety measures to these projects remains optional.

13 Implementation measure S-3S indicates that fuel reduction plans for new developments "should"

14 consider fuel reduction in common areas, "should" address recording fuel management

15 easements, and "should" encourage projects to become Firewise Communities. Thus, all these

16 4 fire safety efforts remain optional. Similarly, while measure S-3W calls for CalFire and fire

17 districts to review proposed new developments, it only requires the County to "consider" the

18 recommendations in those reviews. Again, the fire safety efforts for new developments remain

19 optional. Furthermore, these optional provisions apply only to discretionary development. As
noted above, because the GPU both continues and expands the use of by-right and ministerial 20 development approvals, such development will be subject to neither the fire safety reviews, nor
21 the optional application of fire safety measures.
22 255. The Community Wildfire Protection Plan provides guidance not only for meeting
23 building requirements, but also for maintaining fire safe landscapes and communities. (See pp.
24 34-84 of the CWPP.) Clearly the County knows how to construct and maintain safer
25 communities. However, unless optional Safety Element implementation measures become
26 required, contractors will continue to build less fire safe neighborhoods, in less fire safe
27

28

Petition for Writ of Mandate -78-

communities. If we are going to meet the obligations of the Government Code to keep local

2 employees and residents safe from the unreasonable risk of loss of life and property to wildfire, ,
this has got to change.

(iii) There is no recognition that some areas are SO dry, windy,
steep, fuel laden, and poorly accessible that they are inherently unsafe for new developments that will concentrate people in
those areas.

7

co 256. The overarching land use policy in the GPU is that every legal lot in the natural resource,

O residential, or mixed-use designations is suitable for residential development, no matter how dry,

10 windy, steep, fuel laden, and poorly accessible. (Land Use Element, Table LU-1.)

11 In addition, the GPU applies land use designation, policies, and implementation measures for

12 residential, commercial, and industrial development across the entire land use map of the
County, regardless of the unsafe fire conditions on the landscape. (Land Use Element, LUD Map, 13
page LU11; Wildfire Risk Map.) This ignores the requirements of the safety element to reduce
14 the unreasonable risk of fire.
15
257. This error is compounded, as future zoning is required to be consistent with these land 16
use designations, again regardless of the unsafe fire conditions on the landscape. Development
17 proposals can be approved and built if they are consistent with these inherently unsafe general
18 plan land use designations and zoning categories. If we are going to keep local residents and
19 employees safe, this has got to change.
20 258. It is true that a there is a class of people in Calaveras County who have the money and
21 ability to live and work where ever they wish. They can choose to avoid fire risks. However, most
22 of the people in Calaveras County have to take the jobs they can get, and live in the homes they
23 can afford, where ever those may be. Where these parents live, their young children live with
24 them. It is for the health and safety of these people that the County must establish a foundation of
25 fire safe building and zoning codes, upon which all legitimate development is based. This is
26 more than a matter of public safety, it is a matter of human decency. These people depend on the
27 County to protect them from unnecessary incineration, in accord with land use law.
28

0 O0A0 N (iv) There remains no coordinated post-fire recovery plan for
the people, plants, and animals in the 2015 Butte Fire burn
scar.

259. Section 8 of the BOF review calls for burn area recovery plans, the use of state-of-the-art
fire safe building techniques in redevelopment, and the restoration of wildlife habitat.

Over four years have passed since the Butte Fire burned through Calaveras County. A lot has

9 been done. Emergency erosion control, hazardous material clean-up, and hazard tree removal

10 have been done. PG&E has paid settlement funds, and road reconstruction efforts are under way.

11 A new CWPP is in place identifying fire safety projects for future funding. However, these

12 efforts continue to be independent, un-coordinated, and haphazard. There remains no post-fire

13 recovery plan for the people, plants, and animals that reside in the burn scar. Opportunities are
being missed to underground utilities, to build more fire safe buildings, to restore critical habitat,

14 and to reconfigure transportation dead-ends and bottlenecks.

15 260. Today, over four years later, many families that remain in the burn scar are still living in

16 substandard conditions as they wait to rebuild their homes. Meanwhile, the brush returns among

17 the down logs and limbs across the dry and unshaded landscape. Residents live in fear that the

18 next wildfire will come soon.

19 261. The failure to comprehensively address fire safety concerns is a substantive violation of

20 the fire safety requirements of general plan law. Also this violation is highly prejudicial to the

21 members of the Petitioner, and to the vast majority of residents in Calaveras County, because the

22 live at risk in the High and Very High Fire Hazard Zones of Calaveras County.

23 4) By not reducing the adverse impacts of by-right and ministerial approvals.

24 the General Plan Update does not comprehensively address the need for

25 agricultural land conservation, and for special status species protection;

26 thereby putting economic development and the broad exercise of personal
property rights at risk.

27

28 262. The reasonable objectives of general plan law include the conservation of forests, soils,
agricultural lands, rivers and other waters, fisheries and wildlife. (Gov. Code, sec. 65302, subds.

Petition for Writ of Mandate -80-

r (d)(1), (e); 65561.) The 1996 General Plan included maps and policies to address wildlife habitat
2 during discretionary actions such as zoning, and when new subdivisions are proposed.
0F100 co 263. Special status species in Calaveras County use habitat in the forested and rangelands.
Habitat along lakes and streams, called riparian habitat, is also essential to many special status
species.

264. At the time of the 2010 inventory, there were about 77,000 acres of private forest land
and 188,000 acres of rangelands that provide wildlife habitat. A review of the stream maps
shows that these streams flow though the existing parcels of these private lands. Many land uses
0 disruptive to wildlife habitat are allowed by right on these lands without a permit, while others are

10 allowed with a ministerial permit. Thus, a comprehensive approach to the protection of fish and
E wildlife habitat would address reducing the impacts from discretionary and non-discretionary
development on both existing and new parcels, especially those in the forests and rangelands.
13 265. The General Plan is at the top of the hierarchy of planning documents. All other
discretionary land use approvals must be consistent with the general plan. The zoning map and 14 zoning code must be consistent with the general plan. New subdivisions must be consistent with
15 both zoning and the general plan. New use permits must be consistent with the subdivision, the
16 zoning, and the general plan. Thus, discretionary development approvals are subject to the

17 program-level mitigation measures required in the General Plan. Also, discretionary approvals

18 are subject to any additional mitigation requirements put in place after project-level CEQA
review.
19

20 266. On the other hand, the by-right and ministerial approval of building permits and

21 administrative use permits do not require consistency with the General Plan. In addition, these
development approvals are not subject to CEQA review to mitigate impacts. These approvals are 22 only subject to objective standards placed in the County Code.
23 267. Nevertheless, the adverse impacts f these by-right and ministerial approvals can be 24 reduced. This can be done by including in the general plan a directive to include in the county
25 code objective standards to reduce impacts. This could include prescriptive standards (e.g. On
26 parcels where the size of the building and other setbacks allow, development shall be set back at
27 least 50 feet from the edge of a stream) or performance standards (e.g. On parcels where the size

28

Petition for Writ of Mandate -81-

of the building and other setbacks allow, grading and development shall retain at least 75% of the
N riparian vegetation on site).

268. However, most of the key GPU efforts to reduce habitat impacts only apply to
discretionary land uses. (See COS 4H, COS-4I, COS-4K, COS-41, COS-4M, COS-40, COS-4P.
Although this issue was raised with the Board of Supervisors during the GPU hearing on July 31,
of habitat 0 2019, they refused to discuss or take action on the issue. By limiting the scope

7 protection to only discretionary development, the General Plan fails to comprehensively address
the habitat protection needs associated with new development under the GPU.
00 a 269. The violation is both substantive and prejudicial, because it interferes with both the
essential objective of the general plan law, and with the Petitioner's desire, to locally achieve the 10 state's purpose of protecting wildlife habitat. The state has warned that the cumulative impacts of
11 development and climate change will result in wildlife habitat losses. For game species, habitat
12 protection ensures the ongoing tradition of hunting and fishing will remain a viable part of the

13 local culture, and an ongoing mainstay of the local economy. For special status species, habitat

14 protection helps prevent or delay the time when habitat destruction will trigger development

15 moratoria under the federal Endangered Species Act. By limiting necessary habitat protection to
discretionary approvals, the County is failing to comprehensively address the local issues of 16 wildlife habitat protection. Thus, this violation is both substantive and highly prejudicial.
17

18

19 C THE GENERAL PLAN UPDATE IS NOT INTERNALLY CONSISTENT.
(Government Code, sec. 65300.5.) 20

21 270. A general plan is intended to be "an integrated, internally consistent and compatible

22 statement of policies." (Government Code, sec. 65300.5.) A general plan is internally
inconsistent when one part of an element contradicts part of the same element. (South Orange 23
County Wastewater Authority v. City of Dana Point (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1604.)
24
1) The D2 Community Plan text is not consistent with the maps. 25

26 271. The Community Planning Element claims that its policies only apply in the community

27 core, but the policies themselves suggest that they apply outside the core. This contradiction
it makes it unclear what land use activities will be is allowed outside community cores. This 28

3 problem was pointed out by CPC member Colleen Platt during the County's 2019 review of the

4

un 2) The General Plan Introduction's community development guiding

a principal is not consistent with the contents of the Community Planning
Element.
272. The Community Development guiding principle is that "Community Plans, as developed
by the local residents, will help preserve the character of historic communities and foster

9 economic growth, the delivery of services, and provision of infrastructure." (GPU Introduction,

10 Page-INT 1.) However, the Community Plan Element does not include the Community Plans "as

11 developed by the local residents", but instead includes only a handful of token policies from some

12 of the plans. In addition, many of the policies that are not included from the Community Plans
are policies related to "economic growth, the delivery of services, and provision of

13 infrastructure." Finally, there are no provisions from any of the existing and proposed plans

14 along the entire Highway 4 corridor from Ebbetts Pass, Arnold, Murphys, and Avery/Hathaway

15 Pines down to Copperopolis. There are no provisions from the Valley Springs Community Plan.

16 Thus, the plans in these areas will NOT "preserve the character of historic communities," nor

17 foster "economic growth, the delivery of services, and provision of infrastructure." Thus problem

18 was also pointed out by a CPC member during the County's 2019 review of the GPU.

19 or 273. Both of these inconsistencies are substantive and prejudicial. The first is substantive and
prejudicial because it directly affects the ability of a person to know what will be allowed on his

20 her land outside the community core. The second inconsistency is substantive and prejudicial

21 because the failure to include so many of the community plans in the Community Planning

22 Element, contrary to the direction of the Community Development Guiding Principle, directly
harms the people who live in those communities.

2 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION: VIOLATION OF THE CALIFORNIA PÜBLIC

G RECORDS ACT AND THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION. (Government Code, secs.
6250, et seq.; California Constitution, article I, section 3, subdivision (b)(1.)

A

5 274. The Petitioner re-alleges the facts set forth in paragraphs 1 -273 of this petition.

6 A) The California Constitution and the Public Records Act are to be interpreted

7 broadly to provide public access to information about the people's business.

8 275. The California Supreme Court has nicely summarized the public's right to access records:

10 The public records act requires local governments to disclose record to the public. The

11 PRA and the California Constitution provide the public with a right of access to government information. As this court has explained: "Openness in government is

12 essential to the functioning of a democracy. 'Implicit in the democratic process is the

13 notion that government should be accountable for its actions. In order to verify accountability, individuals must have access to government files. Such access permits

14 checks against the arbitrary exercise of official power and secrecy in the political

15 process.' [Citation.]" (International Federation of Professional & Technical Engineers,
Local 21, AFL-CIO v. Superior Court (2007) 42 Cal.4th 319, 328-329 (Local 21 ).) In

16 adopting the PRA, the Legislature declared that "access to information concerning the
conduct of the people's a business is a fundamental and necessary right of every person in

17 this state." (§ 6250.) "As the result of an initiative adopted by the voters in 2004, this

18 principle is now enshrined in the state Constitution. " (Local 21, at p. 329.) The California
Constitution, article I, section 3, subdivision (b)(1) provides: "The people have the right of

19 access to information concerning the conduct of the people's business, and therefore, the meetings of public bodies and the writings of public officials and agencies shall be open to
public scrutiny."

20

21 (Sierra Club v. Superior Court (2013) 57 Cal.4th 157, [emphasis added].)

22

23 B) Exceptions to the Public Records Act are to be interpreted narrowly based upon

24 the facts of each case, so that the purpose of the act, to provide the public with

25 information about the business of government, is best served.

26 276. -Records may be withheld from the public only when allowed by the terms of the

27 California Public Records Act. Two such exceptions to disclosure are draft documents not
ordinarily retained in the ordinary course of business, and documents that would disclose the

28 thought processes of the executive branch. These two exceptions only apply if the government
interest in withholding the document clearly overbalances the public interest in disclosure of the

Petition for Writ of Mandate -84-

-
2 document. (Los Angeles County Bd. of Supervisors v. Superior Court (2016) 2 Cal.5th 282;
Humane Society of U.S. v. Superior Court (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 1233.)
c 277. The California Supreme Court has also recognized that exceptions to the disclosure of
records should be narrowly construed. It quoted the California Constitution noting:

Ut [A]rticle I, section 3, subdivision (b)(2), of the California Constitution: "A statute, court

6 rule, or other authority, including those in effect on the effective date of this subdivision, shall be broadly construed if it furthers the people's right of access, and narrowly

7 construed if it limits the right of access."

10 278. -If parts of the document can be withheld, while other parts of the document are not

11 exempt from disclosure, the government must disclose the reasonably segregable portions of the
document to the public. In making its assessment of the document, the court can review the
12 record in question in camera, to determine if any or all of it must be disclosed. (Humane Society
13 of U.S. v. Superior Court (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 1233.)

14

15 C) The 2011 Mintier General Plan is a public record controlled by the County..

16 279. As the Court noted in City of San Jose:

17 Appellate courts have generally concluded records related to public business are

18 subject to disclosure if they are in an agency's actual or constructive possession. (See, e.g., Board of Pilot Comrs. for the Bays of San Francisco, San Pablo and

19 Suisun v. Superior Court (2013) 218 Cal.App.4th 577, 598, 160 Cal.Rptr.3d 285; Consolidated Irrigation Dist.

20 v. Superior Court (2012) 205 Cal.App.4th 697, 710, 140 Cal.Rptr.3d 622 (Consolidated Irrigation).) "[A]n agency possession of records if it has the right to has constructive

21 control the records, either directly or through another person." (Consolidated Irrigation, at p. 710, 140 Cal.Rptr.3d 622.)
22

23

24 280. While the County has asserted that it only has annotated copies of the 2011 Mintier
General Plan in its possession, Mintier and Associates has indicated

25 that it has a copy of the 2011 Mintier General Plan in its unannotated form. Both the County and Mintier and Associates have

26 asserted that the County retains control over the release of the 2011 Mintier General Plan. The

27 County's control of the document makes it a public record for purposes of the Public Records
Act..
28

A D) The County has illegally refused to release the 2011 Mintier General Plan, because the exceptions to disclosure the County claims do not apply.

Un 1) The Mintier "Draft" General Plan is a final document.

6 281. The County has argued that the Mintier General Plan is a preliminary draft document, not

7 ordinarily retained by the county, and therefore can be withheld from disclosure under the Publick
Records Act, if the public interest in withholding the document clearly outweighs the public

o interest in disclosing the document. (Gov. Code, sec. 6254, subd. (a). However, in the most
relevant senses, the Mintier General Plan is not a preliminary draft document.

10 282. First and most importantly, the Mintier General Plan is the final document that was

11 produced pursuant to an over $900,000 public contract with the County. It is the product

12 delivered by the contractor and received by the County that justifies the expenditure of public

13 funds. The public has an interest in seeing what the public bought, even though the Board of

14 Supervisors rejected the plan sight unseen, and perhaps especially because the Board of

15 Supervisors rejected the plan sight unseen. Accepting the County's argument, that virtually any

16 document not finalized by the government can be withheld from public scrutiny, would allow the

17 government to hide its most expensive and embarrassing mistakes from public review, thereby
thwarting the California Constitution's guarantee that, "The people have the right of access to
information concerning the conduct of the people's business."

18

19 283. Second, the fact that the document was not adopted by the Board of Supervisors only

20 means that it is not the County's legally binding land use "constitution". Failure to adopt such

21 plan does not negate the fact that it is the final product that was delivered by the contractor and
received by the county as justification for spending over $900,000.

22 284. Third, since the Mintier General Plan was rejected, and a new consultant a

draft a different General Plan, the Mintier General Plan is not really a draft was hired to

23 of anything, in that it

24 will never be the basis for the final plan adopted by the Board of Supervisors. Webster's defines

25 the word "draft" as... "a preliminary sketch, outline, or version (the author's first - ) (a

26 treaty)." The Mintier General Plan is not connected to the new General Plan Update that was -

27 drafted by a different consultant. The author of the 2011 Mintier General Plan is not the author of

28 the subsequently contracted for General Plan Update. The 2011 Mintier General Plan is neither
the GPU author's preliminary draft, nor a first draft that will a be followed by another version. The
2011 Mintier General Plan is its author's FINAL version.

Petition for Writ of Mandate -86-

I 285. Finally, even if one considers the Mintier General Plan a draft document, it is far from a
2 "preliminary draft." According to its authors, at the time is was presented to the County in
February 2011, "[T]he General Plan Update process was more than 80% complete" and was on
track to be completed "within year or less." (Mintier and Harnish, Letter to Board of
Supervisors, December 11, 2012, p. 1.) 5 In all these critical respects, the Mintier General Plan is
not the sort of "preliminary draft" that can be withheld from public disclosure. 6

7 2) The deliberative process privilege does not apply to shield the Mintier
8 General Plan from public review.
286. County Counsel has argued that the deliberative process privilege applies to the Mintier
10 General Plan.

11 "Under the deliberative process privilege, senior officials of all three branches of

12 government enjoy a qualified, limited privilege not to disclose or to be examined
concerning not only the mental processes by which given decision was reached, but the 13 substance of conversations, discussions, debates, deliberations and like materials 14 reflecting advice, opinions, and recommendations by which government policy is
15 processed and formulated." (Regents of University of California v. Superior Court
16 (1999) 20 Cal.4th 509, 540, 85 Cal.Rptr.2d 257, 976 P.2d 808.) The privilege rests on
17 the policy of protecting the decision making processes of government agencies [-]' "

18 (Id. at p. 541, 85 Cal.Rptr.2d 257, 976 P.2d 808.) "The key question in every case is
"whether the disclosure of materials would expose an agency's decisionmaking process in 19 such a way as to discourage candid discussion within the agency and thereby undermine 20 the agency's ability to perform its functions.' [Citation.]" (Times Mirror Co. v. Superio;
21 Court (1991) 53 Cal.3d 1325, 1342, 283 Cal.Rptr. 893, 813 P.2d 240.)
22

23 (As Quoted in San Joaquin Local Agency Formation Commission v. Superior Court (App. 3 Dist.
24 2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 159.)

25 287. Actually, the deliberative process privilege is not absolute, but rather is qualified and
narrowly interpreted. "Not every disclosure which hampers the deliberative process implicates 26 the deliberative process privilege. Only if the public interest in nondisclosure clearly outweighs
27 the public interest in disclosure does the deliberative process privilege spring into existence."
28

Petition for Writ of Mandate -87-

(California First Amendment Coalition v. Superior Court (App. 3 Dist. 1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 159,
172.) The burden rests on the County to establish the conditions that justify nondisclosure.
288. The County's instinctive invocation of the deliberative process privilege is misplaced in
this instance. First, the 2011 Mintier General Plan was never the subject of deliberation by the
Board of Supervisors. The Board met and voted on hiring a new general plan consultant. (BOS

6 Agenda & Minutes 11/23/12.) The actual text of the 2011 Mintier General Plan was not reviewed

7 by the Board of Supervisors as part of that decision. The decision was made based upon the

ao public staff report and recommendations of Planning Director Willis. (Staff Report, 11/13/12.)

9 289. Second, the contents of the 2011 Mintier General Plan are not the type of private advice
that is protected under the deliberative process privilege to promote frank advice to public

10 officials. The contents of the 2011 Mintier General Plan are public policy pronouncements. The

11 Mintier General Plan is not providing advice to the Supervisors. It is providing a technical

12 planning product in response to a contract with the County. It is not private advice to the

13 Supervisors to do or to refrain from any particular action. The 2011 Mintier General Plan is not

14 document advising the Board to fire or to retain its authors as consultants. It simply does not

15 include the kind of advice from county staff or questions from County Supervisors that are
protected under the deliberative process privilege.

16 290. Third, the County's decisionmaking process regarding the dismissal of Mintier-Harnish

17 was far from a private consultation with County staff that now deserves the protection of the

18 deliberative process privilege. County staff criticism of the Mintier General Plan was very public]

19 and very candid, as was the reply from Mintier-Harnish. (See Video of BOS meeting, 11-13-12;

20 Mintier and Harnish, Letter to Board of Supervisors, December 11, 2012.) The four-year

21 planning process facilitated by Mintier-Harnish was also very public. It seems inequitable to

22 allow the County to arbitrarily go from paying a consultant over $900,000 dollars, engaging the
public in a four year planning process, to then to publicly besmirching the professional reputation

23 of that consultant, disregarding the work product, publicly hiring another consultant for close to

24 $300,000, and then at the last minute hiding behind the deliberative process privilege to prevent

25 the public from reviewing the fruits of their labor and their tax dollars.

26 291. The only portion of the Mintier General Plan that may reflect a deliberative process are

27 the "tags" that Mintier added to the end of some policies in the Natural Resources Element to

28 indicate their source. If the source listed on some of those tags are the names of planning
commissioners or supervisors who will later vote on the general plan, or county staff giving the

Petition for Writ of Mandate -88-

decisionmakers advice, then the names on those tags can be redacted prior to the release of the
2 Mintier General Plan. On the other hand, if the tags merely identify the origin of a policy as
3 another city or county's general plan, then they do not reveal a deliberative process.

4

5 3) The public interest in withholding the Mintier General Plan does not
clearly outweigh the public interest in its disclosure. 6 292. Even if the Mintier General Plan is ruled a draft document, or found to reflect a
co deliberative process, the Public Records Act does not universally exempt such documents from
public review. Instead, the exemption for such documents is much narrower. (Gov. Code, O Section 6254 (a) & 6255.) In addition, exemptions from disclosure are to be narrowly construed,
10 and the burden of proof to justify non-disclosure rests with the County. (City of Hemet v.
11 Superior Court (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1411; Sacramento County Employees' Retirement System
12 V. Superior Court (App. 3 Dist. 2011) 195 Cal.App.4th 440.)
13 293. For example, draft documents that are normally retained, or have been retained, in the
14 ordinary course of business are subject to public review. (Gov. Code, sec. 6254, subd. (a).) "[I]f
preliminary materials are not customarily discarded or have not in fact been discarded as is 15 customary they must be disclosed." (Citizens for a Better Environment v. Department of Food
16 and Agriculture (1985) 171 Cal.App.3d 704, 714.) Mintier Harnish has indicated that it retains a
17 copy of the Mintier General Plan, and will release it pursuant to a direction by the County, or if
18 required to in connection with litigation. (Mintier email, 12/23/14.) Since the Mintier General

19 Plan is the type of report ordinarily retained by the County, and versions of it are currently in both

20 the County's actual and constructive possession, the report is not exempt from disclosure.
294. In addition, draft reports are only exempt from disclosure if the public agency can show 21 that the public interest in nondisclosure clearly outweighs the public interest in disclosure. In
22 determining the public interest, "the weight of that interest is proportionate to the gravity of the
23 governmental task sought to be illuminated and the directness with which the disclosure will

24 serve to illuminate." (Citizens for a Better Environment v. Department of Food and Agriculture

25 (1985) 171 Cal.App.3d 704.) In the case of the Mintier General Plan, the gravity of the

26 governmental task is substantial, and the weight of the public interest is overwhelming.

27

28

Petition for Writ of Mandate -89-

a) The County's "constitution" for future development will broadly

2 and directly affect people's lives for decades.
295. The general plan has been called the constitution for all future developments. It is the
fundamental document that empowers a Board of Supervisors to make land use decisions. It has
a long-term perspective of twenty years. It includes land use maps and policy pronouncements on
a variety of topics that affect people's lives every day. It identifies the potential future locations
6 of homes and businesses. It identifies acceptable levels of traffic congestion and noise that
7 people may have to endure. It determines the efforts that the County will take, or not take, to
conserve its water supply, to protect water quality, to preserve wildlife habitat, and to maintain

9 the viability of farms, ranches, and forestlands. It identifies efforts the County will take, or not

10 take, to protect residents from crime, from floods and from wildfires. It identifies, or not, efforts

11 the County will take develop park and recreation facilities.
296. Thus, the governmental task at issue has gravity, because it is the County's update of its
12 constitution for all future development, and it will thoroughly affect every resident's health,
13 safety, and wellbeing every day, for decades. The disclosure of the Mintier General Plan will
14 directly illuminate this process, by presenting professionally produced policy options, custom

15 crafted for Calaveras County to use. This importance was heightened during the July and

16 November hearings of the Board of Supervisors, when they encouraged people to continue to

17 propose improvements to the General Plan.
b) The public has a major interest in the financial dealings of County
18 government.
19 297. In the Public Records Act, the Legislature declared that "access to information
20 concerning the conduct of the people's business is a fundamental and necessary right of every

21 person in this state. (Government Code, sec. 6250.)

22 298. The Mintier General Plan cost Calaveras County over $900,000. The next consultant

23 was hired for nearly $300,000. Yet another general plan consultant was hired for another
$50,000. Her contract was later extended for another $63,000. While $1.3 million may not sound 24

25 like a lot of money in the context of national, state, and large metropolitan government budgets, it
is a lot of money to Calaveras County. That is more than the annual budget for the entire
26 Planning Department. (County of Calaveras, 2014-2015 Final Budget, pp. 109-110.).

27 299. The taxpayers have an interest in reviewing the document on which the County spent

28 over $900,000, and that the County Board of Supervisors rejected sight unseen. Taxpayers

Petition for Writ of Mandate -90-

deserve to judge for themselves whether or not the money was wasted on bad consultant, and
2 whether or not the subsequent expenditures on new consultants were justified.

3

4 c) The public has an interest in reviewing the government's awarding
of contracts.
5 300. The California Supreme Court has held that the public has a valid and weighty interest in 6 scrutinizing government dealings with contractors. (Michaelis, Montanari, & Johnson v. Superior
Court (2006) 38 Cal4th 1065.)
8 301. There have been three separate general plan contractors hired by the County. We know.
9 who the contractors are. We know how much they are being paid. We have the work product of

10 the current general plan contractor. We do not have the work product of the prior contractor. As

11 Planning consultants are frequently hired to produce plans and environmental documents for the
County, the public has an interest in reviewing their work so they can intelligently advise the 12 County with regard to whom to hire. Such public scrutiny of such contracting issues is
13 recognized as a valid public interest for Public Record Act purposes.
14

15 d) The Public has an interest in reading the Mintier General Plan

16 that it worked so hard to produce.

17 302. The public has an interest in seeing the Mintier General Plan because it was produced

18 after hundreds of people spent hours in public workshops, at public hearings, and making written
comments. The Mintier General Plan was not produced by a consultant in a vacuum. a It was the
19 product of a work plan that included extensive public participation. (General Plan Update Work
20 Program, 12-1-06) The first round of workshops were held in 7 locations. Over 500 people
21 participated in identifying the County's top assets and top problems. The second round of
22 workshops were held in 6 locations. About 300 people helped to identify a vision for the county,
23 noted specific improvements they would like to see, and selected useful guiding principles.

24 (Issues and Opportunities Report, June 2008. p.5.) The third round of workshops were held in
locations, and lasted over two hours each. 216 people participated by identifying their preferred 25 general plan alternative and suggested changes. (Alternative Workshops Results, pp. 1-2.) In
26 addition, there were Board of Supervisor hearings (and some jointly with the Planning
27 Commission) on many dates. Dozens of people attended, and many spoke at those meetings. The
28

Petition for Writ of Mandate -91-

2 Mintier General Plan was the culmination of these efforts. The people who invested all those
hours in the process deserve to see the fruits of their labors.

4 e) The public has an interest in trying to get any nuggets of wisdom
from the Mintier General Plan into the County's general plan.
303. The public has an interest in getting the best possible general plan. The plan will

oo determine how the county administers land use, circulation, housing, open space, resource
production, resource conservation, noise, public safety, and public facilities for the next two
decades. (Gov. Code, Sec. 65302.)

1O

10 304. Prior to preparing the 2011 Mintier General Plan, Mintier and Associates evaluated the

11 1996 Calaveras County General Plan in detail, and identified aspects that needed to be upgraded.

12 (Calaveras General Plan Evaluation, 10-12-06.) As the Petitioner asserted above in Cause of
Action 1, the 2019 GPU has not adequately addressed some of these flaws in the 1996 General
Plan.
13

14

15 305. Mintier and Associates used its expert professional judgment to custom craft a general
plan for Calaveras County to correct the flaws outlined in its evaluation of the 1996 Calaveras

16 County General Plan. Thus, the Mintier General Plan may include policies that were overlooked

17 in the 2019 GPU. It may include a measure to reduce environmental impacts of the GPU. It may

18 even be sufficiently less impacting that it could have served as an alternative for evaluation in the

19 environmental impact report on the general plan. The reduction of significant impacts and the

20 analysis alternatives is required by CEQA. (CEQA Guidelines, secs. 15126.4 & 15126.6.) If

21 only one overlooked policy is salvaged, or one lost mitigation measure is found, it would be
worth allowing the public to review the Mintier General Plan. At the July and November 2019

22 GPU hearings, members of the Board repeatedly referred to future opportunities for the public to

23 suggest to improvements to the plan through future amendments. The release of the Mintier

24 General Plan, with all of its suggested improvements, is a critical step for a meaningful public
process to improve the GPU.

25

26 306. Allowing such an exercise to verify that the 2019 GPU did not miss any key suggestions

27 from the Mintier General Plan, and to re-include in the GPU any inadvertently excluded

28 provisions, would reconnect the first part of the General Plan Update process with its Mintier and
Associates guided public participation, to the second part of the General Plan Update process.

Petition for Writ of Mandate -92-

2 Such continuity is needed for the general plan update public participation process to regain its

3 integrity. (OPR General Plan Guidelines, pp. 142-148.)

0$0° u A f) The County was required to disclose in good faith any feasible
mitigation measures and alternatives it has produced during the
CEQA review of the General Plan Update.
307. The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) requires the County to develop and
adopt feasible mitigation measures to reduce potentially significant impacts of the General Plan

10 Update. Failure to adopt feasible mitigation measures is a violation of CEQA. These mitigation
measures must be disclosed in the EIR for the General Plan Update. Failure to disclose

11 mitigation measures in an EIR is a violation of CEQA. (CEQA Guidelines, sec. 15126.4)

12 i 308. Similarly, CEQA requires that the County develop and analyze a broad spectrum of
alternatives to the project that can reduce its impacts, while still meeting most of its objectives.

14 While there is no set number of alternatives that must be evaluated, the alternatives must be
chosen to inform decisionmakers and the public. (CEQA Guidelines, sec. 15126.6.)

15

16 309. The County spent five years, hundreds of volunteer hours, and over $900,000 developing
the 2011 Mintier General Plan. If the Mintier General Plan would reduce otherwise significant

17 impacts of the of the county general plan, then the County was required to consider analyzing the

18 Mintier General Plan as an alternative in the DEIR. If there is even one objective or policy or

19 implementation or standard in the Mintier General Plan that would reduce a significant impact of

20 the GPU, then the County was required to consider that provision as a mitigation measure in the

21 DEIR. To ensure the County complied with CEQA in completing the environmental review for
the GPU, the Mintier General Plan must be reviewed.

22 310. There are many ways that agencies have failed to meet their obligations under CEQA to

23 address alternatives and mitigation measures. Some agencies have done a poor job of identifying

24 mitigation measures and alternatives. Once identifying them, some agencies have refused to

25 evaluate them in an EIR. Other agencies have improperly failed to adopt mitigation measures.

26 However, it would be an unprecedented violation of CEQA for a County to spend so much time
and so much money developing

27 an alternative and mitigation measures, and then to refuse to
disclose them in good faith as part of the CEQA process.

28 311. The two pillars of CEQA are the protection of the environment and the disclosure of
useful information to do so. "[T]he 'foremost principle' in interpreting CEQA is that the

Petition for Writ of Mandate -93-

Legislature intended the act to be read SO as to

2 afford the fullest possible protection to the

3 environment within the reasonable scope of the statutory language." (Communities for a Better
Environment v. California Resources Agency (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 98, 110; citing Laurel

4 Heights Improvement Association v. Regents of University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376,

un 390.) For an EIR to be adequate it must reflect "a good faith effort at full disclosure." (CEQA

6 Guidelines, sec. 15151.) Like the Public Records Act, CEQA is has a public disclosure function.
The County's repeated refusal to
7 disclose the content of the Mintier General Plan totally
undermine those both pillars of CEQA. It is completely antithetical to the foundational principals
of CEQA.

9

10 g) The Mintier General Plan must be publicly available as part of
11 the record of proceedings for the General Plan Update and its

12 CEQA review.

13 312. The General Plan Update process includes preparation of an environmental impact report

14 in conformity with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The administrative record

15 for project prepared under CEQA includes documents like the 2011 Mintier General Plan.

16 (Public Resources Code, sec. 21167.6, subds. (e), 2, 3, 7, and 10.) The County's CEQA Findings
of Fact concede that the record must be available for public inspection. (CEQA Guidelines, sec.

17 15094, subd. (b)(9).)

18 313. The County's CEQA Findings of Fact for the GPU concede that an administrative record

19 includes documents reviewed by staff, for the purpose of advising the Supervisors. The Mintier

20 General Plan was reviewed by staff for the purpose of advising the Supervisors regarding the

21 General Plan Update in 2012. . Thus, it must it be part of the GPU administrative record.

22 314. The County's CEQA Findings of Fact also conceded that the CEQA administrative
record includes any document referenced in the EIR. The Mintier General Plan is referenced in

23 Final EIR. (FEIR, pp. 2-202. 2-274.) Thus the Mintier General Plan must be part of the CEQA

24 administrative record, and subject to public inspection..

25 315. In County of Orange, the court noted that CEQA, "[C]ontemplates that the administrative

26 record will include pretty much everything that ever came near a proposed development or to the

27 agency's compliance with CEQA in responding to that development." (County of Orange v. The
Superior Court of Orange County (2003) 113 Cal.App.4th 1, 8.)

28

Petition for Writ of Mandate -94-

316. The court went on to explain the importance of including draft documents in the

2 administrative record. The court reasoned that the CEQA process, "[C]ontemplates revisions, to

0 a greater or lesser degree, in any 'project.' That is, indeed, one of the major objectives of the
L CEQA process -- to foster better (more environmentally sensitive) projects through revisions
which are precipitated by the preparation of EIR's. As County of Inyo V. City of Los Angeles
(1984) 160 Cal.App.3d 1178, 1185 has stated, CEQA is an 'interactive process of assessment of
6 environmental impacts and responsive project modification which must be genuine.' (Emphasis
A0 added.) It is thus the very nature of CEQA that 'projects' will be 'modified' to protect the
environment, and it is the logic of section 21167.6 that there be a record of such modifications,

9 not just those documents relating only to the finished product." (County of Orange v. The

10 Superior Court of Orange County (2003) 113 Cal.App.4th 1, 10.)
317. Thus, even if the County were able to withhold the Mintier General Plan from the public 11 under the Public Records Act in the past, the document must become publicly available now that
12 the General Plan EIR is certified and the general plan is adopted. Since the document cannot be
13 kept secret, the government's interest in withholding it now is even less weighty.
14 318. By way of contrast, the public interest in disclosing the document now is weighty.

15 Disclosed now, the document can influence the future amendment of the GPU, and potentially

16 improve the County's future. Disclosed now, the document will provide for more informed

17 public policy debate.

18 h) The public has an interest in confirming the wisdom of the
19 Board of Supervisors when they changed general plan consultants.
20 319. On November 13, 2012, the Board of Supervisors passed a motion to hire a new general

21 plan consultant. Two of the Supervisors who voted (differently) on that motion are again on the

22 Board of Supervisors in 2019. Only by reviewing the Mintier General Plan can members of the

23 public decide for themselves the wisdom of their Supervisors' choices.
320. One must ask oneself, in a democratic republic, is it legitimate under the Public Records
24 Act for incumbents to quash public debate simply by withholding a government document that
25 raises questions about their thriftiness and effectiveness? We think not. We agree with the
26 California Supreme Court that the Public Records Act exists to check "the arbitrary exercise of

27 official power and secrecy in the political process." (Sierra Club v. Superior Court (2013) 57

28 Cal.4th 157.)

Petition for Writ of Mandate -95-

321. As a Patrick Henry observed, "The liberties of a people never were, nor ever will be,
2 secure, when the transactions of their rulers may be concealed from them." In a democratic

3 republic, we are not required to merely accept the dictates of technocrats or government officials

4 at face value. We actually get to review the facts, make our own conclusions, and vote according
to our informed convictions.
5 322. As Thomas Jefferson rhymed, "If you expect a nation to be ignorant and free, you expect 6 what never was and can never be." The totalitarian governments of the former Soviet Union, Red
A China, and Nazi Germany are prime examples of this adage. They destroyed books and record in
a vain attempt to restrict the fundamental freedom of thought. By contrast, in American
o government; information educates, minds evaluate, and all the people can participate. Our

10 freedom of information, our freedom of thought, our rights to respond by speaking out and by

11 voting, are among the noblest ways that our American system of government distinguishes itself
from the totalitarian regimes. By releasing the 2011 Mintier General Plan, the Court will uphold 12 these foundational principle of our democratic republic.

14 i) A publicly disclosed Mintier General Plan could be used as

15 substantial evidence to support the County's claims regarding in its

16 FEIR, and in its Findings.

17 324. In response to comments on the DEIR, the Final EIR claims that the Mintier General

18 Plan could not be evaluated as a policy alternative in the EIR. (FEIR, p. 2-274.) The County
claims in its Findings of Fact, that there are no additional feasible mitigation measures for the 19 many significant and unavoidable impacts of the 2019 General Plan Update. CEQA requires that
20 such responses and findings be supported by substantial evidence in the record. If released to the
21 public, the Mintier General Plan could be used as substantial evidence to support these claims, if
22 they are accurate. Thus, the public interest in disclosing the Mintier General Plan is

23 overwhelming.

2 4) The public interest in withholding the document is minor.

3 a) Confusion is unlikely, and will not affect public participation in the

4 GPU.

5 325. At one point, the Planning Director indicated that he did not want the 2011 Mintier

6 General Plan released because releasing it when the 2014 Public Review Draft General Plan was

7 out for public review would confuse people. They might not know to which general plan they

8 should address their review and comment efforts. This would interfere with the General Plan
Update process.

9 326. Releasing the Mintier General Plan to the CPC at this time is not likely to cause public

10 confusion. First, the 2019 GPU has been adopted, and the comment periods closed. There is no

11 longer any chance that people will be confused about which draft to direct their review and
comment efforts.
12

13 327. Second, the request is to release the document to the CPC, not to circulate the Mintier

14 General Plan for public comment. The CPC has participated in the General Plan Update since the

15 beginning. That participation has included: participating in the aforementioned general plan

16 workshops, submitting two volumes of input for the background report, working with stakeholder
efforts to prepare the draft Water Element, commenting on the draft land use maps, responding to

17 the requests for policy suggestions from the County in 2013, and submitting comments on the

18 2014 Public Review Draft General Plan. The CPC submitted scoping comments and DEIR

19 comments, and testified at the 2019 GPU hearings of the Planning Commission and the Board of

20 Supervisors. The CPC has been involved in the General Plan Update longer than the County's

21 Planning Director, longer than County Counsel, and longer than the current general plan

22 consultant. These experiences have helped CPC members develop a detailed understanding of
the General Plan Update. The CPC understands the difference between the 2011 Mintier General

23 Plan and the 2019 GPU. The release of the Mintier General Plan will not confuse the CPC.

24 328. While it is true that once released, any member of the public can ask for and receive a

25 copy of the 2011 Mintier General Plan, it does not follow that such a requester will be confused

26 upon receipt of the plan. It is more likely that a person knowledgeable enough to request a copy

27 of a document will also know why they want to look at it; and will do so. Since the 2019 GPU is

28 now complete, there is no longer any chance that the confusion of such a requester would
interfere with the County's completion General Plan Update process.

Petition for Writ of Mandate -97-

2 b) No deliberative processes will be divulged.
w A 329. As noted above, the Mintier General Plan does not include the sort of confidential advice
to decisionmakers that is protected by the deliberative process privilege. Thus, its release will not
injure the Supervisor's deliberative process. 5

6 c) Withholding the document does not ensure that we will be "moving
7 forward."

8 330. One Supervisor objected to the release of the Mintier General Plan because he considered

9 it moving backwards in the General Plan Update process, and he wanted to move forward. The

10 Planning Director also said that he did not want to release the Mintier General Plan because it

11 would cause people to again raise policy issues that he felt were dismissed with the hiring of a
new consultant. He felt that continuing to debate those issues would be a step backward. 12 331. To be determine if you are moving forward toward a goal, you need both an initial 13 reference point and a goal. Some people differ on their General Plan Update goal. Originally the
14 County's primary goal was a legally valid general plan, so the County sought to ensure legal
15 compliance by following established legal precedents and the General Plan Guidelines. Later, the
16 Planning Commission sought to do the minimum legally adequate general plan, while promoting

17 flexibility and private property rights to the greatest extent possible. The CPC has consistently
sought a legally valid general plan that fairly balances competing local and regional interests, 18 while making full use of state, federal, and private programs to enhance the health, safety,
19 wellbeing, and environment of the people of Calaveras County.
20 332. Regardless of your General Plan Update goal, you cannot tell if you are making progress
21 toward it unless you can compare where you are now, to where you were. The Mintier General

22 Plan defines where we were in February 2011. The 2019 GPU is another reference point. Does

23 the County's 2019 GPU constitute moving forward? Without the 2011 Mintier General Plan to
compare it to, no one can say. 24 333. The release of the 2011 Mintier General Plan would allow all to judge, using their own 25 criteria, whether the County made progress on the General Plan Update between 2011 and 2019.
26 Some may feel that moving farther away from the policy proposals in the 2011 Mintier General
27 Plan is progress. Some may feel it is regressing farther away from the goal of a legally valid
28 general plan that promotes a balance of competing local and regional interests. Until we can

Petition for Writ of Mandate -98-

-

2 compare the 2011 Mintier General Plan to the 2019 general plan, there is no way for anybody to

3 tell which direction the General Plan Update is going, relative to where we were in 2011. Thus,
the desire to evaluate the progress on the General Plan Update weighs in favor of releasing the

4 Mintier General Plan.

5 334. Finally, we have to ask ourselves whether the County articulates a legitimate rationale for

6 nondisclosures, when it seeks to squelch informed public debate about a local government

7 decision that will dramatically effect, for the next two decades, countywide land use, resource
conservation, open space, public facilities, water supply, energy conservation, public safety, and
economic development. Regardless of who the general plan consultant is, these general plan
issues will continue to be the subject of public debate.

10 335. In the past, County staff members expressed concern about the controversial nature of the

11 policy recommendations in the Mintier General Plan. Nevertheless, these policy

12 recommendations remain those of respected planning professionals who spent four years and over

13 $900,000 first overseeing three rounds of public workshops where these issues were debated, and

14 later writing up policies to address these issues. Does the fact that a public document may

15 stimulate informed public debate on critical policy issues justify government nondisclosure?

16 Does the fact that people may question why, after spending over $900,000 of taxpayer money on
a plan, the County BOS rejected it, sight unseen, justify not even giving the public a chance to

17 read the plan? We think not. If simply claiming that a document will create a public policy

18 controversy is enough to justify the government withholding it from the public, then that

19 exception would swallow the rule that dwells at the heart of the Public Records Act: that

20 government should be accountable for its actions. Instead, we agree with the Supreme Court of

21 the State of California, that openness in government is essential to the functioning of a
democracy. (Sierra Club v. Superior Court (2013) 57 Cal.4th 157.)

22

23 d) The release of other portions of the Mintier General Plan have caused no

24 problems.

25 336. Sections of the Mintier General Plan have been release to the public without causing any

26 of the problems that would justify nondisclosure.

27

28 337. The draft Water Element and the draft Agriculture Element were first produced by
stakeholder groups. At one point, the County accepted the Agriculture Element and forwarded it

Petition for Writ of Mandate -99-

P

N to the Planning Staff for use in the General Plan. (BOS Minutes, 2-10-09) The Economic
Development Element was drafted by consultants other than Mintier-Harnish. It was also released
by the Planning Department. (Economic Development Element, 12-13-11.) The Energy element

0 N.O u was also prepared by a different consultant, and was released by the Planning Department.
(Energy Element.) The Introduction of the Mintier Harnish General Plan was released to the
public. In May of 2019, the Planning Commission even include two pages of that Mintier-
Harnsih Introduction into the GPU Introduction.
338. These general plan components and documents were made available to the public, and
there has been no resulting threat to public health, safety, and wellbeing. There has been no

10 outbreak of criminal activity associated with the release of this material. There has been no

violent over-through of the local government as a result of these releases. There has been no

11 violation of people's rights to privacy associated with these releases.

12 339. Just as all of the previous general plan releases have posed no risks, the release of the

13 2011 Mintier General Plan poses none of the risks that would justify nondisclosure by the

14 County. The disclosure of the remainder of the 2011 Mintier General Plan does not risk exposing

15 the type of personal or embarrassing information, or trade secrets, that are usually exempt from

16 public disclosure. Nor does it contain the kind of information that would expose the County to
risk of terrorist attack, and would thus be exempt from disclosure. Essentially, there is no a

17 legitimate public interest in restricting disclosure of the 2011 Mintier General Plan.

18 340. Since the public interest in keeping the report confidential does not clearly outweigh the

19 public interest in disclosure, the County must disclose the Mintier General Plan.

20

21 e) The Mintier General Plan is akin to the publicly available General Plans
adopted by every City and County in California.

22 341. In its ruling that a County GIS database was a public record, the California Supreme

23 Court noted that 47 of the 58 California Counties provide access to GIS databases as public

24 records. (Sierra Club v. Superior Court (2013) 57 Cal.4th 157.) Similarly, all of California's

25 cities and counties, including Calaveras County, provide access to their general plans as public

26 records. There is nothing inherent about the a information in a general plan that would justify its
nondisclosure.

27

28 342. By law, every City and County in California must adopt a general plan. (Government
Code, sec. 65300.) The law requiring such master plans was passed in 1937, and codified into the

Petition for Writ of Mandate -100-

Government Code in 1951. The requirement for the land use and circulation elements was passed
in 1955. The requirement for a housing element was passed in 1967. The requirements for the
conservation and open-space elements was passed in 1970. The requirements for the safety
L element were passed in 1975. (OPR General Plan Guidelines, 1990.)
ün a 343. There are over 480 incorporated cities in California and 58 counties. (Department of
Finance, list of cities and counties, 2015.) The California Supreme Court has stated that a generall
plan is "the constitution for all future developments within the city or county." (Citizens of Goleta 7 Valley v. Board of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 531. 570.) These general plans are reviewed and
8 referenced by public and private planners, local citizens, and local governments regularly as they
9 prepare, review, and approve specific plans, subdivisions, and use permits. (Government Code,

10 secs. 65451, 66473.1- 66,474; Neighborhood Action Group v. County of Calaveras (1984) 156

11 Cal.App.3d 1176.)
344. It is illogical for Calaveras County to suggest that there is any harm to releasing to the 12 public the type of document that is both totally public and critically useful in every city and every 13 county in California; and has been for decades.
14

15 f) Any opinions and recommendations may be severed.

16 345. The courts have agreed that, when the issue is the release of a draft document, a

17 government agency may redact, "A statement of opinion concerning whether county conduct,
policy, or practice conforms to the law" or whether the County should "take some other action in 18 view of the conduct, policy, or practice." (Citizens for a Better Environment v. Department of
19 Food and Agriculture (1985) 171 Cal.App.3d 704, 717.) For example, there would be no need to
20 disclose the identities of the commenters through "source tags at the end of the policies" as noted
21 in the Harnish memoranda. Although the CPC would prefer that the County waive this privilege,
22 and produce the entire document, the County is free to redact such information from the 2011

23 Mintier General Plan before producing a copy for the CPC. Such redaction was done when the
County released the Draft General Plan Evaluation report in 2006. 24

F THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION: VIOLATION OF CEQA (Public Resources Code, secs.

2 21000, et seq.)

3 346. The Petitioner re-alleges the facts set forth in paragraphs 1 - 345 of this petition.

4
A) THE RESPONDENTS' TREATMENT OF MITIGATION MEASURES
5 VIOLATES CEQA IN MANY WAYS.

6

7 347. CEQA requires agencies to adopt feasible mitigation measures in order to substantially

8 lessen or avoid otherwise significant environmental effects. (Pub. Resources Code, secs. 21002,

9 21081, subd. (a); Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, secs. 15002, subd. (a)(3), 15021, subd. (a)(2), 15091,
subd. (a)(1).) 10 348. A mitigation measure is something that avoids an impact, minimizes an impact, reduces
11 the impact over time, restores the impacted environment, or compensates for an impact by
12 providing substitute resources or environments. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, sec. 15370.)
13 349. When approving projects that are general in nature (e.g. general plan amendment),
14 agencies must develop and approve whatever general mitigation measures are feasible, and

15 cannot merely defer the obligation to develop mitigation measures until a specific project is

16 proposed. (Citizens for Quality Growth v. City of Mount Shasta (App. 3 Dist. 1988) 198
Cal.App.3d 433, 442.) A program EIR is supposed to, "Allow a Lead Agency to consider broad
17 policy alternatives and program-wide mitigation measures at an early time when the agency has
18 greater flexibility to deal with basic problems or cumulative impacts." (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14,
19 sec. 15168.) The California Supreme Court has ruled that, if an agency adopts a program level

20 EIR, then certification of the EIR without the adoption of feasible mitigation measures is an abuse

21 of discretion under CEQA. (City of Marina v. Board of Trustees (2006) 39 Cal.4th 341 [No

22 mitigation adopted for significant off-site impacts on drainage, water supply, traffic, wastewater
management, and fire protection.].) 23

24 1) THE COUNTY IMPROPERLY DEFERS IMPACT MITIGATION WITHOUT
25 STATING A REASON DEFERRAL IS NECESSARY, MAKING AN
26 ENFORCEABLE COMI T, SPECIFYING A MENU OF FEASIBLE
27 MEASURES, SETTING A MITIGATION STANDARD TO ACHIEVE, AND

28

Petition for Writ of Mandate - 102-

N00A0 N IDENTIFYING A TIME OR CONDITION WHEN THE MITIGATION WILL BE
COMPLETED BEFORE IMPACTS WILL OCCUR.

A) An agency adopting project and certifying a Program EIR must adopt
general mitigation measures to reduce significant impacts.

350. When approving projects that are general in nature (e.g. general plan amendment),

8 agencies must develop and approve whatever general mitigation measures are feasible. (Citizens

9 for Quality Growth v. City of Mount Shasta (3 Dist. 1988) 198 Cal.App.3d 433, 442.) The

10 mitigation measures must be incorporated into the plan. (Sierra Club v. City of San Diego (2014)
231 Cal.App.4th 1152, 1173.) When a program EIR identifies significant impacts on drainage,

11 water supply, traffic, wastewater management, and/or fire protection, certification without

12 adoption of the feasible mitigation measures is an abuse of discretion under CEQA. (City of

13 Marina v. Board of Trustees (2006) 39 Cal.4th 341.)

14

15 B) Each adopted mitigation measure must be a mandatory commitment of the

agency.

16 351. CEQA requires that mitigation measures be enforceable commitments to reduce or avoid

17 significant environmental impacts. (Neighbors for Smart Rail v. Exposition Metro Line

18 Construction Authority (2013) 57 Cal.4th 439, 445; CEQA Guidelines, sec. 15126.4, subd. (a)(2).)

19 "The purpose of these requirements is to ensure that feasible mitigation measures will actually be

20 implemented as a condition of development, and not merely adopted and then neglected or

21 disregarded." (Federal Hillside & Canyon Associations v. City of Los Angeles (2000) 83
Cal.App.4th 1252, 1260-1261.)

22

23 352. When an agency adopts a plan that includes planned future development, it must actually
mitigate the impacts that can be anticipated at that time, regardless of future tiers of review.

24 (Koster v. County of San Joaquin, supra, 47 Cal. App. 4th at 39-40.) It is not adequate mitigation

25 to simply promise to meet some goal in the future, without any criteria for how this will occur.

26 (Gray v. County of Madera (2008) 167 Cal. App. 4th 1099, 1118 ["[W]e conclude that here the

27 County has not committed itself to a specific performance standard. Instead, the County has

28 committed itself to a specific mitigation goal."].) An agency must commit to implement a
mitigation measure using mandatory language. Otherwise, it does not qualify as a mitigation

Petition for Writ of Mandate -103-

measure. (CEQA Guidelines, sec. 15126.4, subd. (a)(2); California Clean Energy Committee v.

2 City of Woodland (2014) 225 Cal. App.4th 173, 199.)

3 353. As one court explained:

4 Numerous cases illustrate that reliance on tentative plans for future mitigation after
completion of the CEQA process significantly undermines CEQA's goals of full 5 disclosure and informed decision making; and consequently, these mitigation plans

6 have been overturned on judicial review as constituting improper deferral of environmental {Slip Opn. Page 23} assessment. (See, e.g., Gentry v. Murrieta
7 (1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 1359, 1396 ( Gentry ) [conditioning a permit on "recommendations of a report that had yet to be performed" constituted improper
8 deferral of mitigation]; Defend the Bay v. City of Irvine (2004) 119 Cal.App.4th 1261, 1275 [deferral is impermissible when the agency "simply requires a project 9 applicant to obtain a biological report and then comply with any recommendations
10 that may be made in the report"]; Endangered Habitats League, Inc. v. County of Orange (2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 777, 794 ["mitigation measure [that] does no
11 more than require a report be prepared and followed,. without setting any standards" found improper deferral]; Sundstrom , supra , 202 Cal.App.3d at p. 306
12 [future study of hydrology and sewer disposal problems held impermissible];

13 Quail Botanical Gardens Foundation, Inc. V. City of Encinitas (1994) 29
Cal.App.4th 1597, 1605, fn. 4 [city is 4 prohibited from relying on "post approval
14 mitigation measures adopted during the subsequent design review process"].)

15 (Communities for a Better Environment v. City of Richmond (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 70 92-93.]

16 C) Under specified limited circumstances an exception allows mitigation

17 measures to be deferred.

18 354. Generally, an agency cannot rely on mitigating a significant impact by developing a

19 mitigation plan after project approval. "The CEQA process demands that mitigation measures
timely be set forth, that environmental information be complete and relevant, and that
20 environmental decisions be made in an accountable arena." (Oro Fino Gold Mining Corporation
21 V. County of El Dorado (3d Dist. 1990) 225 Cal.App.3d 872, 884-885.)
22 355. However, deferral may be permissible if the agency states a valid reason why deferral is

23 necessary, displays commitment to mitigating the impacts, lists a menu of feasible mitigation

24 measures, and identifies performance criteria that the measures must satisfy. (Sacramento Old

25 City Association v. City Council of Sacramento (3d Dist. 1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 1011,
1028-1029.) An agency may not defer adopting specific mitigation measures by adopting merely 26 a "mitigation goal" without specific performance criteria and a menu of feasible mitigation a
27 measures. Similarly, merely committing to study an impact or the feasibility of its mitigation in
28 the future is not sufficient. (See Gray v. County of Madera (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1099, 1118-

Petition for Writ of Mandate -104-

P 1119.) Mitigation measures are improperly deferred when there is no commitment to a specific
2 performance criteria, and the mitigation is not in place at the time of project implementation.
(POET v. California Air Resources Board (2013) 218 Cal.App.4th 681.)

4
D) Some adopted "mitigation measures" do not meet the requirement that 5 there is a reason to defer mitigation.
6

7 356. RP-1F, developing the mitigation for conversion of Resource Production land, was
already completed. The issue was already thoroughly studied for ten years and addressed by local
o stakeholders, local experts, County planning staff and consultants, and mitigation recommended

10 by the State Department of Conservation. Nothing more needs to be done that was not done

11 during the 13-year GPU process. There is no justification for deferring the adoption of a
mitigation measure.
12 357. COS-8A calls for identifying Native American cultural resource sensitive areas. This 13 preliminary planning task should have been done during the GPU EIR process. Consultation with
14 Native American tribes is a mandatory part of the GPU process. The cultural sites have not
15 moved, and will not be any easier to locate in the future. There was no need to defer this

16 mitigation measure to an unspecified time in the future.

17 358. COS-4N, mitigation to protect riparian corridors was already completed. It was

18 developed by County staff and expert consultants for inclusion directly into the GPU for
immediate implementation. It was supported by commenters at the Planning Commission hearing 19 in May and June of 2019. There is no justification for deferring the development of this
20 mitigation.

21 359. PF-2J is about protecting groundwater recharge areas. However, the time to identify and
22 protect these areas is during the GPU EIR, SO that these areas are not designated for intensive

23 development. Deferring that analysis does not facilitate mitigation, it undercuts options for

24 protecting these areas.
360. COS 51 calls for investigating the potential uses of woody biomass. This preliminary 25 planning task should have been done during the GPU. There is no reason stated for delaying the
26 investigation to some indefinite time in the future. There is nothing inherent in any of these
27 mitigation efforts that necessitates their deferral.

28

Petition for Writ of Mandate -105-

E) One "deferred mitigation measures" was tried before and failed.

2 361. Completing and applying deferred general plan mitigation measures will only begin when

3 they are selected as priorities by the Board of Supervisors on an annual basis. There are 43

4 zoning ordinance updates, and 81 other items that are deferred specific actions to implement the
GPU, that have no due dates or implementation timelines. Because all of these measures are
5 conditioned on future selection by the BOS for before their development can even begin, there is
6 no enforceable commitment to adopt any of them.
7 362. One of the mitigation measures has been tried before and failed to result in

8 implementation by the County. PF-4C calls for funding for law enforcement. The Sherriff

9 completed a nexus study for impact fees in 2008 under the prior general plan, but the BOS

10 refused to adopt the mitigation fee. It is not a good faith effort at disclosure for the County to

11 refrain from disclosing this failing in the EIR.. It is disingenuous for the County to claim it is
"deferring" this measures, if it is actually just continuing to evade its adoption.
12

13 F) Some deferred "mitigation measures" in the General Plan Update might
14 not meet the standard for timely implementation.

15 363. It is not unusual for a General Plan to defer some impact mitigation until an updated

16 zoning ordinance is approved. Thus it is not unusual that three mitigation measures call for the

17 approval of code amendments or standards: LU-4A Community Design Standards, RP-4A
Amend County Code (Mineral Resources), and COS-5E Alternative Energy. However, the GPU
18 calls for 43 different ordinance updates, and does not give those that mitigate impact any priority.
19 timelines, due dates. Without due dates, implementation timelines, or priorities pursuant to
20 CEQA, the zoning ordinance changes need only be made within a reasonable time after GPU

21 approval. Each of the 43 different ordinance updates will only begin when the Board of

22 Supervisors makes them a priority during one of its annual implementation priority setting

23 meetings.
364. It is important to note that the project review staff of the Planning Department will be 24 busy attending to its own additional duties under the GPU. Over two dozen of the GPU
25 implementation measures require specific studies to be completed by development project
26 applicants. Those studies are to be reviewed by County project review staff. The result will be
27 crafting project-specific mitigation measures. Thus, it is unlikely that project review staff will

28 have spare time to help with implementing the rest of the general plan.

Petition for Writ of Mandate - 106-

2 365. It took years to adopt just the one ordinance regarding commercial cannabis cultivation.
It is unlikely that the 43 different zoning updates will be completed in the 20-year horizon of the

A General Plan Update. It is even less likely that those zoning updates relied upon as mitigation

5 measures will be implemented in time to avoid the impacts of developments approved under the
GPU.

7 2) THE COUNTY RESCINDED COMMUNITY PLAN POLICIES THAT HAVE

8 MITIGATED IMPACTS IN COMMUNITIES FOR DECADES WITHOUT

LO MAKING FINDINGS BASED UPON SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE IN THE

10 RECORD THAT THE POLICIES ARE NOW INFEASIBLE.

11 366. The courts have explained the reason that mitigation measures must be enforceable, and

12 must be monitored to ensure that they are implemented. "The purpose of these requirements is to

13 ensure that feasible mitigation measures will actually be implemented as a condition of

14 development, and not merely adopted and then neglected or disregarded. (See § 21002.1, subd.
(b).)" (Federation of Hillside & Canyon Associations v. City of Los Angeles (2000) 83

15 Cal.App.4th 1252, 1260 - 1261.) CEQA requires that mitigation measures actually be

16 implemented, not merely adopted and then neglected or disregarded. (Anderson First Coalition

17 City of Anderson (2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 1173.) However, "Mitigation measures adopted when

18 a project is approved may be changed or deleted if the agency states a legitimate reason for

19 making the changes and the reason is supported by substantial evidence. (Napa Citizens for

20 Honest Government v. Napa County Bd. of Supervisors (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 342, 359.)" (From
Mani Brothers Real Estate Group v. City of Los Angeles (2007) 153 Cal.App.4tn 1385, 1403.)

21 367. The 1996 General Plan includes the special plan for Rancho Calaveras, and the

22 community plans for Valley Springs, San Andreas, Mokelumne Hill, Mountain Ranch,

23 Murphys/Douglas Flat, Avery/Hathaway Pines, Arnold, and Ebbetts Pass. At the beginning of

24 the General Plan Update process, it was envisioned that the General Plan Update would include

25 the Community Plans. (Mintier & Associates, General Plan Update Work Program, December
2006, p. 5)

26 368. During the General Plan Update, efforts were made to update the community plans for

27 Valley Springs, San Andreas, Mokelumne Hill, and Mountain Ranch. In addition, community

28 plans were drafted for Copperopolis, Railroad Flat/Glencoe, West Point, Paloma, and Sheep

Petition for Writ of Mandate - 107-

P Ranch. These efforts included numerous public meetings to come to agreement on the terms of
2 these plans.

au A u 369. The Copperopolis Community Plan, in process since 1992, was edited down to three
pages in. 2013. After two competing plans were completed for Valley Springs in 2010 (the COG
facilitated Plan and the "Citizen Committee" Plan), the combined Valley Springs Community
Plan, which is a hybrid of the two plans, was presented to the Planning Department and the
Valley Springs Supervisor in in 2016. In January 2017, the Planning Director submitted to the
7 Planning Commission a pared down version of the blended plan (four and a half pages of text)
suitable for inclusion in the Community Planning Element, but it has yet to be adopted.

9 370. In June of 2015, the Supervisors directed the Planning Department to include in the

10 General Plan Update the Community Plans from Rancho Calaveras, San Andreas, and District 2.

11 The County Planning Department has only included selected text and selected policies from these
community plans in the General Plan Update.
12 372. Since that time, the County completed a Draft Environmental Impact Report (DEIR) for
13 the General Plan Update. That DEIR identifies many impacts as significant and unavoidable.
14 However, a closer look at the community plans indicates that these plans have many policies that

15 qualify as mitigation measures under CEQA.

16 373. To reject as infeasible a measure to mitigate a significant impact, a lead agency must have

a
17 valid finding that the proposed mitigation measure is infeasible. (Masonite Corp. v. County of
Mendocino (2013) 218 Cal.App.4th 230.) "Mitigation measures adopted when a project is 18 approved may be changed or deleted if the agency states a legitimate reason for making the
19 changes and the reason is supported by substantial evidence. (Napa Citizens for Honest
20 Government v. Napa County Bd. of Supervisors (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 342, 359.)" (From Mani

21 Brothers Real Estate Group v. City of Los Angeles (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1403).

22 Thus, whether removing existing mitigations measures from an existing general plan, or rejecting

23 new mitigation measures proposed for the general plan update, the County must demonstrate,
based upon substantial evidence in the record, that these measures are infeasible. The County
24 must show that there is some technical, legal, or fiscal barrier that makes implementing these
25 measures impossible. (CEQA Guidelines, sec. 15091.) With regard to those policies in the
26 existing community plans, that have been reducing impacts in communities for decades, the

27 County has failed to make a valid finding that somehow, all of a sudden, these policies have

28 become infeasible.

2 374. The provisions of four community plans (Arnold, Murphys & Douglas Flat, Avery-

3 Hathaway Pines, and Valley Springs) qualify as CEQA mitigation measures. (CPC, March 20

A memo on Community Plans as Mitigation, pp. 3-17) The Board of Supervisors refused to include

5 these community plan provisions in the General Plan Update, but failed to make specific findings

6 of fact explaining why each was infeasible, or why the General Plan Update provided superior
impact mitigation.

7 375. The District 2 draft community plans produced by the people included additional

8 mitigation measures, but they were not included in the GPU. The Board of Supervisors failed to
make specific findings of fact explaining why each was infeasible, or why the General Plan
Update provided superior impact mitigation.

12 3) THE COUNTY' REJECTED MITIGATION MEASURES SUGGESTIONS

13 WITHOUT MAKING WELL-REASONED WRITTEN FINDINGS BASED UPON
SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE REFERENCED IN THE RECORD THAT THE

14 SUGGESTED MITIGATION MEASURES ARE INFEASIBLE.

15

16 A) CEQA findings of fact must trace the logical route from the agency's

17 ultimate conclusion to the substantial evidence in the record.

18 376. CEQA Guidelines Section 15091 requires that an agency make specific findings of fact.

19 Those findings must be supported by substantial evidence in the record, and they must bridge the

20 analytical gap between the evidence in the record and the ultimate conclusion of the agency.
(Cal. Code Regs., tit 14, sec. 15091; Laurel Heights Improvement Association v. Regents of the

21 University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376 [Substantial evidence supported the findings that

22 the project's impacts would be less than significant]; Save Round Valley Alliance (2007) 157

23 Cal.App.4th 1437 [CEQA findings must disclose the analytical route traveled from evidence to
action.])

24

25 377. CEQA requires that findings be made for each significant effect identified in the EIR: (1)

26 mitigation has been adopted, (2) the agency lacks jurisdiction to make the changes but others
should, and/or (3) specific economic, social, technological, or other considerations make

27 mitigation or alternatives infeasible. (Sacramento Old City Association v. City Council (1991)

28 229 Cal.App.3d 1011; See also County of San Diego v. Grossmont-Cuyamaca Community
College District (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 86; Citizens for Quality Growth v. City of Mt. Shasta

(App. 3 Dist. 1988) 198 Cal.App.3d 433 [City violated CEQA when it failed to make findings

2 adopting or rejecting proposed mitigation measures]; Environmental Council of Sacramento v.

3 Sacramento County (App. 3 Dist. 1982) 135 Cal.App.3d 428 [The County erred in failing to make

4 findings of mitigation before it amended the general plan].)

5 378. Agencies cannot approve a project as proposed if feasible mitigation measures are
available that can substantially lessen the significant environmental effects. (Mountain Lion
6 Foundation v. Fish and Game Commission (1997) 16 Cal.4th 104, 134; Sierra Club v. State Board
7 of Forestry (1994) 7 Cal.4th 1215, 1233; Citizens for Quality Growth v. City of Mount Shasta
(App. 3rd Dist. 1988) 198 Cal.App.3d 433, 440-441.) The CEQA process is an "interactive
process of assessment of environmental impacts and responsive project modification which must

10 be genuine. (County of Orange v. Superior Court (2003) 113 Cal.App.4th 1, 10) Local

11 governments, state agencies, community organizations, and individuals play a vital role in the
CEQA process when they identify feasible measures to mitigate the significant impacts of the
12 proposed project. (Sutter Sensible Planning, Inc. v. Board of Supervisors (App. 3rd Dist. 1981)
13 122 Cal.App.3ra 813, 820 [comments are an integral part of an EIR]; Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14,
14 secs. 15086 & 15087.)

15 379. Even when specific mitigation measures may need to wait until the specific development

16 is proposed, general mitigation measures may be adopted with the adoption of a general plan.

17 (Citizens for Quality Growth City of Mount Shasta (App. 3rd Dist. 1988) 198 Cal.App.3d 433,
442.) A Program EIR such as the one at issue is supposed to focus on programwide mitigation.
18 (CEQA Guidelines, sec. 15168.)
19 380. However, an agency can approve a project that has residual significant impacts if it
20 makes findings that further mitigation measures are not feasible, and that the projects other

21 benefits outweigh its harm to the environment. (Public Resources Code, Sec. 21002, 21081; Cal.

22 Code Regs., tit. 14, secs. 15091 to 15092.) To be valid, findings rejecting mitigation measures as

23 infeasible must be based upon substantial evidence. That evidence must be specific and concretel,
such as the presentation of comparative data and analysis. (Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Board of
24 Supervisors (App. 2 Dist. 1988) 197 Cal.App.3d 1167, 1180-1183.) "Argument, speculation,
25 unsubstantiated opinion, or narrative evidence which is clearly erroneous or inaccurate ... does

26 not constitute substantial evidence." (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, sec. 15384.) The findings must

27 "bridge the analytical gap between the raw evidence and the ultimate decision," and reveal the

28 "analytic route the agency traveled from evidence to action." (Topanga Association for a Scenic

Petition for Writ of Mandate - 110-

Community v. County of Los Angeles (1974) 11 Cal.3d 506, 514-516.) Conclusory statements
rejecting mitigation measures are inadequate. (Village Laguna of Laguna Beach v. Board of
Supervisors (App. 4th Dist. 1982) 134 Cal.App.3ra 1022, 1035-1035.)
a u A 381. To reject additional mitigation measures, a lead agency's findings may claim that the
mitigation measures adopted will be sufficient to reduce the impact to a level of insignificance.
However, a lead agency must have substantial evidence that mitigation is feasible and will be

7 effective. (Gray v. County of Madera (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1099, 1116-1118.) "A clearly

8 inadequate study is entitled to no judicial deference." (Laurel Heights Improvement Association

9 of San Francisco V. Regents of the University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 422 &409 fn.
12.)

10
11 382. To reject as infeasible measures to mitigate a significant impact, a lead agency must have
a valid finding that each of the proposed mitigation measure is infeasible. The agency must show

12 that there is some economic, environmental, legal, social, or technological barrier that makes

13 implementing each of these measures impossible. (CEQA Guidelines, sec. 150364.) It is an

14 abuse of discretion to reject alternatives or mitigation measures that would reduce adverse

15 impacts without supporting substantial evidence. (Sierra Club v. County of San Diego (2014) 231
Cal.App.4th 1152, 1175-1176.)

16

17 B) The need for additional flexibility for economic development and the

18 protection of property rights is an unsupported rationale for rejecting

19 mitigation measures, as it presents a false choice, and it undermines the basic
intent of CEQA.
20

21 383. The County's major premise justifying the rejection of mitigation measures is:

22 One of the primary objectives of the General Plan is to provide the flexibility desired and

23 necessary to meet the needs of the County, while protecting property rights and promoting

24 economic prosperity. Many of the mitigation measures suggested during the comment period would prevent the County from achieving these project objectives and are therefore

25 infeasible mitigation measures.' (Board Packet, p. 141, see also for example pp. 150, 152 .154, 156, 159, 161, 163, 166.)

26 By definition, mitigation measures are mandatory and enforceable. If allowed to stand, the logic

27 of the findings would give any agency a free pass to avoid complying with all the mitigation

28 requirements of CEQA, and completely undermine the intent of CEQA to avoid unnecessary

Petition for Writ of Mandate - 111-

harm to the environment, by relying on an oversimplified generalization. The finding is not based

2 upon reason and evidence, but upon unsupported presumptions and false choices.

3 1) The level of flexibility intended by the legislature is already inherent

4 in the planning process.

5 384. The claim in the findings that the desire for flexibility wipes out mitigation
6 responsibilities, is consistent with the philosophy of some members of the public who argued that

7 the General Plan Update must be "flexible," and who opposed commitments to impact mitigation.

8 They view some mitigation measures as unsuitable government intrusion into private property

9 rights. The reluctance on the part of some public officials and their constituents to mitigate
environmental impacts is the very reason that the law requires that these mitigation measures be 10 mandatory and enforceable.
11

12 385. On the surface, the desire to be flexible and to leave one's options open is
understandable. Under certain circumstances such flexibility is beneficial. That is why
13 applicants for zone changes have the option to seek variances when the strict application of the
14 ordinance would be unfair under the circumstances. That is why many general plan policies can
15 be optional. That is why program-level mitigation may be deemed infeasible under the

16 circumstances when applied to a specific project. That is why a general plan may be amended up

17 to four times per year to allow mitigation measures an opportunity to evolve. All of these

18 reasonable provisions for flexibility are already in existing planning law and CEQA.

19 386. No law says that every policy in the general plan has to be mandatory. Plenty of policies

20 in the general plan can be and are optional. A zoning ordinance that implements mandatory

21 program level mitigation programs can include circumstances when variances are allowed. This
appropriate level of flexibility is already inherent in planning law. What is not allowed is
22 refusing to adopt the feasible mitigation programs in the first place, and refusing to apply them in
23 most instances. We know that people will pursue residential and economic development in the
24 next generation under the General Plan Update based upon their own financial self-interest. What

25 CEQA ensures is that this development will be balanced by a parallel commitment on the part of

26 local governments to protect health, safety, and natural resources in the public interest.

27

2 2) The findings do not point to substantial evidence in the record
demonstrating which if any proposed mitigation measures would harm

3 property rights and economic development.

4 387. The findings seek to dispense with mitigation measures to keep a flexible general plan.
Some see the apparent lack of regulation as a way to promote property rights and economic

6 development. They believe that plan flexibility gives the Planning Commission and the Board of

7 Supervisors greater power to approve a broader spectrum of private development projects
regardless of the harm to the larger community. Some believe that state law requirements for
specificity and impact mitigation are unconstitutional interferences with their property rights.

10 Others would rather have the Board approve the projects (lawful or not) and force the violated

11 members of the public to seek legal recourse. These arguments, speculations, and unsubstantiated
opinions do not constitute substantial evidence.

12

13 388. The desire to protect property rights and to dispense with unnecessary regulation is

14 understandable. However, the problem with trying to deregulate the development project review
process at the county level is that many of the development requirements are actually imposed by

15 state law. For example, a specific plan includes "Standards and criteria" as well as

16 "implementation measures, including regulations" to address natural resource conservation and

17 the financing of public infrastructure. (Government Code, sec. 65451.) A large subdivision must

18 be designed for passive heating or cooling, must provide for a sufficient water supply, must avoid

19 substantial environmental damage, must not cause serious public health problems, must not result

20 in violations of regional water quality control board requirements, and must meet fire safety
standards including those for emergency ingress and egress. (See Section VI, B, 7, Government

21 Code, secs. 66473.1 - 66474.6.) Thus, while the County has the power to ignore these

22 reasonable requirements when approving development projects, those approvals can be set aside

23 by the courts, for the County has no legal authority to make such approvals. Given these

24 circumstances, those seeking to deregulate the County's development review process should

25 instead seek reforms at the State Legislature where the development requirement laws can
actually be changed.

26

27 389. Attempting to continue on the path of legal violations in the hope of promoting freedom

28 and economic development will not stimulate investments in the local economy. It will only lead
to further economic stagnation and litigation in this county, while people with capital to invest go

Petition for Writ of Mandate -113-

-

2 to other counties where their investments will be less risky. Trying to develop in the absence of

3 clear standards and safe regulatory harbors will not make people free to do what they want with
their land. It will make them slaves to the whims of the Board of Supervisors and to litigious

4 development opponents. Because virtually all the County's discretionary decisions regarding

5 public and private development projects must be consistent with a valid general plan, a

6 substandard general plan a and a substandard environmental impact report cripple the valid exercise
of property rights to develop real estate.
7

8 390. The CPC's members would prefer that the County comply with planning and

9 environmental laws that have been on the books for decades and found constitutional. They

10 would like the County to finally establish development standards and programs that mitigate

11 impacts so that there is no need for repetitious and divisive debates about the same issues for each
project that comes along. They would prefer that the Board of Supervisors make legally valid

12 project approvals to protect the interests of both project applicants and existing residents.

13

14 3) Mitigation measures can actually protect the exercise of property
rights.

15

16 391.A perhaps counter-intuitive effect of mitigation measures is that some measures actually
support more people exercising their property rights. They do this by cutting the impact pie into

17 smaller pieces, so that more development can occur before so many impacts accumulate as to

18 reach thresholds that might stop development. For example, if there are ten developments

19 awaiting approval, and the first five developers wastefully use up all of the available sewer

20 capacity, then the last five developments have to wait, and wait, and wait, for a new sewer

21 expansion. On the other hand, if the wastewater impacts are cut in half for each development,

22 then all ten could proceed. In this way, the best mitigation measures prevent unnecessary
development impediments.

23

24 392. Also, some mitigation measures serve a regulatory function to avoid producers from

25 externalizing costs and harming people and the environment. Development projects that
unnecessarily foul the air, make noise, or destroy scenic vistas avoid imposing these costs on their

26 consumers, and instead foist these costs on other people and the environment. Thus, in an un-

27 regulated market, they will succeed over their competition, and an inefficient excess of harm will

28 result. Mitigation measures regulate these activities to avoid this excessive harm. In this way,

I some good mitigation measures help to cure a resource allocation flaw in the market. In the past

2 these flaws have caused great harm, including harm to the rights of neighboring property owners.

0 + 10 o 393. Finally, some mitigation measures support property values by keeping communities and
homes more desirable. For example, the scenic open space in conserved forests and agricultural
lands gives neighboring properties value. Mitigation programs that compensate people for
providing public benefits cure a flaw in a the free market that would otherwise under-produce these
cares about property rights and property value, it makes sense to 7 public goods. So, if one really
adopt such additional mitigation measures.
8
394. However, the findings of fact simply paint all rejected mitigation measures with the same C brush (i.e. harmful to property rights and economic development), without considering each
10 measure on its own merits. Such finding, based upon unsubstantiated opinion rather than
11 substantial evidence, lacks validity.
12 4) Additional GPU impact mitigation might not prevent economic
13 prosperity, but could expedite project review and finance the
14 infrastructure needed for economic development.
15 395. By mitigating the significant environmental impacts of development at the general plan
16 level, the County would facilitate prompt and lawful future approvals of specific plans,
17 subdivisions, and use permits. This is because the impact mitigation issues raised in the general

18 plan can and do come up with regard to the discretionary approval of specific plans, subdivisions,

19 and use permits. Filling the gaps in the County Code with standards to mitigate development

20 impacts both facilitates project approvals, and protects health, safety, welfare, and the
environment. By the way, this is no accident. California planning and environmental law is 21 integrated to achieve this result. To efficiently comply with the law, a county that adopts
22 mitigation programs in its general plan, refines them (if needed) in its zoning ordinance, applies
23 them to development proposals, and implements them in the field.
24 396. There will be adverse fiscal impacts on the County without the proper and timely
25 employment of impact mitigation fee programs under CEQA. Failure to promptly establish and
26 collect the maximum "fair-share" impact mitigation fees across the spectrum of significant

27 impacts places an unfair burden on existing taxpayers and ratepayers to provide new and/or

28 improved infrastructure in the future. These developer impact fees are not an undue burden on

Petition for Writ of Mandate -115-

economic development. They are simply charges for the costs of providing the public goods

2 (roads, water, sewer, etc.) necessary to support new development.

0) 397. If these costs are not paid by developers and new residents through impact fees, the costs
are passed on to existing residents in one of two ways. One way is that the level of infrastructure
ün a and services declines, e.g., roads get crowded, water supplies get rationed more severely,
electricity browns out more often, etc. A second way the costs are passed on is through higher
rates and taxes to
7 pay for infrastructure expansions. As some would say, there is no "free lunch.'
Also, as economists would say, we cannot afford "free riders," those who will use the
8 infrastructure without paying for their share of it.
9

10 398. The findings contend that mitigation regulations and impact fees will impede economic
development. However, the findings point to no evidence that there is a direct correlation
11 between the shortness of a county code and the economic prosperity of the county. Some
12 counties with huge economies have very long county codes filled with regulations. Regulation
13 has not choked prosperity in these areas. Counties with short county codes and fewer regulations

14 can be ranked very low on the scale of economic prosperity. Lack of regulation has not spurred

15 these local economies to success.

16 399. Nor do the findings point to substantial evidence in the record that a detailed general plan

17 or high development fees has stopped economic development in the region. In fact, the evidencel

18 in the record demonstrates that economic development can thrive where there is a detailed general
plan and high impact mitigation fees. The record does include evidence that, in 2004, EI Dorado
19 County approved a valid and detailed general plan with a commitment for traffic impact
20 mitigation fees. In 2006, El Dorado determined that it needed to generate over $500 million from
21 developers to build the roads needed to serve new development. (TIM Fee Report 2006, p. 20.)

22 That put traffic impact fees in some parts of the County at over $13,000 per house. (Final TIM

23 Fee EIR, p. 19.) Nevertheless, from 2000 to 2009, El Dorado County produced over 15,000 units

24 of housing and 5 million square feet of non-residential/ job generating land uses. (EI Dorado

25 Hills Workshop, pp. 12-13.)

26 400. Calaveras County has tried the flexible/vague regulation approach for decades. The

27 result is a County with home values $150,000 below the statewide average. (Census Bureau
Quick Facts, p. 2.) It is time for the County to try to specify development standards to provide
28

Petition for Writ of Mandate -116-

2 investors with financial security and existing residents with impact mitigation equity. It is time for the County to try to fully fund the infrastructure needed for economic development.

0aUA 401. With regard to the efficacy of this approach in streamlining development review, the
County did not have to take the CPC's word for it. All they had to do is look at the
recommendation of one of the County's outside legal counsels on land use and CEQA. The
County frequently contracts with Remy, Moose and Manley for its CEQA legal work. (See Remy Moose and Manley Contract.) Senior Partner, James Moose includes this approach as among the options for completing a general plan in compliance with CEQA. While his guide provides other

10 general plan approval options as well, it does includes an entire section entitled, "The Adoption of
Stringent General Plan Language Does Provide Some Future

11 Advantages: It Can Help to
Streamline Future, Project-Specific Environmental Review." (CPC DEIR Comment

12 Attachments, Agriculture, General Plan Updates and Amendments, p. 13-15.)

13 402. CEQA has been in existence for over 45 years. Over that time, cities and counties

14 throughout California have implemented the law. Over that time, California has grown from just

15 under 20 million to just under 40 million of people. California has moved up from the ninth

16 largest economy in the world in 1991 to the fifth largest economy in the world today. (See

17 Economic Data 1991 & 2018.) All the while, other California cities and counties have managed
to mitigate the significant impacts of development

18 achieved the Legislature's policy hope that whenever feasible. In this way, CEQA has

19 "man and nature can exist in productive harmony to
fulfill the social and economic requirements of present and future generations." (Public

20 Resources Code, sec. 21001, subd. (e).)

21

22 403. The time is long overdue for Calaveras County to embrace the opportunity to implement
a this law in a way that promotes both economic development and environmental protection.

23 Because of its broad scope, its long-term application, and its many potentially significant impacts,
there is no more important decision of the

24 CEQA than the General Plan Update. Board of Supervisors upon which to properly apply

28 404. By passing CEQA and planning law, the Legislature ensured that planning for the

Petition for Writ of Mandate -117-

N differences. All government agencies, regardless of the ideology of their governing bodies, must
do all that is feasible to protect the human and natural environment when taking discretionary

A actions. Why? Because regardless of whether we prefer regulation or incentives, we all need to

5 wake up in the morning and breathe clean air, turn on the lights, flush the toilet, drink clean

6 water, eat food reared on agricultural lands, use roads get to work or to school, recreate to keep
our bodies strong, return to a safe home constructed from timber and minerals, and use the peace
and quiet of the night to enrich our minds, to say our prayers, and to get a good night's sleep.

10 C) Many mitigation findings are based on the incorrect presumption that the

11 adopted mitigation measures will be timely implemented by the County to avoid
harm from development under the GPU.

12

13 405. The adoption of many claimed mitigation measures are actually deferred indefinitely, and

14 may never be implemented. (See for example RP-4A County Code-Minerals, PF-2J Groundwater

15 Recharge, LU-5A Telecommunications Ordinance, COS-7I Parks Funding, RP-1F Resource

16 Production Land Conversion, RP-1A Code Amendment-Resource Production Lands, COS-5G
Emission Reduction, COS-5E Alternative Fuels Ordinance.)

17

18 406. Throughout the GPU process, the CPC has repeatedly asked the County to set timeframes
for completing implementation measures, and to give priority to implementation measures the

19 County claims will mitigate impacts. We also asked for measureable objectives in the GPU that

20 would specify interim expected achievements (e.g. funds to be secured by a specified time, acres

21 of habitat to be protected by a specified time) so that there was some commitment to

22 implementing mitigation measures. The County has repeatedly refused. Instead, these measures

23 will only be implemented if and when they are chosen during the Board of Supervisor's annual

24 selection process, and necessary staff and funding for the work is secured. (GPU,

25 Implementation Measure LU-1A, Annual Work Plan.). Under these circumstances, impacting
developments can be approved indefinitely, and the mitigation programs may never be

26 implemented. As we know from the previous Housing Elements, insufficient funds and staff

27 have been the excuse for numerous implementation failures. Given past implementation failures,

28 and the refusal of the County to set timeframes for implementation, the findings cannot rely on
the unsupported presumption that adopted mitigation measures will be timely implemented.

Petition for Writ of Mandate -118-

2

W0A 00 v D) Many findings are based on the incorrect presumption that regulating currently
defined discretionary development, and not regulating currently defined ministerial
or by right development, will be sufficient.

407 Upon adoption of the GPU, many of the mitigating implementation measures will only
apply to developments that are currently defined as discretionary and subject to CEQA review.
(See for example COS-5K Odors, COS-5F Air Pollution, COS-4H Biological Resources, COS-41

9 Biological Communities, COS-4P Bats, COS-4I Riparian Habitat, COS-4K Invasive Species,
COS-4N Riparian Corridors, COS-4D Oak Woodlands, COS-4M Wildlife Corridors.)

10
11 408. Discretionary projects subject to CEQA are only a small proportion of the new

12 development that happens in the County. Because the County has tens of thousands of exiting
vacant parcels where residential development is allowed by
13 right, none of these implementation
measures will mitigate the impacts that will result from such development under the GPU.

14 Similarly, because the current Agricultural Zoning and the Agricultural Tourism Zoning allow

15 many impacting projects by right or ministerial approval, none of these implementation measures

16 will mitigate the impacts from such development under the GPU.

17 409. The CPC asked the County to re-consider the list of projects that are not discretionary, or

18 to adopt objective standards for the application to all project approvals. For example, a simple
building setback from streams that

19 applies to both discretionary and ministerial projects can
protect riparian habitat that is critical for some

20 special status species. Keeping these species off
the endangered list, and avoiding development injunctions that could follow, are important to

21 both the economy and to the exercise of property rights. The Planning Department staff and

22 consultants recommended the adoption of such standards as mitigation measures. The Planning

23 Commission and the Board of Supervisors rejected the setbacks, but provided no valid

24 justification. The County imposes residential building setbacks from roads for safety and noise,

25 and even imposes setbacks from floodplains for safety, but the County refused to provide

26 setbacks from streams to avoid wasting habitat for sensitive species; the loss of which could
cripple the local and regional economy. Such findings are arbitrary because they do not reveal a

27 logical route from the evidence in the record to the County's ultimate action.

4 measures without individual logical analyses based upon facts in the record.

5 410. The findings for many classes of impacts globally reject numerous potentially feasible
A og mitigation measures without individual logical analyses based upon facts in the record. The
findings simply refer back to the EIR. (See for example findings for Aesthetics, Agriculture
Forest & Mineral, Air Quality, Biological Resources.)

411. The only consideration given proposed mitigation measures was in boilerplate responses

10 to comments on the DEIR that did not address the comments in a commensurate level of detail,

11 and did not correctly justify the rejection of the measures. (See Infusino, Inadequate Responses
to Comments on GPU DEIR, 11/7/19.)
12

13 412. Contrary to the implications in the findings, many of the suggestions were proper plan-

14 level mitigation measures. Many of the mitigation measures suggestions were drawn from
general plan elements specifically drafted for Calaveras County with the help of County staff. 15 (For example the draft Water Element, the draft Energy Element). Many measures were from
16 community plans that are currently in the exiting 1996 General Plan. Many mitigation
17 suggestions were drawn from general plans in other counties. Many mitigation proposals were
18 timely made by agencies and the public during scoping and in comments on the DEIR.

19 413. The findings reject many of these measures with the general claim that are insufficiently
20 flexible. The certainty in these proposed mitigation measures was needed to comply with-CEQA

21 As noted above, the claim that additional flexibility is needed to protect property rights and for

22 economic prosperity is not supported by evidence in the record.

23 414. This CEQA violation is highly prejudicial, as agencies and citizens went to the efforts to

24 provide feasible mitigation measures, only to have them summarily rejected by the County. The

25 County's disregard for the iterative improvement of projects expected of CEQA's public
comment process, increases the potential for significant an unnecessary harm from the GPU. 26 This CEQA violation is highly prejudicial, since it denies citizens of California the benefits of the
27 foremost principle of CEQA: "the fullest possible protection of the environment within the
28 reasonable scope of the statutory language." (Communities for a Better Environment v.

Petition for Writ of Mandate -120-

2 California Resources Agency (3rd Dist. 2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 98, 110, citing Laurel Heights
Improvement Association V. Regents of University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 390.)

4 2) The Board did not review suggested mitigation measures.

415. The findings repeat a statement to the effect that, "The Board has reviewed all additional
suggested mitigation measures and finds the suggestions infeasible." (Board Packet, pp. 149, see
also for example pp. 151, 153, 155, 158, 161, 162, 166.) This is not true.

8

O 416. In January of 2019, the CPC begged the Board of Supervisors to hold GPU workshops,

10 part to review GPU impacts and proposed mitigation measure options made in comments on the
GPU DEIR. The Board refused. Later that month the CPC submitted written and verbal

11 testimony encouraging the Board to fix the flaws in the GPU DEIR, including the impact

12 mitigation flaws. The Board again refused. The CPC presented mitigation options to the

13 Planning Commission in May and June of 2019 and asked the Commission to consider them.

14 The Planning Commission did not. In June of 2019, we asked to appeal the rejection of our

15 General Plan mitigation suggestions to the Board of Supervisors. The opportunity for an appeal

16 hearing was denied. We sent our mitigation suggestions to the Board so they could discuss them
during their July 2019 GPU hearing. With the exception of the traffic impact mitigation, the

17 Board did not. Findings must be based upon facts in the record. The facts do not
aspect of the finding. support this

18

19 417. In 2015-2016, the County Planning Commission and the Board of Supervisors made

20 wholesale changes to the GPU, that were adverse to the environment, all without the benefit of an

21 EIR and the comments of reviewers. When an EIR and public and agency suggestions for

22 reducing impacts was finally available in 2019, those suggestions for reducing impacts were not

23 given consideration by the Planning Commission and the Board of Supervisors. By not giving

24 the mitigation measures proposed by the public, organizations, and agency experts a proper

25 review, the County has failed to consider the ecological implications of its actions, and shirked its
duty to avoid unnecessary harm to the built and natural environments.

26

27 418. This inaccuracy in the findings is highly prejudicial and misleading to the public. The

28 inaccuracy does not reflect a good faith effort at full disclosure. (CEQA Guidelines, sec. 15151.)
One of the key policies in CEQA is that the EIR is to demonstrate to an apprehensive citizenry

Petition for Writ of Mandate -121-

L

2 that the agency has, in fact, analyzed and considered the ecological implications of its actions.
(CEQA Guidelines, sec. 15003.) While the events do not make such a demonstration, the

3 findings seek to remedy that with a falsehood. In this instance, two wrongs don't make a right.

4 4) THE COUNTY REFUSED TO COMPLETE AND ADOPT A MITIGAITON

5 MONITORING PLAN.

6 419. Mitigation monitoring is required to ensure that mitigation measure are not merely

7 adopted on paper and never implemented. At the time of project approval, the lead agency adopts

8 a mitigation monitoring and reporting plan to guide this ongoing process. Later, during

9 implementation of the project, agency reports confirms the implementation of mitigation

10 measures, and may report on the effectiveness of the mitigation. In the case of a General Plan,

11 these reports may take the form of the annual reports made to the Office of Planning and
Research (OPR) and to Housing and Community Development (HCD).

12

13 A) The 1-page mitigation monitoring plan is incorrect and insufficient.

14 420. The Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program (MMRP) claims that it needs no

15 detail because the mitigation measures in the GPU are "self-mitigating goals, policies, and

16 implementation measures" and that adoption of the plan "would result in implementation of all

17 mitigation measures included in this Final EIR" so that "further monitoring or reporting would
not be necessary." (Board Packet, p. 204. See also

18 pp. 137-138.) This is not entirely correct. The
MMRP explains how it will report but not how it will monitor.

19

20 B) The immediately employed mitigation measures, which can be routinely

21 implemented by planning staff, in the ordinary course of project review,
should be easy to implement.

22

23 421. It is true that some of the GPU mitigation measures are part of the over two dozen

24 implementation measures that will be immediately employed by planning staff during their
review of new discretionary project applications. (For example see IM COS-5I Air Quality, IM

25 COS-5J Asbestos, IM COS-5K Odors, PF-4d Emergency Communications, RP-1E Farmland,

26 COS-5H Air Quality Guidelines, COS-5F Air Pollution, COS-4H Biological Resources, COS-4I

27 Biological Communities, COS-4P Bats, COS-4I Riparian Habitat, COS-4K Invasive Species,

28 COS-4N Riparian Corridors, COS-4D Oak Woodlands, COS 4L Wetlands, COS-4M Wildlife

Petition for Writ of Mandate - 122-

- Corridors, COS-40 Road Crossings.) It should be a simple matter to for project-specific staff

2 reports to reflect these analyses, and for the Planning Department to report this implementation of

3 the GPU to OPR in the April annual report.

4 C) There is no guarantee that any of the deferred mitigation measures will

5 ever be implemented.

a 422. Other mitigation measures are part of the over 80 specific deferred actions, and the over
A• 40 deferred zoning ordinances. (For example see RP 4A Code Amendment - Minerals, LU-5A

8 Telecommunications Ordinance, COS-71 Park Funding, RP-1F Resource Production Land
Conversion, COS-5G Emission Reduction, COS-5E Alternative Fuels Ordinance.) These
measures will only be implemented if and when they are chosen during the Board of Supervisor'$ 10 annual selection process, and necessary funding for the work is secured. (GPU, Implementation
11 Measure LU-1A, Annual Work Plan.) . There is nothing "self-mitigating" about these measures.
12 There is no assurance that any of these measures will ever be implemented. For example, we
13 have seen many implementation measures promised in past Housing Elements that have not been

14 implemented. Nevertheless, it is true that, in its annual report to OPR, the County could identify

15 which of these mitigation programs have and have not been implemented.

16 D) The MMRP does not explain if and how mitigation effectiveness will be
monitored. 17

18 423. However, it is not clear from the 1-page mitigation monitoring and reporting plan if the

19 County intends to follow up on development projects, to see if the mitigation measures are

20 employed and are actually successful in reducing impacts. If the County intends to do such
monitoring, the MMRP does not explain how the County intends to do that for each measure. For
21 example, while the annual report might reflect that the County required 6 projects in the year to
22 do acoustical analyses and to apply noise impacts mitigation measures, the MMRP does not
23 indicate if and how the County intends to determine if those measures were implemented at the

24 project site, and if they were effective in reducing noise.

25 424. The improper drafting, evaluation, rejection, and monitoring of mitigation measures is
26 highly prejudicial to the Petitioner. Only with proper drafting, evaluation, selection, and
27 implementation of mitigation measures will the public health, safety, and the environment be

28 properly protected. Only with diligent monitoring will the people be assured that the County is

Petition for Writ of Mandate -123-

implementing successful efforts to reduce the impacts of development under the GPU. Only with

cn such diligent monitoring will decisionmakers have the information they need to know if the
measures they are imposing are working. Only with valid mitigation measures will the intent of
CEQA to avoid unnecessary environmental harm be fulfilled.
ut- B) THE COUNTY'S TREATMENT OF ALTERNATIVES VIOLATED CEQA.

6

7 425. An alternatives analysis is a supposed to look at a broad range of alternatives to reduce plan
impacts and to inform decision makers and the public. This is especially true when it is in a
8 Program EIR like the one in question. (CEQA Guidelines, secs. 15126.6, 15168.) "[T]he
9 discussion of alternatives shall focus on alternatives to the project or the location which are
10 capable of avoiding or substantially lessening any significant effects of the project, even if those

11 alternatives impede to some degree the attainment of project objectives, or would be more

12 costly." (CEQA Guidelines, sec. 15126.6, subd. (b)(1), emphasis added.) There needs to be

13 sufficient information about the alternative to allow the decisionmakers to make a rational a

14 choice. (Save Round Valley Alliance v. County of Inyo (2007) 157 Cal.App.4th 1437, emphasis
added [A decision to approve an alternative analysis based upon the "barest of facts" and "vague
15 and unsupported" conclusions" precluded informed decisionmaking and public participation and
16 was therefore an abuse of discretion.]

17 426 Under CEQA, the range of alternatives that an EIR must study in detail is defined in

18 relation to the adverse environmental impacts of the proposed project. An EIR must include a

19 description of feasible project alternatives that would substantially lessen the project's significant

20 environmental effects. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21061; Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15126.6, subds.
(d), (f).) The project's environmental effects, in turn, are determined by comparison with the
21 existing "baseline physical conditions.' (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15125, subd. (a); see County
22 of Amador v. El Dorado County Water Agency (1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 931, 952.)

23 427. "The range of feasible alternatives shall be selected and discussed in a manner to foster

24 meaningful public participation and informed decisionmaking." (CEQA Guidelines, sec. 15126.6

25 subd. (f), emphasis added.) An EIR need not consider every conceivable alternative to a project

26 or alternatives that are infeasible. (Ibid.; see also Goleta, supra, at p. 574.) [2] "In determining
the nature and scope of alternatives to be examined in an EIR, the Legislature has decreed that
27 local agencies shall be guided by the doctrine of 'feasibility.' " (Goleta, supra, 52 Cal.3d at p.
28

Petition for Writ of Mandate - 124-

- 565.) CEQA defines "feasible" as "capable of being accomplished a in a successful manner within a

2 reasonable period of time, taking into account economic, environmental, social, and technological
cA v 1no factors." (Pub. Resources Code, § 21061.1; see also Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15364.)
428. "There is no ironclad rule governing the nature or scope of the alternatives to be
discussed other than the rule of reason." (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15126.6, subd. (a).) The rule
of reason "requires the EIR to set forth only those alternatives necessary to permit a reasoned
choice" and to "examine in detail only the ones that the lead agency determines could feasibly
7 attain most of the basic objectives of the project." (Id., § 15126.6, subd. (f), [emphasis added].)

8 An EIR does not have to consider alternatives "whose effect cannot be reasonably ascertained and
whose implementation is remote and speculative." (Id., § 15126.6, subd. (f)(3).)

10 429. CEQA requires a "quantitative, comparative analysis" of the relative environmental

11 impacts and feasibility of project alternatives. An inadequate discussion of alternatives in an EIR
is an abuse of discretion. (Kings County Farm Bureau et al. v. City of Hanford (5th Dist. 1990)
12 221 Cal.App.3d 692, 730-737, [emphasis added].) An EIR must explain in detail why various
13 alternatives are deemed infeasible. This discussion of alternatives must be "meaningful" and
14 must "contain analysis sufficient to allow informed decision making." "Without meaningful

15 analysis of alternatives in the EIR, neither the courts nor the public can fulfill their proper roles in

16 the CEQA process. (Laurel Heights Improvement Association of San Francisco v. Regents of the

17 University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 403-404; See also Berkeley Keep Jets Over the
Bay Committee v. Board of Port Commissioners (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1344 [EIR ruled
18 inadequate for lacking a quantitative discussion of increased ambient nighttime noise levels].)
19 430. "The issue of feasibility arises at two different junctures: (1) in the assessment of
20 alternatives in the EIR and (2) during the agency's later consideration of whether to approve the

21 project. [Citation.] But 'differing factors come into play at each stage.' [Citation.] For the first

22 phase--inclusion in the EIR--the standard is whether the alternative is potentially feasible.

23 [Citations.] By contrast, at the second phase--the final decision on project approval--the
decisionmaking body evaluates whether the alternatives are actually feasible. [Citation.] At that 24 juncture, the decision makers may reject as infeasible alternatives that were identified in the EIR
25 as potentially feasible." (Mount Shasta Bioregional Ecology Center, quoting California Native
26 Plant Society v. City of Santa Cruz (2009) 177 Cal.App.4th 957, 981.)

27 431. An EIR should "identify any alternatives that were considered by the lead agency but

28 were rejected as infeasible during the scoping process and briefly explain the reasons underlying

Petition for Writ of Mandate -125-

a üA w N the lead agency's determination." (CEQA Guidelines, sec. 15126.6, subd. (c); Save Round Valley
Alliance v. County of Inyo (2007) 157 Cal.App.4th 1437 [A lead agency must explain why a
suggested alternative is rejected as either unable to be accomplished, not satisfying the goals of
the project, or not advantages to the environment.]; California Clean Energy Committee v. City of
Woodland (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 173, 205-206 [In rejecting an alternative an agency must
disclose the analytic route it traveled from substantial evidence to action].) The explanation for

7 rejecting alternatives must be reasoned and based upon evidence in the record. (Preservation

8 Action Council v. City of San Jose (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 1336 [Insufficient evidence to support

9 the finding that the alternative not included in the EIR was infeasible]; Uphold our Heritage v.

10 Town of Woodside (2007) 54 Cal.Rptr.3d 366 [The record did not support the City's finding that
alternatives were infeasible].)

11

12 1) THE COUNTY FAILED TO ANALYZE ANY POLICY-BASED ACTION

13 ALTERNATIVES.

14 432. Throughout the General Plan Update there have been alternatives proposed for

15 consideration. During the 2010 Alternatives Workshops held throughout the County, four

16 alternatives were discussed. The Board of Supervisors also decided to evaluate two alternatives
for community plan maps for Valley Springs in the GPU EIR. When providing input during

17 preparation of the GPU in 2013, the CPC asked for a plan that would include more of the new and

18 existing community plans and more policies from the optional water, economic, and energy

19 elements. During scoping prior to preparation of the EIR in February of 2017, the CPC proposed

20 a Success Through Accountability alternative that would reflect commitments to timely

21 implementation and monitoring, and a Community Planning Element alternative that included

22 additional community plans with implementation measures for their policies. In July of 2017, the
CPC encourage the County to evaluate 2011 Mintier General Plan as an alternative. Each of

23 these alternatives had the potential to better reduce one or more of the significant impacts of the

24 GPU. However, the comparative merits of THESE ALTERNAIVES ARE NOT ANALYZED IN

25 THE EIR. In fact NO POLICY ALTERNATIVES ARE EVALUATED IN THE EIR. Instead

26 the EIR includes only land use map-based conceptual alternatives that are not even mapped to
allow for meaningful comparative analysis.

27

28

Petition for Writ of Mandate -126-

2) THE EIR UNREASONABLY REJECTED POLICY ALTERNATIVES

2 WITHOUT A BASIS IN SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE IN THE RECORD

3

4 433. The EIR's response to comments indicated that it was infeasible to consider any policy
alternatives in the EIR. (See Response 11-169 to 11-173.) This is ridiculous. There is no CEQA
5 exception to avoid evaluating policy alternatives in an EIR. Even the General Plan Guidelines,
6 that have an entire chapter dedicated to CEQA compliance, explain that:
7 "The EIR for a general plan must describe a reasonable a range of alternatives and analyze
8 each of their effects (CEQA Guidelines § 15126.6). Each of the alternatives should avoid
9 or lessen one or more of the significant effects identified as resulting from the proposed
10 general plan. A reasonable range of alternatives would typically include different

11 levels of density and compactness, different locations and types of uses for future

12 development, and different general plan policies." (OPR, 2017 General Plan

13 Guidelines, Chapter 10, p. 271, emphasis added.)

14 435. The EIR's conclusory response to comment 11-40 indicates that the 2011 Mintier General

15 Plan was an unsuitable alternative because it "was not viable as a guiding policy document for

16 development within the County," was "deficient," and was "not consistent with policy direction
provided by the County Board of Supervisors." However, there were no examples of these
17 problems provided, and the County refused to include the 2011 Mintier General Plan in the record
18 to support its claims.
19 3) THE ANALYSIS OF ALTERNATIVES IN THE EIR IS
20 INFORMATIONALLY INADEQUATE, BECAUSE THE EIR PROVIDED
21 NEITHER SUFFICIENT DETAIL NOR A MEANINGFUL EVALUATION.

22 436. The alternative land use maps are described in the GPU EIR, but they are neither in the

23 EIR nor in the record. These maps are "conceptual". There was no way to see where the actual
boundaries of the communities changed. There was no way to see where the land use 24

25 designations would be changed. As a result, there was no way to determine where and how much
impacts would be decreased, if at all. The comparison of alternatives was a purely theoretical
26 exercise, not a meaningful evaluation of the comparative merits of three land use maps from

27 which the decisionmakers or the public could choose.

28

Petition for Writ of Mandate -127-

H

2 437. Even if the details were provided, the analysis would not have been meaningful, for the

3 alternatives would not have informed the public or the decisionmakers. Nobody in the public was
debating the merits of the alternatives evaluated. No decisionmaker had proposed the alternative

4 map concepts. Except for a few landowners near Copperopolis who made comments at the

5 Planning Commission and BOS hearing in 2019, the debates over the land use
the time the EIR was prepared. maps were over by

6

7 438. The debates that continued revolved around how best to reduce the impacts of the land
use map. Should the county promote more job-generating economic development that might
reduce commuting impacts? Should the County regulate independent property owners, or search

10 for incentives to motivate willing property owners to reduce development impacts? Were

11 prescriptive standards or performance standards needed to inform those seeking project
approvals; or should a majority of the BOS have complete and ongoing discretion to approve

12 applications on a project by project basis, regardless of the effects on communities, even those

13 communities that did not elect them? Were timelines needed for implementation programs, or

14 should the BOS have complete and ongoing discretion when and if to implement programs to

15 reduce impacts? Were community plans needed to ensure the BOS addressed local needs, or

16 should a majority of the BOS have complete and ongoing discretion to alter the fate of

17 communities, even those communities that did not elect them? Should the focus of the policies be

18 on those few developments that are coming, or be expanded to consider the health and safety of
the many people who already reside in the county? While these policy considerations were

19 reflected in proposed alternatives, the GPU EIR did not evaluate any of those policy alternatives.

20 As a result, the analysis of alternatives not only violates CEQA, but also does a great disservice to

21 the many people with diverse opinions who actively participated in the GPU process. The flawed

22 alternatives analysis failed to fairly assess the comparative merits of people's assertions, and

23 failed to present their local government representatives with the most important thing that it must:
a choice.

24

25 4) THE COUNTY'S REFUSAL TO EVALUATE POLICY

26 ALTERNATIVES, WITHOUT A VALID REASON BASED UPON
SUBSTNATIAL EVIDENCE IN THE RECORD, IS HIGHLY

27 PREJUDICIAL.

28

Petition for Writ of Mandate -128-

439. It is highly prejudicial for the county to unreasonably refuse to properly evaluate
alternatives. An agency is supposed to carefully consider alternatives to reduce the
environmental impacts of the GPU. Instead, the County rejected them without justification. The
rejections do not provide the roads to the facts in the record that supports the rejections. Thus,

u there is no way for the public (or the court) to check if the rejection is factually based, save an

6 impractical search through the entire administrative record haystack for supportive needles of

7 evidence, the County may or may not have relied upon. CEQA requires such a road map to
ensure that an agency has not irrationally jumped to a conclusion. Providing such a road map
helps potential litigants, pressed for time under a 30-day statute of limitations, to determine if

agency choices are rationally supported by evidence in the record, and are not vulnerable to legal

10 challenge. Providing a road map to the facts shows that stubborn issues were not swept under the

11 rug, and that the public and the environment are being protected. The County's failure to provide

12 road maps to the facts withholds this critical information from the public and decisionmakers, and

13 needlessly risks harm to the natural and human environments.

14

15 C THE FINAL EIR FAILED TO LAWFULLY RESPOND TO PUBLIC COMMENTS,
RESULTING IN A NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL CEQA VIOLATIONS.

16 440. CEQA has clear requirements for responding to comments on a DEIR. Section 15088 of

17 the CEQA Guidelines explain how to respond to comments on an EIR:

18 § 15088. Evaluation of and Response to Comments.

19 (a) The lead agency shall evaluate comments on environmental issues received

20 from persons who reviewed the draft EIR and shall prepare written response. The lead
agency shall respond to comments raising significant environmental issues received

21 during the noticed comment period and any extensions and may respond to late
comments.

22

23 (b) The lead agency shall provide a written proposed response, either in a printed copy or in an electronic format, to a public agency on comments made by that public

24 agency at least 10 days prior to certifying an environmental impact report.

25 (c) The written response shall describe the disposition of significant

26 environmental issues raised (e.g., revisions to the proposed project to mitigate anticipated impacts or objections). In particular, the major environmental issues raised

27 when the lead agency's position is at variance with recommendations and objections raised in the comments must be addressed in detail giving reasons why specific comments and

28 suggestions were not accepted. There must be good faith, reasoned analysis in response. Conclusory statements unsupported by factual information will not suffice.

Petition for Writ of Mandate -129-

p

2 The level of detail contained in the response, however, may correspond to the level of detail provided in the comment (i.e., responses to general comments may be general). A general response may be appropriate when a comment does not contain or specifically refer to readily available information, or does not explain the relevance of evidence submitted with the comment.

a ∞ Nat (d) The response to comments may take the form of a revision to the draft EIR or may be a separate section in the final EIR. Where the response to comments makes important changes in the information contained in the text of the draft EIR, the lead agency should either:
(1) Revise the text in the body of the EIR, or (2) Include marginal notes showing that the information is revised in the response to comments. (Emphasis added)

10
11 441. From its earliest days to the present, over four decades of CEQA case law has noted the
importance placed on adequate responses to comments. Where comments cause concern that the

12 agency may not have fully evaluated the project and its alternatives, these comments may not

13 simply be ignored. "There must be good faith, reasoned analysis in response." (People v.
County of Kern (1974) 39 Cal.App.3d 830, 841-842.)

14

15 a ....442. CDF's response to a comment regarding the efficacy of a mitigation measure was

16 inadequate where it contained no analysis of the issues, contained no specific information
justifying the rejection of the concern, and referenced a report that was unavailable.

17

18 (Environmental Protection Information Center, Inc. V. Johnson (1985) 170 Cal.App.3d 604.) "In
keeping with the statute and guidelines, an adequate EIR must respond to specific suggestions for

19 mitigating a significant environmental impact unless the suggested mitigation is facially

20 infeasible. (San Francisco Ecology Center v. City and County of San Francisco (1975) 48

21 Cal.App.3d 584, 596 [122 Cal.Rptr. 100]; Concerned Citizens of South Central L.A. V. Los

22 Angeles Unified School Dist., supra, 24 Cal.App.4th at pp. 841-842.) While the response need not

23 be exhaustive, it should evince good faith and a reasoned analysis. (San Francisco Ecology
Center, supra, 48 Cal.App.3d at p. 596; Guidelines, § 15088, subd. (b).)" (Los Angeles Unified

24 School Dist. V. City of Los Angeles (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1019, 1029.)

25 443. Ignoring non-duplicative public comments is prejudicial error. (Environmental Protection

26 and Information Center v. California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (2008) 44

27 Cal.App.4th 459.) An inadequate response to even one substantive comment can be enough to

28 justify a writ of mandate remanding the decision to the lead agency. (Gallegos v. California State
Board of Forestry (1978) 76 Cal.App.3d 945, 952-955.)

Petition for Writ of Mandate -130-

443. The requirements can be summarized as follows. First, there must be a response to the
2 comment. Second, the response must be in writing in the EIR. Third, the response must

cn describe the disposition of the issue raised. Fourth, a detailed comment must have a response at

4 the same level of detail. Fifth, the response must include reasons when suggestions in the
comments were not accepted. Sixth, there must be good faith, reasoned analysis in response. 5 Conclusory statements unsupported by factual information will not suffice. Below we identify a
6 partial list of the responses that do not meet CEQA standards.
7

1) THE COUNTY FAILED TO LAWFULLY RESPOND TO COMMENTS 7-2
AND 7-5 BY THE AGRICULTURAL COALITION RESULTING IN THE

10 IMPERMISSIBLE DEFERRAL OF MITIGATION FOR IMPACTS RESULTING
FROM THE CONVERSION OF AGRICULTURAL LANDS TO OTHER 11
DEVELOPED USES.
12

13 444. Comments 7-2 and 7-5 encouraged the County to adopt the mitigation measure proposed
14 by the Agricultural Coalition, and developed in consultation with County staff, for the conversion
15 of agricultural land to other uses through implementation of the General Plan Update. That

16 mitigation measure would have included in the general plan a 2:1 mitigation ratio for the

17 conversion of resource production lands.

18 445. In response to the comment, County staff recommended that 1:1 mitigation ratio be
applied to agricultural land (not including rangelands) pending development of a permanent
19 standard in the future. Later, the Planning Commission and the Board of Supervisors removed
20 the interim mitigation ratio, and deferred development of mitigation standards for both resource
21 production lands and agricultural land to an undetermined time in the future.

22 446. As noted above, the response must include reasons why the suggestions in the commentsi

23 were not accepted. There must be good faith, reasoned analysis in response. Conclusory

24 statements unsupported by factual information will not suffice.
447. The response does not explain why any interim mitigation standard cannot be included in
25 the General Plan. Also, the response does not explain why there needs to be another planning
26 process, at an unspecified time in the future, to address an issue already thoroughly studied and
27 addressed by local stakeholders, local experts, County planning staff and consultants, and

28 recommended by the State Department of Conservation. Nothing more needs to be done that wa$

not done during the 13-year GPU process. There is no justification for deferring the adoption of a
2 mitigation measure, and accepting significant impacts.
m 7 n 448. In addition, there does not appear to be any evidence that a 2:1 mitigation ratio for the
conversion of resource production land "could place an undue burden on new development and
unnecessarily limit new development within the County." Indeed, the use of the word "could" is
speculative, not evidentiary, and as the draft General Plan makes clear, limiting new development
6 is indeed necessary. There is a huge excess of development capacity on non-ag lands. What logic
7 says that restricting development on agricultural will chill the market for development? Whatever

8 it is, it is not explained in the response to comments.

9 449. As the EIR tells us, the Land Use Element and the Resource Production Element of the

10 Draft General Plan include 24 goals, policies, and implementation measures related to protection
of agricultural, forest, and mineral resources (DEIR, pp. 4.2-18 through 4.2-21). There is a long 11 and storied history of ranching, mining, and logging in Calaveras County. Calaveras is a right-to-
12 farm county. "Overall, agricultural production in the county rose 15% to 29 million dollars, with
13 cattle and timber, our two largest commodities leading the way. (2017 Crop Report)." Rural
14 residential development does not pay for itself. Resource production does. If Calaveras County is

15 in fact going to take its 24 goals, policies, and implementation measures designed to protect

16 resource production land seriously, then the mitigation ratio should definitely be 2:1 for

17 conversion of resource production land.

18 2) THE COUNTY FAILED TO LAWFULLY RESPOND TO COMMENT 11-18 ON
19 THE PROJECT DESCRIPTION, RESULTING IN THE IMPERMISSLBLE
20 REJECTION OF MITIGATION MEASURES THAT ARE SPECIFIC AND

21 MANDATORY.

22

23 450. Response 11-18, regarding the Project Description is inadequate. It states that the County
does not want "inflexible time frames" or too much specificity, and instead wants flexible 24 policies. However, this logic cannot be used as justification for rejecting general plan policies
25 that mitigate impacts.
26 451. By definition, mitigation must be mandatory. The intent of CEQA is to be action forcing.
27 It requires agencies to make commitments to adopt specific feasible mitigation measures. The

28 County cannot avoid the responsibility to adopt proper mitigation measures and implementation

I timeframes simply by making the project description inconsistent with the concept of specific and

2 mandatory mitigation. "'[T]he 'foremost principle' in interpreting CEQA is that the Legislature

3 intended the act to be read so as to afford the fullest possible protection to the environment within

4 the reasonable scope of the statutory language." (Communities for a Better Environment v.

5 California Resources Agency (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 98, 110; citing Laurel Heights Improvement
Association v. Regents of University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 390.) If the County's
6 manipulation of its project description to avoid impact mitigation were allowed, then CEQA
7 would not protect the environment at all. Thus, Response 11-18 is not a good faith, reasoned
analysis as required.

10 3) THE COUNTY FAILED TO LAWFULLY RESPOND TO COMMENTS 11-25,

11 11-36, 11-37, 11-41, AND 11-42 REGARDING AESTHETICS, RESULTING IN
THE FAILURE TO ADOPT PROPER MITIGATION MEAUSURES.
12

13 452. Response 11-35 is not a good faith, reasoned response explaining in detail the reason that
14 suggestions were not accepted. Response 11-35 does not explain why, after 13-year planning
15 process, the development standards and hillside guidelines must be deferred to an unidentified

16 time in the future, without the required menu of feasible measures, objective standards of

17 achievement, and commitment to adopt the program before impacts arise.
453. Also, the response mainly addresses impacts to existing designated Scenic Highways. 18 Eligible state scenic highways, which the DEIR acknowledges is the entirety of Hwy 49 and other
19 areas of Hwy. 4, are only addressed by Policy LU 4.1. Unfortunately, Policy LU 4.1 (as discussed
20 in Comment 11-36) is implemented by 3 measures that are unenforceable, and therefore not .

21 adequate means of mitigating impacts along scenic highways.

22 454. Response 11-36 is unacceptable, as is Master Response #1. The three Implementation

23 Measures or Policy LU 4.1 are deferred until an unspecified time in the future, without deferral
justification and safeguards, and so are not mitigation measures. 24 455. Response 11-37 is not a good faith, reasoned analysis in response to the comment for
25 proper mitigation measures. There is still no effective program to actually conserve and retain
26 scenic resources. There is no Implementation Measure to "encourage their (resources) retention
27 and expansion". The only IM is IM LU-5D regarding Special Events permit streamlining. This

28 does nothing to retain scenic resources. .

Petition for Writ of Mandate -133-

456. Response 11-41 is inadequate because it does not provide a sound justification for

2 deferring the implementation program, without the required menu of feasible measures, objective
standards of achievement, and commitment to adopt the program before impacts arise. There is

4 no strengthening of implementation programs to mitigate impacts of new light and glare, or new
impacts to nighttime views. Without timelines, deferred IM's are not enforceable mitigation. 5 There is little motivation to adopt a controversial dark skies ordinance. Nothing has happened to
6 pass such an ordinance for the last ten years at the Planning Commission, why should the future
be any different without a means of enforcement? "Because an EIR cannot be meaningfully
considered in a vacuum devoid of reality, a project proponent's prior environmental record is
a properly a subject of close consideration in determining the sufficiency of the proponent's

10 promises in an EIR." (Laurel Heights Improvement Association of San Francisco v. Regents of

11 the University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 420 [253 Cal.Rptr. 426.]). In short, IM LU-4B
"Adopt a dark sky ordinance" has no time frames for County implementation, thus is ineffective
12 and unenforceable.
13 457. Response 11-42 is inadequate because it is not a good faith reasoned response. Master
14 Responses #1, #2, and #3 reject timelines, specific standards and objectives for Implementation

15 Measures, making them unenforceable. This response defers development impact mitigation

16 indefinitely. Mitigation measures incorporated as Implementation Measures only work if there is

17 a "when" or "before x happens" included.
458. CEQA requires that mitigation measures be enforceable commitments to reduce or avoid
18 significant environmental impacts. (Neighbors for Smart Rail v. Exposition Metro Line
19 Construction Authority (2013) 57 Cal.4th 439, 445; CEQA Guidelines, sec. 15126.4, subd. (a)(2).)
20 An agency must commit to implement a mitigation measure using mandatory language.

21 Otherwise, it does not qualify as a mitigation measure. (CEQA Guidelines, sec. 15126.4, subd.

22 (a)(2); California Clean Energy Committee v. City of Woodland (2014) 225 Cal. App.4th 173,

23 199.) "The purpose of these requirements is to ensure that feasible mitigation measures will

24 actually be implemented as a condition of development, and not merely adopted and then
neglected or disregarded." (Federal Hillside & Canyon Associations v. City of Los Angeles (2000)
25 83 Cal.App.4th 1252, 1260-1261.) The County cannot avoid the responsibility to adopt proper
26 mitigation measures and implementation timeframes simply by making the project description
27 and plan objectives inconsistent with the concept of specific and mandatory mitigation. "[T]he

28 'foremost principle' in interpreting CEQA is that the Legislature intended the act to be read so as

Petition for Writ of Mandate -134-

N to afford the fullest possible protection to the environment within the reasonable scope of the
statutory language." (Communities for a Better Environment v. California Resources Agency

A (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 98, 110; citing Laurel Heights Improvement Association v. Regents of
University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 390.) If the County's manipulation of its project

L description and plan objectives to avoid impact mitigation were allowed, then CEQA would not
protect the environment at all.

4) THE COUNTY FAILED TO LAWFULLY RESPOND TO COMMENTS 11-109,
11-131, 11-142, 11-143, 11-144, AND IMPROPERLY APPLIED MASTER
RESPONSES 1 THROUGH 4 REGARDING LAND USE, RESULTING IN THE

10 FAILURE TO PROPERLY DRAFT, PROPERLY ADOPT, AND PROPERLY
REJECT, MITIGATION MEASURES.

11

12 459. Response 11-109 is completely inadequate because it does not respond to the point of the

13 comment. The point of the comment is that DEIR Land Use Chapter 4.9 does not reference or list

14 any Implementation Measures for Land Use and Planning goals and policies. There are no

15 specific IMs to detail how each goal and policy would be carried out, sO there is no analysis of

16 IMs or evidence that impacts of development would be mitigated. Without IMs being referenced

17 and analyzed, there is no disclosed basis for the EIR to conclude "less than significant impact"; or
"Mitigation Measures - None required."

18 460. Response 11-131 is an inadequate boilerplate response, "See Master Response #4," that

19 does not respond in good faith, with detail and supporting evidence, to explain why the

20 suggestion in the comment was not accepted. The comment provided a detailed and reasonable

21 suggestion for a mitigation to lessen potentially significant negative environmental impacts of

22 development to existing communities whose community plans would be rescinded or abandoned

23 in the draft General Plan. The suggested measure would help implement Land Use Goals and

24 Policies for these communities. The Comment requested inclusion of existing plan documents as
"Placeholders until those community plans can be revised and adopted." This was done when

25 Mariposa County adopted its general plan update. The Response did not even acknowledge this

26 suggestion. The County didn't say why it disagreed with it and did not explain why the mitigation
was not feasible.
27

28

Petition for Writ of Mandate - 135-

461. Responses 11-142, 11-143, and 11-144 are dismissive boilerplate Master Responses.
They did not explain in good faith how IMs that are optional and/or deferred without the required
∞ NaAU menu of feasible measures, objective standards of achievement, and commitment to adopt the
program before impacts arise qualify as CEQA mitigation measures. Instead, the response tries to
lump discrete comments together and use a "one-size-fits-all" response that lacks the necessary
detail to address the discrete comments.
462. As a general rule, an agency cannot rely on mitigating a significant impact by developing
a mitigation plan after project approval. "The CEQA process demands that mitigation measures
timely be set forth, that environmental information be complete and relevant, and that
• environmental decisions be made in an accountable arena." (Oro Fino Gold Mining Corporation
10 V. County of El Dorado (3d Dist. 1990) 225 Cal.App.3d 872, 884-885.)

11 463. The exception to the general rule is that deferral may be permissible under limited
circumstances. First, the agency must provide a reason why the deferral is required. (San Joaquin 12 Raptor Center v. County of Merced (207) 149 Cal.App.4th 645, 670-671.) Next, the agency must 13 display a commitment to mitigating the impacts, list a menu of feasible mitigation measures, and
14 identify performance criteria that the measures must satisfy. (Sacramento Old City Association
15 City Council of Sacramento (3d Dist. 1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 1011, 1028-1029.) An agency may

16 not defer adopting specific mitigation measures by adopting merely a "mitigation goal" without

17 specific performance criteria and a menu of feasible mitigation measures. Similarly, merely
committing to study an impact or the feasibility of its mitigation in the future is not sufficient. 18 (See Gray v. County of Madera (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1099, 1118-1119.) Mitigation measures
19 are improperly deferred when there is no commitment to a specific performance criteria, and the
20 mitigation is not in place at the time of project implementation. (POET v. California Air
21 Resources Board (2013) 218 Cal.App.4th 681.)

22 464. The response ignored the list of Land Use Element IMs provided in the comment that are

23 not commitments to mitigation. It dismissed all comments about lack of timelines, objectives, and

24 commitment, optional wording, and deferred mitigation, by referring to boilerplate Master
Responses 1, 2, and 3. These responses seem to reject all need for commitment or timelines/
25 objectives, or specificity. The Land Use Element implementation programs listed can be
26 postponed indefinitely; there is no commitment. Such implementation programs do not qualify as
27 enforceable CEQA mitigation when they include optional/vague wording, no commitment, and

28 lack timeframes for completion.

5 a) THE COUNTY FAILED TO LAWFULLY RESPOND TO COMMENT

6 11-40 ON AESTHETICS BY REFERENCING EVIDENCE OUTSIDE THE

7 RECORD TO SUPPORT ITS CLAIM THAT THE MINTIER DRAFT
GENERAL PLAN WAS NOT A VIABLE ALTERNATIVE.

8

9 465. Response 11-40 is inadequate, because the County's rejection of the request in the
comment is not supported by substantial evidence in the record. The County has not provided

10 documentation to substantiate the claim that the 2011 draft Mintier General Plan "was not viable

11 as a guiding policy document for development within the County" ..."deficient", and "not

12 consistent with policy direction provided by the County Board of Supervisors." The County

13 cannot make such allegations in the EIR regarding the Mintier Plan, and then at the same time

14 refuse to include the plan in the administrative record for the EIR. (Planning Commission General
Plan Hearing, May 22, 2019.)

15

16 466. Furthermore, the statement is far too conclusory and not sufficiently explanatory. With
which policy directions from which Board of Supervisors was the Mintier General Plan

17 inconsistent? The response does not say. The publicly released products produced by Mintier and

18 Associates were consistent with policy direction the BOS gave the consultants from 2007 until

19 they were let go in 2011. Planning staff, general plan consultants, and county supervisors have all

20 come and gone in the past 13 years of the General Plan Update. Politics and policy directions

21 have changed, and then changed again. The BOS has never even seen the Mintier General Plan.

22 County Planning Director Willis, who decided the draft was not acceptable in 2012, is long gone
from the County. The Board of Supervisors changed after the 2012 election, and changed again

23 after the elections in 2014, 2016, and 2018. Without providing the Mintier General Plan, there is

24 not substantial evidence that the Mintier General Plan and policies are not consistent with County
policy direction.

3 TO EVALUATE VIABLE POLICY ALTERNATIVES TO REDUCE

4 IMPACTS, AND FAILURE TO SUFFICIENTLY DESCRIBE THE MAP-
BASED ALTERNTIVES IN THE EIR 5

6 467. An EIR must evaluate a range of reasonable alternatives to the project capable of
7 eliminating any significant adverse environmental effects of the project, or reducing them to a
8 level of insignificance, even though the alternatives may somewhat impede attainment of project
9 objectives, or may be more costly. (Pub. Resources Code, sec. 21002; Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14,
10 sec. 15126, subd. (d) [emphasis added]; Citizens for Quality Growth v. City of Mount Shasta (3d
11 Dist. 1988) 198 Cal.App.3d 433, 443-445.)
468. Under CEQA, the range of alternatives that an EIR must study in detail is defined in 12 relation to the adverse environmental impacts of the proposed project. An EIR must include a 13 description of feasible project alternatives that would substantially lessen the project's significant
14 environmental effects. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21061; Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15126.6, subds.
15 (d), (f).) The project's environmental effects, in turn, are determined by comparison with the
16 existing "baseline physical conditions." (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15125, subd. (a); see County

17 of Amador v. El Dorado County Water Agency (1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 931, 952.)

18 (In re Bay-Delta (2008) 43 Cal.4th 1143, 1167.)
469. "The range of feasible alternatives shall be selected and discussed in a manner to foster 19 meaningful public participation and informed decisionmaking." (CEQA Guidelines, sec.
20 15126.6 subd. (f), emphasis added.) An EIR need not consider every conceivable alternative to
21 project or alternatives that are infeasible. (Ibid.; see also Goleta, supra, at p. 574.) [2] "In
22 determining the nature and scope of alternatives to be examined in an EIR, the Legislature has

23 decreed that local agencies shall be guided by the doctrine of 'feasibility.' " (Goleta, supra, 52
24 Cal.3d at p. 565.) CEQA defines "feasible" as "capable of being accomplished in a successful
manner within a reasonable period of time, taking into account economic, environmental, social, 25 and technological factors." (Pub. Resources Code, § 21061.1; see also Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14,
26 15364.)

.....470. "The issue of feasibility arises at two different junctures: (1) in the assessment of
2 alternatives in the EIR and (2) during the agency's later consideration of whether to approve the
7n project. [Citation.] But 'differing factors come into play at each stage.' [Citation.] For the first
phase--inclusion in the EIR--the standard is whether the alternative is potentially feasible.
[Citations.] By contrast, at the second phase--the final decision on project approval--the
decisionmaking body evaluates whether the alternatives are actually feasible. [Citation.] At that
6 juncture, the decision makers may reject as infeasible alternatives that were identified in the EIR
7 as potentially feasible." (Mount Shasta Bioregional Ecology Center, quoting California Native

8 Plant Society v. City of Santa Cruz (2009) 177 Cal.App.4th 957, 981.)

9 471. An appellate court reviews for substantial evidence the conclusion certain alternatives do

10 not merit extended discussion in the EIR. (Preservation Action Council v. City of San Jose (2006)

11 141 Cal.App.4th 1336 [Insufficient evidence to support the finding that the alternative not
included in the EIR was infeasible]; Uphold our Heritage v. Town of Woodside (2007) 54
12 Cal.Rptr.3d 366 [The record did not support the City's finding that alternatives were infeasible].)
13

14 472. Comments 11-169 to 11-173 explain why the EIR should have evaluated one or more

15 additional alternatives. The response to these comments are not in good faith as they do not

16 reference evidence in the record to justify excluding additional alternatives from the record.

22 REGARDING LAND USE, RESULTING IN THE FAILURE TO INCLUDE
NECESSARY IMPACT ANALYSES IN THE FINAL EIR. 23

24 573. Response 11-102 is inadequate because it does not respond in good faith to the comment.
25 It does not answer the comment's request, and does not recognize the need to analyze the ALUCP
26 (Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan) for land use conflicts or inconsistencies with the Draft

27 General Plan and Land Use Map, and to list any conflicts in the EIR. This is a standard impact

28 analysis recognized in initial studies, and carried out in EIRs. The response is not responsive.

Petition for Writ of Mandate -139-

- 574. Response 11-103 is inadequate as it does not respond in good faith to the request that the

2 EIR evaluate conflicts between the zoning ordinance and the GPU in the EIR. Inconsistencies and

3 conflicts in land use and planning between the GPU and the county's existing zoning are NOT

4 acknowledged or analyzed in the DEIR. Again, this is a standard impact analysis recognized in
initial studies, and carried out in EIRs. IM LU-2A, referenced in the response, is not in the DEIR
5 (NO IM's are in the Land Use Chapter of the DEIR). There is no analysis of zoning consistency
6 with the General Plan, or what land use conflicts will occur after adoption of the General Plan. IM
7 LU-2A to update the Zoning Ordinance also has no timeframe for implementation.

8 575. It could take years to update Zoning. It took years to pass one ordinance regarding the

C commercial cultivation of cannabis. Not including the unknown zoning conflicts with the GPU,

10 the General Plan Update identifies the need for 43 additional zoning ordinance reviews and
updates. Thus, the analysis of conflicts between the GPU and zoning is needed if the EIR is to 11 serve its informational function. The Board of Supervisors really needs to know how much
12 rezoning it is getting itself into by adopting the General Plan Update.
13 576. Response 11-104 is inadequate because it does not answer the question of whether
14 Specific Plans have been reviewed for conflicts and consistency with the draft general plan. This

15 is a routine analysis identified in initial studies and completed in EIRs. The response just says

16 Specific Plans are required to be consistent, and would be amended after adoption.
577. The response does not explain why this potential conflict with Specific Plans is NOT 17 discussed under Impacts and Mitigations in the DEIR (as requested), or in the Land Use Element,
18 There is NO Implementation Measure for analyzing Specific Plans for consistency and amending
19 them in the draft general plan or DEIR. This information is needed in the EIR if it is to serve its
20 informational function. The Board of Supervisors really needs to know if existing specific plans

21 will need to be substantially amended after approval of the General Plan Update. Such changes

22 could affect the neighborhoods and the fiscal soundness of a major development.
578. Response 11-107 is inadequate because it does not cure the failure of the EIR to review or 23
analyze the impact of the rescision of existing adopted community plans' mandatory policies that 24 are specifically designed to mitigate impacts of development for those unique communities.
25 Existing adopted community plans, policies, and programs have not been analyzed in the DEIR.
26 Once adopted, the draft General Plan will supercede the adopted community plans, and all
27 mitigations and implementation unique to the community will be lost. Regardless of whether the

28 County considers those community plan policies as newly proposed mitigation measures, or

Petition for Writ of Mandate -140-

2 exiting mitigation measures that must be eliminated, the County needs the analysis in the EIR or

U) elsewhere in the record so that the County can make the proper CEQA findings. "We therefore

L hold that a governing body must state a legitimate reason for deleting an earlier adopted

5 mitigation measure, and must support that statement of reason with substantial evidence. If no

6 legitimate reason for the deletion has been stated, or if the evidence does not support the

7 governing body's finding, the land use plan, as modified by the deletion or deletions, is invalid
and cannot be enforced." (Napa Citizens for Honest Government v. Napa County Board of

8 Supervisors (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 342; 359.)

9 579. Response 11-115 is inadequate because it is not based upon specified evidence in the

10 record, and does not cure the failure of the DEIR to analyze the potentially significant

11 development impacts to existing established communities, due to loss of their existing specific

12 policies and implementation measures in community plans. There are mitigation

13 policies/programs in existing community plans that are NOT covered or duplicated in the Draft

14 General Plan. (See Infusino, Community plan policies can reduce the significant impacts of the
General Plan Update, 5/20/19.) This analysis is needed to properly inform decsionmakers of the

15 impacts of their decision to rescind the community plans.

16 580. Response 11-116 is inadequate because it is not responsive to the comment regarding the

17 inadequacy of DEIR's analysis of the physical impacts of development to:

18 1) established communities not included in the draft General Plan, and

19 2) all communities with existing mandatory policies and programs, that will now have those
policies abandoned or replaced by "optional" general plan programs, and

20 3) communities with no community information included or analyzed in the DEIR.

21 581. Responses 11-118 and 119 are inadequate because they do not correct the DEIR to

22 analyze the potential land use environmental impacts due to General Plan Update conflicts or

23 inconsistencies with Title 17, the Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan, or with existing, adopted
community plans.

'24

25 582. Because response 11-120 is inadequate, the DEIR remains flawed. In Impacts &

26 Mitigations 4.9-2, the DEIR does not acknowledge that the General Plan Update's land uses

27 conflict and are inconsistent with Title 17 of the County Code of Ordinances, which is a land use
and zoning regulation adopted for the purpose of avoiding or mitigating many significant

28 environmental impacts of development, such as noise, lighting, traffic, incompatible uses, loss of
open space and ag lands, and more. This is not a good faith effort at full disclosure.

9 584. Response 11-149 quotes CEQA Guidelines Section 15126.2 (a) stating, in essence, that
the impact analysis need only address changes in existing physical condition, not existing

10 deficiencies. This is only half true. CEQA first requires an accurate environmental setting.

11 Among the other relevant aspects of the environmental setting, the agency must divulge harm to

12 the environment caused by current and past mismanagement, and any efforts being made to

13 remedy that harm that might affect the proposed project. (Friends of the Eel River v. Sonoma

14 County Water Agency (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 859, 874.) The allowance of continued

15 development in the face of unfunded transportation needs is the "past mismanagement" that is the
cause of the existing deficiencies. If this is not remedied, it will cause the same impacts under the

16 General Plan Update. The EIR fails as an informational document because it refuses to address

17 this issue. The excuse for not discussing the issue is not based upon a good faith and reasoned
consideration of the County's CEQA obligations.

18

19 585. Responses 11-154, 11-155, and 11-156 relate to the comment requesting a Congestion

20 Management Program. The responses do not address the request in the comment, nor do they

21 explain why the suggestion in the comment was not accepted. The response states, "Because the
County has not adopted a congestion management plan, and is not currently required to adopt

22 such a plan per State requirements, this EIR is not required to evaluate consistency with such a

23 plan." It is true that the County has not exceeded 50,000 person threshold triggering the

24 preparation of a Congestion. However, the request was not for an assessment of consistency with

25 a plan that does not exist. The request was that the County begin a Congestion Management

26 Program as mitigation now, because traffic congestion problems are apparent and the County
population is already at 48,000 people.

actually does lists a number of conflicts between the RTP and the General Plan. Response 11-157

a1 is factually incorrect, and is not a good faith effort in response to the comment.
587. Response 11-159 addresses a comment about using LOS subcategories rather than

00 N allowing roads to degrade by an entire LOS category (e.g. C to D). The response stated that
defining minimum roadway facility operations by peak hour vehicle trips, rather than LOS, is not

a feasible. While additional subcategories of a given LOS grade may be established using other

10 factors such as average vehicle delay or volume to capacity (V/C) ratio, the County has elected
not to consider such options." Since using subcategories would reduce the allowable impacts of

11 the General Plan Update, it would mitigate impacts. The County knows of a way to reduce plan

12 impacts, but does not evaluate it in the EIR, does not explain why it is infeasible, and does not

13 adopt it as a mitigation measure. The response does not explain why the suggestion was not
adopted.
