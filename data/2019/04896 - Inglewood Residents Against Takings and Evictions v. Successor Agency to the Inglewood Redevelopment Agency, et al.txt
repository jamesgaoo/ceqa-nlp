2 INTRODUCTION

3 1. Petitioner and Plaintiff Inglewood Residents Against Takings And
4 Evictions (*Petitioner") hereby alleges violations' of the Ralph M. Brown Act,

5 Government Code section 54950 et seq. and the California Environmental Quality

6 Act, by the Successor Agency to the Inglewood Redevelopment Agency ("Successor

7 Agency") and the Oversight Board To The Successor Agency To The Inglewood

8 Redevelopment Agency ("Oversight Board") 2 (collectively, "Respondents"). These

9 violations benefited Real Party in Interest Murphy's Bowl LLC (the "Developer").

10 2. The Brown Act, also known as the California open meeting law, has a

11 clear and forcefully stated purpose: "In enacting this chapter, the Legislature finds

12 and declares that the public commissions, boards and councils and the other public
13 agencies in this State exist to aid in the conduct of the people's business. It is the
14 intent of the law that their actions be taken openly and that their deliberations be
15 conducted openly. [1] The people of this State do not yield their sovereignty to the
16 agencies which serve them. The people, in delegating authority, do not give their
17 public servants the right to decide what is good for the people to know and what is

18 not good for them to know. The people insist on remaining informed so that they may
19 retain control over the instruments they have created." (Gov. Code § 54950.)

20 3. To accomplish these vital goals, the Brown Act, inter alia, (1) requires

21 that an agenda be posted at least 72 hours before a regular meeting, (2) requires the

22

23 Petitioner concurrently submits a Notice of Lodging of First Amended Petition to detail
24 the amendments that have been made to the Petition following this Court's ruling on October 2, 2019 that the Petition for Writ of Mandate did not sufficiently state a cause of
25 action for violation of the California Environmental Quality Act, with 20 days leave to amend.
26 As explained below, as of July 1, 2018, the Successor Agency was dissolved and its powers, duties, and liabilities were taken over by the Los Angeles County Second District 27 Consolidated Översight Board. For clarity's sake, this petition refers to the Oversight

28 Board throughout but such reference includes the Second District Consolidated Oversight Board.

Printed on Recycled Paper 2 FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF PURSUANT TO CEQA AND BROWN ACT

1 agenda include a brief description that is informative to the public of the action to be

2 taken, and (3) forbids action on any item not on that agenda. In this way, the Brown

3 Act serves to facilitate public participation in all phases of local government
4 decisionmaking and to curb misuse of the democratic process by secret legislation of

5 public bodies. (San Joaquin Raptor Rescue Center v. County of Merced (2013) 216

6 Cal.App.4th 1167, 1176.)

7 4. At its June 19, 2018 meeting, Respondent Successor Agency took action on

8 a matter not properly noticed putting Petitioner and the public in a position where they

9 could not have reasonably understood the nature of the action or the implications of the

10 same. The Office of the Successor Agency formally recommended to the Board of the

11 Successor Agency that the Board request approval from the Oversight Board to
12 implement the Successor Agency's Long Range Property Management Plan ("LRPMP").

13 The implementation requested is a required initial step in the transfer of 13 parcels of

14 property that would be used for construction of a sports arena project ("Land Transfer")
15 for the Clippers professional basketball team. However, neither the notice for the

16 meeting, the agenda nor the available meeting materials specifically identify the land or

17 the reasons for the Land Transfer in a way that would adequately inform the public of the
18 nature of the action the Successor Agency purported to take. Respondents made clear
19 through email communications that the purpose of requesting the Resolution approving

20 the Land Transfer was for an arena project for the Clippers.

21 5. At its June 27, 2018 meeting, Respondent Oversight Board similarly took

22 action on a matter not properly noticed putting Petitioner and the public in a position

23 where they could not have reasonably understood the nature of the action or the
24 implications of the same. During this meeting, the Oversight Board passed Resolution

25 No. 18-OB-003, which directed the Successor Agency to dispose of the 13 parcels at
26 issueparcels comprising all Successor Agency-owned land within the site identified in

27 an exclusive negotiating agreement ("ENA")pursuant to implementation of the

28

Printed on Recycled Paper 3 FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF PURSUANT TO CEQA AND BROWN ACT

P Amended LRPMP. This Resolution was drafted with input from Murphy's Bowl

2 attorneys who represented the Clippers' interests. However, neither the notice for the

3 meeting, the agenda, nor the available meeting materials specifically identify the land or

4 the reasons for the Land Transfer in a way that would adequately inform the public of the

5 nature of the action the Oversight Board purported to take. Respondents made clear

6 through email communications that the purpose of the Resolution approving the Land

7 Transfer was for the Clippers Arena Project.

8 6. The Land Transfer would dispose properties that are included within an
9 Exclusive Negotiating Agreement ("ENA") among the City of Inglewood, the Successor
10 Agency, the Inglewood Parking Authority and Murphy's Bowl LLC for a sports arena for a

11 the Clippers basketball team (the "Arena Project").

12 7. These meetings violated the Brown Act. The Successor Agency and
13 Oversight Board failed to inform the public that they were taking actions in furtherance

14 of the effort to dispose properties pursuant to an agreement with extensive potential
15 impacts on thousands of Inglewood residents and businesses. The agenda for each
16 meeting merely stated each agency would act to implement the Long Range Property
17 Management Plan, without stating what that implementation entailed. Contrary to Brown
18 Act requirements, this description was overly vague and uninformative. It did not inform
19 the public that the property disposition actions are taken in furtherance of the ENA for

20 the Clippers Arena and involving Murphy's Bowl LLC. It failed to inform the public that

21 the 13 parcels being transferred are specifically designated in maps in the ENA for

22 construction of the Arena Project.

23 8. This failure to adequately inform the public is consistent with and further
24 evidence of the City of Inglewood's, and its related entities', deliberate attempts to
25 obfuscate the true nature of actions taken to facilitate the Clippers Arena Project. Such
26 actions were the subject of Karen Foshay's March 15, 2018 article entitled "Documents
27 Show How Inglewood Clippers Arena Deal Stayed Secret." This article included a

28

Printed on Recycled Paper FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF
MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF PURSUANT TO CEQA AND BROWN ACT

complete copy of June 9, 2017 email between Clippers and City of Inglewood

2 representatives stating "the entity [Murphy's Bowl LLC] will have a generic name so it

3 won't identify the proposed project." In fact, in a letter to the Inglewood City Council,

4 Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey even stated that such actions were

5 "concerted efforts between representatives of the city and the Murphy's Bowl LLC to
6 limit the notice given to the public . . . contrary to the spirit of the Brown Act." (Jackie
7 Lacey, Los Angeles County Dist. Atty's Off., letter to Inglewood City Council, May 17,

8 2019, emphasis added.

9 9. Respondents' actions reflect a continuing course of conduct deliberately
10 designed to obfuscate the subject of public business being conducted. These actions

11 violate the Brown Act.

12 10. Additionally, Petitioner challenges the Respondents' actions under the
13 California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"). Respondents have forced the filing of
14 this action by ignoring California's procedural rules and laws designed to ensure
15 environmental protection, ignoring the interests of the community, and rushing to
16 facilitate a sports arena development that could displace families and businesses, small
17 and large, for a billionaire's benefit. Respondents' actions, recommending and approving
18 disposal of the 13 Successor Agency parcels within the ENA Site, effectuate the Land
19 Transfer pursuant to the ENA3 for the Arena Project.
20 11. The ENA sets forth and specifically details the Arena Project's scope and
21 even defines it as a "Project." The level of detail the ENA and staff report contain on the
22 Arena Project was more than enough to complete environmental review. The ENA states
23 that Respondents will convey property "to the Developer for development as a premier
24 and state of the art National Basketball Association ('NBA') professional basketball
25 arena consisting of approximately 18,000 to 20,000 seats as well as related landscaping,
26

27 The ENA was amended and restated on August 15, 2017 but its essential terms remained the same and was approved by the Oversight Board on September 7, 2017. Therefore, this Petition 28 refers throughout to "the ENA" and, where relevant, "the Revised ENA."

Printed on Recycled Paper 5 FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF PURSUANT TO CEQA AND BROWN ACT

F parking and various other ancillary uses related to and compatible with the operation and

2 promotion of a state-of-the-art NBA arena on the Site." (ENA, at pp. 1-2.) The staff

3 report for the June 15, 2017, special meeting also confirms that the ENA's purpose is to

4 "facilitate the development of a premier and state-of-the-art National Basketball

5 Association ('NBA') professional basketball arena consisting of approximately 18,000 to
6 20,000 seats." The Arena Project's size and location are all that is needed for the City to

7 conduct environmental review as they establish the parameters of the project's impacts.

8 The ENA was followed in February 2018 by a Notice of Preparation ("NOP") of an a

9 environmental impact report, which provided further detailed description of the proposed

10 arena project. No additional information was needed to study the Arena Project's

11 environmental impacts, yet the Respondents seem to have kicked the proverbial can
12 down the road and decided to possibly do environmental review later. Thus, the ENA,

13 staff report, and NOP show that the Arena Project is detailed enough to require
14 preparation of an EIR now, as CEQA demands. (Pub. Resources Code § 21151; see also
15 Save Tara v. City of West Hollywood (2008), 45 Cal.4th 116, 130-31 [environmental
16 review must occur early enough to "influence key public decisions" but late enough so as
17 not to impede the "exploration and formulation" of projects].) Respondents' decision to
18 ignore their obligations under state law cannot and should not be countenanced.

19 12. Despite specifically defining the Arena Project in the ENA, Respondents
20 have prepared no environmental review for the Arena Project before taking actions to

21 transfer the 13 Successor Agency parcels via the recommendation and approval of
22 Resolution No. 18-OB-003. The Successor Agency already agreed that for three years it

23 would "not negotiate with or consider any offers or solicitations from, any person or
24 entity, other than the Developer, regarding: Disposition and Development Agreement
25 for the sale, lease, disposition, and/or development of the Site." (ENA, at § 2(a).) At the
26 same time, the LRPMP required that the Successor Agency disposed of the parcels within

27

28

Printed on Recycled Paper 6 FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF
MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF PURSUANT TO CEQA AND BROWN ACT

1 three years of the date of the LRPMP, or else they would be transferred to the city for
2 future development under prescribed guidelines. (OVERSIGHT AR4 2:82-84.)

3 13. Respondents' decision to approve the transfer of 13 Successor Agency

4 parcels prior to completing environmental review violates CEQA. CEQA prohibits a

5 government entity from taking actions that foreclose alternatives or potential mitigation
6 measures before performing the requisite environmental review. The request and
7 subsequent Oversight Board Resolution to transfer the 13 Successor Agency parcels

8 create significant commitments to and momentum for the Arena Project. As such,
Respondents will undoubtedly ignore the environmental impacts that any future

10 environmental review may uncover, and potentially superior alternative projects, in
11 pursuit of the Arena Project. The Land Transfer will result in significant environmental
12 impacts that must be analyzed in an Environmental Impact Report ("EIR"), disclosed to
13 the public and considered by Respondents prior to passing a Resolution to direct the Land

14 Transfer. Respondents' failure to do so violated CEQA.
15 14. Respondents' disregard for the community's and the City's well-being, of
16 their obligations under CEQA, for how the Land Transfer and the Arena Project will
17 significantly impact the environment, and the requirement to comply with the Brown
18 Act's agenda description requirements necessitate this challenge to Respondents'
19 respective purported approvals of the Land Transfer.

20 PARTIES TO THIS PROCEEDING

21 15. Petitioner Inglewood Residents Against Takings And Evictions is an
22 unincorporated association that opposes the ENA, the Land Transfer, and the City's,
23 Successor Agency's, Parking Authority's, and Oversight Board's approvals to facilitate
24 the development of the Arena Project by Developer in a residential area a and the use of
25 eminent domain to acquire property to develop the Arena Project. Petitioner and its
26 members will be adversely impacted by the Land Transfer as it will result in significant
27

28 The administrative record in this matter has been lodged with the Court, and Petitioner has objected to that record as incomplete.

Printed on Recycled Paper FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF PURSUANT TO CEQA AND BROWN ACT

l impacts to the environment including blight and urban decay, the loss of existing
2 businesses and jobs, and will facilitate development that is inconsistent with the City's
3 Zoning and General Plan. Petitioner and its members will also be adversely impacted by

4 the environmental impacts created by the Arena Project's construction and operation,
5 including impacts to air quality, traffic congestion, nighttime lighting, and noise.

6 16. Respondent and Defendant Successor Agency is responsible for overseeing

7 the winding down of redevelopment activity at the local level under the Redevelopment
8 Law, including managing existing redevelopment projects, making payments on
9 enforceable obligations, and disposing of redevelopment assets and properties. On or

10 about January 10, 2012, pursuant to the Redevelopment Law dissolution legislation (AB

11 X1 26 as amended by AB 1484), the City elected to be the Successor Agency to the

12 Redevelopment Agency of the City of Inglewood. The Redevelopment Agency was

13 officially dissolved on or about February 1, 2012.

14 17. Respondent and Defendant Oversight Board To The Successor Agency To
15 The Inglewood Redevelopment Agency is the governing body of the entity that under the
16 Health and Safety Code must approve Successor Agency agreements with the City of

17 Inglewood prior to the Successor Agency approving those agreements. Inglewood's
18 Mayor Butts was the chair of the Oversight Board at all times relevant to this action.

19 18. Respondent and Defendant Los Angeles County Second District

20 Consolidated Oversight Board is the successor in interest to the Oversight Board.

21 Pursuant to Health and Safety Code Section 34179 subdivision (j), as of July 1, 2018, the

22 Oversight Board was dissolved and its duties, responsibilities, and liabilities were taken
23 over by the Second District Consolidated Oversight Board.

24 19. Real Party in Interest, Murphy's Bowl LLC, is a Delaware Limited
25 Liability Company. Real Party in Interest is the designated developer of the Arena

26 Project under the ENA.

27

28

Printed on Recycled Paper 8 FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF PURSUANT TO CEQA AND BROWN ACT

1 20. Petitioner does not know the true names or capacities, whether individual,
2 corporate, associate or otherwise, of Respondent Does through 10, or of Real Parties in

3 Interest Roes 10-20, inclusive, and therefore sues said Respondents and Real Parties in

4 Interest under fictitious names. Petitioner will amend this Petition to show their true

5 names and capacities when and if the same has been ascertained.

6 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

7 21. This Court has jurisdiction over this proceeding pursuant to California

8 Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 and 1094.5; and Government Code sections 54960,
9 54960.1, and 54960.2; and Public Resource Code sections 21168 and 21168.5.

10 22. Venue in this Court is proper pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
11 394, in that Respondents are located within the County of Los Angeles.

12 23. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Government Code section
13 54960.1 and 54960.2 by delivering to the Oversight Board on June 29, 2018 a letter a
14 demanding that the Oversight Board cure or correct and cease and desist its Brown Act

15 violations.

16 24. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Government Code section
17 54960.1 and 54960.2 by delivering to the Successor Agency on June 29, 2018 a letter
18 demanding that the Successor Agency cure or correct and cease and desist its Brown Act
19 violations.

20 25. Neither Respondent responded to these letters.
21 THE RALPH M. BROWN ACT.

22 26. The Brown Act provides that "[a]t least 72 hours before a regular meeting,
23 the legislative body of the local agency, or its designee, shall post an agenda containing a
24 brief general description of each item of business to be transacted or discussed at the
25 meeting, including items to be discussed in closed session. A brief general description of
26 an item generally need not exceed 20 words. The agenda shall specify the time and
27 location of the regular meeting and shall be posted in a location that is freely accessible to
28

Printed on Recycled Paper 9 FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF PURSUANT TO CEQA AND BROWN ACT

1 members of the public and on the local agency's Internet Web site, if the local agency has
2 one." (Gov. Code § 54954.2 subd. (a)(1).)

3 27. The Brown Act further provides that "[n]o action or discussion shall be

4 undertaken on any item not appearing on the posted agenda, except that members of a
5 legislative body or its staff may briefly respond to statements made or questions posed by
6 persons exercising their public testimony rights under Section 54954.3." (Gov. Code §
7 54954.2 subd. (a)(3).)

8

9 CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT

10 28. The CEQA Guidelines require "all phases of project planning,

11 implementation, and operation" to be considered in the Initial Study for a project.
12 (Guidelines §15063, subd. (a)(1).) CEQA defines a project as "the whole of an action,

13 which has a potential for resulting in either a direct physical change to the environment,

14 or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment." (Guidelines §

15 15378, subd. (a).)

16 29. CEQA is not merely a procedural statute. CEQA imposes clear and
17 substantive responsibilities on agencies that propose to approve projects, requiring that
18 public agencies not approve projects that harm the environment unless and until all
19 feasible mitigation measures are employed to minimize that harm. (Pub. Resources

20 Code§§ 21002, 21002.1, subd. (b).)

21 30. Agencies may not undertake discretionary actions that could have a

22 significant adverse effect on the environment, or limit the choice of alternatives or

23 mitigation measures, before complying with CEQA. (Guidelines §15004, subd. (b)(2).)

24 The "lead agency," which is the public agency that has the principal responsibility for
25 carrying out the project, is responsible for conducting an initial study to determine, in
26 consultation with other relevant state agencies, whether an environmental impact report, a
27 negative declaration, or a mitigated negative declaration will be prepared for a project.

28

Printed on Recycled Paper 10 FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF PURSUANT TO CEQA AND BROWN ACT

- (Pub. Resources Code §§ 21067; 21080.1, subd. (a); 21083, subd. (a).) Accordingly,
2 public agencies may not "take any action" that furthers a project "in a manner that a
3 forecloses alternatives or mitigation measures that would ordinarily be part of CEQA
4 review of that public project." (Save Tara,

5 31. supra, 45 Cal.4th at 138.)
Thus, CEQA does not permit the postponement of environmental review
6 "to the point where the *bureaucratic and financial momentum' has built up "irresistibly
7 behind a proposed project "thus providing a strong incentive to ignore environmental
8 concerns.™ (Save Tara, supra, 45 Cal.4th at 135.)

9 32.

10 Failure either to comply with the substantive requirements of CEQA or to

11 carry out the full CEQA procedures so that complete information as to a project's impacts

12 is developed and publicly disclosed constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion that

13 requires invalidation of the public agency action regardless of whether full compliance

14 would have produced a different result. (Pub. Resources Code § 21005.)
GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

15 33. On June 15, 2017, the City, the City Council, the Successor Agency, and
16 the Parking Authority each purported to hold a special meeting (the "Special Meeting")
17 pursuant to Government Code Section 54956. At the Special Meeting, Respondents
18 purported to approve the ENA among the City, the Successor Agency, the Authority and
19 the Developer "to facilitate the development of a premier and state-of-the-art National
20 Basketball Association ('NBA') professional basketball arena consisting of
21 approximately 18,000 to 20,000 seats."

22 34.

23 On July 20, 2017, Petitioner filed a petition alleging violation of CEQA and
fair meeting requirements.

24 35. The Inglewood City Council held a meeting on August 15, 2017. At the
25 August hearing, the City Council approved a "Revised ENA" which contained many of
26

27 the same terms as the prior ENA and a revised map of the project area purporting to

28 reduce the area of potential eminent domain use. City councilmembers stated it was not

Printed on Recycled Paper 11 FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF PURSUANT TO CEQA AND BROWN ACT

1 the City's intention to take houses or a church by eminent domain. A map attached to the

2 Revised ENA removed many residences from the boundaries of the project area.
3 However, the Mayor and other councilmembers refused to forego the use of eminent

4 domain altogether.

5 36. On September 7, 2017, Inglewood's Oversight Board to the Successor

6 Agency to the Inglewood Redevelopment Agency, which is chaired by the Mayor of
7 Inglewood, approved the Revised ENA as a consistent with a long range property

8 management plan and Redevelopment Dissolution Law.

9 37. The ENA provides for the conveyance of certain real property within a
10 defined "Site"-including property owned by the City ("City Parcels"), by the Successor

11 Agency ("Agency Parcels") and by third parties ("Potential Participating Parcels")-to
12 the Developer, for the Arena Project.

13 In approving the ENA, Respondents did not consider the environmental impacts of the
14 ENA. No environmental review was conducted with respect to the ENA's approval. The

15 ENA is a project under CEQA that has the potential to result in significant physical
16 changes in the environment. Respondents erred by not conducting environmental review

17 for the ENA.

18 38. On February 20, 2018, the City of Inglewood issued a Notice of Preparation
19 (NOP) of an EIR for the Arena Project, months after the ENA was approved. The City

20 anticipated that review of the Arena Project and certification of the EIR would be

21 conducted while the ENA was still in effect, effectively preventing the City and

22 Respondents from considering alternatives to the Clippers Arena Project. (See

23 Presentation, City of Inglewood, Inglewood Basketball and Entertainment Center,

24 Environmental Impact Report Scoping Meeting, Mar. 12, 2018, available at
25 https://www.cityofinglewood.org/DocumentCenter/View/11789/Inglewood-Basketball-
26 and-Entertainment-Center-Scoping-Meeting-Presentation [stating that the Final EIR was

MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF PURSUANT TO CEQA AND BROWN ACT

1 expected to be completed in Summer 2019, two years into the ENA's three year

2 exclusivity period].)

3 39. On June 19, 2018, Respondent Successor Agency took steps to implement
4 the ENA by calling a meeting about the 13 parcels in question and preparing a staff report

5 and agenda. Neither the Agency staff report nor the meeting agenda explained that the 13

6 disposed parcels were in furtherance of the Clippers Arena Project. The Successor

7 Agency's agenda for the June 19, 2018 meeting stated the following:

8 A. CSA-3. OFFICE OF THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR

9 Staff report recommending approval to request that the Oversight Board for the Successor Agency of the Former Inglewood Redevelopment Agency adopt a
10 Resolution, directing the Successor Agency to implement the State of California Department of Finance approved Long-Range Property Management Plan, as
11 amended, with respect to the Long-Term Use and Disposition of the LAX Noise Mitigation Properties, B-1.1 through and including B-3, representing Parcels 1
12 through and including 13, subject to the applicable disposition requirements of the Federal Aviation Administration grant agreements and Los Angeles World Airports
13 letter agreements. (Emphasis added.)

14 40. Contrary to Brown Act requirements, the Successor Agency's agenda

15 description was overly vague, uninformative, and inadequate. It does not inform the

16 public that the property disposition actions are taken in furtherance of the ENA for the

17 Clippers Arena and involve Murphy's Bowl LLC. It fails to inform the public, and does

18 not alert the public to the fact, that the 13 parcels being transferred are specifically

19 designated in maps in the ENA for construction of the arena project. Thé agenda

20 language cloaks the Land Transfer by stating that the requested resolution will merely

21 direct the Successor Agency to "implement" the LRPMP with respect to the 13 parcels.

22 This was misleading. The LRPMP provides that upon disposal pursuant to the LRPMP,

23 the properties in question, B-1, B-2, and B-3, will be developed according a to a particular

24 process. (OVERSIGHT AR 2:83-84.) The LRPMP provides guidelines for this process.

25 a (Ibid.) Thus, passing a resolution to implement the LRPMP with respect to the 13 parcels

26 is a not a trivial act, but rather a concerted effort to commence the Land Transfer necessary

27 for Murphy's Bowl to develop the Clippers Arena Project. Respondents acknowledged

28 this City requirement to sell the parcels for development. In a June 27, 2018 email to

Printed on Recycled Paper 13 FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF
MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF PURSUANT TO CEQA AND BROWN ACT

1 Artie Fields, Inglewood City Manager, Successor Agency Manager Margarita Cruz stated
2 "The approval of the LRPMP gave us three years to either sell the property or transfer
3 them to the city. The city will then be required to sell them following a specific process. I

4 will look this up." (OVERSIGHT AR 91:1527.) With the ENA, the City could

5 contemplate no development other than the Clippers Arena Project. In other words,

6 because the ENA prevented the City from selling the 13 parcels to any party other than

7 the Clippers, the Successor Agency's approval of the transfer of these 13 parcels to the

8 City was an essential step in the Clippers arena's development because but for this

9 transfer from the Successor Agency to the City, the City could not transfer the 13 parcels
10 from the City to the Clippers.

11 41. The Successor Agency reiterated the cloaked, misleading language from the
12 meeting agenda in its staff report. (OVERSIGHT AR 5:97.)

13 42. The Successor Agency also failed to make available the "Federal Aviation
14 Administration grant agreements and Los Angeles World Airports letter agreements" to
15 the public.

16 43. The Successor Agency's failure to adequately inform the public is

17 consistent with and further evidence of the City of Inglewood's deliberate attempts to

18 obfuscate the true purpose of these actions-to facilitate the transfer of 13 Successor
19 Agency parcels to Murphy's Bowl for the Clippers Arena project. This purposeful
20 obfuscation by the City and Murphy's Bowl was reported by Karen Foshay in story

21 entitled "Documents Show How Inglewood Clippers Arena Deal Stayed Secret," for

22 KCET on March 15, 2018 and is available at https://www.kcet.org/shows/socal-
23 connected/documents-show-how-inglewood-clippers-arena-deal-stayed-secret. This

24 story reported a June 9, 2017 email between Clippers and City of Inglewood
25 representatives stating "the entity [Murphy's Bowl LLC] a will have a generic name so it
26 won't identify the proposed project." Therefore, the City and Murphy's Bowl

27 purposefully obscured the identity of the parties involved in the ENA and subsequent

28

Printed on Recycled Paper 14 FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF PURSUANT TO CEQA AND BROWN ACT

transactions with a "generic name." Further, the Inglewood City Council's and Successor
2 Agency's approval of the ENA was discussed at a special meeting, rather than a regular
3 meeting, so as to "reduce the time required to give public notice from 72 hours to 24
4 hours before the meeting." (Jackie Lacey, Los Angeles County Dist. Atty's Off., letter to
5 Inglewood City Council, May 17, 2019.) Given the purposeful obfuscation of the project

6 name and the attempts to reduce the length of public notice through the use of a special
7 | meeting, LA District Attorney Jackie Lacey has stated that the actions by the City and
8 Murphy's Bowl "indicate concerted efforts" to violate the Brown Act. (Ibid.)

9 44. Leaving no doubt, emails produced by Respondents further evidence that

10 the purpose of the request and subsequent Resolution to dispose of the 13 parcels was to
11 permit a formal transfer of the parcels to Murphy's Bowl in order to commence the
12 Clippers Arena Project. In a December 6, 2017 email, Successor Agency Manager
13 Margarita Cruz wrote to the city accountant requesting information about the Agency
14 parcels, stating that "The answers to these questions are very important to the Clippers
15 project." (OVERSIGHT AR 56:1426.)

16 45. In January 11, 2018 email, Ms. Cruz wrote to a colleague, requesting a
17 information about the property appraisal requirements when the Successor Agency
18 "sell[s] property that we bought with FAA funds." (OVERSIGHT AR 58:1430.) This
19 shows that the Successor Agency would sell the purportedly FAA-funded parcels.
20 46. In a February 13, 2018 message, Ms. Cruz wrote to a real estate appraisal
21 firm, requesting appraisal of the parcels at issue. (OVERSIGHT AR 59:1431.) In this

22 email, Ms. Cruz stated that "[t]he City and the Successor Agency own land in the ENA
23 clippers area." (Ibid.) She also stated that "[w]e are looking at trying to complete the
24 transfer of this property prior to June 30, 2018 which is when the Successor Agency's
25 Oversight Board becomes a County board." (Ibid. emphasis added.) This confirms that
26 the Successor Agency understood the request and approval of the June 2018 Resolution
27

28

Printed on Recycled Paper 15 FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF PURSUANT TO CEQA AND BROWN ACT

] to be a definitive step in the process of transferring the 13 parcels to the Murphy's Bowl

2 and the Clippers.

3 47. Further demonstrating that the Successor Agency, itself, recognized that the

4 purpose of seeking a resolution from the Oversight Board was to commence the Land

5 Transfer to Murphy's Bowl, in a June 4, 2018 email, Ms. Cruz wrote to Olga Castaneda,

6 Acting Secretary of the Oversight Board: "] have a request for an [Oversight Board]

7 meeting on either June 20 or June 27. Its related to a property transfer." (OVERSIGHT

8 AR 62: 1436 [emphasis added].) Again, the resolution applied only to the 13 Successor

9 Agency owned parcels falling within the ENA Site and the proposed Clippers Arena

10 Project.

11 48. In a June 18, 2018 email, one day before the Successor Agency meeting in

12 which the Successor Agency Board Members were to discuss requesting approval from

13 the Oversight Board to dispose of the 13 parcels at issue, Ms. Cruz wrote to Artie Fields:

14 "T noted that they placed the Murphys bowl meeting at the same time as we are scheduled

15 to meet. Is it ok if I attend the Murphy's bowl meeting instead?" (OVERSIGHT AR 74:
16 1487.) Clearly, the Successor Agency considered the request for a Resolution approving
17 the transfer as an approval of the transfer of land for the Clippers Arena itself.
18 49. On June 19, 2018, the Board Members of Respondent Successor Agency

19 approved the action to request that the Oversight Board approve of the disposal of 13
20 parcels of property that would be used for construction of the Clippers sports arena

21 project-in violation of CEQA and the Brown Act. The following properties are the

22 subject of the resolution and are included within the ENA area:

23 Property Name Parcel Number on LRPMP Inventory5

24 a. Prairie & 101st (B-1.1) F

b. Prairie & 102nd (B-1.2) 2, 3 25

26

27 5 The LRPMP inventory includes a total of 46 parcels comprising 14 properties. (OVERSIGHT AR 2:49.) The remaining 33 parcels are not included in the resolution, and are not identified in
28 the ENA as part of the Study Area Site.

50. Real Party in Interest Murphy's Bowl LLC, the group developing the 15

16 Clippers Arena Project, apparently had a role in drafting Resolution 18-OB-003.

17 Between June 4, 2018 and June 13, 2018, attorneys for the City of Inglewood and

18 Murphy's Bowl exchanged draft versions of the resolution that eventually became
18-OB-003. (OVERSIGHT AR 63:1437-1441; AR 66:1444-1452; AR 67:1453-1455; 19

20 AR 69:1459-1462; AR 71:1474-1481.) During this revision process, in a June 12, 2018
email to an attorney for Murphy's Bowl, Royce Jones, attorney for the Respondents, 21

22 expressed a desire for concealing the ENA and the Clippers Arena Project from the

23 public approval process for the resolution:

24 Both Gustavo and I have reviewed your draft resolution and felt that the referencing and reaffirming the terms of the Amended ENA in the 25 resolution was inconsistent with the approach I described as wanting to take
26 by simply having the SA [Successor Agency] request the OB [Oversight Board] directing the SA to implement the approved LRPMP by disposing 27 of the "Noise Mitigation Properties" Given the spirit of things here in
28 Inglewood, specifically referencing and/or reaffirming the Amended ENA

Printed on Recycled Paper 17 FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF PURSUANT TO CEQA AND BROWN ACT

1 and the proposed basketball arena during as part of the public entity

2 approval process would likely generate all kinds of unwarranted attention to what is simply a SA action an OB resolution approval action with respect to
3 the implementation of the approved LRPMP. (OVERSIGHT AR 66:1444.)

4 This shows not only that Respondents were working with Murphy's Bowl to approve the

5 Land Transfer, but that Respondents knew that their actions would likely be subject to

6 public and legal scrutiny, and thus actively concealed that the purpose of the Resolution

7 was to transfer parcels for the Clippers Arena project.

8 51. Respondent Oversight Board on June 27, 2018 took definite steps to
9 implement the ENA by approving Resolution 18-OB-003, which directed the Successor

10 Agency to "dispose of the Mitigation Properties in accordance with the amended
11 LRPMP." (OVERSIGHT AR 4:95.) This action violated the Brown Act and CEQA.
12 The Oversight Board failed to inform the public that the properties are proposed to be
13 disposed of pursuant to an agreement with extensive potential impacts on thousands of
14 Inglewood residents and businesses. The brief description on the Oversight Board

15 agenda for its June 27, 2018 meeting stated:

16 Adoption of Resolution by the Oversight Board to the Successor Agency of the

17 former Inglewood Redevelopment Agency Directing the City of Inglewood as the Successor Agency to former Inglewood Redevelopment Agency to Implement the

18 approved Long-Range Property Management Plan, as amended, with respect to the Long-Term Use and Disposition of the LAX Noise Mitigation Properties, B-1.1

19 through and including B-3, representing Parcels through and including 13, subject to the applicable Disposition Requirements of the Federal Aviation Administration grant

20 agreements and Los Angeles World Airports letter agreements. (Emphasis added.)
52. Contrary to Brown Act requirements, the Oversight Board's agenda
21 description was overly vague and uninformative. It does not inform the public that the
22 action to be discussed, adoption of Resolution 18-OB-003, would effectively authorize
23 the disposal of land to Murphy's Bowl LLC for the Clippers Arena. It likewise fails to
24 inform the public, and does not alert the public to the fact, that the 13 parcels being
25 transferred are specifically designated in maps in the ENA for construction of the Arena
26 Project. As discussed above, the Resolution's direction to the Successor Agency to
27 "implement" the LRPMP is a cloaked direction to dispose the 13 parcels. The ENA,
28

Printed on Recycled Paper 18 FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF PURSUANT TO CEQA AND BROWN ACT

approved in 2017, committed Respondents to exclusive negotiations with Murphy's Bowl

2 for a three year period, and the LRPMP required the Successor Agency to sell or transfer

3 the properties by 2018. Thus, the Resolution was a definitive step and a legal
4 commitment to a definitive course of action (i.e., the transfer of land from the Successor

5 Agency to the City) that cleared the pathway for this Land Transfer, as the Successor

6 Agency was bound to negotiations with Murphy's Bowl for the entire remaining time it

7 had to dispose of the parcels pursuant to the LRPMP. Absent the Successor Agency's

8 approval of the Land Transfer, the City could not fulfill its commitments under the ENA

9 to Murphy's Bowl.

10 53. Respondents clearly knew-and concealed-that the Resolution at issue
11 during the Oversight Board meeting was related to the Clippers Arena. In a June 21,
12 2018 email, six days before the Oversight Board meeting, Margarita Cruz wrote: "Is that
13 list for people wanting information on Murphys bowl coming up?" (OVERSIGHT 79:

14 1499.)

15 54. In another email dated June 21, 2018, Ms. Cruz wrote to Olga Castaneda,
16 attaching requests for notice concerning actions taken relating to the ENA with Murphy's
17 Bowl ENA. In that email, Ms. Cruz stated: "These people have requested a copy of the
18 agenda since it related to the property for Murphy's bowl. (OVERSIGHT 80:1500.) The
19 requests for notice are labeled in handwriting "Murphy's Bowl (Clippers)." (Id. at 1501-
20 02.)

21 55. The Oversight Board also failed to make available the "Federal Aviation
22 Administration grant agreements and Los Angeles World Airports letter agreements" to
23 the public.

24 56. Respondent Oversight Board approved Resolution 18-OB-003, which

25 directed the Successor Agency to implement the LRPMP with respect to only properties
26 B-1 through B-3. It authorized disposal of the 13 parcels that are included within the
27 ENA, stated above. No other Successor Agency-held properties are addressed. Based on

28

Printed on Recycled Paper 19 FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF
MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF PURSUANT TO CEQA AND BROWN ACT

information and belief, the Successor Agency has not since authorized the transfer of any
2 other Successor Agency-held land to the City pursuant to the LRMP.
57. In recommending and approving disposal of the 13 parcels, Respondents

4 did not evaluate the potential environmental impacts of the Land Transfer. Respondents'

5 failure to consider the Land Transfer's potential environmental impacts violated CEQA.

6 58. Petitioner on June 29, 2018, pursuant to Government Code section 54960.1,

7 demanded that the Oversight Board cure or correct its violations of the Brown Act within

8 30 days. The Oversight Board failed to do so.
59. Petitioner on June 29, 2018, pursuant to Government Code section 54960.1,

10 demanded that the Successor Agency cure or correct its violations of the Brown Act

11 within 30 days. The Successor Agency failed to do so.

12 60. The Land Transfer is a "project" under CEQA, as defined by Guidelines

13 section 15378. Respondents' actions to recommend and approve disposal of the 13

14 parcels is an "approval" under CEQA as defined by Guidelines section 15352. The Land

15 Transfer may cause a direct and/or reasonably foreseeable indirect environmental change.

16 Therefore, the Land Transfer is subject to CEQA review.

17 61. In failing to subject the Successor Agency request and subsequent
18 Oversight Board resolution authorizing disposal of the 13 parcels to CEQA review,
19 Respondents ignored the impact that the Land Transfer will have on the environment.

20 Respondents are prohibited from engaging in negotiations with anyone other than the

21 Developer regarding the potential development of the Site. (ENA, § 2(a).) Further, the

22 ENA prohibits Respondents from selling or otherwise transferring to third parties their

23 interests in any property on the Site. (ENA, § 11.)

24 62. In failing to subject their decisions to recommend and approve the Land

25 Transfer to CEQA review, Respondents did not consider, and did not inform the public

26 of, direct and reasonably foreseeable indirect environmental impacts that will occur as a

27

28

Printed on Recycled Paper 20 FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF PURSUANT TO CEQA AND BROWN ACT

2 result of the Land Transfer, including but not limited to land use consistency and urban
decay and blight.

63.

4 The actions taken by Respondents to recommend and approve disposal of

5 the 13 parcels are subject to CEQA because they will result in significant land use
impacts.

6 64. In sum, Respondents have failed to consider the Land Transfer's potential
7 and reasonably foreseeable environmental impacts, including:

9 Environmental impacts of noise, traffic, air pollution, aesthetics, and other
impacts;
10 e Effects on land use inconsistent with the City's General Plan; and

12 Increases in urban decay and blight.
FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

13

14 (Failure to Comply with CEQA: Failure to Conduct Initial Study

15 and/or Environmental Assessment)
65. Petitioner incorporates herein and realleges the allegations in prior
16 paragraphs, as if fully set forth herein.

17 66. CEQA applies "to discretionary projects proposed to be carried out or
18 approved by public agencies.

19 67. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21080, subd. (a).)

20 CEQA defines a "project" as "an activity which may cause either a direct

21 physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change

22 in the environment. . . ." (Pub. Resources Code, § 21065.) The Guidelines define

23 "project" as "the whole of an action, which has a potential for resulting in either a direct

24 physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change

25 in the environment." (Guidelines, § 15371, subd. (a).) §

68. The Guidelines define "approval" to mean "the decision by public agency
26 which commits the agency to a definite course of action in regard to a project intended to
27

28 be carried out by any person." (Guidelines § 15352, subd. (a).)

Printed on Recycled Paper 21 FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF PURSUANT TO CEQA AND BROWN ACT

1 69. Respondents' recommendation and approval of disposal of the 13 parcels
2 required for the Clippers Arena constitutes a discretionary project that will cause
3 foreseeable, adverse physical changes to the environment and is, therefore, subject to

4 CEQA review. (See City of Livermore v. LAFCO (1986) 184 Cal.App.3d 531 [adoption

5 of revisions to sphere-of-influence guidelines constitute a "project" subject to CEQA
6 review because the revisions reflected a major policy shift relating to where growth

7 would occur and what the focus of urban development would be].) The approval of the
8 disposition was a commitment to a definite course of action as far as the Respondents

9 were concerned. Under the ENA's exclusivity provision, the land could not be

10 transferred to any parties other than parties to the agreement including the Clippers for a

11 period of at least three years.

12 70. Respondents failed to consider, avoid or mitigate the individual and
13 cumulative impacts of reasonably foreseeable environmental impacts resulting from the
14 recommendation and approval of the Land Transfer. Such impacts include noise, traffic,

15 air quality, aesthetics, land use inconsistency, urban decay and blight.

16 71. Respondents violated CEQA and failed to proceed in the manner required

17 by law, committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion, and acted arbitrarily and capriciously
18 in their approval of the Land Transfer because, without limitation, Respondents failed to

19 subject the Land Transfer to an Initial Study or other environmental assessment as CEQA

20 requires.

21 72. Petitioner has served the California Attorney General with a copy of this

22 amended verified petition, along with a notice of its filing, in compliance with Public
23 Resources Code section 21167.7.

24 73. Petitioner has provided written notice of the commencement of this action
25 to Respondents, in compliance with Public Resources Code section 21167.5.

26

5 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

6

7 (Failure to Comply with CEQA: Improper Deferral
of Environmental Analysis)

8 75. Petitioner incorporates herein and realleges the allegations in prior
9 paragraphs, as if fully set forth herein.

10 76. Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that Respondents
11 have deferred analysis under CEQA for the Arena Project.

12 77. Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that the
13 recommendation to request approval of the Land Transfer, and subsequent approval
14 Resolution commit Respondents to a definite course of action with respect to the Arena
15

16 Project by, for example, defining now, before any CEQA studies occur, which parts of
the City should be considered for the proposed Arena Project and the acceptable size of
17 the proposed Arena Project.

18 78.

19 Respondents' recommendation to request approval of the Land Transfer,

20 and subsequent approval Resolution commit them to a definite course of action that will

21 cause numerous adverse environmental effects that should have been studied in an EIR
before the Land Transfer was approved.

22 79. By approving the Land Transfer, Respondents have displayed a level of
23 commitment to the Arena Project that is more than sufficient to constitute a "project
24 approval."

25 80.

26 By approving the Land Transfer, Respondents have circumscribed or

27 limited their discretion with respect to future environmental review, mitigation measures,
project alternatives and alternative locations.

28

Printed on Recycled Paper 23 FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF PURSUANT TO CEQA AND BROWN ACT

1 81. The Guidelines are clear that Respondents are barred from taking actions
2 "that would have a significant adverse effect or limit the choice of alternatives or
3 mitigation measures, before completion of CEQA compliance." (Guidelines § 15004,

4 subd. (b)(2)(emphasis added).)

5 82. Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that Respondents'
6 approval of the Land Transfer constitutes such an unauthorized action because it limits
7 Respondents' choices of methods to eliminate and/or mitigate adverse environmental
8 impacts generated by the Land Transfer.

9 83. Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that the Land
10 Transfer constitutes a prejudgment by Respondents on the proposed Arena Project and

11 the proposed Site.

12 84. Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that the Land
13 Transfer commits Respondents to a definite course of action and so constrains

14 Respondents' exercise of police power such that the future CEQA review envisioned by

15 the Land Transfer is rendered an unlawful post hoc rationalization for decisions and
16 commitments already made.

17 85. Any later-performed environmental analysis will be influenced in its
18 discussion of impacts, mitigation and alternatives by the significant funds already given

19 to the City by the Developer.

20 86. Respondents have violated CEQA and failed to proceed in the manner

21 required by law, committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion, and acted arbitrarily and

22 capriciously in their approval of the Land Transfer because Respondents committed
23 themselves to a definite course of action, i.e. the Arena Project, before complying with

24 CEQA, and improperly deferred CEQA analysis of the Arena Project to a later time.

THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (Violation of Ralph M. Brown Act, Gov. Code § 54954.1 and 54954.2)
3 87. Petitioner incorporates herein and realleges the allegations in prior

4 paragraphs, as if fully set forth herein.

5 88. The purpose of the Ralph M. Brown Act is to "aid in the conduct of the

6 people's business" by encouraging public participation in government decision making.
7 (Government Code §54950.)

8 89. In furtherance of its goal of public participation, the Brown Act requires
9 that at least 72 hours before a regular meeting, a legislative body must post an agenda
10 containing a "brief description" of each item of business to be acted upon at the meeting.
11 (Government Code 54954.2(a)(1).)

12 90. The legislative body may not take any action on an item not appearing on
13 the posted agenda, except in certain situations not applicable here. (Government Code §§
14 54952(a)(3), 54954.2(b).)

15 91. The Successor Agency violated the Brown Act by failing to properly list in
16 the agenda for the June 19, 2018 Successor Agency meeting the actions to be taken at
17 that meeting. Specifically, the posted agenda listed no item of business describing that
18 the Successor Agency would consider disposition of properties included within an
19 Exclusive Negotiating Agreement between the City of Inglewood, the Successor Agency,
20 the Parking Authority, and Murphy's Bowl, LLC for construction of a sports arena.
21 92. The Successor Agency agenda for the meeting disclosed only that the
22 Successor Agency would "request that the Oversight Board for the Successor Agency of
23 the Former Inglewood Redevelopment Agency adopt a Resolution, directing the
24 Successor Agency to implement the State of California Department of Finance approved
25 Long-Range Property Management Plan, as amended, with respect to the Long-Term Use
26 and Disposition of the LAX Noise Mitigation Properties, B-1.1 through and including B-
27 3, representing Parcels 1 through and including 13, subject to the applicable disposition
28

Printed on Recycled Paper 25 FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF PURSUANT TO CEQA AND BROWN ACT

1 requirements of the Federal Aviation Administration grant agreements and Los Angeles

2 World Airports letter agreements."

3 93. The Successor Agency failed to inform the public that it was proposing to

4 dispose of properties pursuant to an agreement with extensive potential impacts on
5 hundreds of Inglewood residents and businesses. The Successor Agency failed to inform
6 the public of any connection between the listed agenda item and the construction of the
7 Arena Project.

8 94. The Successor Agency failed to make available to the public the "Federal

9 Aviation Administration grant agreements and Los Angeles World Airports letter

10 agreements."

11 95. Thus, the agenda's description was overly vague, and the Successor
12 Agency's action was not adequately or accurately described on the agenda, in violation of

13 the Brown Act.

14 96. The Successor Agency further violated the Brown Act by not making
15 available the Federal Aviation Administration grant agreements and Los Angeles World
16 Airports letter agreements to the public.

17 97. Petitioner was prejudiced by this violation because it was denied the

18 opportunity to prepare and provide meaningful comments to the Successor Agency on the
19 implementation of the amended Long-Range Property Management Plan, the applicable
20 disposition requirements of the "Federal Aviation Administration grant agreements and

21 Los Angeles World Airports letter agreements," the disposition of Parcels 1 through 13,

22 and the interaction between the disposition of the properties and the Arena Project or to
23 ascertain the extent to which the implementation of the Long-Range Property
24 Management Plan or requirements of the "Federal Aviation Administration grant

25 agreements and Los Angeles World Airports letter agreements" would affect the interests
26 of Petitioner's members.

27

28

Printed on Recycled Paper 26 FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF

RELIEF PURSUANT TO CEQA AND BROWN ACT

98. On June 29, 2018, pursuant to Government Code section 54960.1(b),
2 Petitioner timely submitted a demand to the Successor Agency to cure or correct the

3 action taken on June 19, 2018 in violation of the Brown Act. The Successor Agency did

4 not respond.

5 99. The Oversight Board violated the Brown Act by failing to properly list in

6 the agenda for the June 27, 2018 Oversight Board meeting the actions to be taken at that
7 meeting. Specifically, the posted agenda listed no item of business describing that the
8 Oversight Board would consider disposition of properties included within an Exclusive
9 Negotiating Agreement between the City of Inglewood, the Successor Agency, the
10 Parking Authority, and Murphy's Bowl, LLC for construction of a sports arena.

11 100. The Oversight Board agenda for its June 27, 2018 meeting disclosed the
12 Board would consider: "Adoption of Resolution by the Oversight Board to the Successor

13 Agency of the former Inglewood Redevelopment Agency Directing the City of
14 Inglewood as the Successor Agency to former Inglewood Redevelopment Agency to
15 Implement the approved Long-Range Property Management Plan, as amended, with
16 respect to the Long-Term Use and Disposition of the LAX Noise Mitigation Properties,
17 B-1.1 through and including B-3, representing Parcels 1 through and including 13,
18 subject to the applicable Disposition Requirements of the Federal Aviation

19 Administration grant agreements and Los Angeles World Airports letter agreements."
20 The Oversight Board failed to inform the public that it was proposing to dispose of
21 properties pursuant to an agreement with extensive potential impacts on thousands of

22 Inglewood residents and businesses. The Oversight Board failed to inform the public of

23 any connection between the listed agenda item and the construction of a sports arena.

24 101. Thus, the agenda's description was overly vague, and the Oversight
25 Board's action was not adequately or accurately described on the agenda, in violation of

26 the Brown Act.

27

28

Printed on Recycled Paper 27 FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF PURSUANT TO CEQA AND BROWN ACT

1 102. The Oversight Board Agency further violated the Brown Act by not making
2 available the Federal Aviation Administration grant agreements and Los Angeles World

3 Airports letter agreements to the public.

4 103. Petitioner was prejudiced by this violation because it was denied the

5 opportunity to prepare and provide meaningful comments to the Oversight Board on the
6 implementation of the amended Long-Range Property Management Plan, the applicable
7 disposition requirements of the "Federal Aviation Administration grant agreements and

9 and the interaction between the disposition of the properties and the Arena Project or to

10 ascertain the extent to which the implementation of the Long-Range Property
11 Management Plan or requirements of the "Federal Aviation Administration grant

12 agreements and Los Angeles World Airports letter agreements" would affect the interests
13 of Petitioner's members. For these reasons, the Oversight Board's action at its June 27,
14 2018, including adoption of a resolution directing implementation of the approved Long-
15 Range Property Management Plan, as amended, with respect to the disposition of Parcels

16 - through 13, must be declared null and void, pursuant to Government Code section

17 54960.1(a).

18 104. On June 29, 2018, pursuant to Government Code section 54960.1(b),

19 Petitioner timely submitted a demand to the Oversight Board to cure or correct the action

20 taken on June 27, 2018 in violation of the Brown Act. The Oversight Board did not

21 respond.

22 105. For the reasons stated above, the Successor Agency' action taken on June

23 19, 2018 and the Oversight Board's action taken on June 27, 2018 with respect to
24 LRPMP 1-13 must be declared null and void, pursuant to Government Code section
25 54960.1(a).

26 106. Without a writ of mandate and declaratory and injunctive relieve provided

27 for by the Brown Act, Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that

28

Printed on Recycled Paper 28 FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF PURSUANT TO CEQA AND BROWN ACT

F it and other interested persons, citizens, and taxpayers will be irreparably harmed because

2 they will be denied notice of and the opportunity to participate in the Successor Agency's

3 and Oversight Board's meetings, a right guaranteed by law. Government Code Section

4 54960(a) provides that any interested person, such as Petitioner, may commence an
purpose of stopping or 5 action by mandamus, injunction, or declaratory relief for the
6 preventing violations or threatened violations of the Brown Act.

8 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

9 (Injunction Against Further Pursuit of the Land Transfer

10 Until Respondents Comply with CEQA and the Brown Act)

11 107. Petitioner incorporates herein and realleges the allegations in prior
12 paragraphs, as if fully set forth herein.
13 108. Respondents failed to comply with CEQA and the Brown Act prior to
14 recommending to request approval, and subsequently approving the Land Transfer.

15 Petitioner therefore prays for a preliminary and permanent injunction against
16 Respondents and any of their agents from taking any further action to advance the Land

17 Transfer and/or Arena Project unless and until such time as Respondents comply with
18 their mandatory duties under CEQA, the Brown Act, and all other applicable
19 environmental rules, regulations and procedures.

20 109. Petitioner has no adequate remedy other than that prayed for herein in that
21 the subject matter is unique and monetary damages would therefore be inadequate to

22 fully compensate Petitioner for the consequences of Respondents' actions in their

23 continued failure to comply with CEQA and the Brown Act with respect to the Project

24 and the Land Transfer. Petitioner therefore seeks, and is entitled to, injunctive relief

25 under Code of Civil Procedure section 526 et seq., and to a stay, preliminary and/or
26 permanent injunction.
