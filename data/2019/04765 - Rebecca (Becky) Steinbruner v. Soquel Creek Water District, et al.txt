NOTICE OF INTENT TO FILE AMENDED CEQA PETITION

TO THE SOQUEL CREEK WATER DISTRICT, BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE SOQUEL
CREEK WATER DISTRICT and GENERAL MANAGER OF THE SOQUEL CREEK WATER
DISTRICT, MR. RON DUNCAN, and ALL REAL PARTIES OF INTEREST THAT
INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO SANTA CRUZ COUNTY, THE CITY OF SANTA
CRUZ, SANTA CRUZ CITY WASTEWATER TREATMENT FACILITY, SANTA CRUZ
MID-COUNTY GROUNDWATER AGENCY, and TWIN LAKES BAPTIST CHURCH:

PLEASE TAKE NOTICE, under Public Resources Code 21167.5, that Petitioner,
Rebecca (Becky) Steinbruner, intends to file an amended petition under the
provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) against
Respondents, the Soquel Creek Water District, Board of Directors for the Soquel
Creek Water District, General Manager of the Soquel Creek Water District, Mr.
Ron Duncan, challenging its adoption of Resolution 18-30 certifying the Final
Environmental Impact Report (EIR) in violation of numerous provisions of CEQA
statute; challenging its approval of Resolution 18-31 adopting the CEQA
Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program (MMRP), Findings, and Statement
of Overriding Considerations, and Approval of the Pure Water Soquel:
Groundwater Replenishment and Seawater Intrusion Prevention Project Final
EIR without clear evidence of consultation with Trustee Agencies; challenging
the CEQA violation of initiation of significant work on elements of the Project at
the Twin Lakes Church Pilot Recharge Well site using defective CEQA review
before completing the full CEQA process to certify the Project EIR and approve
the Project; asserting demonstration of prejudice toward the Project by
repeatedly authorizing an unbalanced allocation of District resources to pursue

the Project, including Prop. 218 restructuring of water rates and service fees
with intent to fund the expected debt of the Project before completion of CEQA
process and Project approval; and, failure by the General Manager to respect
and honor the supreme purpose of CEQA process to include and encourage the
public's participation in reasonable Project review by repeatedly denying
significant and multiple public requests for extensions of comment time to
examine complex and voluminous Draft EIR and Responses to Comments
documents.

The amended petition will seek the following relief:
1. For a peremptory writ of mandate directing Soquel Creek Water District:
(a) To vacate and set aside Resolutions 18-30 and 18-31 certification of
the Final EIR and approval of the Project, MMRP and Conditions of
Overriding Consideration and the Mitigated Negative Declaration
(MND) for the Twin Lakes Church Recharge Pilot Well Project;
(b) To vacate and set aside its filing of the Notice of Determination for the
Project and associated Twin Lakes Church Pilot Recharge Well Project;
(c) To review the Project in its entirety and revise and recirculate the Draft
EIR, to prepare a legally adequate Draft EIR providing a De Novo "No
Project" analysis that includes existing and expanded Surface Water
Transfer Agreements with the City of Santa Cruz recognizing
conjunctive use related to water rights amendments and place of use
agreements currently undergoing environmental review by the City of
Santa Cruz, and otherwise to comply with CEQA and all other
applicable state, federal and local laws, regulations, ordinances, and
policies in reviewing the Project, granting reasonable public comment
period extensions when requested by the public;

2. For an order staying the effects of the Soquel Creek Water District's
certification of the Final EIR and possible approvals related to any component of the Project, including the Twin Lakes Church Pilot Recharge
Well Project, pending the entry of judgement or filing of an appeal in this
action;
3. For the issuance of a temporary restraining order, and a preliminary and
permanent injunction restraining and prohibiting the Soquel Creek Water

District from carrying out or engaging in any action related to the Project
that could result in any changes or alteration in the physical environment,
until the Soquel Creek Water District has complied with CEQA and all
other applicable laws;
4. For an order directing the Soquel Creek Water District to pay Rebecca
(Becky ) Steinbruner any costs of suit in this action;
5. For an order directing the Soquel Creek Water District to pay Rebecca
(Becky) Steinbruner any reasonable associated attorney fees; and
6. For such other and further relief as the Court deems proper.

Under Public Resources Code 21167.6(a), a copy of the Amended Petition
to be filed by petitioner will be sent by certified mail to Respondents: the
Soquel Creek Water District, Board of Directors for the Soquel Creek
Water District, General Manager of the Soquel Creek Water District, Mr.
Ron Duncan, and to Real Parties of Interest: the County of Santa Cruz, City
of Santa Cruz, City of Santa Cruz Wastewater Treatment Facility, Santa
Cruz Mid-County Groundwater Agency, and Twin Lakes Baptist Church
within 10 business days after filing the original Petition. Petitioner
requests that within 10 business days of receipt of the Amended Petition,

25 Rebecca (Becky) Steinbruner alleges:
26 1. Petitioner, Rebecca (Becky) Steinbruner, is a long-time resident of rural Aptos, is an
27 active community member with long-standing interests in local water issues and public
28 safety, is a customer of a small water company whose boundaries are adjacent to the
Soquel Creek Water District and that holds an emergency intertie connection with the

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1

2

3 Soquel Creek Water District, and a resident within the boundaries of the MidCounty

4 Groundwater Basin, sharing the Purisima Aquifer with the Soquel Creek Water District.

5 Petitioner has actively participated in Soquel Creek Water District and Santa Cruz

6 MidCounty Groundwater Agency meetings and workshops since 2015.

7

8 2. Respondents, Soquel Creek Water District, the Board of Directors for the Soquel Creek

9 Water District, General Manager for the Soquel Creek Water District, Ron Duncan, is the local

10 government lead agency for the Pure Water Soquel: Groundwater Replenishment and Seawater

11 Intrusion Prevention Project and whose actions constituted an abuse of discretionary power in

12 certifying an inadequate EIR and approving the Project, violating the California

13 Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).

14

15 3. Real Parties in Interest, Santa Cruz County, Santa Cruz City, Santa Cruz City Wastewater

16 Treatment Facility are public governmental agencies named on the Project Notice of

17 Determination as joined as parties. Santa Cruz MidCounty Groundwater Agency is a public

18 agency comprised of local representatives of public and private water interests and are charged

19 by the State of California with developing sustainable groundwater management plan for the

20 MidCounty Basin, which is also noted on the Project Notice of Determination and therefore

21 joined as party. Twin Lakes Baptist Church is a private entity whose real estate and land use

22 agreements with Soquel Creek Water District are related to the Project, and therefore is joined
in interest, and Does 1-50,000, inclusive, are public and/or private interests that may or may not 23 include Trustee Agencies and Responsible Agencies whose true names or capacities are 24
unknown to the Petitioner at this time.
25

26 4. The Project, stated as fulfilling a 20-year Project life, is located within the Santa Cruz City
27 limits and the unincorporated areas of Santa Cruz County, spanning an area between the City
28 Wastewater Treatment Plant on Bay Avenue in Santa Cruz City, with conveyance pipelines
leading to an Advanced Water Treatment Facility at an undetermined location in communities

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE paqe z

1

2

3 of either Live Oak or Soquel, and further conveyance pipelines to three injection well locations

4 in Aptos, one of which is at Twin Lakes Baptist Church. The Project would treat and inject an

5 estimated 1500 AcreFeet/Year of treated wastewater effluent into the Purisima Aquifer as

6 Indirect Potable Re-Use and supplemental supply for the Soquel Creek Water District. The

7 intended goals of the Project are to replenish groundwater levels deemed in critical overdraft

8 due to over-pumping and provide an additional 1500 AcreFeet/Year supplemental supply for

9 District customer needs. The Project EIR includes a CEQA Mitigation Monitoring and

10 Reporting Program (MMRP), Findings, and a Statement of Overriding Considerations.

11 Respondent is the lead agency responsible under the California Environmental Quality Act

12 (CEQA) for evaluating the environmental impacts of the project.

13

14 5. Respondent caused a draft environmental impact report (DEIR) for the project to be

15 prepared and circulated from June 29, 2018 to August 13, 2018. The Final EIR, encompassing

16 the DEIR and the Response to Comments documents, was released December 7, 2018 with a 10-

17 day public comment period.

18

19 6. By Resolution 18-30, dated December 18, 2018, respondent resolved to certify the adequacy
of the EIR for the Pure Water Soquel: Groundwater Replenishment and Seawater Intrusion
20

21 Prevention Project under CEQA (Public Resources Code 21000-21189.3). On December 18,

22 2018, respondent approved Resolution 18-31 to approve adopting Environmental Findings with
regard to the Pure Water Soquel: Groundwater Replenishment and Seawater Intrusion
23

24 Prevention Project Environmental Impact Report pursuant to the CEQA and adopting a
Statement of Overriding Considerations and a Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program
25 (MMRP), and approving the Project. A Notice of Determination to carry out the project was
26 filed by respondent on December 19, 2018.
27

28 7. Petitioner, other agencies, interested groups, and individuals made oral and written
comments on the DEIR, Final EIR and Findings and raised each of the legal deficiencies

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE page 3

3 asserted in this petition.

4

5 8. Petitioner performed all conditions precedent to filing this action by complying with the

6 requirements of Public Resources Code 21167.5 in filing this action on January 17, 2019 and

7 filing this Amended Petition for Writ of Mandate 10 business days later on January 31, 2019.

8

9 9. Soquel Creek Water District actually initiated elements of the Project at Twin Lakes Baptist

10 Church on October 2, 2018 with approval of a Mitigated Negative Declaration under CEQA for

11 the Twin Lakes Church Pilot Recharge Well Project but that contained erroneous claims

12 regarding the actual recharge mechanism to be used. The Board approved a release to bid on

13 November 6, 2018 for this Project element at Twin Lakes Baptist Church, and on December 4,

14 2018 approved a bid award to Maggiora Bros. for construction of the Twin Lakes Church

15 Groundwater Replenishment and Seawater Intrusion Prevention Pilot Well injection well

16 element. At that time, the Board also approved a three-year short-term rental agreement and a

17 conditional 50-year lease agreement with Twin Lakes Baptist Church for the Project element

18 construction site that would gift 3.5 AcreFeet/Year of purified water for 50 years to the Church

19 for irrigation of athletic fields associated with the private school operated by the Church, and

20 also waive Water Demand Offset requirements set forth by the District to provide new water

21 service to the Church for a 1600SF expansion of on-site employee housing. On January 2,

22 2019, Soquel Creek Water District and Maggiora Bros. began construction of the Twin Lakes
Church Groundwater Replenishment and Seawater Intrusion Prevention Pilot Recharge Well,
23
before close of the 30-day CEQA appeal period and is threatening to proceed with construction
24 of the project in the near future. Additionally, on October 16, 2018, Mr. Duncan and the
25 Board met in Closed Session with representatives of the Lam Estate to discuss acquisition of the
26 property at 2505 Chanticleer Avenue, the proposed site of the Project Advanced Water
27 Treatment Facility that was subsequently chosen by the Board as the prefered Project facility
28 location in Resolution 18-31. Previously, in 2016, the Board authorized District purchase of
land adjacent to its office at 5180 Soquel Drive in Soquel for the proposed West Annex site of

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE Page 4

2

3 the Project treatment plant. The District evicted Section 8 tenants in the existing residential

4 units on the property and subsequently demolished the two historic structures in December,

5 2017.

6

7 10. Construction and operation of the project will irreparably harm the environment in that 11

8 miles of conveyance pipeline necessary to carry treated effluent to the Advanced Water

9 Treatment Facility, of undetermined location, and to the three pressure injection wells in Aptos

10 will potentially cause unknown significant negative impacts to local and state roadways; cause

11 potential disturbance with construction and possible contamination during operation by

•12 brine/effluent accidents at 18 stream crossings, three possible jurisdictional waterways that

13 include the San Lorenzo River and another significant riparian corridor; potentially cause •

14 disturbance of known and unknown hazardous material contamination sites; potentially cause

15 unknown but significant structural damage to 18 historic structures; cause potential unknown

16 significant disturbance to pre-historic and early California cultural resources within the Project

17 area; potentially cause unknown and irreparable geochemical damage and groundwater

18 contamination of the Purisima Aquifer due to treatment accidents and human error; cause

19 significant increased demand and dependency on electricity use due to the energy-intensive

20 Advanced Water Treatment Facility, injection well pumps and in-line conveyance system pump

21 station requirements and technology; ignore significant public resistance and political

22 opposition to the Project when other agreements with the City of Santa Cruz are intact and

23 would meet the Project goals in a more timely manner, with fewer negative environmental

24 impacts, and be economically feasible; would not have been vetted by critical Trustee Agencies
responsible for protecting public waterways, fish and wildlife, and significant plants within the
25

26 Project boundaries; and, would neglect to adequately analyze a regional approach for long-
term water supply and storage management that could fully evaluate the Surface Water
27
Transfer Pilot Project with the City of Santa Cruz (currently in process and under evaluation
28 and with stated offers by the City for full support and future expansion) for a potentially
superior "No Project" Alternative that the Project EIR failed to even consider.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE pag e 5

3

4 11. A temporary restraining order and preliminary and permanent injunction should be issued
5 restraining the Respondents and Real Parties in Interest and their agents from proceeding with

6 the project.

7

8 12. Respondent's actions in certifying the EIR and adopting Findings, MMRP and Statement

9 of Overriding Considerations and approving the Project constitute a prejudicial abuse of

10 discretionary power in that respondent failed to proceed in the manner required by law and its

11 decision is not supported by substantial evidence as follows:

12 (a) The project EIR fails to adequately describe and evaluate the full impacts of Project

13 operations and fails to adequately evaluate data-based analysis of Project alternatives and/or

14 thorough analysis of a No Project Alternative in which the Surface Water Transfer Pilot

15 Project with the City of Santa Cruz would be allowed to evaluate more timely groundwater

16 recharge and sea water intrusion benefits that could eliminate or substantially lessen significant|

17 negative environmental impacts of the Project proposal;

18 (b) The EIR failed to provide adequate analysis of impacts to groundwater quality and public
health;
19

20 (c) The EIR failed to provide adequate response to comments on the Draft EIR by critical

21 public agencies;

22 (d) The EIR failed to include consideration and analysis of areas of known controversy and

23 issues to be resolved, changing the scope of the project but violating CEQA public process to
include new project area public participation;
24 1
(e) The Respondent violated CEQA by certifying the EIR while ignoring new and significant
25
information presented before approving Resolutions 18-30 and 18-31;
26 (f) The Respondent certified the EIR without having read the Response to Comments or even
27 understanding the existence of the critical document and thereby did not ensure the Final EIR
28 accurately and fully represented the views of the decision-making body of the lead agency;
(g) The EIR is seemingly void of comment or evidence of consultation with Trustee Agencies, as

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE page b

1

2

3 is required by CEQA statute;

4 (h) The District and Board showed prejudicial abuse of discretion by entering into land use

5 agreements, approving and authorizing construction bids for elements of the Project before

6 CEQA process for the Project was complete;

7 (I) Respondent failed to provide members of the public adequate time to review critical Draft

8 EIR and Response to Comment documents and failed to ensure full public participation in

g CEQA review process.

10

11 Respondent thereby violated its duties to certify an EIR and adopt Findings, Mitigation

12 Monitoring and Reporting Program and Statement of Overriding Consideration conforming to

13 the requirements of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines. Accordingly, certification of the EIR

14 and all approvals regarding the Pure Water Soquel: Groundwater Replenishment and Seawater

15 Intrusion Prevention Project must be set aside.

16 •11

17 WHEREFORE, petitioner demands entry of judgment as follows:

18 1. For a temporary restraining order and prliminary injunction restraining Respondents

19 Soquel Creek Water District, the Board of the Soquel Creek Water District, and General

20 Manager of the Soquel Creek Water District, and Real Parties in Interest the County of Santa

21 Cruz, Santa Cruz City, the Santa Cruz City Wastewater Treatment Facility, the Santa Cruz
Mid-County Groundwater Agency, and Twin Lakes Baptist Church from taking any action to

2. For a peremptory writ of mandate directing:
24 (a) Respondent to vacate and set aside its certification of the EIR for the project and Resolution

26
Statement of Overriding Consideration, and approval of the Project as Resolution 18-31.

3 INTRODUCTION

1.

5 The California Environmental Quality Act, codified at

6 Public Resources Code sections 21000-21189.3 ("CEQA"), requires,

7 for any proposed project that may have a significant effect on

8 the environment, that the CEQA lead agency prepare an
environmental impact report ("EIR").
L 21082.2(d)). (Pub. Res. Code

10 The purposes of an EIR are: (a)"to provide public

11 agencies and the public in general with detailed information

12 about the effect which a proposed project is likely to have on
the environment", (b)

13 "to list ways in which the significant

"to

14 effects of such a project might be minimized", and (c)
indicate alternatives to such a project." (Pub. Res. Code

15 21061.)

16 2.

17 When the California Supreme Court articulated the principle
that CEQA is "to be interpreted ...to afford the fullest

18 possible protection to the environment within the reasonable

19 scope of the statutory language," the court based its

20 interpretation on the legislature's statements of purpose in Pub

21 Res C 21000-21002 established with 'Friends of Mammoth v Board

22 of Supervisors' (1972) 8 C3d 247, 259; 'Citizens of Goleta

23 Valley v Board of Supervisors' (1990) 52 C3d 553, 563; and

24 'Laurel Heights Improvement Ass'n V Regents of Univ. of Cal.'

25 (1988) 47 C3d 376, 390.

26

27 3. The Office of Planning and Research ("OPR") interprets CEQA'S

28 basic goals of protecting the environment as having two broad

2
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1

2 purposes: a) Avoiding, reducing, or preventing environmental

w damage when possible by requiring alternatives or mitigation

measures (14 Cal Code Regs 15002 (a) (2)- (3)) ; and b) Providing

5 information to decision-makers and the public concerning the

6 environmental effects of proposed and approved activities (14
Cal Code Regs 15002 (a) (1), (4)).

4 .

8 One of CEQA's basic purposes is to inform governmental
decision-makers and the public about the potential significant

10 environmental effects of proposed projects (14Cal Code Regs

11 15002 (a) (1)) and to disclose to the public the reasons for

12 approval of a project that may have significant environmental

13 effects (14 Cal Code Regs15002 (a) (4)) .

14 5. The Courts have repeatedly stated that informed decision making

15 and public participation are fundamental purposes of the CEQA

process. As one court noted, the purpose of

16 an EIR is not only

17 to protect the environment but also to demonstrate to the public

18 that it is being protected. 'County of Inyo v Yorty' (1973)

24 (collectively, "the District"), that by approval of Resolution

25 18-30, certified the final Environmental Impact Report ("EIR"),

26 composed of the Draft EIR ("DEIR") and Response to Comment

27 ("RTC")on the DEIR for the Pure Water Soquel: Groundwater

28 Replenishment and Seawater Intrusion Prevention Project

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

("Project")and by approval of Resolution 18-31, adopted the CEQA
Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program ("MMRP"), Findings,
and Statement of Overriding Considerations, and Approval of the
Project EIR, based upon multiple violations of CEQA and
5 deficiencies. Petitioner also challenges District's

6 demonstration of prejudice favoring the Project in advance of

7 completion of CEQA process. Finally, Petitioner asserts failure

8 by District General Manager, Ron Duncan, to respect the supreme

9 intent of CEQA process by repeatedly denying multiple requests

10 from members of the public for reasonable extensions of time for

11 public comment on the complex and voluminous critical DEIR and

12 RTC documents.

13 The Project, with a proposed 20-year Project period, includes

14 infrastructure proposed to be located over a broad area of Santa

15 Cruz County, California ("County") and City of Santa Cruz,

16 California ("City") would include conveying 1.86 million gallons

17 per day ('mgd") from the Santa Cruz City Wastewater Treatment

18 Facility ("SCWWTF") to an Advance Water Treatment Facility

19 ("AWTF"), whose location has not yet been determined, for

20 further treatment via a process known as advanced water

21 purification to recover 1.3 million gallons/day of finished

22 water. This finished water would then be conveyed to three

23 separate injection well sites in Aptos where it would be

24 pressure-injected into the Purisima Aquifer ("Aquifer") at

25 depths of up to 1000'. The Project would include: (a) the

26 construction, operation and maintenance of an Advanced Water

27 Treatment Facility ("AWTF") whose exact location has yet to be

decided
28 upon by the District, (b) construction, operation and

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 maintenance of up to 11 miles of pipelines, depending upon the
0A0N location of the AWTF selected by the District, to convey the
treated sewage effluent from the SCWWTF to the District's AWTF,
(c) construction, operation and maintenance of another possible
11 miles of pipeline as a separate brine conveyance route
00 returning treatment spoils to the SCWWTF, and (d) construction,

7 operation and maintenance of three injection wells in the Aptos

8 area that would pressure-inject an anticipated total of 1.3 mgd.

9 8. The Project is expected to result in significant disruption to

10 existing infrastructure during the construction phase, which is

11 anticipated to be up to three years. The EIR is vague about

12 conveyance pipe sizes and the District has not yet decided upon

13 the exact route the conveyance system would take. There are

14 approximately 17 stream crossings anticipated in association

15 with the proposed conveyance system.

16 9. Due largely to significant and unavoidable construction impacts

17 only, the Board approved a Statement of Overriding

18 Consideration. The Statement claimed that the benefits of

19 complying with State and local policies to gain a hypothetical

20 1500AcreFeet/Year ("AFY") the District claims is it's estimated

21 need to offset it's own over-pumping of the Aquifer would

22 outweigh the substantial wide-spread environmental degradation

23 and potentially broad public health and safety risks inherent to

24 the Project but inadequately addressed in the DEIR, RTC and

25 EIR.

26 10. The Project is considered to be a groundwater replenishment

27 reuse project and would be governed by regulations set forth in

28 CCR Title 22, Division 4 , Chapter 3 for operations, monitoring,

5
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

and reporting. While the EIR states that "In general, under

2 normal operations, the District would operate all of the

3 facilities-secondary or tertiary effluent pump station,

4 treatment systems, and recharge wells-24 hours a day, 365 days

5 per year, except during necessary maintenance or cleaning", the

6 District in fact may not be the operator, and instead has

7 discussed in the course of six Special Board Meetings, the fast-

8 track construction route of hiring a large international design-

9 build-operate contractor in order to streamline construction and

10 thereby meet requirements to qualify for federal and state

11 grants. (Exhibit [None of these Special Board meetings,

12 held at the District Office and at an unorthodox times, was

13 recorded by the District for the members of public unable to

14 attend.1

15 11. The AWTF would process the secondary effluent using

16 microfiltration/ultrafiltration ("MF/UF"), tertiary ultraviolet

17 light ("UV"), reverse osmosis ("RO"), advanced oxidation (e.g.,

18 hydrogen peroxide or sodium hypochlorite), and post-treatment

19 stabilization including decarbonation by air stripping to remove

20 carbon dioxide (CO2), the addition of calcium and alkalinity,

21 and ph adjustment with C02 or sodium hydroxide addition.

22 Options for calcium and alkalinity adjustment include addition

23 of purchased hydrate lime slurry (calcium hydroxide slurry), or

24 calcium chloride (CaC12). Sodium hypochlorite would be added to

25 the finished water for secondary disinfection. The EIR states

26 there would be various bulk storage tanks of up to 5,000 gallons

27 located inside or next to the AWTF, with cleaning chemicals

stored in smaller containers.
28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 12. The AWTF, with location yet to be determined, would have
N m varying rates of efficiency and would require regular
maintenance to function properly. A panel of National Water
Reuse Institute ("NWRI") experts examining the proposed Project
LO in September, 2017 determined it is relatively small, would be

6 highly-dependent on technology, and would require functioning

7 perfectly 100% of the time. (Exhibit_)

8 13. The MF/UF system would generate backwash water every 25-30

9 minutes, chemical-enhanced backwash waste daily, and clean-in-
place chemical waste monthly. These undetermined volumes of 10

11 waste would be discharged into the sewer collection system in

12 the Rodeo Basin, which the County has already declared as

13 "overcapacity" (disclosed in comment submitted by multiple

14 County agencies: Edler L-3-1 and Ricker L-4-13 in RTC)

15 Response to Comments on DEIR by agencies).

16 14. The MF/UF membranes would need to be replaced every 5-8 years.

17 The UV lamps would require replacement every two years and the

18 UV electronic ballast would need to be replaced every five

19 years. The RO membranes would be replaced every six to eight

20 years. The sources for these membrane replacement cartridges

21 are all from international suppliers.

22 15. Powerful pumps would force treatment water through semi-

23 permeable membranes to remove salts and other solids. The RO

24 system would be designed to operate at recovery rates ranging
from 75 to 85% (Carollo, 2017). The brine would be generated 25

26 continuously when the RO system is in operation and would be

27 conveyed back to the SCWWTF and blended with treated effluent
for disposal via the ocean outfall, thereby producing no 28

7
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 beneficial net reduction in wastewater treatment contaminants
N being discharged into the Monterey Bay. The RO pumps have been
called "energy hogs" by the District's consultant, Carollo
Engineering, during presentations at the District's Supplemental LO Supply Committee in 2017. These pumps also tend to be very loud
O when in operation. The EIR did not assess noise of RO pumps on

7 nearby residential areas and schools.

8 16. According to the EIR, "clean-in-place chemical waste is

9 anticipated from the RO system on the order of every 6-12

10 months" but the EIR does not describe the process nor volumes of

11 waste involved. Theses unknown clean-in-place chemical wastes

12 would be neutralized and disposed of in the sewer collection

13 system in the Rodeo Basin that has already been classified as

14 "over capacity".

15 17. The system would operate at an anticipated 70% overall

16 recovery rate (DEIR 'Project Background')

17 18. The Conveyance system would use radio-based supervisory

18 control and data acquisition at each site. The system would be

19 remotely operated. The EIR states that "facility operators

20 would conduct routine visits to the pump station sites to

21 monitor mechanical equipment inspection of pumps, valves, tanks,

22 and instrumentation." The EIR mentions above-grade equalization

tanks ("EQ" tank) at each site, and that they would require 23

24 inspection every five years and recoating every 20 years, but

25 does not address their size, material or exact locations within

26 the 11-miles of conveyance system.

19. The waste residuals from the AWTF would be returned via a 27

28 separate conveyance system to the SCWWTF. Both the brine and

8
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 secondary wastewater influent would follow pathways of other
utilities in some areas, but the exact route of the conveyance
system has not been determined. The size of pipe for both

4 conveyance systems likewise is not discussed in the EIR.

5 20. The proposed conveyance system would include 18 stream

6 crossings (identified on Project maps as "SC") and three areas

7 of Potential Jurisdictional Waters (identified on Project maps

8 as "PW") and a significant riparian corridor (identified as "RC"

9 on Project maps).

10 21. The recharge wells would also be operated remotely via radio-

11 based supervisory control and data acquisition systems.

12 District personnel would visit the well sites "on a regular

13 basis" but would be confined to Monday - Friday workdays, to

14 check well pumps, treatment equipment and to record the volume

15 of water injected and the residual chemical in the finished

16 water. Every three months, the submersible backwash pumps would

17 be operated to flush debris from the wells and require that raw

18 groundwater be pumped from each well for a period of about three

19 hours, requiring about 10,000 gallons of water per backwash

20 event at each injection well site. The expected flow would be

21 roughly 500-1000 gallons per minute, and would be disposed of in

22 the local sanitary sewer system or to the stormwater drains

23 flowing into nearby creeks leading to the Monterey Bay. The

24 location of the injection wells would place this discharge onto

25 the drainage areas and beaches near New Brighton State Beach and

26 the Seacliff Beach areas. This is not discussed in the EIR, nor

27 was there comment on the Draft EIR received from Fish and

28 Wildlife or State Parks agencies.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 22. The EIR anticipates the Project will require 3,600 megawatt

2 hours per year total, and the demand would be equally divided
between the AWTF and the conveyance system. It is unclear if

4 the energy calculations include demand by the injection well

5 pumps.

6 23. The EIR is fundamentally flawed as an informational document

7 because it fails to disclose significant information regarding

8 the data-based analysis of wastewater discharge volumes,

9 contingency plans for system failures or power outages, real-

10 time redundancy measures that would prevent operator or system

11 error resulting in contamination of the groundwater aquifer that

12 supplies potable water to a widespread area of the County's

13 residential and commercial areas. While the District insists

14 the Project would be shut down in the event of a problem, a

15 system malfunction at the One Water Treatment Facility in Marina

16 in January, 2018 resulted in 4.9 million gallons of raw sewage

17 flowing into the Bay even though the monitoring systems were

18 designed with redundancy, such as the District promises their

19 Project would be. The EIR is silent on a system of notification

20 of problems with the Project for users not served by their

21 District.

22 24. The EIR contains inaccurate claims regarding the statement in

23 response to DEIR comment submitted by County Water Resources

24 Director Mr. John Ricker (L-4-7 on page 3.6-6 of RTC). The EIR

25 states: the " District is only planning to recharge the purified

26 water in the ground for seawater intrusion prevention and has

27 not selected any sites for irrigation using purified water."

28 However, long-term lease agreements with the Twin Lakes Baptist

2 Church approved by the Board on December 4, 2018 and relating to

w the Twin Lakes Church Pilot Recharge Well' Project, one of three

4 injection well components of the Project, 2018 states the

5 Project will provide 3.5 AcreFeet/Year purified water annually

6 for the 50-year duration of the agreement.

25. The RTC provided inadequate responses to comments made on the

8 Draft EIR, especially those of agencies. "Conclusory statements
unsupported by specific references to empirical information,

10 scientific authorities, or explanatory information are

11 insufficient as responses to comments made by agencies or the

12 public" (14 Cal Code Regs 15088 (c)). Recommendations and

13 objections on major environmental issues that are rejected must

14 be addressed in detail, and the lead agency should explain its

15 reasons for not accepting those suggestions." (14 Cal Code Regs
15088 (c) ; 'People v County of Kern' (1976) 62 CA3d 761. "A

16 specific response is required, however, when a comment raises a

17 specific question about a significant environmental issue."

18

19 Stanislaus' (1981) 118 CA3d 348.

20 26. The Project has caused considerable social upset within the

21 greater MidCounty area because of historic lack of trust in the

22 District administration and policies. This has been especially

23 apparent with the residential neighborhood near the proposed

24 West Annex site, and most recently, from residential

25 neighborhoods in Live Oak near the proposed Chanticleer site

26 2505 Chanticleer Avenue. In response to significant public at

27 resistance to construction of the AWTF and an earlier plan to

28 construct a raw sewage treatment plant at the West Annex

11
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 location, the District changed the Project Scoping to include
2 other potential AWTF sites, and included the Chanticleer Site in

3 the second Scoping Period. The District failed, however, to
expand notification and outreach to the Live Oak neighborhoods

5 near the proposed .Chanticleer site, who are within the Santa

6 Cruz City Water District boundaries and receive no materials

7 from the District. At the January 15, 2019 District Board

8 meeting, over 30 residents of Live Oak attended the meeting and

9 about 10 made oral testimony to the fact that they were not made

10 aware of the Project's proposed Chanticleer Site for placing the

11 AWTF in their neighborhood until after the Board certified the

12 EIR as complete and approved the Project, and therefore these

13 residents were unable to participate in the full CEQA process.

14 District Director Carla Christensen apologized to the audience

15 for the oversight. General Manager Ron Duncan presented an

16 informational slide show to educate the residents who were, as

17 he admitted, "seeing this for the first time", and stated

18 District staff would be contacting the Live Oak neighborhood

19 residents soon for outreach.

20 27. "Changes made to a legally inadequate EIR after it is

21 certified and the Project is approved will not cure the agency's

22 approval of an inadequate EIR." 'Ukiah Citizens for Safety First

23 v City of Ukiah' (2016) 248 CA4th 256, 265.

24 28. The foundation for the Project's need is based upon estimates

25 and models, and was questioned by County Water Resources

26 Director Mr. John Ricker in his DEIR comment L-4-2: "the DEIR

27 states that an estimated 3,000afy would be needed to address

basin-wide overdraft. No citation or basis for this statement 28

12
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 is offered and it is most likely inaccurate." The RTC provided

2 no significant analytical response to this crucial agency

comment.

4

5 29. The Project has been consistently moved forward by District

6 staff and the Board even though alternative conjunctive use

7 water supply sources are available, have cooperative agreements

8 with the City since 2015, and as of December 3, 2018, have been

9 undergoing pilot testing in the District's Service Area #1 via

10 the Surface Water Transfer Pilot Project with the City. This

11 critical and significant information was ignored in the "No

12 Project" Alternative analysis in the Project DEIR, and was not

13 implemented into the Final EIR analysis. (Exhibit )

14 30. The District continues to insist that the City will not

15 provide more than 300afy from North Coast Pre-1914 water rights

16 sources, but Comment submitted in the RTC by Santa Cruz City

17 Water Dept. Director Ms. Rosemary Menard (L-2-3) states: "An

18 analysis should be completed that confirms the need to receive

19 300 acre feet each year as opposed to a potentially varied

20 regime of water transfers that achieve the same supply

21 reliability objectives. The City is strongly committed to the

22 success of a project that improves water reliability for the

23 City, other agencies and has beneficial impacts to the basin and

24 without evidence to the contrary believes a modified operational

25 approach may be equally successful." To date, the District has

26 not asked the City to amend the Surface Water Transfer Pilot

27 Project agreement made in 2015 to extend the date and terms of

28 the agreement.

13
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 31.

2 The District has not approached the City to ask for future

W conjunctive water use agreements, but the City has included
Soquel Creek Water District and Central Water District in a
"Change in Place of Use" request as part of the San Lorenzo

6 River Amended Water Rights petition to the State. The City held

7 two public hearings in November, 2018 for Scoping and CEQA

8 review with a Draft EIR expected by summer, 2019. Regardless of

9 this critical new information and real cooperative action taken

10 by the City, the District chose to certify the Project EIR and
approve the Project on December 18, 2018.

11 32.

12 The District has ignored scientific and historic groundwater

13 level information from outside sources showing improved levels

14 and has dismissed the significance of improved groundwater

15 levels at many of their own monitoring wells in recent years.

(Exhibit _! Water for Santa Cruz County)

16 33.

17 District Manager, Ron Duncan stated in an interview with Santa

18 Cruz Sentinel reporter Ms. Jessica York, published on April 14,
2018, that groundwater and coastal well water levels have been

19 trending higher in recent years, even as years of drought were

20 striking the state.

21 34. The District continued to ignore data that does not support

22 their overt and prejudiced actions approving the Project while

23 giving resources to conjunctive use projects within the regional

24 area shared by Santa Cruz City water. (DEIR, page 4.10-11) :

25 "Groundwater trends in the Purisima area (primarily the A/AA

26 unit) have slightly declined or stabilized over the last five

27 years but the Purisima unit nearest the project (wells SC-3A and

28 SC-5A) have increased with accelerated recovery in the last five

14
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 years. Spring and fall 2016 coastal groundwater levels in the

2 BC unit experienced an acceleration of recovery in early 2016
that was maintained for the remaining part of the year. Pumping
depressions around District production wells are shown but are

5 much smaller than in previous years. (HydroMetrics WRI, 2017b)

6 Further, "The coastal groundwater level trend in the Aromas well

7 area has generally been stable or has increased over the last

8 five years, while wells further inland have shown declines over

9 the last five years." (HydroMetrics WRI, 2017b).

10

11 35. Despite the statements in the Project DEIR area description

12 admitting accelerating groundwater rates in the District Project

13 area, the Board ignored written testimonies from nearly 60

14 members of the public submitted to them December 16-18, 2018,

15 requesting that the Board wait for two years to consider

16 approving the Project in order to allow Surface Water Transfer

17 Pilot Project agreements. to gain benefit of full analysis for

18 effectiveness. These comments were not made available to the

19 public at the December 18, 2018 Board meeting on the back table,

20 as is customary, however, all were addressed to the Board and

21 General Manager, Mr. Duncan. These substantial e-mail

22 communications were not made public until the January 15, 2019

23 Board meeting as an adjunct to the December 18, 2018 meeting

24 minutes.

25 36. The District and Board, as the decision-making body of the

26 lead agency for the Project, showed abuse of discretionary power

27 and prejudice toward Project approval by ignoring the CEQA

28 Project Findings that admit the information gained from a recent

15
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

study of the salinity of groundwater along the Monterey Bay

w coastline in the Project vicinity "represents a moment in time,
and does not indicate the rate at which the interface between

5 saltwater and fresh water is advancing landward through the

6 underground aquifers." (Project Findings page A-70 as approved

7 in Project Resolutions on December 18, 2018.) This statement,

8 combined with the real and measurable historic groundwater level
increases recorded and made available to the Board, were ignored

10 and the Board instead chose to approve certify the Project EIR
and approve the Project.

11 37.

12 The District has shown mistrust of the City in pursuing

13 agreements regarding surface water transfer for conjunctive uses

14 and implementing them. The final feasibility study conducted for

15 the Project and approved by the Board in 2018 acknowledges

16 (wherein the District is referred to as "SqCWD") "If SqCWD chose

17 to participate in infrastructure upgrades and SqCWD was granted
surface water rights, they could be able to acquire the

18 necessary 1,500 afy to relieve stress from the aquifer. The

19 actual amount may vary depending on the winter flows in any

20 given year. Without infrastructure upgrades, the cost is

21 estimated to be about $1,020 per acre-foot. With infrastructure

22 upgrades, the cost rises to $3,580 per acre-foot. (Kennedy

23 /Jenks, 2015). In a January 2014 County of Santa Cruz Water

24 Resources Status Report meeting, the cost of transfers to SqCWD

25 was stated to range from $850 per acre-foot (up to 1 mgd,

26 without new infrastructure) to $4,260 per acre-foot (with

27 infrastructure upgrades).'

28 (Exhibit

16
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 36. The District has chosen to focus significant and unbalanced

2 resources to the Project instead of pursuing conjunctive use

3 efforts and possible collaborative grant funding opportunities with

4 the City. The District, in fact, chose to negate the scientific

5 data collection on groundwater level improvement of the Surface

6 Water Transfer Pilot Project by activating large O'Neill Well

7 within the test area two weeks after the Pilot Test began. (Exhibit

8 January 7, 2019 City Water staff report to City Water Advisory
|Commission. District Operations Director Ms. Christine Mead stated

10 during her staff report made orally to the Board on January 15,

11 2019 that there has been no communication between the District and

12 Santa Cruz City Water staff regarding the O'Neill Ranch Well re-

13 activation and the City's planned Aquifer Supply Recharge ( "ASR")

14 Pilot Project nearby and found it regrettable that the District

15 will need to turn off the O'Neill Ranch Well to accommodate the

16 City ASR pilot testing.

17 35. The District has shown prejudice for the Project by allocating
18 significant and unbalanced resources to pursuing grant funding for

19 the Project and authorized Raftelis consultants to develop a

20 Icustomer Prop. 218 rate and fee increase restructuring to support

21 the Project economic feasibility. The Board approved these

22 recommendations supporting the Project on November 6, 2018, while

23 the Project DEIR was still undergoing CEQA analysis. (Exhibit

24 Memo to the Board of Directors re: Presentation by Raftelis

25 of Proposed Inclining Tiered Rates and Emergency Rates, Nov. 6,

26 2018) Petitioner points out that on the second page of the

27 presentation report, the District continues to declare Stage 3

28 Emergency rates which are higher than base rates and designed to

17
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 reflect groundwater levels and imposed conservation strategies.
However, these District staff recommendations concede future

3 economic increases would instead define the need for Stage 3

4 Emergency rates: "Emergency rates have also been developed that
5 correspond to the five stages of groundwater emergency. Currently

6 the District is charging Stage 3 Emergency Rates. Staff recommends

7 |discontinuing Stage 3 rates and returning to base rates if the

11 convened in San Jose on November 7, 2018 at an exclusive hotel to

12 meet in retreat with ESA consultants and "Pure Water Soquel Project

13 Program Retreat" members with Mr. Dana Jabinsky an executive from

14 Virginia Beach. Other attendees included Brown & Caldwell

24 36. The Twin Lakes Church Pilot Recharge Well, as one of three

25 injection well sites, is key component in the Project. The

26 District approved CWO 17-504 and the Twin Lakes Church Pilot

27 Recharge Well Project on November 6, 2018 with a Mitigated Negative

28 Declaration ("MND") containing errors regarding method of injecting

1 the water into the well, and lack of evaluation to required

2 generators on site to power injection pumps on nearby sensitive
receptors at schools. (Exhibit Twin Lakes Church Pilot

4 Recharge Well Project Final IS/MND, Nov. 6, 2018) On November 7,

5 2018, the District filed a NOD for this action, and on December 4,

6 2018 awarded a $1.1 Million bid for construction. All of these

7 actions showed prejudice by the District and Board toward the

8 Project, before the full CEQA process evaluation was complete.

9 37. The District showed abuse of discretion and prejudice for
10 approving the Project by releasing the Project Response to Comments

11 by surprise on December 7, 2018, just three days after staff

12 announced publicly at the December 4, 2018 Board meeting that the

13 document was not expected until early winter, and the item was not

14 included on the proposed Board Calendar discussed and published.

15 The District showed further abuse of discretion by scheduling

16 discussion and ultimate approval of Resolution

17 18-30 and 18-31 during a regular meeting, rather than holding a

18 public hearing that would have required special noticing and better

19 publicity for those who did not receive notice of the impending

20 action as a commenter on the DEIR.

21 38. The Board failed to consider new information presented to them

22 at the December 18, 2018 meeting and subsequently, at the January

23 15, 2019 public meeting. Despite requests from the public that the

24 Board reconsider and rescind Resolutions 18-30 and 18-31 due to

25 CEQA violations, neither the Board nor District Manager

26 acknowledged the requests with substantive or curative action.

19 agricultural connections to the system. After the 1989 Loma

20 Prieta Earthquake, the District worked with the City to

21 construct an emergency intertie connection. The District also

22 has a 4 " emergency intertie connection with neighboring Central

23 Water District, supplied by groundwater from the neighboring

24 Aromas Red Sands Aquifer. Both emergency intertie connections

25 have been and continue to be used when additional water supply
is needed due to emergencies and repairs. 26

39. The District Board is comprised of Dr. Tom 27
LaHue, (Chairman), Dr. Bruce Daniels (Vice-Chairman) Carla 28

2 Christensen, Dr. Bruce Jaffe, and Rachel Lather. All reside

W within the District boundaries and are customers.

20.

4 Ron Duncan is General Manager for the District, appointed

5 as Interim-Manager in 2016 when former Manager Ms. Kim Adamson

6 abruptly resigned. Mr. Duncan had worked in the District's water
conservation department prior to his appointment. The Board

8 approved Mr. Duncan's position as General Manager in 2017.

40.

9 Real Parties in Interest: Under Code of Civil Procedure

389 (a),

10 "any entity who has interest relating to this lawsuit,

11 and whose ability to protect that interest would be impaired or

12 impeded by the disposition of this lawsuit, must be joined as a

party.

13 In addition, Public Resources Code 21167,6.5 (a) requires
that petitioner name, ag a real party joined as interested the

14 person or persons named by the District in its CEQA Notice of

15 Determination." Therefore, the Petitioner names the following

16 as Real Parties in Interest:

17 41. The County of Santa Cruz, the local government agency

18 responsible for oversight of all private wells and some small

19 water company wells in the unincorporated areas of Santa Cruz

20 County, and reports to the County Board of Supervisors annually

21 regarding the Water Resources Status of Santa Cruz County. The

22 County also regularly monitors a system of groundwater

23 monitoring wells, some of which are located in the MidCounty

24 area. The County also owns and manages the sanitary sewer system

25 infrastructure throughout the unincorporated areas of the County

26 and within the Urban Services Line that convey raw sewage to the

27 SCCWWTF on Bay Street in Santa Cruz. The County also oversees

28 the storm drain infrastructure throughout the unincorporated

21
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

areas of the County and monitors streams regularly for water
quality and public health and safety.
42. The City of Santa Cruz is an incorporated government agency
with jurisdiction of the wastewater treatment facility and u 0 infrastructure within City limits. The Santa Cruz City
Wastewater Treatment Facility is named specifically on the

7 Project Notice of Determination, and is located within the City

8 limits. It is responsible for effluent treatment of all sewage

9 produced within the City limits and from residential,

10 commercial, and industrial uses within the County Urban Services

11 Line areas between the community of La Selva Beach to Santa

12 Cruz, also including the City of Capitola.

13 43. The "MidCounty Groundwater Basin" is named on the Project

14 Notice of Determination. Because the Santa Cruz Mid-County

15 Groundwater Agency ("MGA") is the lead agency currently tasked

16 by the State, under the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act

17 ( "SGMA" ) to develop a Sustainable Groundwater Management Plan

18 to achieve groundwater sustainability by 2040 for the MidCounty
Groundwater Basin, the Petitioner is naming this agency as a 19

20 Real Party in Interest. The MGA must submit this Plan to the

21 State Department of Water Resources ("DWR") for approval by

22 January 31, 2020.

23 44. Petitioner also names Twin Lakes Baptist Church as a Real

24 Party in Interest because it is named on the Notice of

25 Determination of the Twin Lakes Church Recharge Pilot Well
The District began work on 26 Project that is part of the Project.

27 the Project before the CEQA process was complete and entered

28 into agreements with Twin Lakes Baptist Church in October, 2018.

22
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 The bid for this pilot recharge well has a title that is
N m identical in nature with the Project. Twin Lakes Baptist Church
is a large church that includes a k-8 private school on the
grounds at 2701 Cabrillo College Drive in Aptos.
U 45. Real Parties in Interest Does 1-50,000, inclusive, may have

6 or may claim to have, interests in the Project, the exact nature

7 of which is unknown to Petitioner. The true names or

8 capacities, whether individual, corporate, association, or

9 otherwise, Does 1 to 50,000, inclusive, are unknown to the

10 Petitioner, who therefore sues these respondents by such

11 fictitious names. Petitioner will ask for leave to amend this

12 petition to show their true names and capacities and states of

13 incorporation when ascertained.

14

15

16

17 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

18 46 . This action is brought pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure

19 sections 1085 and 1094.5 and Public Resources Code sections

20 21167, 21168 and 21168.5. Venue is proper in Santa Cruz County

21 under Code of Civil Procedure sections 393 and 395 because Santa

22 Cruz County is where the Project is proposed to be constructed

23 and where the Project's environmental impacts would occur.

24 Petitioner respectfully asks that the court recuse itself if

25 associated in any way with associated water agencies,

26 respondents or real parties of interest, or associated in any

27 way with areas potentially impacted by the Project.

28

23
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

47. Petitioner respectfully reserves the right to request a

2 change in jurisdiction and venue at any time during the

3 proceedings, providing reasonable just cause.

5 FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6 48. There are many users of the Purisima Aquifer in the

7 MidCounty Basin. Soquel Creek Water District is but one, with

8 approximately 15,800 service connections. Two adjacent small
water systems, Trout Gulch Water Mutual and PureSource Water,

10 Inc. also pump locally from the Purisima Aquifer and have active

11 emergency inter-tie connections with the District. Other small

12 water companies in the immediate area of the Project include

13 Cathedral Hills Water Mutual, Cabrillo College, and Seascape

14 Golf Course, among others. Central Water District, while

15 relying upon the neighboring and underlying Aromas Red Sands

16 Aquifer, has an active emergency inter-tie connection with the

17 District that has historically seen regular use, most often

18 supplying the District with water during shortages or repairs.

19 According to the Santa Cruz County Health Services Agency, there

20 are approximately 130 small water systems in Santa Cruz County

21 that serve roughly 2,500 households, and at least 8,000 private

22 wells in Santa Cruz County that serve between one and four

23 households, some of which are located near the proposed Project

24 area. Additionally, major components of the Project, namely the

25 conveyance system and AWTF Chanticleer Avenue location would be

26 located outside of the District's jurisdiction.

27 49. These users essentially have had no meaningful or effective

28 representation regarding the District action on the Project to

24
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 inject 1.3 Million gallons/day of treated sewage water into the

2 Purisima Aquifer or to accept this treated water as defacto

3 customers from the District via multiple inter-tie connections that

4 would serve treated water in the Indirect Potable Re-Use scenario

5 inherent of the Project.

6 50. District General Manager Ron Duncan made the decision in
August, 2018 to deny multiple public requests for a reasonable time

8 extension for public comment on the Draft EIR ("DEIR"), stating

9 that the requests had come largely from citizens outside of the

10 District.

11 51. The Santa Cruz MidCounty Groundwater Agency ("MGA"), with

12 representation for all MidCounty Basin users, has been silent as a

13 body on the District's clear choice of the Project to address what

14 is perceived to be a widespread salt water intrusion problem in the
15 Purisima Aquifer. The District, being the jurisdiction with the
16 largest recognized customer base and pumping demand, has proceeded
17 independently with the Project to resolve the salt water intrusion

18 issue that has manifested in two isolated areas of it's service

19 area in recent years, while monitoring well logs of other areas

20 have shown groundwater level improvements.

21 52. The Project would not include injection wells in areas of the

22 Purisima Aquifer that have shown groundwater level evidence of

23 possible seawater intrusion.

24 53. Petitioner, along with other members of the public

25 representing adjacent small water companies, private well owners,

26 and customers of the City of Santa Cruz have made regular and

27 frequent requests during oral communications at District Board

28 meetings to have the opportunity to vote on the Project in advance

25
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 of the Project approval because the Project would inject treated

2 sewage water directly into the Basin that supplies potable water

3 for all Basin users, not just the District's customers. Over the

4 past two years, Petitioner has presented petitions to the District

5 with over 300 signatures of Basin users asking for the opportunity

6 to vote on the Project in advance of approval. The District has

7 been unresponsive.

8

9

10

11

12 Members of the public have lodged persistent protests and pleadings

13 with the District staff and Board for temperance on their actions

14 over the span of years PureWater Soquel Project has seemingly been

15 regarded by District as having already been chosen without full
16 environmental analysis of other feasible wäter supply solutions

17 available. The Board has repeatedly dismissively regarded the

18 public and stated publicly that they would make no decisions

19 regarding which path they would choose instituting the PureWater

20 Soquel Project, and have insisted other approaches for managing

21 their perceived salt water intrusion problem within the Basin were
22 being equally considered. However, these claims have not been

23 matched by their focused actions and consistent approvals for

24 massive allocations of District resources for the PureWater Soquel
25 Project, while showing much less interest in projects, especially a

26 regional surface water transfer agreement with the City of Santa

27 Cruz.

28

26
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 The ultimate manifestation of that predisposition was the omission

2 of viable and feasible project alternatives in the PureWater Soquel

3 Project Draft EIR, lacking consideration of regional surface water

4 Itransfers from the North Coast streams solely, and analysis of the

5 No Project alternative using a broader scope of data than was

6 selected. Further, the wide lack of sufficient analysis and data-

7 supported responses to comments submitted, especially by key public

8 agencies, with regard to the PureWater Soquel Project Draft EIR

9 supported the District's long-standing indifference to seriously

10 implementing a regional approach for conjunctive water management

11 with feasible projects that are already underway as pilot projects,

12 for which infrastructure exists, and that can accomplish the
13 District's goal of meeting a 1500AFY supplemental supply with
14 insignificant environmental impacts. The Board has abused it's

15 discretion in approving the PureWater Soquel Project Final EIR that

16 is deficient.

17

18 On or about November 16, 2016, the District released a CEQA Notice

19 of Preparation and Initial Study for PureWater Soquel Project with

20 a 30-day public comment period. On or about December 7, 2016, the

21 District held two Public Scoping Hearings at Twin Lakes Church.

22 Staff and ESA consultants made presentations but members of the

23 public were not allowed to publicly ask questions for clarification

24 of material. Two court recorders transcribed public oral

25 testimony. At small informal presentations, members of the public

26 questioned the merits of the PureWater Soquel Project and many

27 residents were angry that the District would consider building a

28 raw sewage treatment facility in their neighborhood near the

27
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 proposed West Annex facility site. Other members of the public

2 ardently demanded that water transfers with Santa Cruz City be

3 included and analyzed as a superior project to PureWater Soquel.

4 Scoping closed on January 5, 2017, with the District granting a 15-

5 day extension to public comment due to the busy holiday season.

6

7 Throughout the winter and early spring of 2017, the District

8 continued to receive massive public outcry by residents of the
9 neighborhood near District Offices regarding a possible raw sewage

10 treatment plant component of PureWater Soquel Project to be located

11 in their backyards. District Board and staff members met with

12 select neighborhood members in an effort to quell their protests,

13 but the meetings did not go well and outcry intensified. The

14 District hired security guards to attend Board meetings because the

15 angry citizens of the neighborhoods surrounding the proposed West

16 Annex filled the Board chambers beyond capacity.

17

18 In response to this massive protest, the District Board reduced

19 source water options for the PureWater Soquel Project to be
20 already-treated secondary effluent from the Santa Cruz Wastewater

21 Treatment Facility (AWTF) and added other advanced treatment

22 facility locations outside District service boundaries for

23 consideration.

24

25 On or about June 22, 2017 the District published a Revised Notice

26 of Preparation (NOP) that an environmental impact report (EIR)

27 would be prepared to reflect the recent changes and an additional

28 30-day scoping period for public comment through July 22, 2017.

28
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 On July 12, 2017, the District held a Public Scoping Comment
2 Hearing at Twin Lakes Church. Again, no members of the public were
allowed to ask questions publicly to clarify information. There

4 was a court reporter to transcribe oral testimony. The District

5 continued to receive strong requests from the public to fully

6 consider a water transfer project with Santa Cruz City as a

7 superior project for environmental reasons and a more readily-

8 available solution to addressing groundwater level issues in the
Purisima Aquifer. A citizen effort began to collect petition

10 signatures to allow all who depend on the Purisima Aquifer for

11 potable water the ability to vote on the PureWater Soquel Project.

12 Many area residents voiced protests to the District's plan to

13 inject treated sewage water into the area's groundwater supply.

14

15

16 In July, 2017, Soquel Creek Water District entered into a
17 Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) agreement with the City of Santa

18 Cruz for sewage water necessary for the PureWater Soquel Project.

19 Citizens protested that there was little energy being directed to

20 the Water Transfer Pilot Test with the City of Santa Cruz.

21

22

23 In spring of 2018, Board and staff members travelled to

24 Washington, D.C. to lobby for federal grants to fund PureWater

25 Soquel Project. Upon their return, the Board zealously began

26 holding monthly special meetings at the District Office to explore

27 Fast-Track Construction of the PureWater Soquel Project and also

28 rapidly develop a new rate and fee structure increase program to

29
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 support the Project. The Board and staff met in special session

2 May 1, May 29, June 19, June 26, July 24, and August 21, 2018.

3 Agendas all focused on PureWater Soquel Project construction models

4 for rapid completion times, and how to obtain necessary funding for

that work. Citizens attending those meetings protested the sudden

6 Fast-Track mindset, and commented that the Board only seemed

7 concerned about successfully getting grant money for the PureWater

8 Soquel Project but was paying little or no attention to making

9 progress on the Water Transfer Pilot Test with Santa Cruz. Indeed,

10 at the May 29 special meeting, the Board approved moving the project

11 completion date of the proposed PureWater Soquel Project forward

12 one year to 2022 in order to qualify for federal and state grant

13 funding. Director Jaffe at one point did ask staff to clarify that

14 the District could submit the PureWater Soquel Project grant

15 applications even though the CEQA process was not complete.

16

17 On or about June 29, 2018, the Board approved various scopes of

18 work for for professional consulting services related to the

19 |l PureWater Soquel Project. Members of the public protested the
20 seemingly premature agreement when the CEQA process was not yet

21 complete.

22

23 On or about June 29, 2018, the District released the Draft

24 Environmental Impact Report (DEIR) for the PureWater Soquel Project

25 with a 45-day comment period ending August 13, 2018. Scoping

26 comments earlier submitted by the public were not included

27 verbatim, but rather were summarized by the ESA consultants and

28 included in an appendix that was not immediately available to the

30
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 public in hard copies of the document at public libraries. Citizens

2 organized three public study sessions at local libraries to help

3 each other understand how to read, interpret and comment upon the

4 massive 1000+-page complex document. Many people submitted written

5 requests to the District to extend the August 13 end-of-public

6 comment date. District General Manager Ron Duncan refused to

7 grant an extension. When questioned by a citizen attending a

District Outreach Subcommittee meeting soon after after, Mr. Duncan

9 stated that there were not enough requests from ratepayers to do

10 so, and the delay of time could mean increased Project costs to the

11 ratepayers. Members of the public concerned about the inadequacies

12 of the DEIR held widespread consensus that more time was in fact

13 needed to read and comment upon the document, especially owing to

14 the lack of analysis to regional water transfers as an
15 environmentally and economically-feasibly superior project

16 alternative. Members of the public continued to protest the

17 PureWater Soquel Project at Board meetings and ask that the
18 District reconsider better analysis of the conjunctive use project

19 as a superior alternative to the Project. the Board was

20 Idismissive.

21

22

23 On or' about July 17, 2018, the Board accepted the "Bench Scale

24 Testing Technical Memo" by consultants Black & Veatch, verifying
25 there would be no adverse chemical interaction within the District

26 supply system by using surface water from Santa Cruz City in a

27 Pilot Water Transfer test. Members of the public praised the

28 District for taking careful action to analyze and consider

31
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 potential chemical contamination issues relative to surface water

2 and ground water interactions. Members of the public again

3 beseeched the Board to place PureWater Soquel Project plans on hold

4 until the regional conjunctive use pilot project with the City of
Santa Cruz could occur and groundwater monitoring results

6 analyzed. Members of the public also ardently suggested the

7 District negotiate with Santa Cruz City an extension for the terms

8 of the conjunctive use pilot project because the District had taken

9 three years to achieve work they felt necessary to initiate the

10 five-year project agreement. The Board was resistant and
11 dismissive.

12

13 On or about September 4, 2018, the Board accepted a Technical Memo

14 'Economic Study Estimating Benefits of the PureWater Soquel

15 Project' by Dr. Brent Haddad and Bryan Pratt, PhD candidate of

16 UCSC. Staff explained that Dr. Haddad had prepared the report for

17 inclusion in the District's application for grant funding of the

18 |PureWater Soquel Project. Members of the public protested that

19 this cost/benefit analysis report claimed NO ALTERNATIVES available

20 to the PureWater Soquel Project when in fact the District had the

21 ability to move forward with the water transfer pilot project in

22 the near term, based on extremely favorable chemical analysis of

23 surface groundwater supply interaction.

24

25 On or about October 2, the District Board approved the PureWater

26 Soquel Feasibility Study Final Report that narrowed a range of

27 aternatives to a single recommended groundwater replenishment

28 project, the PureWater Soquel Project. At the same meeting, the

32
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Board approved the scope of work for professional hydrogeology

2 consulting services related to the PureWater Soquel Project and

3 also approved the Draft Initial Study and Mitigated Negative
4 Declaration for the Twin Lakes Church Pilot Recharge Well Project

5 that is one of the three sites for PureWater Soquel Project

6 injection wells. Members of the public protested the District's
continued hyper-focus of resources on a Project that had not

8 completed full CEQA process of evaluation. The Board was

9 dismissive. Members of the public also inquired if the District

10 would pursue necessary permitting requirements by the State for the

11 initiation of the conjunctive use Surface Water Pilot Project. The

12 Board was silent. The Board also met in closed session to

13 negotiate property agreements for the Lam Property at 2505

14 Chanticleer Avenue and the Twin Lakes Church Recharge Pilot Well

15 Project sites, both regarding significant District monetary

16 expenditure to support PureWater Soquel Project, even though CEQA
17 process for the Project was incomplete.

18

19 On October 16, 2018, the Board met in Closed Session at the

20 conclusion of their regularly-scheduled meeting to discuss

21 "acquisition /lease agreement in real property located at 2502

22 Chanticleer Avenue (APN 029-13-54) with Ron Duncan representing the

23 Santa Cruz Negotiator with Lam Estate representative. Members of

24 the public commented that the Board clearly had determined they

25 would approve and pursue the PureWater Soquel Project even before

26 the Response to Comments on the Draft EIR was completed and

27 released for public comment. The Board acted with dereliction of

28

33
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 duty and violated CEQA law to fully consider all Project

2 environmental impacts and mitigations.

3

4 On November 1, 2018, the District could have initiated the Surface

5 Water Transfer Pilot Test but staff had not yet satisfied necesary

6 public noticing requirements in the Service Area 1 or completed

7 other work regarding baseline groundwater monitoring within the

8 test area. The Project was delayed until the end of November,

9 2018. Members of the public encouraged District staff to ensure

10 all requirements were met in a timely manner so that the Pilot

11 Project could begin as soon as possible to potentially improve

12 groundwater levels and increase stream flow in Soquel Creek, which

13 were low due to below normal rainfall.

14

15 On November 6, 2018, the Board approved Resolution 18-26 adopting

16 the Final IS/MND for the Twin Lakes Church Pilot Recharge Well

17 Project (Item 6.3 on page 39). This Project is a component of the

18 PureWater Soquel Project and is identified as one of three Project

19 injection well sites. The Board again abused their discretionary

20 power and demonstrated their patent disregard for the CEQA process

21 by approving an erroneous IS/MND for the Twin Lakes Church project,

22 and in fact approved a project to begin initial construction for

23 PureWater Soquel Project injection well work before completion of

24 CEQA process. The Board showed dereliction in its duty by

25 accepting this erroneous IS/MND that stated in response to public

26 comments BS-4 "A pump would not be used to pressurize the recharge

I
27 water and that the test would be "gravity feed". This response

28 is repeated in BS-19 that the well "is not a pressure injection".

34
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Chairman Daniels reiterated this information when the commenter

2 publicly asked again about the discrepancy, when other areas of the
report cite a 12 megawatt electricity requirement. He stated the

4 City was making the District do this Project. (This erroneous

5 reference to the Twin Lakes Church Pilot Recharge Well Project as

6 "gravity feed" was again made public at the December 18, 2018 Board

7 meeting when the commenter inquired again and Director Daniels

8 admitted that what he thought was not true, yet the Board did not

9 take action to retract their approval of the Twin Lakes Church

10 IS/MND or Resolution 18-26.) Of note, Mr. Steve Wait, IDE

11 Technologies representative was in the audience and spoke in praise

12 of the District raising rates and fees to support PureWater Soquel

13 Project. Members of the public felt the Board had invited IDE

14 Technologies to the meeting as an informal consultation for the

15 Project.

16

17 On November 7, 2018, the District filed a Notice of Determination

18 for the Twin Lakes Church Pilot Recharge Well Project with the

19 County Clerk of the Board of Supervisors.

20

21 On November 20, 2018, District staff reported the Surface Water

22 Transfer Pilot Project was again delayed, due to staff issues.

23 Members of the public encouraged the Board to begin the Pilot

24 Project as soon as possible and to negotiate an extension of the

25 agreement with the City of Santa Cruz. The Board was dismissive

26 and silent.

27

28

- 35
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 On December 3, 2018, the public ceremony to initiate the Surface
2 Water Transfer Pilot Project was held, acknowledging that the

3 Project's conjunctive management approach had received a high-

4 priority recommendation by the City's Water Supply Advisory

5 Committee (WSAC) in 2014.

6 Members of the public attended and celebrated with District, City

7 and County officials as 1200 gallons/minute flowed through the pre-

8 existing intertie connection to the District's customers, allowing

9 area pumping to cease.

10

11 On December 4, 2018, District staff reported at the Board meeting

12 that the Response to Comment (RTC) on the PureWater Soquel Project

13 DEIR was expected to be released in early winter. The Board

14 approved their December and January meeting calendars with key

15 issues anticipated on respective meeting dates. The December 18

16 meeting calendar did not include any notation of PureWater Soquel

17 Project CEQA action, other than Prop 1 Funding Approval. Members

18 of the public praised the Board on successfully initiating the

19 Surface Water Transfer Pilot Project with Santa Cruz City.

20

21 On December 4, 2018, the Board also approved a 50-year Easement

22 Agreement with Twin Lakes Church for the Twin Lakes Church Pilot

23 Recharge Well Project, agreeing to pay $800/month rent for the

24 duration of the easement, waive Water Demand Offset requirements

25 for a single family residence and proposed coffee house on site,

26 and to provide 3.5AFY purified water free of charge for church

27 athletic fields for the 50-year duration of the easement. "The

28 intention is to provide purified water for this demonstration

36
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 project." (page 70 under 12. Special Provisions of the Agreement.)
2 Clearly, the Board was again derelict in it's duty to follow CEQA

3 law to fully consider all environmental impacts associated with

4 PureWater Soquel Project by entering into this 50-year agreement

5 and offering special favors, including planned irrigation using

6 purified water as a demonstration project. Members of the public

7 orally protested the Board's disregard for upholding full CEQA
8 process.

9

10

11

12 Just three days later, on December 7, 2018, The District released

13 the Response to Comments (RTC) on the PureWater Soquel Project DEIR

14 document, and announced that the Board would consider certifying

15 the Final EIR and approve the Project at their next meeting on
16 December 18, 2018. The District acted erratically by releasing the

17 significant RTC document so quickly after publicly alluding that it

18 would not be available for public comment for an extended period of

19 time and not including it on the Board-approved December 18 meeting

20 Icalendar. Members of the public who watch the District Board

21 meetings on live stream video were given no indication that they

22 need check the District website in anticipation of release of the

23 crucial RTC document release and associated completion of CEQA

24 public comment opportunity.

25

26 Although the RTC was a 720-page document and very complex to

27 interpret, the District allowed only minimal 10 days for public
comment. This announcement came as
28 a complete surprise to those who

37
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

were notified as commenters. Other members of the public had no

2 idea the critical and massive document was even available for

3 review until near the end of the 10-day comment period, when alerts

4 began to be posted on social media and NextDoor neighborhood calls-

5 to-action. There were no hard copies available in public libraries

6 for members of the public who have sight impairment challenges to

7 read. The only hard copy available was at the District Office, but

8 was only available during Monday-Friday business hours and not at

9 all on weekends. Members of the public were not given any

10 comfortable seating or a table at which to study the 4-inch-thick

11 complex document, even though they requested it. Some elderly

12 members of the public complained that they were made physically
13 uncomfortable by lack of accommodations but were not provided with

14 anything to improve study conditions, even when they asked. The

15 District acted with disrespect and seemingly discouraged public

16 review of the PureWater Soquel Project RTC document.

18 Many requests for an extension of time for public comment were

19 submitted in writing to the District. The busy holiday season
20 prevented many who quickly recognized significant deficiencies in

21 the RTC to delegate the amount of time necessary to address the

22 voluminous document. Members of the public voiced concern that the

23 responses were inadequate, especially those from key agencies and

24 submitted written requests for such but received only a non-

25 descript response alluding to the impending December 18, 2018 Board

26 Iconsideration.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 There were many blatant deficiencies in the responses, some of

2 which are discussed elsewhere in this Petition, but there was also

3 at least one clear error and misrepresentation of facts in response

4 to comments from two agencies. Comment submitted by Mr. John

5 Ricker, Director of Santa Cruz County Environmental Health Services

6 Water Resource Director, stated (page 3.6-2 in RTC) points out the

7 DEIR lacks meaningful analysis of disposal contingency plans

8 regarding finished water from the AWPF not meeting necessary water

9 quality parameters and asked "Lastly, is there an option for

10 surface irrigation at sites other than La Barranca Park, (Cabrillo

11 College, Twin Lakes, Willowbrook, or Monterey)? If none of these

12 contingencies have been planned for, please explain why not."

13 Response L-4-7 (page 3.6-6 in RTC) states: "The La Barranca and

14 the fill station at SC WWTF are the only surface irrigation sites

15 considered as par of this project by SCWWTF. Fore the District,

16 the primary focus of the Pure Water Soquel project is seawater

17 intrusion prevention. With this focus, District is only planning

18 to recharge the purified water in the ground for seawater intrusion
19 prevention and has not selected any sites for irrigation using

20 purified water." This is not true. The Board approved a 50-year

21 3.5 AFY purified water irrigation with Twin Lakes Church for the

22 PureWater Soquel Project on December 4, 2018.

23

24 On December 18, 2018, the Board held a public meeting, rather than

25 a public hearing, and thereby streamlined and by-passed any formal

26 public noticing requirements for their consideration of completion

27 of CEQA process for the PureWater Soquel Project. There was no

28 copy of the Response to Comment and Final EIR available at the

39
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 meeting for members of the public to review. Members of the public

2 provided further oral testimonies regarding the Project, pointing

3 out many problems and concerns with responses to substantial and

4 significant agency comments on the Draft EIR deficiencies. Members

5 of the public also testified that more time was necessary to

6 thoroughly review the document and asked for an extension of public
comment period. The Board took an intermission after public

8 comment closed. Notably, there was no written comment from public

9 agencies regarding the Response to Comment, and there were no

10 responses at all from Fish and Wildlife regarding the Draft EIR.

11

12 Upon re-convening, the Board heard consultant testimony and then

13 responded. Director Rachel Lather stated with an irritated tone

14 that she did not understand why members of the public could

15 complain about lack of time to read the document, and voiced the

16 public had had plenty of time to review it at the public libraries,

17 available since last summer. Chairman Tom LaHue and Vice-Chair

18 Bruce Daniels corrected her, clarifying that the public was

19 referring to the Response to Comments, not the Draft EIR, and that

20 the Response to Comment was not made available at the public

21 libraries. Director Lather then asked how large the Response to

22 Comment document was, to which Chairman LaHue responded " about the

23 same size as the Draft EIR." Director Lather then said "Oh, " and

24 moved on to her other comments. Clearly, not all of the Board had

25 even read the comments submitted to their decision-making body, nor

26 had they fully examined and considered the crucial input from

27 public agencies and members of the public regarding deficiencies of

the Draft EIR.
28 It is questionnable if District Counsel had

40
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 submitted to the Board any formal and legal recommendations for

2 their consideration of the Draft EIR and Response to Comments to

3 ensure adequate and necessary ownership of the District's lead

4 agency and decision-making duties in accepting work performed by an
outside consulting agency. (The District has subsequently responded
to a citizen Public Record Act request for such that the material

7 will not be available until January 21, 2018, after the close of

8 the CEQA appeal window for the Project.) The Board unanimously

9 approved Resolution 18-30 that accepted the Final EIR for the
10 PureWater Soquel Project and certified it as complete with a

11 Statement of Overriding Consideration. Accordingly, the Board then

12 approved Resolution 18-30 to approve the PureWater Soquel Project,

13 with Director Lather opposing due to choice of Project location.

14 The Board acted in violation of CEQA guidelines, whereby as the

15 decision making body of the Project's lead agency, they approved

16 the Final EIR and Statement of Overrriding Consideration without a

17 full knowledge and ownership of it's contents or of potential

18 significant deficiencies that remain in the Project due to

19 insufficient consideration by consultants to address them in
20 responses to comments submitted by public agencies and individuals.

21

22

23 Later on December 18, 2018 the Board approved Bid Award CW017-504

24 "Twin Lakes Church Seawater Intrusion Prevention Pilot Well

25 Project" to Maggiora Brothers Drilling for $1.1 Million, including

26 an injection pump. The member of the public who had questioned the

27 Board regarding the injection vs. gravity feed issue protested the

28 Project and again raised the issue, asking why Director Daniels

41
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 made untruthful claims at a previous meeting. Director Daniels

2 shrugged and commented that he understood the well would be only

3 gravity-feed. The citizen then again protested the Project. In

4 spite of the significant error made public in the Twin Lakes Church

5 Pilot Recharge Well Project, approved November 6, 2018, the Board

6 took no action to correct the mistake or to rescind Resolution 18-

7 26 approving the Project. Once again, the Board was derilect in

8 it's duty to ensure that factual informationbecky presented to the
public was correct before approval, and that they were well-

10 informed before making decisions on the IS/MND for the Project. It

11 is to be noted that the Board approved the Project with one name ("

12 Twin Lakes Church Pilot Recharge Well Project") and approved a bid

13 for it's construction subsequent to approving the PureWater Soquel

14 Project, calling it by a different name: "Twin Lakes Church

15 Seawater Intrusion Prevention Pilot Well Project".

16

17 On January 7, 2019 Santa Cruz City Water staff reported to the City

18 Water Advisory Commission that on or about December 20, 2018,

19 Soquel Creek Water District re-activated it's large O'Neill Ranch

20 Well, located within the Surface Water Transfer Pilot Test area.

21 Correspondingly, volumes of surface water being delivered to the

22 test area through the intertie connection dropped by roughly 50%.

23 City staff reported to the Water Advisory Commission, who were

24 plainly shocked, that the District has stated it will turn off the

25 O'Neill Ranch Well when the City begins it's Aquifer Storage

26 Recharge Pilot Project at the Beltz 12 Well nearby. That Project

27 is antipated to being by late January, 2019. Public inquiry of

28 District staff regarding the reason for essentially voiding the

42
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Pilot Project test results met with a refusal to discuss the
2 matter. By this action, the District is seemingly attempting to

3 void the experiment that would produce meaningful and measurable

4 data regarding the effectiveness of regional surface water

5 transfers for unknown reasons, yet by these actions, is causing

6 great concern for the integrity of future work and/or value of

7 agreements and wasting ratepayer money on meaningless Pilot Project

8 results.

9

10 The Board, as the supreme decision-making body of the PureWater

11 Soquel Project's lead agency; has abused it's descretionary power,

12 neglected to make informed decisions based on adequate and correct

13 information and has made no effort to correct it's actions when

14 presented with clear proof of error and/or clear evidence lack of
15 adequate response to significant deficiencies in data and
16 documentation. Further, the Board has regularly and continually

17 treated dismissively members of the public who have shown genuine

18 and well-informed concern about the CEQA process over the life of

19 the Project's examination and who would be potentially affected by

20 the PureWater Soquel Project. Finally, due to the consistent

21 disregard given these members of the public by the Board, citizens

22 outside of the Soquel Creek Water District boundaries have been

23 given no opportunity for representation in decision-making on a

24 Project that could potentially and adversely affect their water

25 supply, the environment and the associated peaceful enjoyment of

26 life and their property.

27

28

43
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 On January 15, 2019, Petitioner presented oral and written request
2 to the Board to reconsider and rescind Resolutions 18-30 and 18-31,

3 presenting reasonable legal information to cause the Board to

4 consider her request. The Board was dismissive and unresponsive.

5 The Board also heard testimony from about 10 members of the public

6 from the Live Oak area (most of the 30+ Live Oak audience members

7 with small children had to leave before the Board considered the

8 item) requesting input on the Project's Chanticleer Avenue AWTF

9 site, having received no notice of the CEQA process. Because they

10 are customers of Santa Cruz City Water, not the District, and had

11 no just cause to investigate the District's website for information

12 about the Project. These residents also asked for the Board's

13 reconsideration of the Project's Chanticleer Avenue site. The

14 Board apologized for their oversight, and General Manager Ron

15 Duncan presented educational information about the Project,

16 admitting "it's probably the first time you're seeing this."

STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS

8 101. Petitioner is filing this petition within 30 days after
9 December 19, 2018, the date which the District Manager of Special
10 Projects/Communications Melanie Mow-Schumacher filed the Project

11 Notice of Determination with Santa Cruz County Clerk of the Board

12 of Supervisors, as required by Public Resources Code 21167(b).

13 (Exhibit ). Note that in Santa Cruz County, Notice of
14 Determination is filed with the Clerk of the Board of Supervisors,

15 rather than Clerk of the County. Even though the District

16 technically initiated the Project with agreements joining the Twin

17 Lakes Baptist Church in October, 2018, filed NOD on November 7,

18 2018 (Exhibit __) and awarded the Bid for Twin Lakes Church

19 Groundwater Recharge and Saltwater Intrusion Prevention Pilot

20 Recharge Well on December 4, 2018. Although the District initiated

21 work on the Twin Lakes Church Project, an injection well and a

22 critical element of the Project, on or about January 2, 2019,

23 |Petitioner requests the Court to hold with the December 19, 2018

24 NOD filing date for purposes of statute and not render the Petition

25 moot.

26 102. Petitioner filed a Petition for Alternative Writ of Mandate

27 on January 17, 2019, and filed an amended Petition for Peremptory

28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Writ of Mandate because the cause and evidence against the

4 STANDING

5 102. Petitioner is beneficially interested in the subject matter

6 of this proceeding because the Project may adversely impact the

7 groundwater resources that serve not only her family but also the

8 entire MidCounty area at-large for which she has shown a long-

9 standing and deep level of concern and sense of protection as a

10 long-term resident. (Exhibit is communication from Aptos /La

11 Selva Fire Chief Aaron Lowe stating respect for Petitioner's level

12 of concern for community safety. Exhibit is Petitioner's Op Ed

13 from 2016 explaining reasons for filing for County Supervisor

14 candidacy with reference to water concerns included therein.)

15 103. In CEQA guidelines (23.7) it is stated "General rules of

16 standing for Mandamus petition applies." Further guidance on the

17 matter is supported by 'Santiago County Water v. County of Orange'

18 (1981) 118CA 3d 818,832. Further standing based on geographic

19 proximity with respect to Project location was established without

20 the need to having to prove adverse impact by the Project in 'Kane

21 v. Redevelopment Agency' (1986) 179 CA 3d 899,904 and 'Bozung vs.

22 LAFCO' (1975) 13 C3d 263, 272, and 'Citizens Ass'n for Sensible

23 Dev. V. County of Inyo' (1985) 172 CA3d 151,158. "Against a

24 municipal entity based on alleged violations of CEQA, a property

25 owner, taxpayer or elector who establishes a geographical nexus

26 with the site" has standing.

27 104. Under Cal.Civ. Code of Procedure 1084-1097, a Writ of Mandate

28 gives discretion to the Court to weigh the evidence presented by

46
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 the petitioner supporting that some just and useful purpose may be
2 answered by the Writ. This process was introduced to prevent

3 disorders from failure of justice, and is to be used when justice

4 and good government are needed but there has been no such remedy.

5 105. A Writ must be issued under Cal. Civ., Code of Procedure

6 11094.5 (a) for the purpose of inquiring into validity of any final
7 administrative order made.

8 106. "Public Standing " is addressed by CEQA guidelines 23.6(b)
(1) : Enforcement of Public Duty: "Petitioner may have standing

10 despite absence of beneficial interest (23.4-5) if the question is

11 one of public rights enforcement of public duty, and the public

12 interest would suffer if the agency is not compelled to perform."

13 (CCP 1086). This is supported by 'Environmental Protection Info

14 Center v Dept. of Forestry and Fire Protection' (2008) 44C4th

15 459,479; 'Common Cause v Board of Supervisors' (1989) 49 C3d
16 432,439; "to provide purpose that the public right is not thwarted

17 by a public agency when shown that 1. An alleged breach of an

18 important public duty is involved, 2. The persons who are

19 beneficially interested in the action would find it difficult to

20 Ivindicate their own rights, and 3. The petitioner asserts a

21 specific interest in protecting the rights of the beneficiaries of

22 the public duty or has demonstrated a commitment to the subject

23 matter of the right being asserted." In each case where courts

24 upheld citizen standing involving a surrogate need because persons

25 directly interested in enforcement of the statute might not have

26 the resources, ability or motivation to bring an enforcement

11 As an addendum to the inadequate EIR analysis of potential
12 contamination of groundwater, Petitioner would like to make the

15 and Caldwell Anti-Degradation Studies (2016, 2018) cited in the EIR

16 because the documents are not readily available on the District

48
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

(Writ of Mandate - Violation of CEQA)

# Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by this reference Paragraphs # through #
above as though the same were set forth fully herein.

# Under CEQA, a lead agency must identify all significant effects on the
environment caused by proposed project that cannot be avoided, and must separately
identify any significant effect on the environment that would be irreversible if the project
is implemented. (CA PRC § 21100 (b); CEQA Guidelines 15126.2 (b).) The EIR must
describe and evaluate feasible measures for minimizing or avoiding a project's direct,
indirect, and cumulative impacts on the environment. (CA PRC § 21100.1 (b); CEQA
Guidelines § 15126.4.) The EIR must describe a reasonable range of alternatives to the
proposed project. The range of potential alternatives to the proposed project shall include
those that could feasibly accomplish most of the basic objectives of the project but avoid
or substantially lessen any of the significant effects of the project, even if the alternative
would be more costly. (CEQA Guidelines §§ 15126.6 (a),(b),(c).) The EIR shall include
sufficient information about each alternative to allow meaningful evaluation, analysis,
and comparison with the proposed project. (CEQA Guidelines § 15126.6 (d).) A lead
agency must provide good faith, reasoned analysis in response to comments received
about an EIR. (CEQA Guidelines § 15088 (c).) The EIR must contain specific responses
to comments that raise specific questions about significant issues.

Inadequate Analysis of Impacts to Groundwater Quality and Public Health

# The EIR lacks credible information to support its findings that the Project's
impact on groundwater resources would be less than significant, and it fails to identify
irreversible effects on the environment that would result from implementation of the
Project. In particular, the EIR claims that introducing advanced purified wastewater into
the existing groundwater supply of the Purisima aquifer units would not degrade aquifer
water quality or violate water quality standards. (EIR Impact 4.10-2. and 4.10-3.) As
support for finding Impacts 4.10-2 and 4.10-3 "Less than Significant," the EIR relies on
regulatory human health screening levels primarily established by federal and state

shccdcall

agencies as set forth by the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB). The EIR
concludes that advanced water purification processes would greatly reduce or eliminate
the concentrations of Constituents of Emerging Concern (CECs) and other chemicals of
concern to levels protective of human health. This conclusion is based primarily on five
regulatory and scientific sources: SWRCB Recycled Water Policy (as amended in 2013),
SWRCB Groundwater Replacement Regulations (2014), a review of the Project by an
advisory panel of water industry experts from the National Water Research Institute, a
Groundwater Replenishment Feasibility Study and technical memoranda by Carollo
Engineers, and a science advisory panel convened by the SWRCB. Data from these
sources might support the EIR's conclusion that the Project would comply with state
groundwater regulations. But existing water quality standards based on such sources are
not sufficiently comprehensive to support the EIR's more significant conclusion that the
Project's impact on groundwater quality would be "less than significant." The EIR
analysis does not take into account a growing body of scientific evidence that casts doubt
on the Project's conclusion and supports the possibility that the Project's impact on
groundwater resources might indeed be significant, and cause for public concern.

# SWRCB Recycled Water Policy is based on testing for only a limited list of
indicator chemicals, which includes no pesticides or pharmaceuticals. Many potential
contaminants, including toxic and carcinogenic disinfection byproducts, endocrine
disruptors, pesticides, industrial and commercial chemical contaminants,
pharmaceuticals, microbial contaminants and biological toxins, are currently not subject
to any drinking water standards at all, but are concerning enough to be considered
candidates for future regulation. Appeal to existing water quality standards thus provides
no assurance that "greatly reduced levels" of as-yet unregulated potential contaminants
would not degrade aquifer water quality and pose a threat to human health. On the
contrary, the EIR lacks adequate data to support conclusion of such broad sweep and
such critical import to human health and the environment.

# Under CEQA the EIR must identify, in a separate section, any significant effect

on the environment which would be irreversible if the project is implemented. (CEQA
Guidelines 15126.2 (c) and PRC § 21100 (b) (2) (B).) The finding of "less than

1

significant" for Impacts 4.10-2 and 4.10-3 eliminated the necessity for the EIR of
identifying the Project's impacts on the aquifer as permanent and irreversible. Yet they
would be. The EIR acknowledges that research on CECs is evolving and notes that the
SWRCB therefore reconvenes its Science Advisory Panel every three to five years to
update its recommendations for CEC monitoring for the State's Recycled Water Policy.
Given the Project's permanent and irreversible impact on the aquifer from injection of
recycled water, a three- to five-year window for revising CEC thresholds for human
health risk is unacceptable. The Project poses too great a risk for health and the
environment. Given the insufficiency of credible information presented in the EIR to
support the conclusions stated therein, the District abused its discretion when it certified
the Final EIR and approved the Project.

Inadequate Analysis of Alternatives

# According to CEQA Guidelines a project's statement of objectives should include
the underlying purpose of the project. The EIR states as its primary objective "to recharge
the local groundwater basin with 1,500 acre-feet per year (afy) of purified water for
indirect potable reuse ... and thereby improve the groundwater basin's reliability as a
water supply source." This is posited as the preferred means of achieving the underlying
purpose of developing safe, reliable, drought-resistant water supply and preventing
further seawater intrusion into the aquifer. However, the specific requirement of 1,500
afy is based on outdated information, staff estimates and a consultant memo (District
2016, WSC 2015, Hydrometrics WRI 2015). The County of Santa Cruz Health Services
Agency, Environmental Health, Water Resources Division Director notes in comments
on the draft EIR that this estimate is "most likely inaccurate." (Santa Cruz County Water
Resources Division Director John Ricker, Comment Letter L-4.) The Santa Cruz Water
Department Director questions the validity of the District's claims regarding water supply
requirements and recommends further analysis. (Santa Cruz Water Department Director
Rosemary Menard, Commen Letter L-2.) The District and other member agencies of the
Santa Cruz Mid-County Groundwater Agency are currently participating in regional
water supply sustainability planning to update basin-wide sustainability needs. Despite

2

the likely inaccuracy of its data, the EIR uses this arbitrary yearly requirement as a fixed
criterion by which otherwise viable alternatives to the Project are rejected without
adequate analysis.

# Under CEQA the lead agency must identify any alternatives which would feasibly
attain most of the basic objectives of the project but would avoid or substantially lessen
any of the significant environmental effects of the project. (CEQA Guidelines § 15126.6
(b).) The District's conclusion that the PWS Project is the environmentally superior
alternative rests in part on inadequate consideration of health and environmental effects,
as argued above. The EIR acknowledges as significant effects only impacts associated
with construction and operation of an AWPF. In doing so, the EIR limits the effects that
need be avoided or substantially lessened, and thus inappropriately limits its own
responsibility. By finding Impacts 4.10-2 and 4.10-3 "less than significant," the EIR
narrows its consideration of alternatives, and excludes from consideration an
environmentally superior alternative that would eliminate or significantly reduce these
impacts on the environment.

# The EIR fails to adequately describe the alternative of large-scale water transfers
for conjunctive use between the District and the City of Santa Cruz, independent of
aquifer storage, but instead conflates the two and lists this alternative as "considered but
rejected from further analysis." The District eliminates this alternative from analysis,
despite extensive research demonstrating its feasibility (), and the fact that it is the policy
of the City of Santa Cruz to partner with the District to pursue this alternative. The City
has expressed interest in negotiating an agreement with the District for a "symbiotic
relationship between projects" that would meet both the District's and the City's
objectives. Conjunctive use among adjoining water districts is encouraged by the State
Department of Water Resources. This alternative merits thorough analysis under CEQA.
But despite the demonstrated potential of this alternative, the EIR fails to provide
sufficient information about this alternative to allow meaningful evaluation, analysis, and
comparison with the proposed project. The District's exclusion of this alternative from
consideration appears premature and arbitrary. Given the failure to adequately analyze

3

and evaluate this alternative, the District abused its discretion when it certified the Final
EIR and approved the Project.

Failure to adequately respond to comments on the Draft EIR

# Under CEQA a lead agency must evaluate comments on environmental issues
received from persons who reviewed and commented on the draft EIR during the public
comment period, and the CEQA lead agency must prepare written responses to such
comments. (CEQA Guidelines § 15088 (a).) In particular, the major environmental
issues raised when the Lead Agency's position is at variance with recommendations and
objections raised in the comments must be addressed in detail giving reasons why
specific comments and suggestions were not accepted. There must be good faith,
reasoned analysis in response: Conclusory statements unsupported by factual information
will not suffice. (CEQA Guidelines § 15088 (c).)

# The District received written comments on the draft EIR from five state and local
agencies, seven letters from organizations, 95 individual comment letters, and oral
comments from eight individuals at the July 31, 2018 Draft EIR Hearing. The District
failed to provide a detailed, good faith, reasoned analysis in its responses to many of

these comments.

# Comment Letter L-2 from the City of Santa Cruz Water Department is an
important case in point. In paragraphs L-2-3 and L-2-8 Water Director Menard questions
the EIR's assertion of set daily and annual supplemental water supply requirements, and
recommends analysis of potentially varied regimes that might equally achieve the
District's objectives. The response fails to address the question but simply restates the
Project's objective of meeting specific daily and annual water supply requirements,
without a detailed explanation of reasons for not accepting the recommendation. The
response to L-2-3 is repeated in response to L-2-8 even though the comments are not the

same.

C

# In many comments from individuals, the District failed to address in detail (1)
concerns and questions raised regarding significant effects on health and the
environment, including effects that would be irreversible; and (2) comments and
suggestions regarding the EIR's failure to give full consideration to and analysis of a
feasible and environmentally superior alternative to the Project, namely the regional
solution of water transfers with conjunctive use. Instead, the responses to many such
comments (1) refer the commenter back to the portion of draft EIR text that is the subject
of the comment in the first place; (2) repeat the original assertion from the dEIR; and/or
(3) offer arbitrary or conclusory statements unsupported by substantial evidence in the
administrative record, often repeating identical statements in response to different
specific comments. None of these three types of response constitutes a reasoned analysis
or detailed explanation for why the specific comments and suggestions were not
accepted. For these reasons, the District violated CEQA and abused its discretion under
CEQA when it certified the final EIR and approved the Project.

23 'Environmental Planning & Info. Council v County of El Dorado'

24 (1982) 131 CA3d 350), the court held that the EIR was legally

25 inadequate because its impact analysis was limited to the

26 Idifferences between the existing and proposed plans. As the CEQA

27 Guidelines now make clear, the "EIR in such a situation should

28 treat the existing plan as the no-project alternative and should

50
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 186. The EIR does not analyze the NO Project Alternative that

2 would support and acknowledge regional conjunctive use with

3 existing and expanded agreements with the City of Santa Cruz Water
4  Department. Despite the Project Findings (page A-63) that

5 conjunctive use was the highest priority recommendation by the

6 Santa Cruz City Water Supply Advisory Commission Report in 2015:

7 "This alternative was rejected as it would meet some of the Project
alternatives, but NOT meet project objectives related to
timeliness, affordability, or reliability during drought periods.

10 In addition, this alternative would also not substantially reduce
11 significant Project impacts." This rejection is counter to the

12 list of no impacts shown within Table 7-2 in the DEIR, and is

13 without scientific merit or analysis regarding points of rejection

14 offered. Conjunctive use agreements with Santa Cruz City exist and

15 are operating now; the infrastructure exists and is operational now

16 and has been used in emergencies without problem, and therefore

17 must be included as a more thorough 'NO PROJECT" alternative
18 evaluation in the Project EIR.

19

20 187. Santa Cruz City Water Director Rosemary Menard submitted

21 agency comment on the DEIR (page 3.4-2 in RTC): "The City is

22 strongly committed to the success of a project that improves water

23 reliability for the City, other agencies and has beneficial impacts

24 to the basin and without evidence to the contrary, believes a

25 modified operational approach may be equally successful." This

26 significant agency comment alone is cause for the EIR to be

27 rejected as deficient because it failed to thoroughly evaluate

28

51
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

conjunctive use as a No Project alternative, instead rejecting the
2 regional management opportunities available.

3

4 188. Historic streamflow and rainfall data compiled by the City

5 and Water for Santa Cruz County show reasonable evidence that over

6 an eight-year average of wet and very dry rainfall years, an

7 estimated 450,000,000-750,000,000 gallons/year currently flows to

8 the Monterey Bay but could be collected, treated and used
conjunctively throughout the region.

10

11 189. Currently, Santa Cruz City is conducting environmental review

12 of water rights amendments for the San Lorenzo River, and has

13 included amending place of use for the restrictions on the San

14 Lorenzo River. These increased takes for beneficial conjunctive

15 uses throughout the region would not harm environmental stream

16 flows to support healthy fish habitats.

17

18 190. The infrastructure to support this conjunctive use is already

19 in place, has been used in emergencies to the benefit of both

20 agencies, and is currently (as of December 3, 2018) operational

21 with the Surface Water Transfer Pilot Project. The District has

22 negatively altered the data-collecting merit of the Project by

23 activating the large O'Neill Ranch Well that is located within the

24 test service area. District staff explained this action to the

25 Board on January 15, 2019, stating it was necessary in order to

26 support a State waiver for high ammonia-related disinfectant levels

27 that have plagued the Well over the past approximately two years,

28 causing prolonged Well de-activation.

52
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1

2 191. The Board certified the Project EIR that is deficient of

3 expanded conjunctive use analysis and instead prejudicially chose

4 to approve the Project that would cause significant known and

5 unknown negative environmental impacts over a broad area of the

6 County, not limited to the District service areas.

7

8 192. The requirement to cure and recirculate an EIR when a No

16 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

17 VIOLATION OF CEQA

18 200. The District violated CEQA by certifying a Project EIR

19 deficient in attention and consideration to areas of known
20 controversy and issues to be resolved. The District altered the
21 Project to avoid further public protest regarding the proposed West

22 Annex AWTF site neighborhoods, but did not expand CEQA process

23 noticing to members of the public in residential and commercial

24 areas not in the District service area but directly affected by the

25 change that included the new Chanticleer Avenue AWTF site. The

26 District approved the Project EIR and the Project, identifying the

27 Chanticleer Avenue AWFT site as first priority for construction,

28 but the EIR lacked public participation by these members of the

53
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 public. The Board took this action despite receiving public

2 testimony from County Supervisor John Leopold at the December 18,
3 2018 meeting that he opposed the Chanticleer Avenue location due to

4 an inconsistency the Project would create with current land use

5 policy and new information that a large Kaiser medical facility is

6 being considered in the area near the proposed Chanticleer Avenue

7 AWTF site, and ignoring new information made public about the site

8 that District Director Lather possessed regarding possible

9 hazardous materials at the site.

10

11 201. As interpreted in the CEQA Guidelines by the state Office of

12 Planning and Research ("OPR), CEQA's basic goal of protecting the

13 environment has two broad purposes: a) Avoid reduce or prevent

14 environmental damage when possible by requiring alternatives or

15 mitigation measures (14 Cal Code Regs 15002 (a) (2) - (3) ; and b)

16 provide information to decision-makers and the public concerning

17 the environmental effect of the proposed activities and reasons for

18 their approval (14 Cal Code Regs 15002 (a), (4). The courts have

19 repeatedly stated that informed decision making and public

20 participation are fundamental purposes of the CEQA process

21 ( 'Citizens of Goleta Valley v Board of Supervisors' (1990) 52 C3d

22 553 ; Laurel Heights Improvement Ass'n v Regents of Univ. of Cal.'

23 (1988) 47 C3d 376; 'No Oil, Inc. V City of Los Angeles' (1974) 13

24 C3d 68 ; 'County of Inyo V Yorty' (1973) 32CA3d 795, 810.

25

26 202. The District altered the Project during the Scoping Period

27 to include the Chanticleer Avenue site for the AWTF location. This

28 action was taken in direct response to the significant and ongoing

54
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 levels of public protests made by residents in neighborhoods
2 adjacent to the proposed West Annex AWTF location. Despite the
District's awareness of public resistance to the AWTF and

4 associated impacts, The District did not extend public outreach or

5 education to residents and commercial property owners in the

6 Chanticleer Avenue area of the Live Oak community. Since Live Oak

7 is not within the District service boundary, these people had no

8 reason to know such CEQA action was in process with a Project that

9 would potentially affect them, nor could they even know to
10 participate in the CEQA process for the Project review. Over 30

11 Live Oak residents attended the January 15, 2019 Board meeting,

12 with about 10 testifying they had no idea the Project was happening

13 because they are customers of the City water service, received no
14 notification of the impending Project CEQA review in process, and

15 saw no signs at the proposed Chanticleer Avenue site (many with

16 small children had to leave early due to the length of the Board's

17 consideration of matters placed earlier on the agenda). This

18 oversight was publicly acknowledged by both Mr. Duncan and the

19 Board at the January 15, 2019 Board meeting. The Petitioner

20 presented a written and oral request to the Board to reconsider and

21 rescind their December 18, 2018 actions that certified the Project

22 EIR and approved the Project, based on new information presented.

23 The Board was unresponsive.

24

25 203. The Project EIR acknowledges the need for demolition of the

26 existing uninhabited structure located at the 2505 Chanticleer

27 Avenue proposed for the AWTF site, and that it may support a

28 special-status species of bats while also likely presenting

55
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 significant asbestos removal issues. These along with significant

2 noise and hazardous materials impacts, are all significant impacts

3 that residential and commercial members of the public must be

4 allowed to review and comment upon during the CEQA process, but

5 were effectively eliminated from the process by District
6 negligence.

7

8 204. The proposed Chanticleer Avenue AWTF site is not within the

9 District boundaries, yet the District has been meeting with
10 representatives of the property owner of 2505 Chanticleer Avenue,

11 with the matter listed publicly on October 16, 2018 in Closed
12 Session. On November 24, 2018, the District was invoiced $4,700.00

13 by Ronald S. Zeller to appraise the 2505 Chanticleer Avenue

14 property for "Potential Land Development". (Exhibit )

15

16 205. While the Project DEIR acknowledges the need for demolition

17 of the existing uninhabited structure at the proposed Chanticleer

18 Avenue site and that there may be asbestos removal required

19 (according to County Assessor data base information, the home was

20 built in 1942), the issue of hazardous materials removal in the

21 residential and commercial area located adjacent to CalTrans

22 Highway One was not addressed in the Final EIR.

23

24 206. During the December 18, 2018 District Board meeting,

25 Director Rachel Lather voted against the Project approval because

26 of her personal knowledge of asbestos problems CalTrans had

27 lencountered near the site, also her concern regarding historic use

28 of the 2505 Chanticleer Avenue property that could pose possible

56
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 contamination issues for the Project, and because she felt it

2 unfair to locate the AWTF outside the District to accommodate

3 public protests from the proposed West Annex AWTF neighborhoods.

4 This was new and significant information that was only made public

5 after the Board had voted to certify the Project EIR and approve

6 the Project upon Director Bruce Jaffe inquiry as to why Director

7 Lather voted against Project's approval.

8

9 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

10 300. The Board certified the EIR as complete and approved the

11 Project on December 18, 2018 despite new and significant

12 information presented publicly at the meeting that had been

13 withheld by Director Rachel Lather and members of the public until

14 that moment, and which could have altered the lead agency's
15 decision-making had they been made known earlier and for which

16 there was no public review regarding this new and significant

17 information included in the area potentially affected by the

18 Project elements.

19 Under CEQA, a lead agency must identify all significant effects on

20 the environment caused by a proposed project that cannot be

21 avoided. (Pub.Res Code 21100 (b)) It must describe and evaluate

22 feasible measures for minimizing or avoiding a project's direct,

23 indirect and cumulative impacts on the environment. (Pub. Res. Code

24 21100 (b) ; Cal Code Regs 14 15126.4)

25

26 301. "Changes made to a legally inadequate EIR after it is

8 Cordova' (2007) 40 Cal4th 412, 442.)

9

10 303. During the Board deliberation of Project approval with

11 Resolution 18-31, Director Lather brought forth new information

12 regarding significant professional knowledge of and concerns about

13 soil contamination and other problems at the proposed Chanticleer

14 Avenue AWTF site. Here are her comments:

15 Lather: "Well, my concern is that I don't particularly like the

16 Chanticleer site. I have a problem with imposing the Advance Water

17 Purification on someone else's neighborhood. I have ethical issues

18 with that. Just because we have people here that don't want it

19 at..at..the site next to our facility. So the other thing is that

20 the Chanticleer site has been used as a construction staging site

21 for probably over 20 years, and who knows what's there. I would

22 wonder if there's gasoline, diesel, who knows what's there. I have

23 less concern regarding the.the..the site next to our office

24 because it's been residential. But the PG&E substation is there on

the corner. SO, I 25 would want to keep the Soquel site as a third

26 choice. Another thing, well, of course I've been wearing a lot of

27 hats in my life, and when I worked for the County, I was in charge

of the sanitation.
28 As I recall, the Soquel Avenue has a lot of

58
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 utilities in there, um, and r had actually experienced, because

2 it's right next to CalTrans staging area, I had a project where
3 huge riprap pieces had asbestos, and it turned a somewhat simple

4 project into a very difficult one. And alignment of that pipe as

5 it goes along that side is another problem I have in terms of

6 accessibility, which has nothing to do with environmental impacts,

7 but um, that's another reason I didn't like that site."

8

9 304. Another piece of new information brought before the Board the

10 evening of December 18, 2018 during public testimony was from

11 County First District Supervisor John Leopold, declaring that a new

12 and significant land use change to the Chanticleer Avenue area had

13 recently been made known and that would affect the cost of land in

14 the area, as well as projected land uses. Supervisor Leopold

15 stated that while he supported the Project, he was opposed to the

16 AWTF component being placed at the Chanticleer Avenue site. He

17 further stated that the AWTF would not be a use consistent with

18 what the County would prefer occur on the Chanticleer Avenue AWTF

19 parcel.

20

21 305. This was new information that was not considered in the DEIR

22 and was not made known via public agency comment on the DEIR. The

23 Board paid no heed to Supervisor Leopold's request to not include

24 the Chanticleer site in the Project, but instead approved the

25 Project with the Chanticleer site as first priority, if unable to

26 site the AWTF at the SCCWWTF without delays to the Project.

27

28

59
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 306. On January 15, subsequent to the Board's approval of

2 Resolutions 18-30 and 18-31 on December 18, 2018, to certify the

3 Project EIR and to approve the Project, about 30 residents of the

4 Live Oak neighborhood attended the Board meeting to express dismay

5 at having been omitted from the CEQA process for the Project, yet

6 only now were being told by the District that the AWTF is to be

7 constructed in their neighborhood. Despite multiple requests from

8 members of the public that the Board reconsider and rescind their

g actions regarding the Project, staff instead presented new

10 information about the Chanticleer site. The fact remains that the

11 residents and business owners in the Chanticleer Avenue AWTF
12 location area were deprived of the CEQA process and the Board

13 certified the Project EIR that is void of public comment from the

14 Live Oak residents.

15

16 307. While the overriding and primary goal of CEQA is protection of

17 the environment, (14 Cal Code Regs 15002 (a) (2) - (3) ) the

18 legislature declared that environmental quality is a statewide

19 concern, and that all citizens have a responsibility to contribute

20 to environmental preservation and enhancement. (Pub Res C

21 21000 (g)) . The State Office of Planning and Research ("OPR")

22 interpret CEQA'S basic Joal of protecting the environment with the

23 two-fold purpose of not only protecting the environment, but also

24 "providing information to decision-makers and the public concerning

25 the environmental effects of proposed and approved activities".

26 (14 Cal Code Regs 15002 (a) (1), (4)) .

27

28

60
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 308. Also during the January 15, 2019 Board meeting, Special
2 Projects Manager and Outreach Director for the District, Ms.

3 Melanie Mow-Schumacher, revealed new information that the District

4 has negotiated land within the public right-of-way on the Soquel

5 Avenue Frontage Road bordering the proposed Chanticleer Avenue

6 AWTF site for a pedestrian/bicycle overpass crossing CalTrans

7 Highway One. This was new information that also was not known

8 during the development of the DEIR and was not evaluated for the

9 Project impacts on future pedestrians and bicyclists users who

10 would be lead inherently toward the Project AWTF site. This new

11 information is cause for reconsideration of the Project EIR. The

12 Board did not discuss the potential of this new information.

13

14 309.New information is defined by Pub Regs Code 21166 (c) ; 14 Cal

15 Code Regs 15162 (a) (3): as information that becomes known only

16 after the EIR was certified for a Project and "triggers further
17 environmental review only if it is of substantial importance to the

18 Project," In the case of this Project's proposed AWTF Chanticleer

19 Avenue location, any complete EIR must include consideration and

20 analysis of potential negative impacts of an aerial access for

21 sabotage to the public water treatment facility. The location of

22 the pedestrian/bicycle overpass that leads members of the public to

23 the facility and could provide such potential access for sabotage

24 requires the Board to rescind the EIR certification and reconsider

25 the use of the Chanticleer site for the AWTF or to abandon the site

26 all together. These actions would constitute a significant change

27 in the Project elements to be given full consideration, change the

28

61
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 public's information and perception of the Project, and require the

2 Project EIR to be corrected and recirculated.

3

4 310. Requirements for review in terms of potential environmental

5 impacts of new information is directed by "Cadiz Land Co. v

6 RailCycle" (2000) 83 CA 4th 74, 95 and 14 Cal Code Regs 15162 (a).

7 The Court has held that an EIR should be revised and recirculated

8 to incorporate new information about the Project's potential

9 impacts. While some new information was presented to the Board at

1.0 the December 18, 2018 meeting that should have caused this

11 decision-making body for the lead agency to pause and consider the

12 potential impacts, the Board did not. Subsequent to certifying the

13 EIR as complete and approving the Project, the Board received

14 further new information on the Project during the January 15, 2019

15 meeting from District Special Project Manager and Outreach Director

16 Melanie Mow-Schumacher regarding a planned bicycle/pedestrian

17 overpass with access to be located on the premises of the

18 Chanticleer Avenue AWTF site. She stated that there had indeed

19 been negotiation with the County regarding the Project and the

20 overpass, but this information only became known at the January 15,

21 2019 meeting. The Board ranked this location as the highest during

22 discussion of Resolution 18-31 on December 18, 2018, yet there was

23 no information presented to the Board regarding the overpass at

24 that time. Significant new information presented after the Project

25 has been approved is cause for cure and recirculation under CEQA.

26

27 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

28 Violation of CEQA

62
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 400. The Board abused discretionary powers by certifying the

2 Project EIR that is void of any comment on the Draft EIR from

3 significant Trustee Agencies.

4

5 401."Trustee agencies are state agencies with jurisdiction by law

6 over natural resources that are held in trust for the people of the

7 State of California and that may be affected by ta project" (Pub

9 402. "Before making determination on whether to prepare and EIR or

10 Mitigated Negative Declaration ("MND"), the lead agency must

11 consult with responsible agencies and trustee agencies." (Pub. Res.

12 Code 21080.3 (a)).

13

14 403. "The lead agency must consult with Trustee agencies regarding

15 the Scope and Content of the EIR. The Office of Planning and

18

19 404. Agencies designated within CEQA guidelines established in

20 statute 14 Cal Code Regs 15386 (a)- (d) include, but are not limited

21 to:

*
22 The Department of Fish and Wildlife for jurisdiction over fish

5 of lead agency consultation requirements (Pub Res C 21080.3-

6 21080.4, 21104, 21153) and the legislature has expanded

7 requirements for other types of agencies (Pub Res. C 21092.4) for

8 transportation agencies, and Publ. Res. Code 21151.2 to include

9 school districts before site acquisition.

10

11 406. These statutes require the lead agency to consult with both

12 responsible agencies and any trustee agencies with jurisdiction

13 over resources that could be affected by the Project ("San

14 Francisco Baykeeper, Inc. v State Lands Comm'n' (2015) 242 CA4th 202,

3 Jurisdictional waters (two over the San Lorenzo River and one in

4 Arana Gulch), and one major riparian corridor crossing near Schwan

5 Lagoon. Drainage areas for discharge of backwash for the three

6 injection wells include New Brighton State Beach and into the

7 Monterey Bay. The resulting brine discharge from the AWTF and

8 conveyance system would not decrease overall contamination into the

9 Bay, but rather require dilution before outfall from the SCCWWTF.

10 |However, despite all Trustee agency jurisdiction within the Project

11 area, there is no clear comment submitted by any of these Trustee

12 agencies Department of Fish and Wildlife, State Parks, the Regional

13 Water Quality Control Board or NOAA, despite the requirement that

14 clear consultation and recommendation from these public trust

15 agencies be included in the Project EIR.

16

17 410. Further, the Board approved a MMRP that lacks clear evidence

18 of consultation with these key Trustee agencies that would ensure

19 the mitigations are enforceable, as required by CEQA statute to

20 ensure protection of critical resources held in the public trust.

21

4 (California Department of Fish and Wildlife) for mitigations 4.4-2a

5 regarding "Substantial disturbance to Riparian Habitat Within

6 Willowbrook Park" yet the EIR is void of comment or consultation

7 with CDFW, nor is there any comment on the DEIR from County Parks
Department that stewards the Willowbrook County Park.

11 Trustee agency consultation and recommendation, but merely states:

12 "The District will develop Habitat Monitoring Plan ("HMP"). The

13 District shall develop HMP and submit to appropriate resource

14 agencies including CCC, DCFW,CRWQCB, USZCE and USFWS for riparian

20 413. The Board certified the EIR and Project with Findings that

21 "changes in the composition of water quality constituents contained

22 in treated effluent discharged under Project operations are NOT

23 EXPECTED to rise to levels that could be harmful to biological

24 resource and therefore be less than significant." (Findings, page

25 A-11) Without consultation from CDFW or NOAA, there is no clear

26 enforceable mitigation for this potentially significant negative

27 Project impact that has dismissed with "expectation" but no

4 414. There is, in fact good reason to thoroughly analyze the

5 potential problems of this nature regarding the Project if one

6 examines the case of an advance water treatment facility in Cambria

7 that was constructed on a fast-track streamlined schedule but has

8 plagued the adjacent State Park and property owners with accidental

9 system outfalls that were environmentally toxic and that have

10 caused the Regional Water Quality Control Board to spend the

11 majority of staff time working on enforcement of mitigation and

12 reporting violations. (Central Coast Regional Water Quality Control

SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION
27

28

67
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 500. THE Board certified the EIR without fully accepting the
information developed by ESA consultants as propriety of the

3 District and ensuring that the information accurately and fully

4 represents the views of the decision-making body of the lead

5 agency.

6 501. Director Lather was clearly not aware that the RTC is a

7 different document than the Draft EIR, and could not recall the

8 proper name of the West Annex Site, one of three locations

9 evaluated for the AWTF, and the site she preferred, further showing

10 she was unfamiliar with the EIR content. However, she voted to

11 certify the EIR as complete. During her response to public

12 testimonies made at the December 18, 2018 Board meeting during

13 Project consideration, her comments in response to public

14 testimonies were:

15 Lather: "One of the questions I had was, when we posted the draft

16 EIR at the libraries, we left them there, right?"

17 ESA Consultant: "Yes."

18 Lather: So, it's been there for how long?"

19 ESA Consultant: "Since June 22."

20 Lather: So, there's been plenty of time to review it, and not just

21 10 days."

22 ESA Consultant: "I believe the document they're referring to is the

23 Response to Comment where the lead agency provided response to

24 public agency comments."

25 Lather: "How many pages was that?"

26 ESA Consultant: (showing the thick document) "It's about the same

27 as the Draft EIR."

28 Lather: "Oh."

68
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 ESA Consultant: "But I want to repeat that under CEQA, the lead
2 agency does not have to respond to any comments other than those

3 submitted by agencies."

4 502. Legal Counsel for the District did not confer with the Board,

5 the decision-making body of the lead agency, as a whole body in

6 view of the public after public testimony at the December 18, 2018

7 meeting before the Board took action. It is unknown if District's

8 Legal Counsel submitted a statement of recommendations to the Board

9 regarding the DEIR and significant agency comments submitted, or

10 the responses made to those key public agency comments.

11

12 503. "Unlike the tasks involved in EIR preparation, approval may

13 NOY be delegated by the decision-makers to a subordinate body or

14 lofficial." 14 Cal Code Regs 15025 (b) (1); "City of Carmel-by-the-

15 Sea v Board of Supervisors" (1977) 71 CA3d 84, 94.

16

17 504. "Changes made to a legally inadequate EIR after it is

18 certified and the project is approved will not cure the agency's

19 approval of an inadequate EIR." "Ukiah Citizens for Safety First v

20 City of Ukiah" (2016) 248 CA4th 256, 265.

21

22 505. "The lead agency should document its independent review in the

23 administrative record, noting e.g., conferences and instructions

24 provided, to avoid the need for evidence from outside the record in

25 the event of litigation. Man agencies provide substantial

26 direction to the consultants throughout the process and many

27 agencies revise the proposed responses to some extent. These

28 actions can easily be documented in the record. One means of doing

4 has requested such documentation from the District via a Public

5 Records Act request, however the District has not responded with

6 materials to date.

7

8 506. "Whenever possible, the attorney for an applicant and agency

9 counsel should review such administrative drafts or responses to be

10 sure that adequate informative responses are provided."

11

12 507. "The lead agency must certify that the final EIR reflects its

13 independent judgement and analysis." (14 Cal Code Regs 15090

14 (a) (3) . "This requirement reflects the rule that a lead agency may

15 allow third parties to prepare an EIR, but is ultimately

16 responsible for its contents." (Pub. Res. Code 21082.1 (a)-(c)).

17 "Final authority and responsibility to approve the contents of an

18 EIR rest with the agency. The lead agency's duty to ensure that

19 the EIR is adequate and compete is a statutory duty owed the public

20 in general, not to the project sponsor."

21 ("Mission Oaks Ranch, LATD. V County of Santa Barbara" (1998) 65

22 CA4th 713, 723.) "The lead agency must certify that the final EIR

23 was presented to the decision-making body, which reviewed and

24 considered the information in the Final EIR before approving the

25 IProject." (14 CalCode Regs 15090 (a) (2)),

26

27 508. At the December 18, 2018 Board meeting, it was clear that

28 Director Lather had no knowledge of the Response to Comment

70
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 document being discussed by members of the public, but which she

2 approved as part of the Final EIR. Other Board members were silent

3 on the issue. The full Board approved the Final EIR without

4 knowledge of its contents, violating CEOA statute.

5

6 SEVENTH USE OF ACTION

7 600. In the Project CEQA process, District General Manager Ron

8 Duncan repeatedly denied multiple written requests from citizens

9 for an extension to public comment, despite having granted it

10 earlier in the process during the initial less-complex Scoping

11 Period.

12

13 601. A significant number of requests for more time to review the

14 DEIR, a 1200+ page complex document, were made in writing to

15 General Manager Ron Duncan, as the public was told the decision

16 would be his, due to Board meeting scheduling and the close of

17 comment period. The Record of correspondence shows 10 such written

18 requests. Mr. Duncan told the Petitioner at an Outreach Committee

19 meeting held subsequently that he made that decision because "most

20 of the requests were made by people outside of the District."

21

22 602. The District allowed only 10 days for public review of the

23 Response to Comment document, a 720+page document. Despite over 50

24 written requests for more time and numerous oral requests made to

25 the Board at the December 18, 2018 meeting when the EIR and Project

26 were discussed, the public was denied additional time.

27

28

71
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 603. Only one hard copy of the RTC was made available to the public

2 at the District office, and was available only during business

3 hours. No table or comfortable study area was provided for members

4 of the public, including the Petitioner, who came to review the

5 document repeatedly, even though Petitioner asked for such

6 amenities to accommodate long periods of study and evaluation.

7

8 604. The courts have repeatedly stated that informed decision

9 making and public participation are fundamental purposed of the

10 CEQA process. "Citizens of Goleta Valley v Board of

11 Supervisors" (1990) 52 C3d 553; "Laurel Heights Improvement Ass'n V

12 Regents of Univ. of Cal. (1988) 47 C3d 376: "No 0il, Inc. V City of

13 Los Angeles: (1974) 113 C3d 68.

14

15 605. "As one court noted, the purpose of an EIR is not only to

16 protect the environment but also to demonstrate to the public that

17 it is being protected." ( "County of Inyo V Yorty" (1973) 32 CA3d
18 795,810). Mr. Duncan, as General Manager for the Soquel Creek

19 Water District, the lead agency for this Project that potentially

20 would affect a broad area of the County's citizenry and

21 environmental habitats, violated the supreme purpose of CEQA by

22 repeatedly denying public requests for reasonable time extensions

23 to review complex and voluminous DEIR and RTC documents that the

24 Board ultimately approved as the Final EIR for the Project.

25

26 EIGHTH CAUSE OF ACTION

27

28

72
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 700. The District showed prejudicial abuse of discretion by
2 entering into land acquisition agreements necessary for the Project

3 before CEQA process was completed.
4

5 701. In 2016, the District purchased the residential property

6 adjacent to District Offices at 5180 Soquel Drive, Soquel. The

7 District evicted the Section 8 tenants, and demolished the historic

8 structures in December, 2017. This site was later identified in

9 the DEIR as the West Annex site for the Project.

10

11 702. The proposed Chanticleer Avenue AWTF site is not within the

12 District boundaries, yet the District Board met with

13 representatives of the Lam Estate, property owner of 2505

14 Chanticleer Avenue in Closed Session on October 16, 2018 to begin

15 negotiations on purchase of the property. On November 24, 2018,

16 the District was invoiced $4,700.00 by Ronald S. Zeller to appraise

17 the 2505 Chanticleer Avenue property for "Potential Land

18 Development". (Exhibit

19

20 703. In September, 2018, the Board began negotiation with Twin

21 Lakes Baptist Church in Closed Session. On November 6 , 2018, the

22 Board approved a defective IS/MND for the Twin Lakes Church Pilot

23 Recharge Well Project, misstating information to the Petitioner and

24 denying her additional time to clarify responses to her multiple

25 comments she had submitted on the Initial Study. On December 4,

26 2018, the Board approved a 3-year temporary lease and a 50-year

27 long-term lease agreement with Twin Lakes Baptist Church that

28 gifted the Church 3.5AcreFeet/Year for 50 years of purified water

73
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 for irrigating the athletic fields adjacent to the private school

2 operated by the Church. The District also waived significant

3 Water Demand Offset requirements for the Church to build future

4 1600SF on-site employee housing. On December 18, 2018, the Board

5 awarded a bid to Maggiora Bros. to drill the injection well for the

6 Twin Lakes Church Pilot Recharge Well Project, but that had been

7 re-named to the Twin ukes Church Groundwater Recharge and Seawater

8 Intrusion Prevention Well Project. On January 2, 2019, Maggiora

9 Bros. began tree removal and excavation at the Twin Lakes Church

10 injection well site. All of these actions point to District and

11 Board prejudice for the Project and abuse of discretionary power to

12 support approving the Project without full CEQA process.

13

14 704. "An agency cannot divide large projects into smaller

15 projects." ("Hacienda Heights Improvement Ass'n v County Sanitation

16 District of Los Angeles County (1987). " Energy Resources

17 Conservation and Development Commission Division of Water Rights

18 Docket #86 c and I-2" confirmed that projects under review cannot

19 be divided artificially to avoid the environmental scrutiny

20 intended by the CEQA legislation. This is further supported by

21 "Lake Elsinore Advanced Pumped Storage Project" 136 FERC P 62033

22 (2011) and C.F.R.385.713 (2011) issued July 12, 2011.

23

24 705. The District and Board violated CEQA and showed clear

25 prejudice toward Project approval, and abused discretionary power

26 to do so while engaging knowingly in actions that piecemealed the

27 larger Project.

MEMO TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

Subject: Agenda Item No. 2.52

Title: Pure Water Soquel Project Consider Adopting Resolution 18-30, Certifying the Final
Environmental Impact Report (EIR), and Consider Adopting Resolution 18-31, Adopting the CEQA Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program (MMRP), Findings, and Statement of Overriding Considerations, and Approving the Project

Attachment(s):
1. Resolution No. 18-30, Certifying the Final Environmental Impact Report for Pure Water Soquel: Groundwater Replenishment and Seawater Intrusion Prevention Project (State Clearinghouse No. 2016112045)
2. Resolution 18-31, Adopting Environmental Findings with Regard to the Pure Water Soquel:
Groundwater Replenishment and Seawater Intrusion Prevention Project Environmental Impact
Report (State Clearinghouse No. 2016112045) Pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act; Adopting a Statement of Overriding Considerations and a Mitigation Monitoring and
Reporting Program; and Approving the Project

Background and Purpose
In accordance with the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), and the State CEQA Guidelines, Soquel Creek Water District is serving as the lead agency for the environmental review of its Pure Water Soquel: Groundwater Replenishment and Seawater Intrusion Prevention Project (Project). The primary objective of the Project is to recharge the local groundwater basin with 1,500 acre- feet per year (afy) of purified water for indirect potable reuse (IPR) and thereby improve the groundwater basin's reliability as a water supply source. The specific objectives of the Project are to:
Replenish the local groundwater basin to prevent further seawater intrusion and develop a sustainable water supply in a timely manner that meets the District's supply objectives and the State's mandate under the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA);
Develop an affordable, reliable, and drought-resistant supplemental water source, which contributes to the diversification of the District water supply portfolio and enhances water supply resiliency;
Continue to provide District customers with a high-quality and safe water supply; and
Provide additional environmental benefits, such as to surface and marine waters.

Discussion on EIR Certification
On June 29, 2018, the District released the Draft Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for the Project, and consulted with and requested comments from all responsible and trustee agencies, other regulatory agencies, and others during the 45-day public review and comment period that ran from June 29, 2018, through August 13, 2018. During this public review period of the Draft EIR, the District received five comment letters from public agencies, seven from non-governmental organizations, and 95 from individual members of the public. In addition, the District received oral comments from eight members of the public.

Page 7 of 442

ITEM 2.52

Board of Directors
December 18, 2018
Page 2 of 3

A Responses to Comments (RTC) document was prepared containing: (1) a list of commenters who provided comments on the Draft EIR, (2) copies of the written comments and the transcription of oral comments received at the July 31 public meeting, (3) responses on environmental issues raised in those comments, and (4) corrections/text revisions to the Draft EIR as a result of the public review process. CEQA requires that, at least 10 days prior to certifying an environmental impact report, the lead agency
provide a written proposed response to a public agency on comments made by that agency. Thus, the RTC document was distributed and received by the public agencies commenting on the Draft EIR on December 7, 2018. In addition, to further inform the community, Staff posted the RTC document on the District website, made a hard copy available at the District office, and notified all commenters on the Draft EIR
that the RTC was available at these locations.

The Final EIR for the Project consists of the Draft EIR (dated June 2018) and the Responses to Comments
(dated December 2018). For reference, these documents can be accessed on the District's website, broken
out into sections, at https://www.soquelcreekwater.org/PWS-CEQA, as well as these direct links:

Appendices to the Draft EIR: https://www.soquelcreekwater.org/sites/default/files/documents/Advanced-Water- Purification/Draft_EIR/Pure_Water_Soquel_Draft_EIR_Appendices-Only.pdf
Several written communications have been submitted by members of the public following the release of the RTC document. These communications are included in this December 18 Board Packet under Agenda
Item 7, Written Communications and Correspondence.

Resolution 18-30 (Attachment 1) has been prepared for the Board's consideration of Final EIR certification. Staff recommends the Board of Directors, as the elected body of the lead agency under CEQA,
certify the Final EIR through adoption of Resolution 18-30, which states that the Final EIR has been completed in accordance with CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines, reflects the District's independent judgement and analysis, is adequate, accurate and objective, and that the RTC document contains no
significant revisions to the Draft EIR.

Discussion on the Recommended Project Approval
To have the ability to move forward with the Project, the Board must first review, consider and certify the
Final EIR, and then, by separate action, adopt the Project CEQA Findings, including the Statement of
Overriding Considerations, the Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program, and approve the Project.
In response to public scoping comments requesting the District consider multiple Project sites, and to allow flexibility in responding to the interests of local jurisdictions, technical uncertainties, and environmental and economic considerations, the District considered one or more options for each of these
required Project components: treatment facilities, conveyance systems, and recharge well facilities. Accordingly, the approach to analysis in the Final EIR represents the most comprehensive analysis and is

Page 8 of 442

ITEM 2.52

Board of Directors
December 18, 2018
Page 3 of 3

intended to provide the public with a full understanding of the range of options under consideration and their potential environmental effects. Thus, environmental consideration of all Project components is complete and fully analyzed under the Final EIR. However, which of the Project options to implement will
be based on activities such as furthering the engineering feasibility, land acquisition, coordination with
local jurisdictions, interagency agreements, etc. for the components which are ongoing.
Staff recommends approval of the Project as described in the Final EIR, consisting of these components: water treatment facilities at one or two sites, a pipeline alignment for secondary or tertiary effluent, a pipeline alignment for purified water, a pipeline alignment for brine concentrate, and recharge wells and appurtenances at up to three (3) sites, from the components evaluated in the Final EIR.
Further, Staff recommends that, among the Project options evaluated in the Final EIR, the Board prioritize
project development and siting for:
Tertiary treatment at the Santa Cruz Wastewater Treatment Facility (SCWWTF) and the advanced water purification (AWP) treatment at the Chanticleer Site; and
Recharge wells at Twin Lakes Church, Monterey Avenue, and Willowbrook Lane
Resolution 18-31 (Attachment 2) has been prepared for the Board's consideration of approving the Project which incorporates the required CEQA Findings and the Statement of Overriding Considerations
and the corresponding Mitigation, Monitoring and Reporting Program.

POSSIBLE BOARD ACTION(S):
1. By MOTION, and roll call vote, adopt Resolution 18-30, Certifying the Final Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for the Pure Water Soquel: Groundwater Replenishment and Seawater Intrusion Prevention Project (State Clearinghouse No. 2016112045); and
2. If Resolution 18-30 is adopted, By MOTION, and roll call vote, adopt Resolution 18-31, adopting
environmental findings with regard to the Final EIR, adopting a Statement of Overriding Considerations, a Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program, and approving the Project; or
3. Take no action.

WHEREAS, in 2015 to protect endangered groundwater resources, ensure water reliability and resiliency to its customers, and prepare for climate change, the District, based on community input over a 13-month development process, prepared and approved the Community Water Plan to
serve as the District's roadmap to meetings its goals and state mandate of sustainability by 2040;
and

WHEREAS, in 2016, the Department of Water Resources for the State of California declared the basin from which the District withdrawals all its groundwater as being in a state of Critical
Overdraft (the state's most critical basin designation); and

WHEREAS, in addition, and related to the overdraft conditions, the District has detected
seawater intrusion in its groundwater supply aquifers at some coastal monitoring wells. Based on
recent geophysical mapping data showing the seawater intrusion is occurring along the entire
coastline of the District's service area immediately offshore expanding the risk of seawater
contamination of the District's drinking water wells, as well as other wells dependent on groundwater as a freshwater resource; and
WHEREAS, in order to recharge the local groundwater basin with 1,500 acre-feet per year of purified water for indirect potable reuse and thereby improve the groundwater basin's reliability
as a water supply source, staff of the District proposed the Pure Water Soquel: Groundwater Replenishment and Seawater Intrusion Prevention Project (Project) to supplement natural recharge of the Santa Cruz Mid-County Groundwater Basin with purified water. Existing secondary effluent from the regional Santa Cruz Wastewater Treatment Facility (SC WWTF) that is discharged
to the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary would be recycled and further treated at facilities located in either the City of Santa Cruz or unincorporated Santa Cruz County such that purified water would then be conveyed to recharge wells to replenish the groundwater basin and prevent seawater intrusion from moving further inland; and

Page 12 of 442

ATTACHMENT 1 - ITEM 2.52

The Final EIR has been completed in accordance with CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines; and
The Final EIR adequately describes the environmental impacts of the Project; and
The Final EIR does not add significant new information to the Draft EIR that would require recirculation of the EIR under CEQA because the Final EIR contains no information
revealing (1) any new significant environmental impact that would result from the
proposed plan or from a new or revised mitigation measure proposed to be implemented, (2) any substantial increase in the severity of a previously identified environmental impact, (3) any feasible project alternative or mitigation measures considerably different from others previously analyzed that would clearly lessen the environmental impacts of the plan but that was rejected by the Board, or (4) that the Draft EIR was so fundamentally and basically inadequate and conclusory in nature that meaningful public review and comment were precluded; and
The Final EIR reflects the Board's independent judgment and analysis, is adequate, accurate and objective, and that the Responses to Comments document contains no significant revisions to the Draft EIR.

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Board does hereby certify the Final EIR (State Clearinghouse No. 2016112045) for the Project as complete and adequate.

CEQA Findings of Fact for the Pure Water Soquel: Groundwater Replenishment and Seawater Intrusion Prevention Project

At a session assembled on December 18, 2018, the Board determined that, based on all of
the evidence presented, including but not limited to the Final EIR, written and oral
testimony given at meetings, and the submission of testimony from the public,
organizations, and regulatory agencies, the following environmental impacts associated with the Project are either: (1) less than significant and do not require mitigation; or (2)
potentially significant but will be avoided or reduced to a level of insignificance through the
identified Mitigation Measures; or (3) significant and cannot be fully mitigated to a level of
less than significant but will be substantially lessened to the extent feasible by the identified
Mitigation Measures.

This Exhibit describes:

the environmental impacts identified in the Final EIR that the Board finds of no impact
or constitute a less than significant impact and do not require mitigation; and
the environmental impacts identified in the Final EIR as potentially significant but
which the Board finds can be mitigated to a level of less than significant through the
incorporation of feasible, adopted Mitigation Measures identified in the Final EIR that
will further reduce impacts to a less than significant level; and
the environmental impacts identified in the Final EIR as potentially significant but which the Board finds cannot be mitigated to a level of less than significant, despite the imposition of feasible Mitigation Measures identified in the Final EIR; and
the cumulative impacts of the Project identified in the Final EIR and set forth herein;
and

the significant and irreversible environmental changes that would result from the Project, but which would be largely mitigated, and which are identified in the Final EIR;
and

the existence of any growth-inducing impacts resulting from the Project identified in the Final EIR; and
the alternatives to the Project that might eliminate or reduce significant environmental
impacts; and

the Statement of Overriding Considerations identifying those benefits of the Project that
the board finds outweigh its potential significant environmental impact.

Exhibit A
CEQA Findings of Fact for the Pure Water Soquel: Groundwater Replenishment and Seawater Intrusion Prevention Project

Section 1. Description of the Project
The Project would supplement natural recharge of the Santa Cruz Mid-County Groundwater
Basin with purified water. The purified water would be produced from existing secondary
effluent from the Santa Cruz Wastewater Treatment Facility (SC WWTF) and delivered to
treatment facilities located in either the City of Santa Cruz or unincorporated Santa Cruz
County. Purified water would recharge the aquifer. The Project setting is predominantly
urban, characterized by mostly residential and commercial development, interspersed with
patches of more naturalistic undeveloped areas primarily along major drainages and
riparian corridors.

The Project would include potentially all of the following:

Advanced Water Treatment Facility or Facilities, which could consist of a tertiary treatment system at the SC WWTF in conjunction with an Advanced Water Purification Facility (AWPF) at the Chanticleer Site or at the Headquarters-West Annex Site; or a stand-alone AWPF at SC WWTF, Chanticleer Site, or Headquarters-West Annex Site.
Conveyance System, which would include pump stations, process tanks, and pipelines to convey source water (secondary or tertiary) effluent, RO concentrate, and purified water between the SC WWTF, the AWPF or facilities (if not co-located with SC WWTF),
and the recharge wells.
Recharge and Monitoring Wells, five potential sites on four properties are being
considered for development of up to three recharge wells: 1) one site on District-owned property near the Monterey Avenue-Kennedy Drive intersection (Monterey Avenue Recharge Well); 2) one site on District-owned property near Willowbrook Lane (Willowbrook Lane Recharge Well); 3) one site on Twin Lakes Church-owned property near Cabrillo College (Twin Lakes Church Recharge Well), and; 4) two sites on Cabrillo College-owned property (Cabrillo College North Recharge Well and Cabrillo College South Recharge Well).

In response to public scoping comments requesting the District consider multiple Project
sites (see Chapter 2, Introduction), and to allow flexibility in responding to the interests of
local jurisdictions, technical uncertainties, and environmental and economic considerations,
the District is considering one or more options for each of these required Project
components. Accordingly, the approach to analysis in the Final EIR represents the most
comprehensive and reasonably conservative analysis feasible, and is intended to provide
the public with a full understanding of the range of options under consideration and their
potential environmental effects. Based upon information obtained through the
environmental analysis, additional engineering feasibility considerations, and continued
community engagement, the District would select a final Project configuration (consisting of
a single AWPF treatment concept, a single pipeline alignment, and up to 3 recharge wells),
from the components evaluated in the Final EIR, prior to development of final engineering
design.

The primary objective of the Project is to recharge the local groundwater basin with 1,500
acre-feet per year (afy) of purified water for indirect potable reuse (IPR) and thereby

CEQA Findings of Fact Page'21 of 442

ATTACHMENT 2 - ITEM 2.52

Exhibit A
CEQA Findings of Fact for the Pure Water Soquel: Groundwater Replenishment and Seawater Intrusion Prevention Project

improve the groundwater basin's reliability as a water supply source. The specific
objectives of the Project are to:
Replenish the local groundwater basin to prevent further seawater intrusion and
develop : sustainable water supply in a timely manner that meets the District's supply
objectives and the State's mandate under the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act
(SGMA);
Develop an affordable, reliable, and drought-resistant supplemental water source,
which contributes to the diversification of the District water supply portfolio and
enhances water supply resiliency;
Continue to provide District customers with a high-quality and safe water supply; and

• Provide additional environmental benefits, such as to surface and marine waters.

Section 2. Findings Required Under CEQA
CEQA requires that the lead agency adopt mitigation measures or alternatives, where
feasible, to substantially lessen or avoid significant environment impacts that would
otherwise occur. Mitigation measures or alternatives are not required, however, where such changes are infeasible or where the responsibility for the project lies with some other agency. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15091, sub. (a), (b).)
With respect to a project for which significant impacts are not avoided or substantially
lessened, a public agency, after adopting proper findings, may nevertheless approve the
project if the agency first adopts a statement of overriding considerations setting forth the
specific reasons why the agency found that the project's "benefits" rendered "acceptable" its
"unavoidable adverse environmental effects." (CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15093, 15043, sub. (b);
see also Pub. Resources Code, § 21081, sub. (b).)

In seeking to effectuate the substantive policy of CEQA to substantially lessen or avoid
significant environmental effects to the extent feasible, an agency, in adopting findings, need
not necessarily address the feasibility of both mitigation measures and environmentally
superior alternatives when contemplating approval of a proposed project with significant
impacts. Where significant impact can be mitigated to an "acceptable" level solely by the
adoption of feasible mitigation measures, the agency, in drafting its findings, has no
obligation to consider the feasibility of any environmentally superior alternative that could
also substantially lessen or avoid that same impact - even if the alternative would render
the impact less severe than would the proposed project as mitigated. (Laurel Hills
Homeowners Association v. City Council (1978) 83 Cal.App.3d 515, 521; see also Kings County Farm Bureau V. City of Hanford (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 692, 730-731; and Laurel Heights Improvement Association v. Regents of the University of California ("Laurel Heights
I") (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 400-403.)

In these Findings, the Board first addresses the extent to which each significant
environmental effect can be substantially lessened or avoided through the adoption of
feasible mitigation measures. Only after determining that, even with the adoption of all

Pure Water Soquel A-3 ESA / 160164
CEQA Findings of Fact Padé 22 of 442

ATTACHMENT 2 - ITEM 2.52

Exhibit A
CEQA of Findings of Fact for the Pure Water Soquel: Groundwater Replenishment and Seawater Intrusion Prevention Project

feasible mitigation measures, an effect is significant and unavoidable does the Board
address the extent to which alternatives described in the EIR are (i) environmentally
superior with respect to that effect and (ii) "feasible" within the meaning of CEQA.
In cases in which a project's significant effects cannot be mitigated or avoided, an agency, after adopting proper findings, may nevertheless approve the project if it first adopts a
statement of overriding considerations setting forth the specific reasons why the agency
found that the "benefits of the project outweigh the significant effects on the environment."
(Public Resources Code, Section 21081, sub. (b); see also, CEQA Guidelines, Sections 15093,
15043, sub.(b).)
In the Statement of Overriding Considerations found at the conclusion of these Findings, the
Board identifies the specific economic, social, and other considerations that, in its judgment,
outweigh the significant environmental effects that the projects would cause.

The California Supreme Court has stated that "[t]he wisdom of approving ... any
development project, a delicate task which requires a balancing of interests, is necessarily
left to the sound discretion of the local officials and their constituents who are responsible
for such decisions. The law as we interpret and apply it simply requires that those decisions
be informed, and therefore balanced." (Goleta II (1990) 52 Cal. 3d553, 564 [276 Cal. Rptr. II
410, 801 P.2d 1161].)

In support of its approval of the plan, the Board's findings are set forth below for each of the
potentially significant environmental effects and alternatives of the Project identified in the
EIR pursuant to Section 21080 of CEQA and Section15091 of the CEQA Guidelines.
These findings do not attempt to describe the full analysis of each environmental impact contained in the Final EIR. Instead, a full explanation of these environmental findings and conclusions can be found in the Final EIR and these findings hereby incorporate by reference the discussion and analysis in the Final EIR supporting the determination
regarding the impacts of the Projects and mitigation measures designed to address those
impacts. In making these findings, the Board ratifies, adopts and incorporates in these
findings the determinations and conclusions of the Final EIR relating to environmental
impacts and mitigation measures except to the extent any such determinations and
conclusions are specifically and expressly modified by these findings.
As set forth below, the Board adopts and incorporates all of the mitigation measures set forth in the Final EIR and Exhibit B, the MMRP, to substantially lessen or avoid the
potentially significant and significant impacts of the Project. The Board intends to adopt
each of the mitigation measures proposed in the Final EIR to reduce or eliminate significant
impacts resulting from the Project. Accordingly, in the event a mitigation measure recommended in the Final EIR has inadvertently been omitted in these findings or the
MMRP, such mitigation measure is hereby adopted and incorporated in the findings below
by reference. In addition, in the event the language describing a mitigation measure set
forth in these findings or the MMRP fails to accurately reflect the mitigation measures in the
Final EIR due to a clerical error, the language of the policies and implementation measures,

as set forth in the Final EIR shall control. The impact numbers and mitigation measure
numbers used in these findings reflect the information contained in the Final EIR.

Unless otherwise specified, all page references presented herein are to the Draft EIR
document.

2.1. Impacts Found to be Less Than Significant or No Impact and Thus Requiring No
Mitigation.
Consistent with Public Resources Code section 21002.1 and section 15128 of the State
CEQA Guidelines, the EIR focused its analysis on potentially significant impacts, and limited
discussion of other impacts for which it can be seen with certainty there is no potential for
significant adverse environmental impacts. State CEQA Guidelines section 15091 does not
require specific findings to address environmental effects that an EIR identifies as "no
impact" or a "less than significant" impact. Nevertheless, the Board hereby finds that, based
on substantial evidence in the whole of the record, the Project would have either no impact
or a less than significant impact to the following resource areas and that these impact areas,
therefore, do not require mitigation:

Impact Category: Aesthetics
The Project would not have substantial adverse effect on a scenic vista or substantially damage a scenic resource, including, but not limited to, trees, rock outcroppings, and historic buildings within a state scenic highway (p. 4.2-20).

Findings: Caltrans designates Highway 1 within Santa Cruz County as an Eligible State
Scenic Highway - Not officially Designated and the County of Santa Cruz General Plan
identifles Highway 1 as a valued public vista. Project pipelines and the Chanticleer Site
along Soquel Avenue and Auto Plaza Drive would be adjacent to Highway 1, and alignments cross under Highway 1 in three locations. However, views of these project areas from Highway 1 is mostly screened by landscaping adjacent to the highway (see Figure 4.2-6, Photo 15). Where gaps in vegetation occur, views of project construction areas or the aboveground structures at the Chanticleer Site would be brief as motorists move past project areas. Aside from Highway 1, there are no state or locally designated scenic vistas in the Project area. Further, given the developed nature of the overall Project area, long-range views of mountain peaks, the ocean, or other features that may be considered a scenic vista
are not available in the vicinity of Project locations.

Impact 4.2-1: The Project would not substantially degrade the existing visual character or
quality of the site and its surroundings (p. 4.2-21 - 4.2-29).

Findings:
Santa Cruz WWTF Site - The Project site itself has low visual quality and is poorly exposed, is
and is thus considered to have a low visual sensitivity. Construction at this site would last
approximately 12 (pump station only) to 36 months (treatment facility), and would involve
clearing and grubbing, and facility installation. Construction vehicles, materials, and
equipment would temporarily add to the existing WWTF activities, and the additional

CEQA Findings of Fact Pade 24 of 442

ATTACHMENT 2 - ITEM 2.52

Exhibit A
CEQA Findings of Fact for the Pure Water Soquel: Groundwater Replenishment and Seawater Intrusion Prevention Project

construction activities may be noticeable and unappealing visual features, as seen by Neary
Lagoon Park trail users passing the site. Project construction activities would not be visually
noticeable from other areas of Neary Lagoon Park, La Barranca Park, or Bay Street due to
trees/vegetation, fencing, and other existing WWTF facilities that block views of the Project site the Project facilities would not be visible from other vantage points in Neary Lagoon
Park or La Barranca Park, or from Bay Street. Type and scale of Project facilities would be
consistent with the existing WWTF facilities.
The Project would not have substantial adverse effect on the visual character or quality of
the site and its surroundings during construction or operation of the Project. The visual
character and quality impact associated with this Project site would be less than
significant.

Chanticleer Site - The Project site itself has low visual quality and is poorly exposed, and is
thus considered to have a low visual sensitivity. The visual changes associated with
construction of this facility would nclude vehicles, materials, and equipment. Construction activities would occur over an approximately 24-month period. While the work area would be fenced during construction, construction vehicles, materials, and equipment would
temporarily add to the existing commercial and light industrial activities that occur in the
vicinity, and the additional construction activities may be noticeable and unappealing visual
features, as seen by motorists, bicyclists, and pedestrians traveling along Soquel and
Chanticleer avenues.

The upper portion of Project facility structures would be visible from Soquel Avenue even
after landscaping installed between the roadway and site fencing; however, proposed
building structural design and finishes would be similar to existing commercial and
residential structures in the vicinity.
The visual character of the Project site, as seen from public vantage points to the north of the site, would be consistent with the existing visual character of the area. The visual
character and quality impact associated with this Project site would be less than
significant.

Headquarters-West Annex Site - The Project site itself has moderate visual quality, with limited and brief exposure, and is thus considered to have a low to moderate visual
sensitivity. The visual changes associated with construction of this facility would include
vehicles, materials, and equipment. While the construction area would be fenced,
construction activities would occur over an approximately 24-month period. Construction
vehicles, materials, and equipment may be noticeable and unappealing visual features, as
seen by motorists, bicyclists, and pedestrians traveling along Soquel Drive and Capitola Avenue. However, these areas are not scenic in nature and is an area of limited visual
exposure. Structures would be similar in structural design and finishes to existing
commercial and residential structures in the vicinity.
The visual character of the Project site, as seen from public vantage points to the west of the site, would be consistent with the existing visual character of the area. Thus, the visual

ATTACHMENT 2 - ITEM 2.52

Exhibit A
CEQA Findings of Fact for the Pure Water Soquel: Groundwater Replenishment and Seawater Intrusion Prevention Project

character and quality impact associated with this Project site would be less than
significant.

Monterey Avenue Site - The Project site has low is visual quality and is poorly exposed, and is
thus considered to have a low visual sensitivity. The visual changes associated with construction of this facility would include vehicles, materials, and equipment. Construction activities would occur over an approximately 18-month period and following construction and site restoration, the recharge well facilities would be similar in scale and type as the existing (decommissioned) groundwater production well currently located at this site.
Existing fencing would be retained or replaced. The type and scale type of Project facilities
would be consistent with the existing groundwater facilities.

The visual character and quality impact associated with this Project site would be less than
significant.

Willowbrook Lane Site - The Project site is considered to have a moderate visual
sensitivity., The visual changes associated with construction of this facility would include
vehicles, materials, and equipment. Construction activities would occur over an
approximately 18-month period

Views of aboveground features would be available from the Willowbrook Park's tennis and
basketball courts; however, these areas do not include bleachers, benches, or picnic areas that
would be associated with more contemplative use as compared to the more active use that occurs in these areas of Willowbrook Park. Given that the type and scale type of Project facilities would not be prominent or inconsistent with the visual character of the area, the
Project would not have a substantial adverse effect on the visual character or quality of the
site and its surroundings. The visual character and quality impact associated with this Project
site would be less than significant.

Twin Lakes Church Site - The Project site has low to moderate visual quality and is poorly
exposed, and is thus considered to have a low visual sensitivity. The visual changes
associated with construction of this facility would include vehicles, materials, and
equipment. Construction activities would occur over an approximately 18-month period
and following construction and site restoration, the recharge well facilities would include a
recharge well and backwash pump, equalization tank, and other small support structures.

The scale of the proposed structures would be small relative to the heights of the adjacent slope and mature vegetation along Cabrillo College Drive, and the parked vehicles and nearby structures among the church complex. The site has historically been used for
equipment staging and/or materials storage. Accordingly, the proposed facilities would not be substantially noticeable or inconsistent with the existing visual character of the area; and
given past uses and its location among a large parking area, a recharge well would be
consistent with past and present uses at this location.

Given that construction activities would be temporary and fairly typical of the urban setting,
and that pipelines would not be visible following completion of construction, impacts on
visual character and quality would less than significant.

Impact 4.2-2: The Project would a not create a new source of substantial light or glare which
would adversely affect day or nighttime views in the area (p. 4.2-29).

Findings. The majority of construction activities would occur during normal working
hours; weekdays between the hours of 8 a.m. and 5 p.m., and possible on Saturdays
between the hours of 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. However, development of recharge wells would require 24-hour construction for a period of approximately 2 weeks. Accordingly, recharge
well staging and drilling would require temporary nighttime lighting for safety and security.
Standard construction lighting includes shielding and the ability to focus light downwards
towards the work area and away from adjacent areas. Therefore, use of nighttime lighting
over a two-week period would not constitute a new source of substantial light or glare.
Periodic repairs of recharge well pumps and equipment could also require occasional nighttime work. However, similar to well drilling, the use of nighttime lighting would be for
short periods of time, and would include the ability to shield and direct lighting towards the
work area and away from adjacent areas.

Construction equipment, building materials, and building finishes would consist of dull,
non-reflective surfaces, and would not have large glass windows or other reflective
materials facing affected viewers. Such building finishes are not substantial sources of glare,
such as mirrors, polished metallic surfaces, or windows.

The only permanent light source used during operation of the Project would be exterior
security lights at the Chanticleer or Headquarters-West Annex sites; and motion-sensor
activated securing lighting at recharge well sites. The area requiring lighting would be at
building entrances and along parking and pathways, which would not be in close vicinity to
residences or other land uses that would be sensitive to light and glare. In particular, for the
treatment sites, the entrances of structures that could require lighting are oriented towards
the center of each site; rather than exterior areas that are closer to other land uses. Further,
the security lighting would be in keeping with existing lighting at other nearby commercial
and institutional light uses, in addition to roadway lighting. For these reasons, construction
and operation of the Project would not constitute a new source of substantial light or glare
and are less than significant.

Impact Category: Agricultural and Forestry Resources
The Project components would be located in urban areas. There are no agricultural uses on
the Project sites or in the Project area. Further, the Project sites are not zoned for such uses.
The California Department of Conservation's Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Program
identifies the Project sites as Urban and Built-Up Land, defined as ...land [that] is used for
residential, industrial, commercial, institutional facilities, cemeteries, airports, golf courses,
sanitary landfills, sewage treatment, and water control structures" (California Department
of Conservation, 2014). The Project would not convert any Prime Farmland, Unique
Farmland, or Farmland of Statewide Importance to non-agricultural use, and would not
conflict with existing agricultural land uses, zoning for agricultural land use, or a Williamson
Act contract. Therefore, the Project would have no impact on agricultural resources. (p. 4.1-
3.)

The Project sites do not include any lands zoned or managed for forest or timber uses.
Implementation of the Project would also not affect any tracts of land with a high density of
trees. Although construction activities could require the removal of mature trees to
accommodate the proposed facilities, the removal of these isolated trees is not considered a
loss or conversion of forest land. (p. 4.1-3.)

Impact Category: Air Quality
Impact 4.3-2: The Project would not generate: long-term increase of criteria pollutant
emissions during operations (p. 4.3-19).
Findings. The Project would not include any new or modified stationary sources of air
pollutants. The only daily emission sources that would be associated with the Project would
be limited to on-road vehicles. Mobile emission sources would include the daily commute
trips of up to six facility operators and support personnel. It is estimated that these
activities would result in approximately 16 light-duty one-way automobile trips. Emissions
associated with these trips would be negligible (i.e., well under 1 pound per day for each of
the criteria pollutants and precursors) and would not exceed the MBARD significance
thresholds. The operational impact related to the potential for the Project to cause a violation of an ambient air quality standard would be less than significant.

Impact 4.3-5: The Project would not be expected to create objectionable odors that would
affect a substantial number of people (p. 4.3-22).
Findings. Construction activities that would be associated with the Project could result in temporary odors from use of diesel-fueled equipment. These odors would dissipate quickly,
and therefore not be concentrated enough for sufficiently long periods of time to create objectionable odors that would affect a substantial number of people. The impact would be
less than significant.
Operation of the pumps, pipelines, and the recharge wells would not generate odorous emissions, because they would be closed systems. The chemical storage and chemical feed facilities at the AWPF site would also be closed systems that would not generate any
odorous emissions. With respect to purification process, there would be no objectionable
smells/odor, because it would not involve handling of raw /untreated wastewater.
Furthermore, as mentioned above, the AWPF would be completely pressurized and closed
to the atmosphere. The only Project component whose normal operations would have
potential odor generation is the spoils area proposed at the Headquarters-West Annex Site.
At this facility, the District would air dry wet dirt, soil, or mud, which would then be off-
hauled for reuse or disposal. While odors can be emitted from soil when decomposing
matter is present, this would not be the case at the Headquarters-West Annex Site, because of the source of the spoils (i.e., excavated material from water main and service line repairs,
and from cleaned out meter boxes) are not typically comprised of decomposing material.
For these reasons, the Project would not create objectionable odors that would affect a
substantial number of people. The impact would be less than significant.

Impact Category: Biological Resources
Impact 4.4-2: Project construction would not have a substantial adverse effect on a marine
environment identified in local or regional plans, policies, regulations or by
the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,
or National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. (4.4-65 - 4.4-66)
Findings. The Project would not involve any construction work within the marine
environment. Therefore, no conflicts with sensitive natural communities within the marine
environment would result from Project construction.

Operational impacts from Project implementation would be limited to changes in treated
effluent discharged from the existing SC WWTF ocean outfall. The Project's alterations to the
effluent discharged into Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary would not be expected to
result in significant impacts to water quality or marine species in the vicinity of the discharge
point. Water quality constituent levels would be subject to number of water quality
regulations and standards, including those specified in the NPDES permit for SC WWTF
effluent discharges. Through adherence to these requirements, the effluent water quality
would remain in keeping with Ocean Plan objectives, and potential effects on sensitive natural
marine communities would be less than significant.

Impact 4.4-3: Project construction and operation would not have a substantial adverse effect on federally protected wetlands as defined by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (including, but not limited to, marsh, vernal pool, coastal, etc.) through direct removal, filling, hydrological interruption, or other means (p.
4.4-64 - 4.4-65).

Findings. Federally protected wetlands and waters of the U.S. are existent along pipeline
alignment options. However, all of these wetland sites are far enough from the pipeline
alignment that direct impacts would not be expected. The District anticipates that pipelines
crossing stream culverts and bridges would be accomplished by hanging pipelines from
bridges or by placing the pipeline between the road and the top of the culvert. These
methods would avoid significant impacts to waterways. Therefore, no impacts are
anticipated to federally protected wetlands from Project operations and no mitigation is
required.

Impact 4.4-4: Project construction and operation would not interfere substantially with the
movement of native resident or migratory fish or wildlife species or with established native resident or migratory wildlife corridors, or impede the use of native wildlife nursery sites (p.4.4-65 - 4.4-66).

Findings:
Terrestrial and Freshwater Environment - The majority of the Project area is located
within or adjacent to developed areas, which do not serve as wildlife movement corridors
for terrestrial animals. Although some terrestrial wildlife may be deterred from movement
through the Project site during construction, all work would largely occur in areas that are
subject to current development or disturbance. Streams potentially provide movement

ATTACHMENT 2 - ITEM 2.52

Exhibit A

corridors for aquatic wildlife, such as fish and amphibians, and their movement in these
areas would not be impaired during or following construction. Pipeline crossings at streams would be implemented above the water or by using trenchless methods, negating the need to the conduct in-water work which could impact movement of aquatic wildlife. The Project
does not include the permanent placement of structures within creeks, rivers, or other
waterways and would not substantially impede the movement of native resident or migratory fish or wildlife corridors, which could impede the use of native wildlife nursery
sites. Implementation of the Project would, therefore, result in a less-than-significant
impact relative to movement of fish or wildlife along a migratory corridor.

Marine Environment - The Project would not involve any construction within the marine
environment, and construction-phase discharges would comply with applicable NPDES
permit requirements. Therefore, there would not be any conflicts with migratory pathways
for marine species would result from Project implementation.

The location of the SC WWTF outfall pipeline discharge point, approximately 110 feet below
the ocean surface, makes the occurrence of migrating special-status marine species in the vicinity of the outfall unlikely. Additionally, changes in the composition of water quality constituents contained in treated effluent discharged under Project operations are not expected to rise to levels that could be harmful to biological resources. Therefore, impacts
on the migratory pathways for marine species from Project operations would be less than
significant.

Impact Category: Energy Conservation
Impact 4.6-2:The Project would not constrain local or regional energy supplies, require additional capacity, affect peak and base periods of electrical demand, or otherwise require or result in the construction of new electrical generation and/or transmission facilities, or expansion of existing facilities, the construction of which could cause significant environmental effects (p. 4.6-9; Responses to Comments p. 4-20 - 4-21)

Findings. The Project's impact on local and regional energy supplies depends on several
factors; however, the primary energy source of concern associated with Project operation is electrical power provided by MBCP through the PG&E power grid infrastructure. The
Project's estimated electrical demand would be roughly 3,600 MWh per year, which would
represent less than 0.01 percent of the total electricity used in Santa Cruz County in 2016
(CEC, 2018b). As such Project energy demands could be accommodated within the capacity
of existing available electrical generation and transmission facilities. The new underground
and aboveground power lines would be required to connect the proposed facilities to the
existing local PG&E power grid. However, for the reasons above, the Project could be
accommodated by the existing local and regional energy supplies and transmission
infrastructure, and the impact would be less than significant.

Impact Category: Geology and Paleontology
Impact 4.7-1: The Project would not expose people or structures to substantial seismic
shaking or seismically-induced ground failure, including liquefaction or lateral spreading (p. 4.7-21 - 22).
Findings. Construction activities would occur over approximately 36 months. Construction activities would not include actions that would exacerbate the exposure of people or
structures to substantial adverse effects involving seismic hazards (e.g., hydraulic fracking).

The California Building Code (CBC) would require that the structural elements of the Project
would undergo appropriate design-level geotechnical evaluations prior to final design and
construction. The geotechnical investigation would include any necessary recommendations for soils remediation and/or foundation systems necessary to reduce
seismic-related hazards to less than significant. Implementing the regulatory requirements
in the CBC, and ensuring that buildings and structures are constructed in compliance with
the law is the responsibility of the Project engineers and building officials. Geotechnical
investigations would include recommendations to address geotechnical issues, including seismic shaking and seismically inducted ground failures, such as liquefaction and lateral spreading. With compliance with the regulatory requirements and the implementation of
geotechnical design recommendations, impacts relative to seismic shaking and seismically
induced ground failure during operations would be less than significant.

Impact 4.7-2: The Project would not result in substantial soil erosion (p. 4.7-22).

Findings. State requirements were developed to ensure that stormwater is managed and
erosion is controlled on construction sites. The NPDES General Permit for Discharges of
Storm Water Runoff Associated with Construction and Land Disturbance Activities (Order 2009-0009-DWQ NPDES No. CAS000002; as amended by Orders 2010-0014-DWQ and
2012-006-DWQ) (Construction General Permit) requires preparation and implementation
of a SWPPP, which requires applications of Best Management Practices (BMPs) to control
run on and runoff from construction work sites. The BMPs would include, but would not be
limited to, physical barriers to prevent erosion and sedimentation, construction of
sedimentation basins, limitations on work periods during storm events, use of infiltration swales, protection of stockpiled materials, and a variety of other measures that would
substantially reduce or prevent erosion from occurring during construction. With
compliance with these existing regulations, impacts associated with soil erosion during
construction would be less than significant.

Once constructed, there would be no further ground disturbance and no potential for
erosion. The Project would be constructed using BMPs that would provide erosion and
sedimentation control measures to maintain the capacity of area storm drains and protect
water quality in compliance with the regional MS4 permit. Therefore, impacts associated
with soil erosion during operations would be less than significant.

Impact 4.7-3: The Project would not be located on expansive or corrosive soil such that substantial risks could occur (p. 4.7-22 - 23).
Findings. The foundations for the SC WWTF, Chanticleer Site, or Headquarters-West Annex Site structures would be constructed in soils with a moderate potential for expansive soils and a moderate to high potential for damage to unprotected steel, which could result in
damage to foundations and subsurface steel pipes. However, implementation of standard
geotechnical engineering practices and adherence to building code requirements would
reduce potential impacts from expansive and corrosive soils during operations to less than
significant.

Impact Category: Greenhouse Gas Emissions
Impact 4.8-1: The Project would not generate an amount of GHG emissions that would
contribute substantially to climate change (p. 4.8-11 - 4.8-13; Responses to
Comments p. 4-20 - 4-22).

Findings. The sum of the 50-year amortized construction GHG emissions and the total net operation emissions that would be associated with the Project is approximately 406 metric
tons CO2e per year. These emissions would be less than the 1,100 metric tons per
year significance threshold; therefore, a less-than-significant impact would occur, and the Project would not be considered to contribute substantially to the primary and secondary
adverse effects of climate change, such as increases in global temperatures, global rise in sea
level, ocean acidification, impacts on agriculture, changes in disease vectors, and changes in
habitat and biodiversity

Impact 4.8-2: The Project would not conflict with the Executive Order B-30-15 Emissions
Reduction Goal (p. 4.8-13 - 14).

Findings. As discussed under Impact 4.8-1, the carbon footprint of the Project and the impact associated with GHG emissions would be less than significant. The threshold of 1,100 metric tons CO2e per year used to assess the significance of Impact 4.8-1 effectively requires mitigation for the top 92 percent of emissions generated by new land use projects,
which would represent an overall reduction in new land use project-related emissions of up
to 92 percent. Since the issuance of Executive Order B-30-15, the GHG emissions reductions
goal of lowering GHG emissions to 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030, is roughly
equivalent to reducing emissions by 44 percent below current levels, this analysis uses the
same significance threshold to determine if the Project would generally be consistent with
this goal. As discussed under Impact 4.8-1, the carbon footprint of the Project and the impact associated with GHG emissions would be less than significant. Therefore, the Project would not conflict with the Executive Order B-30-15 Emissions Reduction Goal, and impact
would be less than significant.

Impact Category: Hazards and Hazardous Materials

Impact 4.9-1: The Project would not create a significant hazard to the public or the
environment through the routine transport, use, disposal, or accidental release of hazardous materials (p. 4.9-15)

Findings:
Construction of Project and Operation of Water Treatment Chemicals and Sourcewater
Effluent and Brine Water Conveyance Pipelines - Construction activities would be
required to comply with numerous hazardous materials and stormwater regulations
designed to ensure that hazardous materials are transported, used, stored, and disposed of
in a safe manner to protect worker safety, and to reduce the potential for a release of construction-related fuels or other hazardous materials into the environment, including
stormwater and downstream receiving water bodies. In particular, contractors would be
required to prepare and implement HMBPs that would require that hazardous materials
used for construction would be used properly and stored in appropriate containers with
secondary containment to contain a potential release. The California Fire Code would also
require measures for the safe storage and handling of hazardous materials.
Construction contractors would be required to prepare a SWPPP for construction activities
according to the General Construction Permit requirements. The SWPPP would list the
hazardous materials (including petroleum products) proposed for use during construction;
describe spill prevention measures, equipment inspections, equipment and fuel storage;
protocols for responding immediately to spills; and describe BMPs for controlling site runoff. In addition, the transportation of hazardous materials would be regulated by the USDOT, Caltrans, and the CHP. Together, federal and state agencies determine driver-
training requirements, load labeling procedures, and container specifications designed to
minimize the risk of accidental release. Finally, in the event of a spill that releases
hazardous materials, a coordinated response would occur at the federal, state, and local
levels, including the County and city agencies. In the event of a hazardous materials spill, the
police and fire departments would be simultaneously notified and sent to the scene to respond and assess the situation.

In the case of ACM and LBP, numerous existing laws and regulations require that demolition
activities that may disturb or require the removal of materials that consist of, contain, or are
coated with ACM and/or LBP must be inspected and/or tested for the presence of hazardous materials. If present, the hazardous materials must be managed and disposed of
in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. The identification, removal, and
disposal is regulated under CCR Title 8, Division 1, Chapter 4, Article 4, Sections 1529 and
5208, and MBARD Rule 424 for ACM, and CCR Title 8, Division 1, Chapter 4, Article 4,
Section 1532.1, and MBARD Rules 442 and 439 for LBP. All work must be conducted by a
State-certified professional, which would ensure compliance with all applicable regulations.
If ACM and/or LBP are determined to exist on-site, a site-specific hazard control plan must
be prepared detailing removal methods and specific instructions for providing protective clothing and equipment for abatement personnel. A State-certified LBP and/or an ACM removal contractor would be retained to conduct the appropriate abatement measures as

required by the plan. Wastes from abatement and demolition activities would be disposed
of at a landfill permitted to accept such waste. Once all abatement measures have been
implemented, the contractor would conduct a clearance examination and provide written
documentation to the local Santa Cruz County Environmental Health Services and MBARD
that testing and abatement have been completed in accordance with all federal, state, and
local laws and regulations.
Once operational, the treatment facilities would use the water treatment chemicals. The District would be required to prepare and implement a HMBP that would identify the
hazardous materials to be used in the treatment process, procedures for the safe
transportation, storage, use and disposal of chemicals, and spill response procedures in the
event of a spill. The requirements include primary and secondary containment of all
hazardous materials, training for the use of hazardous materials, routine facility
inspections, and the establishment of spill prevention and response procedures in the event
of a spill. The transportation regulations enforced by the CHP and Caltrans include periodic
inspections of vehicles and containers used to transport hazardous materials to ensure
compliance with container requirements. Collectively, the HMBP and transportation
requirements would ensure compliance with the numerous regulations summarized in the
Regulatory Framework. The required implementation and compliance with existing
regulations would limit the potential for creation of hazardous conditions due to the use or
accidental release of hazardous materials, and would render this impact less than
significant.

Required compliance with the numerous laws and regulations that govern the
transportation, use, handling, and disposal of hazardous materials would limit the potential for creation of hazardous conditions due to the use or accidental release of hazardous
materials, and impact is less than significant.

Operation of the Recharge Wells - No hazardous materials would be used in conveying
treated water through conveyance pipelines and recharge wells; thus, there would be
no impact.

Impact 4.9-2: The Project would not emit hazardous emissions or handle hazardous or
acutely hazardous materials, substances, or waste within one-quarter mile of an existing or proposed school (p. 4.9-18 - 19).

Findings:
Construction Required compliance with the numerous laws and regulations discussed
above that govern the transportation, use, handling, and disposal of hazardous materials would limit the potential for creation of hazardous conditions due to the use or accidental
release of hazardous materials, and the impact would be less than significant.

Operation of Sourcewater Effluent and Brine Conveyance Pipelines - The preparation
and implementation of the spill response plan, compliance with the AREMA standards, and
required compliance with existing regulations would limit the potential for creation of

hazardous conditions due to the accidental release of hazardous materials near schools, and
the impact would be less than significant.

Operation of Recharge Wells and Conveyance Pipelines Conveying Water from the
AWPF - The recharge wells and the conveyance pipelines conveying water from the AWPF
to the recharge well sites would only receive water treated to drinking water standards.
This water would not be a hazardous material, resulting in no impact.
Transportation of Hazardous Materials The transportation regulations enforced by the CHP and Caltrans include periodic inspections of vehicles and containers used to transport
hazardous materials to ensure compliance with container requirements. The required
compliance with existing regulations would limit the potential for creation of hazardous conditions due to the accidental release of hazardous materials near schools, and would
render this impact less than significant.

Impact Category: Hydrology Resources - Groundwater
The Project would not contribute to groundwater degradation by sea water intrusion.
(p. 4.10-37.)

One of the primary objectives of the Project is to replenish the local groundwater basin to prevent further seawater intrusion. The Project proposes to accomplish this through
pumping distribution that directs pumping away from the coast and recharging the
A Purisima A and B/C units using purified water. Groundwater modeling was employed to
develop the District's municipal pumping distributions, to identify effective recharge well
sites, and determine whether managed active recharge in concert with proposed pumping
distributions increased groundwater levels along the coast at or above their protective
elevations. Protective elevations refer to the groundwater levels that are necessary to
prevent seawater intrusion from occurring in the water supply aquifers inland from the
coast. The groundwater modeling of the Project simulations suggest that in most wells, protective elevations would be achieved. In many cases, the projected existing conditions
simulations show that if the Project was not implemented, protective elevations would not be achieved into the future. The modeling also showed that projected existing conditions groundwater levels decline substantially after recharge ceases but groundwater levels
remain at or above the protective levels, in some cases higher than they would be under the
existing conditions. Groundwater modeling shows that achieving protective levels along the coast and recharging the Basin is viable and beneficial to the District. As the Project would prevent future seawater intrusion rather than induce it, there would be no impact.

Impact 4.10-1: Borehole drilling, construction and development of the recharge wells and monitoring wells would not permanently draw local groundwater levels down to the extent that the operation of nearby District and non-District production wells are adversely affected, nor would water generated during
well construction degrade ambient groundwater quality or violate

Pure Water Soquel A-16 ESA /160164
CEQA Findings of Fact Page'35 of 442

ATTACHMENT 2 - ITEM 2.52

Exhibit A
CEQA Findings of Fact for the Pure Water Soquel: Groundwater Replenishment and Seawater Intrusion Prevention Project

groundwater quality standards (p. 4.10-38 - 4.10-40; Responses to Comments p. 4-25).

Findings. Aquifer testing would be conducted to determine the recharge capacity at the
selected test well sites, and to estimate travel times of recharge water to two monitoring
wells. Potable water from a local private fire hydrant would be drawn from the District's
water supply and would originate from groundwater wells extracting water from predominantly the same aquifer formations as planned for test well recharge. The potable
water would be dechlorinated and filtered for particulate matter prior to recharge, resulting
in recharge water similar to the raw groundwater extracted from District production wells.
Thus, recharge of dechlorinated and filtered potable water would not result in a substantial
groundwater quality impact.

Boreholes for proposed recharge wells and monitoring wells would be drilled by a truck-
mounted drill rig using one of the standard drilling methods for large diameter deep wells.
Drilling deep, large diameter wells is common practice for District wells, is conducted using proven, industry standard methods, requires specialized contractor drilling license, and is
subject to regulation and oversight by the County Environmental Health Services Agency.
Some drilling projects require large volumes of water during well drilling to reduce friction
in the drill casing and to help flush rock fragments and pulverized cuttings generated from
drilling out of the borehole. For these operations, clean well drilling water is typically
brought onto the site via support trucks or obtained from the municipal supply (e.g.
temporary hook-up or hydrant).

Well development is a temporary operation that could depress groundwater levels locally
around the well for up to an estimated 24 to 48-hours. However, given the location of the
proposed recharge and monitoring well sites, the short-term duration of the well
development process is not anticipated or expected to form a cone of depression that would
adversely impact the operation of nearby District or non-District, private production wells.
Construction of the recharge and monitoring wells could require the use of drilling fluids in
the drilling process, primarily to help keep the borehole from caving during drilling. These
fluids are typically water-based and contain small amounts of inert additives. The chemicals
in the fluids could degrade the groundwater quality in the Purisima aquifer and constitute a
significant impact if not used properly and within the manufacturer's guideline and
professional standards. Examples of the products currently used throughout the water well
drilling industry include liquid polymer emulsion used for to stabilize the borehole by preventing reactive shale and clay from swelling and sloughing or a concentrated detergent
containing non-corrosive, non-contaminating, and slowly biodegradable wetting agents,
dispersants, and emulsifiers. Sometimes a mud mixture is used that contains the expansive clay bentonite. However, polymers are widely used because they are more easily removed from the well during development. Often surfactants and dispersants are also used during well development. These and all drilling fluids that are added during drilling and
development are removed through the downhole fluid circulation and well development. As
the fluids are typically confined to the interior part of the borehole or may migrate a
minimal distance from the well boring, there is a low potential for significant quantities of
residual drilling fluids to remain in the aquifer after the fluids are removed through drilling

circulation and well development and thus have negligible effect on groundwater.
Therefore, degradation of groundwater quality during drilling operations would be less
than significant.

Impact 4.10-2: Managed active aquifer recharge of purified water would not cause unfavorable groundwater conditions in the Basin such that nearby District and non-District wells are damaged, experience substantial loss of yield, or
can no longer be operated (p. 4.10-40 - 45).
Findings. The Project would not lower groundwater below the pre-Project levels, nor
would the Project cause groundwater levels in any municipal, private, or monitoring well to
fall below the top of the wells screen. Overall, the Project would increase groundwater levels in the Basin and would have a beneficial effect on non-district, District, and private
wells. This impact is considered less than significant because the Project would not cause
groundwater levels to decline nor would the Project be operated under excessive draw-up
conditions.

Impact 4.10-3: Introducing advanced purified wastewater into the existing groundwater supply of the Purisima aquifer units would not degrade aquifer water
quality or violate water quality standards (p. 4.10-46).

Findings. Based on the proposed water treatment sequence, recharge locations, and estimated residence time, the Project would comply with state groundwater regulations and would adequately treat and remove the chemicals of concern and the CEC's present in the
wastewater stream generated by the SC WWTF. Advanced treated water is the highest level of treatment available such that the water will not have any negative impacts on
groundwater already in the basin. The water will comply with all applicable State Water
Resources Control Board regulations, policies and permit requirements including the State
Board's anti-degradation and drinking water protection policies. Both of these apply to groundwater and ensure that groundwater is viewed as a potential source of drinking water and that new discharges do not degrade existing water quality. Advanced water purification processes would greatly reduce or eliminate the concentrations of trace CEC's or other chemicals of concern to far below limits considered safe for human consumption. The
conclusions reached by the National Water Research Institute panel of experts reflect this
conclusion. As the injection of advanced treated wastewater would be adequately treated,
the potential for degradation of the ambient potable groundwater in the Purisima A and BC
units would negligible and this impact is considered less than significant.

Impact 4.10-4: Soil leaching of metals and other constituents from the aquifer materials,
which could occur as a result of injecting purified water, would not degrade
groundwater quality (p. 4.10-51 - 54).
Findings. The District prepared geochemical characterization study and an Anti- Degradation study (Brown and Caldwell, 2016; 2018). The studies concluded that the
treated water could need conditioning to minimize the potential for leaching of other
constituents that may be susceptible to mobilization under low salinity and/or oxidized

Pure Water Soquel A-18 ESA / 160164

ATTACHMENT 2 - ITEM 2.52

conditions. Therefore, proper conditioning to prevent geochemical mobilization in excess of
MCLs would occur and the Project would conform with Resolution 68-16 Antidegradation
Policy. As part of this Project and in accordance with the SWRCB DDW regulations and the
state Anti-Degradation Policy, adherence to which is mandatory for water recharge projects, the District would conduct the appropriate studies and testing to develop adequate
post-treatment stabilization measures that would ensure chemical leaching does not occur
to an extent that groundwater quality standards would be violated. Given that the District
proposes post-treatment stabilization prior to injection of the purified water and would comply with California's water quality standards, this impact is considered less than
significant.

Impact 4.10-5: Elevated local groundwater levels caused by the Project would not degrade groundwater quality by inducing flows that intersect groundwater
contaminant plumes or existing shallow soil contamination (p. 4.10-54-58).
Findings. The Project would raise groundwater levels in the District's service areas and
could alter local groundwater flow directions due to the changes in groundwater gradients.
However, these localized changes in groundwater flow and gradient would not result in groundwater degradation because there are no known, active contaminant plumes in the
District's service areas. Furthermore, known and undiscovered shallow soil contamination,
which could be spread by rising groundwater levels, would not be disturbed because, based
upon the results of the groundwater model simulation (HydroMetrics, 2018) the Project
would not be operated under conditions where the groundwater surface elevation with draw up would approach the ground surface or shallow soils where soil contamination is typically found (See Impact 4.10-2). Therefore, based on these conclusions, this impact is
considered less than significant.

Impact 4.10-6: Groundwater replenishment would not cause increased flooding and
hydromodification in local streams (p. 4.10-58).

Findings. Because the surface water flows to the groundwater along Soquel Creek (losing
stream) rather than the groundwater flowing into the creek (gaining stream), it is expected
that the increase in groundwater levels from the Project would reduce the amount of surface water flowing to groundwater rather than increase the baseflow in Soquel Creek.
The effects on Soquel Creek from the Project, if any, would be minor and difficult to distinguish among the other factors that affect baseflow. The Project would not alter baseflow in Soquel Creek to a degree that would cause substantial changes in the flow
regime and thus, this impact is considered less than significant.

Impact Category: Hydrology Resources - Surface Water
Place Housing within a 100-Year Flood Hazard Zone. (p. 4.11-40.)

Findings. The Project would not involve construction of new housing within a 100-year
flood hazard zone. Therefore, the significance criterion related to the placement of housing
within a 100-year flood hazard zone is not applicable to the Project.

Expose People or Structures to Inundation by Seiche, or Mudflow. (p. 4.11-15;40.)

Findings. A seiche is a rhythmic motion of water in a partially or completely enclosed
(landlocked) large water body caused by landslides, earthquake-induced ground
accelerations, or ground offset. Seiches can result in long-period waves that cause run-up or
overtopping of adjacent landmasses, similar to tsunami runup. None of the Project facilities
are located in close proximity to a large enclosed body of water capable of producing seiche
waves. Flooding from dam failure can result from both natural and human causes, including
earthquakes, erosion, improper siting and/or design, and rapidly rising floodwater during
heavy storms. The type of failure, ranging from instantaneous to gradual, is dependent on
the building material of the dam. Dam failure can potentially cause loss of life and property
damage, displacement of persons residing in the inundation path, and damage to
infrastructure. The SCWWTF and the area around the San Lorenzo River (where some pipeline segments would be located) is within the mapped dam inundation hazard area for Newell Creek Dam (Figure 4.11-2; City of Santa Cruz, 2008). There have been no reported dam failures for the Newell Creek facility (Santa Cruz County, 2015). In Santa Cruz County, levees along portions of the San Lorenzo River were constructed as part of the San Lorenzo
River Flood Control and Environmental Restoration Project (discussed under Flood
Hazards, above). All of these levees and floodwalls are required to undergo periodic
inspections for safety and performance as part of routine maintenance plans.

There is a very low probability of a seiche occurring in the project area. The Project would
have no effect on the frequency or probability of seiches (i.e., earthquake-induced
oscillating waves in an enclosed water body) because the Project would not create new
enclosed water bodies or affect the frequency of earthquakes. Due to the relatively flat
topography of the project area, Project implementation would not expose people or property to increased mudflow hazards. Therefore, no impact related to inundation by
seiche or mudflow would result.

Impact 4.11-2: Project operation would not violate water quality standards and/or waste discharge requirements, provide substantial additional sources of polluted runoff, or otherwise substantially degrade water quality (p. 4.11- 51 - 59)

Findings:
Operational Water Quality Impacts from Onshore Facility Siting - No long-term changes in drainage patterns would result from implementation of the proposed pipelines as all surface areas associated with pipeline installation would be restored to pre-construction
condition following pipeline installation and, as such, operation of the pipelines would not
provide substantial additional sources of polluted runoff or otherwise substantially degrade
water quality. Impacts to water quality would be less than significant.
Operational Water Quality Impacts from Use of Treated Water for Irrigation Adherence to regulatory requirements would ensure that public health and surface and
groundwater quality are protected and that use of treated water for landscape irrigation, should any irrigation customers be identified in the future, would not violate water quality

standards and/or waste discharge requirements. Impacts to water quality would be less
than significant.

Water Quality Impacts from Operational Discharges into Monterey Bay National
Marine Sanctuary - Project discharges would not be allowed if they do not conform to the NPDES effluent limitations that are prescribed for the protection of receiving water quality
and beneficial uses. Adherence to regulatory requirements including those for wastewater
discharges associated with the County of Santa Cruz LCP policies (which would be
implemented through issuance of a CDP), would ensure that operational discharges do not
degrade the quality of receiving waters in Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary or
impair designated beneficial uses. Given that the combined discharge would not exceed the
dilution requirements of the NPDES permit and would not violate the SC WWTF's NPDES
effluent limits, the RWQCB Basin Plan WQOs for marine habitat, and the Ocean Plan WQ0s for marine aquatic life, nor substantially increase the concentration of constituents in
Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary receiving waters as compared to baseline conditions, the water quality impact associated with the discharge of brine would be less
than significant.

Impact 4.11-3: Project facilities would not alter drainage patterns such that there is
a resultant increase in erosion, siltation, flooding or the rate or amount of surface runoff such that the capacity of an existing or planned stormwater drainage system is exceeded (p. 4.11-59 - 61).

Findings:
Construction - Facility construction would not substantially alter the existing on-site
drainage patterns or the slope of areas where Project components are located. Additionally,
Project construction would adhere to the requirements of the CGP. These requirements are
standard construction practice and have been proven effective at preventing erosion and/or
siltation both on and off site during construction activities and are specifically designed to
manage stormwater within construction zones. Impacts relating to erosion, siltation, or
increased stormwater runoff on and off site due to altered drainage patterns resulting from
construction activities would be less than significant.

Operation The proposed conveyance pipelines would be installed underground, or would
span existing bridges and operation of these components would not alter drainage patterns or cause erosion, siltation or flooding. With mandatory compliance with the post- construction stormwater requirements, proposed alterations in drainage patterns would not
result in substantial increases in erosion, siltation, flooding or the rate or amount of surface
runoff in manner that could exceed the capacity of existing or planned stormwater systems.
The impact would be less than significant.
Impact 4.11-4: Project facilities would not be located within a 100-year flood hazard area
and impede or redirect flood flows or could expose people or structures to a significant risk of loss, injury or death involving flooding, including flooding

Pure Water Soquel A-21 ESA / 160164

as a result of the failure of a levee, or coastal flooding due to tsunami or sea- level rise (p. 4.11-61 - 63).
Findings. The Project facilities would not be located in FEMA-designated 100-year flood hazard zone (1 percent annual flood risk). The conveyance pipelines cross flood zones
associated with the San Lorenzo River, Arana Creek, Rodeo Gulch and Soquel Creek.
However, the pipeline would either cross under or be constructed within the bridge structures over these surface water features. Therefore, the proposed conveyance pipelines would not place structures within flood-hazard areas in a manner that would impede or
redirect flood flows or otherwise expose people or structures to significant risks involving
flooding. Impacts related to flooding hazards would be less than significant; the Project
would not expose people or structures to significant increased risks involving flooding
associated with 100-year flood hazard areas or areas subject to flooding as a result of levee
failure.

Conveyance pipelines would be located underground or would span existing bridges and
would not be subject to structural failure caused by tsunami run-up and would not impede
or redirect tsunami related flood flows. Therefore, impacts related to inundation by tsunami
would be less than significant.

A portion of the Project area in the vicinity of the San Lorenzo River, including the SC WWTF
dam inundation zone for Newell site and some pipeline segments, are within the mapped
Creek Dam. Given the low risk of dam failure, the Project would not expose people or
structures to increased risk due to failure of a dam. Therefore, impacts related to flooding due to dam failure would be less than significant.

The SC WWTF site is protected from overtopping of Neary Lagoon by an existing flood
mitigation barrier wall. Therefore, impacts to the shoreline or surrounding areas related to
sea level rise flooding, flood exposure risk, and potentially increased flood related hazards
from the proposed SC WWTF or pipeline segments would be less than significant.

Impact Category: Land Use and Recreation

Impact 4.12-1: The Proposed Project would not conflict with applicable land use plans, policies, or regulations adopted for the purpose of avoiding or mitigating an environmental effect (p. 4.12-12).

Findings. California Government Code Section 53091 (d) and (e) provides that facilities for
the production, generation, storage, treatment, and transmission of water supplies are
exempt from local (i.e., city and county) building and zoning ordinances. As the Project
facilities each relate to the production, generation, treatment, and transmission of water
and are, they are exempt from Santa Cruz County, City of Santa Cruz, and City of Capitola
building and zoning ordinances, including associated permitting requirements. However,
the policies of general plans and LCPs within these jurisdictions would continue to apply.
Through adherence to Santa Cruz County, City of Santa Cruz and City of Capitola provisions,
the Project would not conflict with applicable land use policies and regulations. The impact
would be less than significant.

Impact Category: Mineral Resources
There are no known mineral resources in or adjacent to the Project sites. The potential for
impacts to mineral resources and the identification of their potential locations was
completed using available data from the California Geological Survey (CGS) formerly the
Division of Mines and Geology (CDMG), the Division of Oil, Gas & Geothermal Resources
(DOGGR), and County of Santa Cruz GIS database information (CDMG, 1982; DOGGR, 2018; County of Santa Cruz, 2018). CGS is responsible for preparing Mineral Land Classification
Maps that designate Mineral Resource Zones (MRZ). MRZs define areas where important
mineral deposits occur, based on the value of the mineral resource. The Project area is
predominantly within areas designated as MRZ 4, areas where available information is
inadequate for assignment to any other MRZ zone (CDMG, 1982). The Project area is
entirely developed urban land that would be inaccessible for classification or use. Some
smaller areas are classified as MRZ-1, areas designated as having no significant or unlikely
mineral deposits. The only area designated as MRZ-2, areas where adequate information
indicates that significant mineral deposits are present, is the corridor of San Lorenzo River,
which some of the pipeline routes would pass through. However, this area is also entirely
within the urban area and is not currently used for extraction of mineral resources. Finally,
the County of Santa Cruz GIS database indicates that there are no mineral resources in or
near the Project area (County of San Cruz, 2018). The DOGGR well finder website indicated
that there are no oil or gas production wells at or near any of the Project components
(DOGGR, 2018). Accordingly, this significance criterion is not applicable to the Project. (p.
4.1-3-4.1-4)

Impact Category: Noise and Vibration
Impact 4.13-1: Construction of the Project would not result in exposure of persons to, or generation of, noise levels in excess of standards established in the local general plans or noise ordinances (project-related construction activities at
the SC WWTF Site, Headquarters-West Annex Site (last 21.5 months of construction activities), Cabrillo College Recharge Well Sites (i.e., both
proposed north and south recharge well sites), and Twin Lakes Church Recharge Well Site (p. 4.13-18 - 4.13-30).

Findings:
SC WWTF Site - Construction at the SC WWTF site would occur within the allowed hours
specified in Section 9.36.010(a) of the City of Santa Cruz noise ordinance. Since Project-
related construction activities would not conflict with the City of Santa Cruz's noise
ordinance, construction of purification facilities at the SC WWTF site would not conflict with
the City's municipal code. Therefore, there would be a less-than-significant impact with respect to exposure of persons to, or generation of, noise levels in excess of standards found
in the local noise ordinance.

Headquarters-West Annex Site (last 21.5 months of construction activities) - A wall
would be constructed along the southern boundary of the proposed Headquarters-West
Annex Site and existing District's Headquarters property, which is expected to attenuate
noise exposure levels at the nearest sensitive receptor by 10 dB during the remaining 21.5

Pure Water Soquel A-23 ESA / 160164

ATTACHMENT 2 - ITEM 2.52

months of construction, following wall installation. As shown in Table 4.13-6, the wall would reduce noise levels associated with AWPF construction activities to 74 dBA Lmax and 73 dBA Leq- Thus, residences near the AWPF construction areas would not be exposed to construction noise levels that would exceed the County's daytime noise standard of 75 dBA
Leq- This impact would be less than significant.

Cabrillo College North and South Recharge - Well Sites - Since the nearest sensitive
receptors to the Project site would not be expose to construction noise levels that would
exceed the County's daytime noise standard, there would be a less-than-significant impact with respect to exposure of residents to noise levels in excess of standards found in the local
noise ordinance. Since the nearest sensitive receptors to the Project site would not be
expose to construction noise levels that would exceed the County's nighttime noise
standard of 60 dBA Leq, there would be a less-than-significant impact with respect to exposure of residents to noise levels in excess of standards found in the local noise
ordinance.

Twin Lakes Church Recharge Well Site - Since the nearest sensitive receptors to the
Project site would not be exposed to construction noise levels that would exceed the
County's daytime noise standard of 75 dBA Leq there would be a less-than-significant impact with respect to exposure of residents to noise levels in excess of standards found in
the local noise ordinance. Similarly, since the nearest sensitive receptors to the Twin Lakes
Church Site would not be expose to construction noise levels that would exceed the
County's nighttime noise standard of 60 dBA Leq, there would be a less-than-significant impact with respect to exposure of residents to noise levels in excess of standards found in
the local noise ordinance.

Impact 4.13-2: Project construction would not result in a substantial temporary or
periodic increase in ambient noise levels in the Project vicinity at sensitive
receptors near the SC WWTF Site, Headquarters-West Annex Site (last 21.5
months of construction activities), Cabrillo College Recharge Well Sites (i.e.,
both proposed north and south recharge well sites), and Twin Lakes Church Recharge Well Site above levels existing without the Project (p. 4.13-30-36).

Finding:
SC WWTF Sites - The sensitive receptors closest to the SC WWTF Site consist of single- family residences located approximately 520 feet south of the SC WWTF Site and would be exposed to noise levels of 59 dBA Leg during Project construction, below the applied 75 dBA Leq daytime temporary substantial noise increase threshold. Therefore, there would be a
less-than-significant impact with respect to a temporary substantial increase in ambient
noise levels at residences in the vicinity of the SC WWTF Site.

Headquarters-West Annex Site (last 21.5 months of construction activities) - Once the wall is constructed, noise generated during the construction of the AWPF is expected to attenuate noise exposure levels at the nearest sensitive receptor by 10 dB during the last 21.5 months of construction. As shown in Table 4.13-7, the wall would reduce noise levels
associated with AWPF construction activities to 73 dBA Leq. Residences near the AWPF

construction areas, after the construction of the wall, would not be exposed to construction
noise levels that would exceed the County's daytime noise standard of 75 dBA Leq- This
impact would be less than significant.
Cabrillo College North and South Recharge Well Sites - Since onsite construction activities would not exceed the applied daytime or nighttime temporary substantial noise
increase threshold, this would result in a less-than-significant impact with respect to a
temporary substantial increase in ambient noise levels in the vicinity of the Cabrillo College
Recharge Well Sites.

Twin Lakes Church Recharge Well Site - Since onsite construction activities would not
exceed the applied daytime or nighttime temporary substantial noise increase threshold,
this would be a less-than-significant impact with respect to a temporary substantial
increase in ambient noise levels in the vicinity of the Twin Lakes Church Site.

Impact 4.13-3: Operation of the Project could result in exposure of persons to, or generation of, noise levels in excess of standards established in the local
general plan or noise ordinance (p. 4.13-37 -39).

Findings. Operational activities associated with the water treatment facilities, recharge and
monitoring wells, and pump stations could result in the exposure of nearby off-site sensitive
receptors to noise levels that could exceed local noise standards. The primary noise source associated with Project operation would be the onsite pumps. The recharge well backwash
and backwash tank pumps at the proposed recharge well sites would be fully submerged in water and would be located under densely compacted soil. Since noise generated by these
pumps are not anticipated to be audible at ground level, noise generated by these pumps are not anticipated to expose nearby sensitive receptors to noise levels that would result in
a less-than-significant impact. Noise generated during the operation of the onsite pump
stations at the AWPF Sites would not expose nearby sensitive receptors to noise levels that
exceed the County of Santa Cruz's daytime or nighttime noise standards. Therefore, a less-
than-significant impact would occur at these sites.

Impact 4.13-5: The Project would not result in a substantial permanent increase in
ambient noise levels in the Project vicinity above levels existing without the
Project (4.13-42-45).

Findings. Operational activities associated with the treatment facilities and pump stations, and recharge wells could increase the existing ambient noise levels in the vicinity of the
Project sites. Noise sources associated with the Project would be primarily stationary, such as pumps. The recharge well backwash and backwash tank pumps at the proposed recharge well sites would be fully submerged in water and would be located under densely compacted soil. Since noise generated by these pumps are not anticipated to be audible at
ground level, noise generated by these pumps are not anticipated to expose nearby
sensitive receptors to noise levels that would result in a less-than-significant impact.
Noise generated during the operation of the onsite pump stations at the AWPF Sites would
not expose nearby sensitive receptors to noise levels that would elevated existing ambient

ATTACHMENT 2 - ITEM 2.52

noise levels above the applied 5 dB substantial increase threshold. Therefore, a less-than-
significant impact would occur at these sites.

Impact Category: Population and Housing
Impact 4.14-1: The Project would not induce substantial population growth directly
during Project construction or operation (p. 4.14-6-7).
Findings. The Project would not include any housing construction and would not induce
growth directly by constructing housing that would attract people to the area. Construction
and operation employment demands related to the Project would be anticipated to be met by the existing labor pool within the study area. Therefore, construction and operation of the Project would not directly induce a substantial increase in the local population or
demand for housing; the effect would be less than significant.

Impact Category: Public Services
The Project would not include the construction of new housing, nor would it increase the
number of workers in the area such that new governmental facilities would be necessary.
The Project would add six additional staff positions (five full-time, and one half-time) to
support existing District staff with Project operations. It is expected that additional staff and Project construction workers would primarily be from within the Santa Cruz region. This small increase in employees, and the short-term use of construction workers for the Project
may result in some need for additional public services, but not to the extent that would
require any new or physically altered governmental facilities to maintain acceptable service
ratios, response times, or other performance objectives for any public services, including
fire protection, police protection, schools, and other services. Therefore, the Project would
not have any impacts related to public services. (p. 4.1-4.)

Impact Category: Transportation
The Project will not conflict with an applicable Congestion Management Program. (p. 4.15-8)

Findings. In 2000, at the request of the Santa Cruz County Regional Transportation
Commission (SCCRTC), the County of Santa Cruz and other local jurisdictions exercised the
option to be exempt from preparation and implementation of a Congestion Management
Plan (CMP) per Assembly Bill 2419. As a result, the County of Santa Cruz no longer has a
Congestion Management Agency or CMP. In addition, regardless of this exemption, the standards established by CMPs in general are intended for use in evaluating traffic impacts
related to added vehicle trips during Project operation and are not applicable to
construction-related vehicle traffic. Project operations following construction of the
planned facilities would only require periodic maintenance, and would not result in a
substantial change in vehicle trips, as further discussed below. Because Project construction
would be transitory in nature, and effects on roadway and intersection operations would be
temporary, a level of service analysis for construction is not required.

Pure Water Soquel A-26 ESA /160164
CEQA Findings of Fact Page'45 of 442

ATTACHMENT 2 - ITEM 2.52
Exhibit A
CEQA Findings of Fact for the Pure Water Soquel: Groundwater Replenishment and Seawater Intrusion Prevention Project

The Project will not require a change in air traffic patterns. (p. 4.15-8)

The Project sites are not near an airfield; the Watsonville Municipal Airport is about 10 to
13 miles to the east. These distances are outside of the limit for objects near airports in the
guidance published by the Federal Aviation Administration.

The Project Will Not Substantially Increase Hazards due to a Design Feature. (p. 4.15-8.)
Implementation of the Project would not permanently change the existing or planned
transportation network and would not include any design features that would permanently
increase the potential for traffic safety hazards. Therefore, this significance criterion is not
applicable to the Project.

Impact 4.15-2: Project construction could cause temporary increases in traffic volumes on area roadways, but would not cause substantial conflicts with
the performance of the circulation system (p. 4.15-12 - 14).
Findings. Construction-Related Vehicle Trips Construction of each element of the Project
would result in short-term increases in vehicle trips on area roadways. The number of construction-related vehicle trips would vary each day, depending on the type of Project component, construction phase, planned activity, and material needs. The addition of
construction traffic to the current roadway volumes, without an increase in roadway
capacity, could result in increased congestion and delays for vehicles, including public transit. The presence of construction trucks, with their slower speeds and larger turning
radii, could result in some vehicle delays and congestion. The actual impact of construction
vehicle traffic on local and regional roadways would vary by time of day, the number and
type of construction-related vehicles, the number of travel lanes on the affected roadways,
and existing traffic volumes on these roadways. Impacts of construction traffic would be
most noticeable on roadways in the immediate vicinity of the Project work sites and less noticeable on regional roadways and on roadways farther away from the sites (as Project
trips disperse over the road network).

Worker Vehicle Trips - Construction at the SC WWTF would average up to 15 construction
workers per day, with peak construction activities having up to 20 workers per day, and
construction at the Chanticleer Site or the Headquarters-West Annex site would require an
average of 12 construction workers, and a peak of up to 16 workers. Construction of the recharge and monitoring wells would require a maximum of 6 workers per day for each
site. Construction for pipeline installation would require up to two crews, each with an
average of 7 workers (and a peak of up to 10 workers) per day. Although construction worker travel mode is unknown, for this analysis it was assumed that all workers would
travel to and from the Project site in their own vehicles.
Haul Truck Trips - The number of construction-related haul truck trips per day would vary depending on the type of construction technique, the volume of spoils and fill, and the pace of work. As presented in Chapter 3, Project Description, open-cut trenching and excavation would be used during pipeline installation, which would require haul trucks to export
excavated spoils and import fill material along the alignment. Haul truck trips also would be

Pure Water Soquel A-27 ESA / 160164

ATTACHMENT 2 - ITEM 2.52

Exhibit A

generated during demolition of existing structures at the SC WWTF and/or Chanticleer
Sites. Table 3-6 summarizes excess spoils, construction area, construction equipment types,
truck trips, and construction duration for each primary Project component. Construction
truck traffic would be required to follow designated truck routes to the Project sites, as well
as other streets that provide the most direct route to the work site and minimize the use of
local streets.

Table 4.15-3 of the Draft EIR documents the projected number of vehicles that would be
generated by Project construction activities. These projections include trips to and from the
Project work sites and account for daily construction worker commutes and haul truck trips. Based on the estimated amount of traffic generated by each Project component, concurrent construction activities could result in daily one-way vehicle trips of up to 116 by
workers and 152 by haul trucks. All worker trips to and from the work sites are assumed to
occur during the a.m. and p.m. peak (commute) traffic hours (i.e., up to 58 inbound to the work sites prior to 8:00 a.m., and up to 58 outbound from the work sites after 5:00 p.m.). Haul truck trips would be spread over the course of the 9-hour day (i.e., up to about
18 one-way trips per hour). The highest concentration of vehicle trips traveling to and from
the well facility sites would be on the roads that provide direct access to the sites. However,
not all of the facilities and pipelines are located near each other, and it is reasonably
assumed that workers' residences would be spread among various cities, and that Project
trips would be dispersed on different roads. On that basis, the estimated daily vehicle trips
associated with concurrent construction activities would represent a less-than-substantial
increase on regional roads (e.g., Highway 1), and similarly would not substantially alter the
existing operations of local roads.

The impact related to temporary increases in traffic volume associated with construction
vehicle traffic would be lessening of their traffic-carrying capacities due to the slower
movement and larger turning radii of trucks, which potentially could significantly affect
traffic and transit operations. However, due to its temporary nature and limited magnitude,
the effect of this construction-related increase in traffic and truck volume on traffic and
transit operations would not be substantial and is determined to be less than significant.

Impact 4.15-5: Project operations and maintenance activities would cause increases
in traffic volumes on area roadways, but would not substantially alter transportation conditions, and would not cause conflicts with alternative
travel modes, including vehicles, emergency vehicles, transit, pedestrians, and bicycle traffic (p. 4.15-17).

Findings. Project operations and maintenance activities would result in trip generation
levels similar to the normal range of variation for existing system operations and
maintenance practices, and would not represent a substantial number of new vehicle trips.
Overall, any increases in traffic generated by operation and maintenance of Project facilities
would be less than substantial compared to existing conditions and would not result in a
noticeable increase in traffic on adjacent streets. Therefore, operational impacts related to
the proposed Project would be less than significant.

Impact Category: Utilities and Service Systems
Require or result in the construction of new water or wastewater treatment facilities or
expansion of existing facilities, the construction of which could cause significant
environmental effects. (p. 4.17-6.)

Findings. The primary purpose of the Project is the construction of new water treatment
facilities for advanced water purification. Accordingly, the potential environmental effects
of constructing and operating these facilities are the primary subject of this EIR. Significant
effects that could result from the Project are addressed in the topical sections of this EIR
that correspond to those types of effects.

Require or result in the construction of new stormwater drainage facilities or expansion of existing facilities, the construction of which could cause significant environmental effects. (p. 4.17-7.)

Findings. The Project does not propose to construct or expand stormwater drainage
facilities. As discussed in Section 4.11, Hydrology Resources - Surface Water, Project
implementation would not substantially increase the rate or amount of stormwater runoff.
Thus, project implementation would not cause an exceedance of existing stormwater
drainage capacity that would necessitate the construction or expansion of infrastructure.

Impact 4.17-1: The Project would not exceed water treatment requirements or
result in a determination by the wastewater treatment provider that there is insufficient capacity to serve the Project (p. 4.17-7-8)

Findings:
Construction - During Project construction, dust abatement, pipe flushing, and equipment
testing would account for the majority of water required for treatment and conveyance
facility construction. Substantial sewer discharges are not anticipated during construction,
and therefore would not be expected to exceed wastewater treatment provider capacities.
For these reasons, Project construction would be expected to have a less-than-significant
effect related to exceeding water treatment requirements or wastewater treatment
provider capacities.

Operation • The primary waste streams from Project operations would be the
ultrafiltration (UF) or microfiltration (MF) waste, and brine/RO concentrate generated from
the reverse osmosis (RO) process. Through adherence to applicable regulations governing
operational discharges, Project operations would not exceed treatment requirements. For these reasons, Project operations would be expected to have a less-than-significant effect
related to exceeding water treatment requirements or wastewater treatment provider
capacities.

ATTAGHMENT 2 - ITEM 2.52

Exhibit A
CEQA Findings of Fact for the Pure Water Soquel: Groundwater Replenishment and Seawater Intrusion Prevention Project

Impact 4.17-2: The Project would have sufficient water supplies from existing
entitlements and resources, and would not require new or expanded
entitlements (p. 4.17-8 -9).

Findings. Construction phase water supply needs would be for dust abatement, pipe flushing,
equipment testing and well drilling during construction and for potential water faucets and
bathrooms facilities during operations. The District and City of Santa Cruz have entered into a
memorandum of understanding (MOU) regarding the provision of sourcewater effluent from
the SC WWTF for the Project's operational source water. Pursuant to the MOU and the Project
design, Project operation would not require more water supply than would be available
through the Project Agreement, nor would it require new or expanded water supply
resources or entitlements; therefore, the Project would have a less-than-significant impact
related to source water supply availability.

Impact 4.17-3: Disposal of Project-related construction waste would not result in adverse effects on landfill capacity and conflict with solid waste statutes and regulations (p. 4.17-9 - 10).

Findings:
Construction - Excavation and construction activities would generate excess soil, rock,
construction material and debris. It is unknown whether a substantial amount of the
expected construction solid waste can be reused. Regardless, if the all construction waste
were disposed of at the Buena Vista Landfill, it would represent a negligible amount of the remaining landfill capacity. If another area landfill were to be used instead, it can similarly
be assumed that the required Project waste would represent a negligible amount of the
remaining landfill capacity. Therefore, this impact would be less than significant.

Operations - Once constructed, operation of the pumps, conveyance pipelines, and
recharge wells would not generate solid waste, except for that resulting from occasional
minor servicing and/or replacement of equipment parts, and grounds maintenance. Given the small amount of solid waste that would be generated relative to the above-described
remaining capacity of nearby landfills, Project operation and maintenance activities would
not contribute substantial amounts of solid wastes which could exceed remaining landfill
capacity. For these reasons, operational impacts would be less than significant.

2.2. Significant or Potentially Significant Impacts Mitigated to a Less Than Significant
Level.

The following significant and potentially significant environmental impacts of the Project are
being mitigated to a less than significant level and are set out below. Pursuant to section
21081(a)(1) of CEQA and section 15091(a)(1) of the CEQA Guidelines, as to each such impact,
the Board, based on the evidence in the record before it, finds that changes or alterations
incorporated into the Project by means of conditions or otherwise, mitigate, avoid or substantially lessen to a level of insignificance these significant or potentially significant
environmental impacts of the Project.

The Board also finds that the mitigation measures cited below are feasible, are adopted, and
will further reduce impacts to a less than significant level. Accordingly, the Board finds that,
pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21081(a)(1) and State CEQA Guidelines section
15091(a)(1), changes or alterations have been required in, or incorporated into, the
proposed Project that mitigate or avoid the potentially significant impacts of the proposed
Project as identified in the EIR. Therefore, impacts in this section are considered less than
significant. Mitigation measures will further reduce impacts.

The basis for the finding for each identified impact is set forth below.

Impact Category: Air Quality
Impact 4.3-1: The Project could generate emissions of criteria air pollutants that could
contribute to a violation of an ambient air quality standard during construction (p. 4.3-16 - 4.3-19; Responses to Comments p. 4-14 - 4.18).
The following mitigation measures within the authority of the Board to impose have been
adopted to address this impact to the extent feasible:
Mitigation Measure 4.3-1a: Construction Emissions Reduction Plan.
Mitigation Measure 4.3-1b: Idling Restrictions.
Finding. Using the most conservative daily emissions scenario out of all the water treatment facility options (construction of the AWPF for advanced purification of tertiary
effluent at the Chanticleer Site), maximum daily construction emissions of NOx would be
approximately 245 pounds per day, which would exceed the MBARD's significance
threshold of 137 pounds per day, resulting in a significant impact related to the potential to
cause a violation of an ozone and/or NO2 ambient air quality standard. Emissions of ROG,
CO, PM10, and PM2.s would not exceed the MBARD's respective significance criteria;
therefore, impacts associated with these pollutants would be less than significant.
As discussed on pages 4.3-17 - 4.3-19 (revised per Responses to Comments p. 4-14 - 4.15),
implementation of Mitigation Measures 4.3-1a (Construction Emissions Reduction Plan)
and 4.3-1b (Idling Restrictions) would reduce maximum construction-related emissions of
NOx to less than the 137 pounds-per-day significance threshold. The maximum daily
emission reductions would occur as a result of Project component phasing modifications
and the potential use of off-road construction equipment that would meet USEPA's most
stringent emissions standards for NOx.

With implementation of the mitigation measure(s), this impact is reduced to a less
than significant level

Impact 4.3-3: Project construction activities could conflict with implementation of the
applicable air quality plan (p. 4.3-19 - 4.3-20).

The following mitigation measures within the authority of the Board to impose have been adopted to address this impact to the extent feasible:
Mitigation Measure 4.3-1a: Construction Emissions Reduction Plan.
Mitigation Measure 4.3-1b: Idling Restrictions.
Finding. The Project-related short-term construction emissions associated with all five
configurations would exceed the significance threshold for NOx, representing a significant
impact related to the potential to cause a violation of an ozone and/or NO2 ambient air
quality standard.
As discussed on pages 4.3-17 - 4.3-19, with implementation of Mitigation Measures 4.3-1a
and 4.3-1b, construction-related NOx emissions would be reduced to less than the
significance threshold (see discussion of mitigation of Impact 4.3-1, above); therefore, the
Project would not conflict with the primary goal of the 2012-2015 AQMP, and the impact associated with conflicting or obstructing implementation of the applicable air quality plan.
With implementation of the mitigation measure(s), this impact is reduced to a less
than significant level

Impact 4.3-4: Project construction could expose sensitive receptors to substantial
pollutant concentrations (4.3-20 - 4.3-22)

The following mitigation measure(s) within the authority of the Board to impose has been
adopted to address this impact to the extent feasible:
Mitigation Measure 4.3-4: Equipment with Tier 4 Engines.

Finding. Construction of the Project would result in the short-term generation of DPM
emissions from the use of off-road diesel equipment. These emissions could result in the
short-term exposure of local sensitive receptors to TACs (i.e., DPM). A screening-level HRA
was conducted to estimate the health risk impact that would be associated with
construction of the Project. The maximum non-cancer risk would not exceed the
significance threshold for construction at any of the Project sites, however, the maximum
cancer risk would be approximately 121 in one million associated with construction at the
Headquarters-West Annex Site. Construction at each of the Project sites, with the exceptions
of the Twin Lakes Church Recharge Well Site and the Cabrillo College North and South
Recharge Well Sites, would result in a cancer risk that would exceed the significance
threshold. The associated construction-phase health risk impact is considered significant.

As discussed on page 4.3-22 (revised per Responses to Comments p. 4-16), implementation
of Mitigation Measure 4.3-4 (Equipment with Tier 4 Engines), would require that all off-
road construction equipment at the Project sites have engines that meet USEPA's most
stringent emission standards for particulate matter, are otherwise equipped with Level 3

diesel particulate filters, and/or be fueled by alternative fuels. This would reduce maximum
construction-related emissions of DPM due to construction at the Chanticleer,
Headquarters-West Annex, SC WWTF, Willowbrook Lane Recharge Well, and Monterey
Avenue Recharge Well Sites.

With implementation of the mitigation measure(s), this impact is reduced to a less
than significant level

Impact Category: Biological Resources
Impact 4.4-1: Project construction and operation could have a substantial adverse effect,
either directly or through habitat modifications, on a species identified as candidate, sensitive or special-status in local or regional plans, policies, or
regulations, or by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service, or National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
[4.4-46 - 4.4-61]

The following mitigation measures within the authority of the Board to impose have been
adopted to address this impact to the extent feasible:

Mitigation Measure Mitigation Measure 4.4-1a: Perform preconstruction nesting bird
surveys in areas that provide suitable habitat.
Mitigation Measure 4.4-1b: Perform preconstruction bat surveys. [Applies to Headquarters-West Annex site, Chanticleer site, conveyance pipeline stream crossings 3 18, and the Willowbrook Lane. Twin Lakes Church, and Cabrillo College South Recharge Well sites.]

conveyance pipeline alignment on Wharf Road, between Pacific Coast Manor on the
southern end and Soquel Wharf Road on the northern end; the eucalyptus grove
adjacent to the pipeline alignment at Kennedy Road and Park Avenue; and the eucalyptus grove adjacent to Cabrillo College Drive near Stream Crossing 17.]
Mitigation Measure 4-4.1i: Avoidance and Minimization Measures for Special- Status Plants. [Applies to the conveyance pipeline alignment along the railroad tracks north of Schwan Lagoon, between the Simpkins Family Swim center parking lot and
Stream Crossing-15.
Mitigation Measure 4.4-1j: Avoidance and Minimization Measures for Native Stands of Monterey Pine. [Applies to the pipeline alignment between Soquel Avenue
and 7th Avenue; the pipeline alignment between the Simpkins Family Swim Center parking lot and 7th Avenue; the pipeline alignment along Wharf Road between Grace Street and Soquel Wharf Road; the pipeline alignment along Kennedy Drive; and the Willowbrook Recharge Well site.]

Mitigation Measure 4.4-1k: Control Measures for Spread of Invasive Plants. [Applies to coastal terrace prairie north of Schwan Lagoon along the pipeline alignment along the railroad tracks north of Schwan Lagoon, from the Simpkins Family Swim Center parking lot to Stream Crossing-15.]

Mitigation Measure 4.4-1l: Mitigation and Monitoring Plan. [Applies to any riparian,
wetland or coastal terrace prairie habitat temporarily impacted by construction
activities.]

Finding. Construction of the proposed Project could result in potentially significant impacts from erosion, sediment transport, hazardous waste in waterways, which could have a substantial adverse effect on special-status fish and amphibians. Temporary loss of habitat
could negatively impact Ohlone tiger beetle, and rare plants. Construction could disrupt
breeding and foraging habitat for nesting birds, raptors and bats; and disrupt overwintering
habitat for monarch butterflies. The project would adhere to the Construction General Permit
and SWPPP, as discussed in Hydrology Resources - Surface Water (Impact 4.11-1), and
implement the following Mitigation Measures 4.4-1a (Perform preconstruction nesting bird
surveys in areas that provide suitable habitat), Mitigation Measure 4.4-1b (Perform preconstruction bat surveys), Mitigation Measure 4.4-1c (Provide Construction
Monitoring near Sensitive Habitats), Mitigation Measure 4.4-1d (Construction Worker
Environmental Awareness Training and Education Program), Mitigation Measure 4.4-1e
(General Avoidance and Protection Measures), Mitigation Measure 4.4-1f (Avoidance and
Minimization Measures for Western Pond Turtle and Santa Cruz Black Salamander),
Mitigation Measure 4.4-1g (Avoidance and Protection Measures for Ohlone Tiger Beetle),
Mitigation Measure 4.4-1h (Avoidance and Protection of Overwintering Monarch Butterfly
Colonies), Mitigation Measure 4-4.1i (Avoidance and Minimization Measures for Special-
Status Plants), Mitigation Measure 4.4-1j (Avoidance and Minimization Measures for Native
Stands of Monterey Pine), Mitigation Measure 4.4-1k (Control Measures for Spread of
Invasive Plants), and Mitigation Measure 4.4-11 (Mitigation and Monitoring Plan) to reduce substantial adverse effects resulting from project construction or operation either directly or through habitat modifications, on a species identified as candidate, sensitive or special-

status in local or regional plans, policies, or regulations, or by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, or National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration.

Implementation of Mitigation Measure 4.11-1 provides safety precautions for horizontal
directional drilling operations which would reduce potential impacts to special-status fish.
Mitigation Measures 4.4-1c, 4.4-1d, 4.4-1e, and 4.4-1f would reduce impacts on western pond
turtle by providing biological monitoring within 150 feet of sensitive aquatic sites, providing
environmental training to construction personnel, providing general protection measures, and specific survey and relocation measures for western pond turtles, if encountered.
Implementation of Mitigation Measures 4.4-1c, 4.4-1d, 4.4-1e, and 4.4-1f would reduce
impacts on special-status amphibians by providing biological monitoring within 150 feet of
sensitive sites, providing environmental training to construction personnel, providing general
protection measures, and specific surveys and relocation measures for Santa Cruz black
salamander in suitable habitat. Implementation of Mitigation Measures 4.4-1c, 4.4-1d, 4.4-1e,
and 4.4-1g would reduce impacts on Ohlone tiger beetle by providing biological monitoring
within 150 feet of sensitive habitat, providing environmental training to construction
personnel, providing general protection measures, and requiring focused surveys for Ohlone
tiger beetle in suitable habitat. Implementation of Mitigation Measures 4.4-1c, 4.4-1d, 4.4-1e,
and 4.4-1h would reduce impacts on monarch butterfly by providing biological monitoring
within 150 feet of sensitive habitat, providing environmental training to construction
personnel, providing general protection measures, and requiring focused surveys for
monarch butterflies for activities that are performed in near proximity to suitable habitat. Implementation of Mitigation Measures 4.4-1c, 4.4-1d, 4.4-1e, 4.4-1i, 4.4-1j, and 4.4-1k would
reduce impacts to special-status plants by providing biological monitoring within 150 feet of
sensitive habitat, providing environmental training to construction personnel, providing
general protection measures, requiring focused surveys for rare plants within suitable
habitat, avoiding Santa Cruz tarplant populations, protection and replacement of native
Monterey pine stands, and preventing the introduction of non-native plant seeds.
With implementation of the mitigation measures, this impact is reduced to a less than
significant level

Impact 4.4-2: Project construction could have a substantial adverse effect on a riparian
habitat or other sensitive natural community identified in local or regional plans, policies, regulations or by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, or National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. (4.4-61 - 4.4-64)

The following mitigation measures within the authority of the Board to impose have been adopted to address this impact to the extent feasible:

Measure 4.4-2a: Minimize Disturbance to Riparian Habitat. [Applies to all stream
crossings, Riparian Corridor-1, and riparian habitat within Willowbrook Park.]
Measure 4.4-2b: Avoidance and Protection of Coastal Terrace Prairie. [Applies to coastal terrace prairie between 7th Ave and 17th Ave, north of Schwan Lagoon.]

CEQA Findings of Fact Page'54 of 442

ATTACHMENT 2 - ITEM 2.52

Exhibit A
CEQA Findings of Fact for the Pure Water Soquel: Groundwater Replenishment and Seawater Intrusion Prevention Project

Finding. Riparian habitat occurs outside of the Project corridor at pipeline stream
crossings, as well as in the riparian corridor (RC-1) northwest of Soquel Avenue pipeline
stream crossing SC-3. If the pipeline along Soquel Avenue were installed along the south to southeast side of the Avenue, which is approximately 70 feet from RC-1, there would be no construction impacts on the subject riparian habitat. If the alignment were installed along
the north side of Soquel Avenue, Project construction could temporarily impact the riparian
habitat north of and adjacent to the work area. Project construction along the pipeline
alignment would involve activities such as grading, trenching, and excavation activities that
could modify riparian habitat. Coastal terrace prairie, a recognized CDFW sensitive natural
community, is present in the study area north of Schwan Lagoon, and may be present within
50 to 100 feet south of the pipeline alignment between the west and east arms of Schwan
Lagoon.

As discussed on pages 4.4-61 - 4.4-64, implementation of Mitigation Measures 4.4-1c, 4.4-
1d, 4.4-1e, 4.4-2a (Minimize Disturbance to Riparian Habitat) and 4.4-2b (Avoidance and
Protection of Coastal Terrace Prairie) would reduce impacts on sensitive natural
communities by providing biological monitoring near sensitive areas, providing
environmental training to construction personnel, providing general protection measures,
minimizing disturbance to riparian habitat in the Project area, and avoiding and protecting
native stands of Monterey pines.

With implementation of the mitigation measures, this impact is reduced to a less than
significant level

Impact 4.4-5: Project construction could conflict with local policies or ordinances protecting biological resources, such as a tree preservation policy or
ordinance (4.4-66 - 4.4-67; Responses to Comments pp. 4-18 - 4-19)

The following mitigation measure within the authority of the Board to impose has been
adopted to address this impact to the extent feasible:
Measure 4.4-5: Comply with Local Tree Ordinances.

Finding. The relevant policies and ordinances protecting biological resources in the Project
area are numerous since the Project occurs across multiple jurisdictions. The relevant policies primarily focus on protection of environmentally sensitive habitats and biological
resources, including protected wildlife and plant species, wetlands, streams and riparian
corridors. The Project could result in potentially significant impacts to biological resources,
which could conflict with applicable local policies or ordinances protecting biological
resources.

As discussed on pages 4.4-66 - 4.4-67, with implementation of Mitigation Measure 4.4-5, impacts resulting from tree removal and trimming associated with clearing and grubbing would be reduced to a less than significant level by requiring the District to comply with
applicable local tree protection ordinances, including through obtaining tree removal permits, compensating for removed trees, and monitoring and maintaining replacement plantings (see Impact 4.4-5, above); therefore, the Project would not conflict with local

policies or ordinances protecting biological resources, such as a tree preservation policy or
ordinance.

With implementation of the mitigation measure, this impact is reduced to a less than
significant level

Impact Category: Cultural Resources
Impact 4.5-1: The Project could cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of a historical resource as defined in CEQA Guidelines Section 15064.5.

The following mitigation measure within the authority of the Board to impose has been
adopted to address this impact to the extent feasible:

Measure 4.13-4: Vibration Monitoring for Pipeline Installation in the Vicinity of
Historic Buildings (applies to buildings listed in Table 4.13-9).

Finding. Based on the results of the background research, survey, and evaluation provided
in the Final EIR, there are no historical resources eligible for listing in the California
Register in the Project area. The residential buildings near the Headquarters-West Annex
site, the residential building at the Chanticleer site, and the SC WWTF were evaluated and
none of the buildings or structures meet the California or National Register criteria and are therefore not historical resources for the purposes of CEQA. As there are no historical resources in the Project area, there would be no direct impact on historical resources.
However, as discussed in Impact 4.13-4, vibration from construction equipment used
during excavation and backfilling could result in cosmetic or other damage to 18 buildings
previously recorded as part of the City of Santa Cruz and City of Capitola historic resources
surveys if large vibratory compactors were operated near the buildings.
As discussed on pages 4.5-22 - 4.5-23, implementation of Mitigation Measure 4.13-3 (Vibration Monitoring for Pipeline Installation in the Vicinity of Historic Buildings) would
reduce the potential for vibration impact on contributory buildings by ensuring that
vibration generated during pipeline construction does not exceed the applied 0.25 in/sec
PPV historic building damage threshold. This would be accomplished through pipeline
siting, vibration monitoring during construction, establishment specific vibration threshold triggers, and requiring alternative construction methods if those threshold triggers are
reached.

With implementation of the mitigation measure, this impact is reduced to a less than
significant level

Pure Water Soquel A-37 ESA /160164

ATTACHMENT 2 - ITEM 2.52

Exhibit A
CEQA Findings of Fact for the Pure Water Soquel: Groundwater Replenishment and Seawater Intrusion Prevention Project

Impact 4.5-2: The Project could cause substantial adverse change in the significance of an archaeological resource, including those determined to be a historical resource defined in Section 15064.5 or a unique archaeological resource defined in PRC 21083.2.

The following mitigation measure within the authority of the Board to impose has been
adopted to address this impact to the extent feasible:

Measure 4.5-2a: Archaeological Research Design and Treatment Plan
Measure 4.5-2b: Cultural Resources Study of the Chanticleer Site.
Measure 4.5-2c: Inadvertent Discovery of Cultural Resources.

Finding. The results of the background research, environmental assessment, and
archaeological surface survey indicate that there are eight prehistoric and/or multicomponent (prehistoric and historic-era) archaeological resources in or immediately adjacent to the Project area. These resources are all located along pipeline alignments, and are not within or adjacent to the nonlinear facilities or construction area for the AWPF and
recharge well sites.

As discussed on pages 4.5-23 - 4.5-26, implementation of Mitigation Measures 4.5-2a
(Archaeological Research Design and Treatment Plan), 4.5-2b (Cultural Resources Study of
the Chanticleer Site), and 4.5-2c (Inadvertent Discovery of Cultural Resources) would reduce
the potential for substantial adverse change in the significance of an archaeological resource, including those determined to be a historical resource defined in Section 15064.5 or a unique archaeological resource defined in PRC 21083.2. Mitigation Measure 4.5-2a would reduce
potential effects by identifying site constituents in the Project area prior to Project
implementation and requiring either avoidance during construction, and/or appropriate
treatment. Mitigation Measure 4.5-2b would reduce potential effects through pre-
construction cultural resources identification study to determine whether previously
unrecorded archaeological resources are present.

With implementation of the mitigation measure, this impact is reduced to a less than
significant level

Impact 4.5-3: The Project could disturb human remains, including those interred outside of dedicated cemeteries

The following mitigation measure within the authority of the Board to impose has been
adopted to address this impact to the extent feasible:

Measure 4.5-3: Inadvertent Discovery of Human Remains.

Finding. Prehistoric archaeological resources may contain human burials. Based on the
background research and surface survey there are locations very near to the Project area
that have been used for human burial purposes. The possibility of encountering human
remains, including those associated with the several prehistoric archaeological resources in

Pure Water Soquel A-38 ESA /160164

ATTACHMENT 2 - ITEM 2.52

Exhibit A

the vicinity of the Project area, cannot be entirely discounted. Project-related disturbance of
human remains would be a significant impact.

As discussed on pages 4.5-26 - 4.5-27, implementation of Mitigation Measure 4.5-3
(Inadvertent Discovery of Cultural Resources) would reduce the potential project-related
disturbance of human remains by establishing protocols and procedures for responding in the event that human remains are identified during ground disturbing activities, including
halting construction, contacting the County Coroner to assess the find, among other
appropriate actions (including contacting the Most Likely Descendant).
With implementation of the mitigation measure, this impact is reduced to a less than
significant level

Impact Category: Energy Conservation
Impact 4.6-1: The Project could use large amounts of fuel or energy in an unnecessary, wasteful, or inefficient manner.

The following mitigation measures within the authority of the Board to impose have been
adopted to address this impact to the extent feasible:

Measure 4.6-1: Construction Equipment Efficiency Plan
Measure 4.3-1b: Idling Restrictions (See Impact 4.3-1 in Air Quality)
Finding. While the overall transportation energy use requirements would not be significant
relative to the overall sales of transportation fuels in the county, construction and
decommissioning activities could result in wasteful or inefficient use of energy if
construction and decommissioning equipment is not well maintained, if equipment is left to
idle when not in use, or if haul trips are not planned efficiently. For all Project components,
the potential for construction and decommissioning to use large amounts of fuel or energy
in a wasteful or inefficient manner is considered a significant impact.

As discussed on pages 4.6-7 - 4.69, implementation of Mitigation Measures 4.6-1
(Construction Equipment Efficiency Plan) and 3.3-1b (Idling Restrictions) would ensure construction activities are conducted in: fuel-efficient manner and minimize idling times for
construction equipment and vehicles.

With implementation of the mitigation measures, this impact is reduced to a less than
significant level

Impact Category: Hazards and Hazardous Materials
Impact 4.9-3: The Project would be located on or adjacent to a site that is included on a list
of hazardous materials sites compiled pursuant to Government Code Section
65962.5 and, as a result, could create a significant hazard to the public or the
environment.

The following mitigation measures within the authority of the Board to impose have been
adopted to address this impact to the extent feasible:

Measure 4.9-3a: Health and Safety Plan

Measure 4.9-3b: Soil Management Plan

Finding. The components of the Project that would be at the SC WWTF and the conveyance
pipelines would be on and adjacent to a number of active and closed hazardous materials
sites. Excavation activities may encounter soil with residual levels of fuels, solvents, and/or
metals that could expose workers, the public, and the environment to hazardous materials,
which would be a significant impact. The Project components that would be at the
Chanticleer Site, the Headquarters West Annex Site, and the recharge and monitoring
wells sites would not be on or adjacent to known hazardous materials sites. This condition
does not mean that there are no unknown contamination issues that may be encountered, given that the properties have long been developed. In addition, although not listed on a regulatory agency list, soil along the rail line is known to have arsenic in some locations at
concentrations that would require disposal as a hazardous waste.

As discussed on pages 4.9-19 - 4.9-21, implementation of Mitigation Measures 4.9-3a
(Health and Safety Plan) and 4.9-3b (Soil Management Plan) would reduce any impacts to a less than significant level by ensuring that workers are provided appropriate training in the recognition and response to encountering hazardous materials, and that plans are in place that provide procedures for the testing, handling, and disposal of hazardous materials.

With implementation of the mitigation measures, this impact is reduced to a less than
significant level

Impact 4.9-4: The Project could impair implementation of or physically interfere with an
adopted emergency response plan or emergency evacuation plan.
The following mitigation measure within the authority of the Board to impose has been
adopted to address this impact to the extent feasible:

Measure 4.15-1: Traffic Control Plan (Pipeline Construction) (Refer to Impact
4.15-1 in Transportation)

Finding. Highway 1 and Soquel Avenue are Key Transportation Routes. Some of the
conveyance pipelines would be constructed within these routes and would require
temporary road closures. The lane closures could interfere with emergency responses or
evacuations placing people at risk.

ATTACHMENT 2 - ITEM 2.52

Exhibit A
CEQA Findings of Fact for the Pure Water Soquel: Groundwater Replenishment and Seawater Intrusion Prevention Project

As discussed on page 4.9-21, implementation of Mitigation Measure 4.15-1 would reduce
any potential impacts by requiring that Traffic Control Plan be prepared and implemented
to ensure that traffic, including emergency vehicles, would be able to flow around
construction zones.

With implementation of the mitigation measures, this impact is reduced to a less than
significant level

Impact Category: Hydrology Resources - Surface Water

Impact 4.11-1: Project construction could result in a violation of water quality standards
and/or waste discharge requirements, substantial additional sources of polluted runoff, or otherwise substantially degrade water quality (p. 4.11- 41-4.11-51).

The following mitigation measure within the authority of the Board to impose has been adopted to address this impact to the extent feasible:

Measure 4.11-1: HDD Pipeline Leak Contingency Measures for Surface Water
Crossings.

Finding. HDD is a trenchless technology where a drill bit fitted with a transmitter is guided
from the drilling machine. The intent of utilizing HDD pipeline installation is to stay far
enough below the bottom of surface water features to avoid having the drilling fluids find a
fissure in the soil, which would create a connection to the river above, resulting in a leak of
drilling fluids, such as Bentonite clay, into surface waters. If such a leak of drilling fluids
occurs, the drilling fluids leaking into a surface water feature could directly impact water
quality, such as by increasing turbidity, and indirectly impact species dependent upon the
resource, such as through impacting aquatic wildlife respiration or degrading local habitat.

As discussed on page 4.11-50, implementation of Mitigation Measure 4.11-1 (HDD Pipeline
Leak Contingency Measures for Surface Water Crossings) would ensure that impacts are
less than significant by including leak prevention, containment, and clean-up requirements
in the event of a leak of HDD drilling fluids to reduce potential impacts to water quality.
With implementation of the mitigation measure, this impact is reduced to a less than
significant level

Impact Category: Noise and Vibration
Impact 4.13-4: The Project could result in exposure of persons to, or generation of,
excessive groundborne vibration (p. 4.13-39-4.13-42).

The following mitigation measure within the authority of the Board to impose has been adopted to address this impact to the extent feasible:
Measure 4.13-4: Vibration Monitoring for Pipeline Installation in the Vicinity of Historic Buildings.

Pure Water Soquel A-41 ESA /160164
CEQA Findings of Fact Page'60 of 442

ATTACHMENT 2 - ITEM 2.52

Exhibit A
CEQA Findings of Fact for the Pure Water Soquel: Groundwater Replenishment and Seawater Intrusion Prevention Project

Finding. Construction of the pipelines would require the use of a vibratory rollers during
soil compaction. As shown in Table 4.13-10, the nearest sensitive receptors to the pipeline
alignments would be exposed to a vibration level as high as approximately 0.210 in/sec
PPV, which would exceed the applied human annoyance threshold of 0.4 in/sec PPV.

Given the relatively minimal building setbacks from the street curbs (which range
anywhere from 8 to 100 feet), and that the pipeline could be installed anywhere within the
road rights-of-way, the use of vibratory rollers during pipeline construction could cause
cosmetic or structural damage to historic buildings. Vibratory rollers operating within 22
feet of a historic building could result in building damage. There are up to 18 buildings that could be located within 22 feet of where vibration rollers would operate during pipeline
construction. Cosmetic or structural damage to historic buildings could result in a
substantial adverse change in their historical status, which would be a significant impact a to
historical resources.

As discussed on page 4.13-39--4.13-42, implementation of Mitigation Measure 4.13-4
(Vibration Monitoring for Pipeline Installation in the Vicinity of Historic Buildings) would
ensure that vibration generated during pipeline construction does not exceed the applied
0.25 in/sec PPV historic building damage threshold. This would be accomplished through
pipeline siting, vibration monitoring during construction, establishment specific vibration
threshold triggers, and requiring alternative construction methods if those threshold
triggers are reached.
With implementation of the mitigation measure, this impact is reduced to a less than
significant level

Impact Category: Transportation
Impact 4.15-1: Closure of travel lanes during pipeline construction could temporarily
reduce roadway capacity and increase traffic delays on area roadways, causing temporary and intermittent conflicts with all modes of travel (p. 4.15-9).

The following mitigation measure within the authority of the Board to impose has been adopted to address this impact to the extent feasible:
Mitigation Measure 4.15-1: Traffic Control Plan (Pipeline Construction)

Finding. As discussed on pages p. 4.15-9-4.15-12, implementation of Mitigation Measure
4.15-1 (Traffic Control Plan - Pipeline Construction) would reduce impacts to a less than
significant level by requiring the development and implementation of a plan that addresses specific traffic related issues, including circulation, truck traffic and congestion, access for
adjacent land uses, maintenance of bicycle and pedestrian access, restoration of roads
impacted through construction, and coordination with emergency response personnel,
among other requirements specified in the measure.

With implementation of the mitigation measure, this impact is reduced to a less than
significant level

Impact 4.15-3: Pipeline construction could cause temporary and intermittent impedance to
access to adjacent roadways and land uses (p. 4-15-14).

The following mitigation measure within the authority of the Board to impose has been
adopted to address this impact to the extent feasible:
Mitigation Measure 4.15-1: Traffic Control Plan (Pipeline Construction)

Finding. The proposed installation of pipelines in roadways would require temporary
closures of travel lanes and may affect the performance of the circulation system to
accommodate all modes of transportation (auto, transit, and non-motorized modes).
As discussed on pages 4.15-14-4.15-15, implementation of Mitigation Measure 4.15-1
(Traffic Control Plans) would reduce the impact to a less than significant level by requiring
that the District or its contractor(s) provide notification to all emergency service providers
prior to lane closures, and detour signs and flaggers would be in place during the lane
closure periods.

With implementation of the mitigation measure, this impact is reduced to a less than
significant level

Impact 4.15-4: Pipeline construction would not substantially impair access to alternative
transportation facilities (public transit, bicycle, or pedestrian facilities),
although it could temporarily decrease the performance of such facilities.

The following mitigation measure within the authority of the Board to impose has been
adopted to address this impact to the extent feasible:

Mitigation Measure 4.15-1: Traffic Control Plan (Pipeline Construction)

Finding. Construction of the proposed treatment facilities, pipelines, and
recharge/monitoring wells would not permanently eliminate or modify alternative
transportation corridors or facilities (e.g., bicycle routes or lanes, bus routes/stops,
sidewalks). Similar to the effects on automobile traffic from pipeline construction activities
(see Impact 4.15-1), temporary closures of travel lanes and sidewalks during Project
construction would temporarily increase delays experienced by riders of public transit, bicyclists and pedestrians. Effects on bicyclists and pedestrians due to temporary increases in traffic volumes associated with construction of treatment facilities, recharge/monitoring
wells, and pipelines, and would be temporary in nature and of limited magnitude, similar to
those described in Impact 4.15-2 for traffic and transit operations.

As discussed on pages 4.15-15-4.15-16, implementation of Mitigation Measure 4.15-1 (Traffic Control Plans), would reduce impacts to a less than significant level by requiring the
District to coordinate with SCMTD (and other regional transportation managers) to

coordinate any potential rerouting or relocation of transit stops, maintain bicycle lanes/
lane widths to accommodate bicycle traffic during construction, or coordinate with the
affected jurisdictions regarding bicycle detours and signage for any lane closures and
provide safe crossings and appropriate signage if construction activities would encroach on
a sidewalk.

With implementation of the mitigation measure, this impact is reduced to a less than
significant level

Impact Category: Tribal Cultural Resources
Impact 4.16-1: The Project could cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of a tribal cultural resource (p. 4.16-3).

The following mitigation measures within the authority of the Board to impose have been
adopted to address this impact to the extent feasible:

Mitigation Measure 4.5-2a: Archaeological Research Design and Treatment Plan
Mitigation Measure 4.5-2b: Cultural Resources Study of the Chanticleer Site
Mitigation Measure 4.5-2c: Inadvertent Discovery of Cultural Resources
Mitigation Measure 4.5-3: Inadvertent Discovery of Human Remains
Finding. The Torres Martinez Desert Cahuilla Indians requested consultation with the
District pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21080.3.1. On September 19, 2018, after,
reviewing information provided by the District in response to the consultation request,
including map depicting the District's service area boundary within which the Project is
proposed, an authorized representative of the Tribe notified the District that the project is
outside of the Tribe's traditional use area. In addition, the Amah Mutsun Tribal Band has
indicated the Project is within the lands of the Awaswas (Northerners), and that there is very little cultural information about this area. Based on this information, as well as the
Northwest Information Center background research and surface survey, there are no
known sacred, ceremonial, or gathering places in the Project area. There may, however, be
archaeological resources and/or human remains that could be considered tribal cultural
resources in the Project area and the Project could have an impact on those known
resources. Further, if archaeological resources or human remains are uncovered during
either the implementation of an Archaeological Research Design and Treatment Plan or
during ground disturbing activities, impacts to tribal cultural resources could be potentially
significant.

As discussed on pages 4.16-3-4.16-4, Mitigation Measures 4.5-2a (Archaeological Research Design and Treatment Plan), 4.5-2b (Cultural Resources Study of the Chanticleer Site), 4.5-
2c (Inadvertent Discovery of Cultural Resources), and 4.5-3 (Inadvertent Discovery of
Human Remains) would apply to archaeological resources and human remains that are
considered tribal cultural resources that are uncovered during either the implementation of
an Archaeological Research Design and Treatment Plan or during ground disturbing

Pure Water Soquel A-44 ESA / 160164

activities. Mitigation Measure 4.5-2a would reduce potential effects by identifying site
constituents in the Project area prior to Project implementation and requiring either
avoidance during construction, and/or appropriate treatment. Mitigation Measure 4.5-2b
would reduce potential effects through a pre-construction cultural resources identification
study to determine whether previously unrecorded archaeological resources are present.
Mitigation Measure 4.5-3 would reduce potential impacts effects by establishing protocols
and procedures for responding in the event that human remains are identified during
ground disturbing activities, including halting construction, contacting the County Coroner
to assess the find, among other appropriate actions (including contacting the Most Likely Descendant). These measures comply with PRC Section 21084.3 through avoidance and
preservation in place where feasible, and provisions for dignified treatment in the event of
discovery.

With implementation of the mitigation measures, this impact is reduced to a less than
significant level

2.3. Significant or Potentially Significant Impacts for which Mitigation Measures Are
Found to Be Infeasible.
Mitigation measures to mitigate, avoid, or substantially lessen the following significant and
potentially significant environmental impacts of the Project have been identified. However, pursuant to Section21081(a)(3) of the Public Resources Code and Section15091(a)(3) of
the CEQA Guidelines, as to each such impact and mitigation measure, the Board, based on
the evidence in the record before it, specifically finds that the mitigation measures are
infeasible. The impact and mitigation measures and the facts supporting the finding of
infeasibility of each mitigation measure are set forth below. Notwithstanding the disclosure
of these impacts and the finding of infeasibility, the Board elects to approve the projects due to the overriding considerations set forth below in Section F, the statement of overriding considerations. There are no Project impacts that would be significant or potentially
significant for which mitigation measures would be infeasible.

2.4. Significant and Unavoidable Impacts.
The following significant and potentially significant environmental impacts of the project
are unavoidable and cannot be mitigated in a manner that would lessen the significant
impact to below the level of significance. Notwithstanding disclosure of these impacts, the Board elects to approve the project due to overriding considerations as set forth below in
Section 7, the statement of overriding considerations.

Impact Category: Noise and Vibration
Impact 4.13-1: Construction of the Project would result in exposure of persons to, or generation of, noise levels in excess of standards established in the local general plans or noise ordinances (Chanticleer Site, Headquarters-West
Annex Site (first 2.5 months of construction activities), Willowbrook Lane

Pure Water Soquel A-45 ESA /160164

Site, and Pipeline Alignments [p. 4.13-18 - 4.13-30; Responses to Comments
p. 4-29 - 4-31)

The following mitigation measures within the authority of the Board to impose have been
adopted to address this impact to the extent feasible:
Mitigation Measure 4.13-1a: Construction Noise Reduction Plan
Mitigation Measure 4.13-1b: Off-site Accommodations for Substantially Affected
Nighttime Receptors.
Finding. Construction activities at the Chanticleer Site, Headquarters-West Annex Site (first
2.5 months of construction activities), Willowbrook Lane Site, and Pipeline Alignments
would expose nearby sensitive receptors to noise levels that would exceed the County of
Santa Cruz construction noise standard of 75 dBA Leq. As discussed on pages 4.13-33- 4.13-
36, implementation of Mitigation Measure 4.13-1a and Mitigation Measure 4.13-1b would
attenuate construction noise levels by at least 5 dB by requiring the District to develop and
implement a Construction Noise Reduction Plan which specifies noise reducing mechanisms
(e.g., maximum physical separation, selection of equipment types, noise barriers, etc.) and
by providing temporary hotel accommodations for all residences within 200 feet of the well
sites during nighttime drilling activities (the contour distance to achieve the applicable
nighttime noise standard). The noise level reductions achievable through Mitigation
Measure 4.13-1a may be greater than dB (e.g., as high as 10 dB or more). However, as the specific locations of construction equipment and their proximity to sensitive receptors remains unknown, the analysis conservatively assumes a 5 dB reduction. With these
measures implemented, Project noise levels would not be reduced below the County of Santa Cruz construction noise standard. In addition, construction activities at the Monterey Avenue Recharge Well Site would occur outside of the allowed hours specified in the City of
Capitola noise ordinance due to 24-hour drilling. Therefore, a significant impact would
occur at these sites. Even with implementation of Mitigation Measures 4.13-1a and 4.13-1b,
Project construction activities at these sites would continue to exceed the County of Santa Cruz and City of Capitola noise standards.

For these reasons, this impact is significant and unavoidable.

Impact 4.13-2: Project construction would result in a substantial temporary or periodic increase in ambient noise levels in the Project vicinity at the Chanticleer
Site, Headquarters-West Annex Site (first 2.5 months of construction activities), Willowbrook Lane Recharge Well Site, Monterey Avenue
Recharge Well Site, and Pipeline Alignments above levels existing without
the Project.

The following mitigation measure within the authority of the Board to impose has been
adopted to address this impact to the extent feasible:
Mitigation Measure 4.13-1a: Construction Noise Reduction Plan

Pure Water Soquel A-46 ESA / 160164
CEQA Findings of Fact Page'65 of 442

ATTACHMENT 2 - ITEM 2.52

Exhibit A
CEQA Findings of Fact for the Pure Water Soquel: Groundwater Replenishment and Seawater Intrusion Prevention Project

Finding. Due to the close proximity between nearby sensitive receptors and the
construction areas at the Chanticleer Site, Headquarters-West Annex Site (first 2.5 months of construction activities), Willowbrook Lane Recharge Well Site, Monterey Avenue
Recharge Well Site, and Pipeline Alignments, Project construction have a significant impact related to a substantial temporary or periodic increase in ambient noise. Implementation of Mitigation Measure 4.13-1a would attenuate construction noise levels by at least 5 dB by
requiring the District to develop and implement a Construction Noise Reduction Plan which
specifies noise reducing mechanisms (e.g., maximum physical separation, selection of
equipment types, noise barriers, etc.). The noise level reductions achievable through
Mitigation Measure 4.13-1a may be greater than 5 dB (e.g., as high as 10 dB or more).
However, as the specific locations of construction equipment and their proximity to
sensitive receptors remains unknown, the analysis conservatively assumes a 5 dB
reduction. Therefore, the noise reductions from Mitigation Measure 4.13-1a would not be
expected to reduce construction noise levels to below either the applied daytime or
nighttime substantial temporary ambient noise increase threshold.

For these reasons, this impact is significant and unavoidable.

Section 3. Cumulative Effects

Cumulative impacts, as defined in Section 15355 of the CEQA Guidelines, refer to two or
more individual effects that, when taken together, are "considerable" or that compound or
increase other environmental impacts. Cumulative impacts can result from individually
minor, but collectively significant, actions when added to the impacts of other closely
related past, present, or reasonably foreseeable future projects. Pertinent guidance for
cumulative impact analysis is provided in Section 15130 of the CEQA Guidelines.

The Final EIR presents the cumulative impact analysis for the Pure Water Soquel Project by environmental resource topic. Each impact discussion in the Final EIR assesses whether the
incremental effects of the Pure Water Soquel Project could combine with similar effects of
one or more of the projects identified in the Final EIR (p.5-4 - 5.5) to cause or contribute to
a significant cumulative effect. If so, the analysis considers whether the incremental contribution of the Pure Water Soquel Project would be cumulatively significant (p. 5-9 -5-
34). The Board hereby finds as follows:

Aesthetics

Impact CU-AES: Implementation of the Project, in combination with past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future development, would not result in a
cumulatively significant impact related to aesthetic resources (p. 5-9 - 5-
10).

Findings. The scope and analysis for cumulative impacts on aesthetic resources
encompasses the locations from which a viewer could see the Project construction or
operations elements along with views of other projects in the cumulative scenario.

Pure Water Soquel A-47 ESA /160164
CEQA Findings of Fact Page'66 of 442

ATTACHMENT 2 - ITEM 2.52

Exhibit A
CEQA Findings of Fact for of the Pure Water Soquel: Groundwater Replenishment and Seawater Intrusion Prevention Project

Construction activities at nearby project sites could be noticeable and visually unappealing,
as seen by users of nearby public spaces. However, construction-phase impacts would
generally be confined in extent to the immediate work areas. In addition, the impacts would
be limited to periods of a few days to weeks along pipeline alignments, and roughly 12 to 36 months at the sites of above-ground facilities. Therefore, the Project's impacts would not combine with those of cumulative projects to result in a substantial degradation of the
visual character or quality of the sites because they would not permanently and/or
substantially alter scenic resources or the aesthetic character of the Project area. The
impact would be less than significant.

Projects in the cumulative scenario would have post-construction impacts that would occur
in proximity to those of the Project. Project components at the SC WWTF would be visually
consistent with the other existing facilities on site and not conspicuous from public areas
beyond, including the adjacent La Barranca Park. As the Chanticleer Site is not scenic in nature and is in an area of low visual sensitivity, and given the proposed and cumulative
project components would be compatible with the aesthetic character of the surrounding
built environment, the combined effect would be less than significant.

The Project would not utilize equipment, building materials, or building finishes that would
be substantial sources of glare. Permanent security lighting would be installed at the
Chanticleer or Headquarters-West Annex Sites. The light and glare from cumulative projects
would not combine to cause a nuisance or hazard condition, and the cumulative effect
would be less than significant.

Air Quality
Impact CU-AQ: Implementation of the Project, in combination with past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future development, would not result in a
cumulatively significant impact related to air quality (p. 5-11)
Findings. The geographic scope of analysis for potential cumulative air quality impacts is the North Central Coast Air Basin (Air Basin). The air basin does not attain the State
standards for ozone or PM10; however, it attains (or is unclassified for) all federal standards.
Therefore, existing conditions in the Air Basin are considered to be cumulatively significant
with respect to attaining the State standards for ozone and PM10.

Construction - With regard to emissions of reactive organic compounds (ROG), carbon
monoxide (CO), and particulate matter (both PM10 and PM25), Project emissions would be
below the established MBARD thresholds; therefore, the Project's incremental contribution
of construction-related ROG, CO, PM10, and PM2s emissions would not be considerable.
Because the MBARD thresholds are established to address cumulative emissions within the
Air Basin, Project conformance with the established threshold necessarily means it would
not contribute to a cumulatively significant impact related to short-term construction
emissions. The cumulative effect would be less than significant.
With regard to impacts on sensitive receptors, the total diesel particulate matter (DPM) from
on-site equipment that would be required to construct Project components would be limited

Pure Water Soquel A-48 ESA / 160164
CEQA Findings of Fact Page'67 of 442

ATTACHMENT 2 - ITEM 2.52

Exhibit A

to between several days and 36 months, depending on the specific facility. Given the distances
between sensitive receptors and the Project and cumulative project sites, along with the
duration and intensity of these projects' emissions generating activities, the combined effects
of the Project's and cumulative projects' construction would not result in long-term or
concentrated exposure of sensitive receptors to TAC emissions. As a result, the cumulative
effect would be less than significant.

Project construction would result in diesel emissions-based odors, which would result in a
negligible and short-term effect on nearby sensitive receptors. No projects in the cumulative
scenario would have operations that would create objectionable odors in the vicinity of the
Headquarters-West Annex site, such that a cumulatively significant impact related to odors
could result. As a result, the Project would have a less-than-significant cumulative effect
related to odors.

Operations - Pursuant to MBARD CEQA Guidelines, a project's operational emissions would result in significant cumulative impact if they exceed adopted significance thresholds. As
discussed in Impacts 4.3-2, Project operations would not cause emissions that would exceed
the MBARD significance thresholds. Therefore, the Project would not be cumulatively
considerable and would have a less-than-significant cumulative impact related to emissions
of criteria pollutants.

With regard to impacts on sensitive receptors, there would be no on-site DPM emissions
from Project operation. As such, the project would not be cumulatively considerable and there would be no cumulative impact.

Biological Resources
Impact CU-BIO: Implementation of the Project, in combination with past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future development, would not result in a
cumulatively significant impact related to biological resources (p. 5-13).

Findings. The geographic scope of potential cumulative impacts on biological resources
encompasses the Project site as well as biologically linked areas sharing the watersheds (e.g., San Lorenzo River, Soquel Creek) in the vicinity. The Project would occur primarily
within existing developed or previously disturbed areas that do not provide substantial
habitat value locally or regionally. Nonetheless, with implementation of mitigation
measures, and adherence to the environmental regulatory permitting requirements, the
residual effects of the Project on biological resources would not be expected to combine
with impacts of other projects in the cumulative scenario to cause a substantial adverse
effect on special-status plants and wildlife, sensitive natural communities, wetlands and
riparian areas, or wildlife movement corridors. Further given the nature of the Project sites,
along with the Project's residual (post-mitigation) environmental effect, when considered in
the broader context of biological resources in the study area and the greater Monterey Bay
Area, the project would not result in a cumulatively considerable contribution to habitat
loss, degradation, and direct and indirect impacts to special-status species

Pure Water Soquel A-49 ESA / 160164
CEQA Findings of Fact Page'68 of 442

ATTACHMENT 2 - ITEM 2.52

Exhibit A
CEQA Findings of Fact for the Pure Water Soquel: Groundwater Replenishment and Seawater Intrusion Prevention Project

The project's contribution to cumulative biological resources impacts would be less than
significant.

Cultural Resources

Impact CU-CUL: Implementation of the Project, in combination with past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future development, would not result in a cumulatively significant impact related to historical resources, archaeological resources, or human remains (p. 5-14).

Findings. The geographic scope of analysis for cumulative impacts on historical resources,
archaeological resources, and human remains encompasses the northern Monterey Bay Area
including the cities of Santa Cruz, Soquel, and Capitola. There are no known historic
architectural resources that qualify as historical resources in the Project area; therefore, the
Project would not contribute to a significant cumulative effect on architectural historical
resources. Indirect impacts related to vibration during construction would be mitigated to a
less-than-significant level via implementation of Mitigation Measure 4.13-4, alternative
construction methods and/or monitoring to ensure construction vibration is below the 0.25
inches per second (in/sec) peak particle velocity vibration (PPV) threshold. There are numerous archaeological resources in the Project area that are considered historical
resources. Project construction would have the potential to affect known and unknown
archaeological resources. While portions of the project area have been studied, buried or
otherwise obscured, resources may still exist within the Project area. Accordingly, depending
upon the extent of the resource, the potential for the Project and cumulative projects to affect
the same undiscovered archaeological resource cannot be entirely discounted.

Through compliance with applicable regulations and implementation of associated
avoidance and minimization measures, the Project would not have a considerable
contribution to adverse effects on cultural resources of the region. This cumulative impact
would be less than significant with mitigation.

Energy Conservation
Impact CU-ENE: Implementation of the Project, in combination with past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future development, would not result in a
cumulatively significant impact related to energy conservation (p. 5-15).
Findings. Cumulative impacts associated with energy conservation are considered in the
context of both local and regional energy supply and demand. The Project would have no
impact related to conflicting with energy standards. Therefore, it would not contribute to
cumulative impacts related to these topics.

Project construction could use large amounts of fuel or energy, which in the context of local
and regional energy supplies, in combination with the energy demands of the cumulative projects could result in a significant cumulative impact if not used efficiently. Mitigation Measures 4.6-1 ad 4.31b as identified in Impact 4.6-1 would help improve the fuel
efficiency of and limit idling times for construction equipment.

Pure Water Soquel A-50 ESA / 160164
CEQA Findings of Fact Page'69 of 442

ATTACHMENT 2 - ITEM 2.52

Exhibit A
CEQA Findings of Fact for the Pure Water Soquel: Groundwater Replenishment and Seawater Intrusion Prevention Project

In the event that many other cumulative projects that would be high demand electricity users, additional wholesale electric energy may need to be purchased by MBCP. In addition, some reinforcement or upgrades of the existing distribution system may also be required,
but this would not substantially constrain local or regional energy supplies. Therefore, the Project would have a less-than-significant with mitigation contribution to the cumulative
impact associated with the unnecessary, wasteful, or inefficient use of energy, or with
energy supply, either at a local or regional level, during operation.

Geology and Paleontology
Impact CU-GEO: Implementation of the Project, in combination with past, present, and
reasonably foreseeable future development, would not result in a
cumulatively significant impact related to geology and paleontology (p. 5-
16).

Findings. The geographic scope for potential cumulative geologic and seismic impacts
consists of the Project component locations and the immediate vicinity. The Project could
contribute to cumulative geology, soils, and seismicity effects if it's effects overlapped in
time and space with those of one or more cumulative projects. Significant cumulative
impacts related to geologic hazards could occur if the incremental impacts of the Project
combined with the incremental impacts of a cumulative project would substantially
increase the risk that people or the environment would be exposed to geologic, seismic, and soils hazards. The Project would have no impact with respect to being on an active fault or
in areas susceptible to landslides, subsidence or collapse; loss of topsoil; the use of septic
tanks or alternative wastewater disposal systems; or being in areas with unique
paleontological or unique geological resources.

There are numerous cumulative projects that would be near or adjacent to the Project that
could be constructed at the same time, which could cause significant cumulative erosion
effects. However, the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)
Construction General Permit (CGP) would require each project involving disturbance of one
acre or more of land to prepare and implement a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan
(SWPPP). Thus, even if the runoff waters were to combine after leaving the cumulative
project sites, the sediments and/or pollutants in the combined runoff would still be at
concentrations (amount of sediment or pollutants per volume of runoff water) below action
levels and would not combine to be cumulatively significant. Therefore, the Project would
have a less-than-significant contribution to a cumulative impact with respect to soil
erosion.

Seismically induced groundshaking, liquefaction and lateral spreading, and expansive or
corrosive soils could cause structural damage or pipeline leaks or ruptures during
construction and operations phases. However, State and local building regulations and standards have been established to address and reduce the potential for such impacts to
occur. The Project and cumulative projects would be required to comply with the same
applicable provisions of these laws and regulations. Based on compliance with these
requirements, the incremental impacts of the Project, combined with impacts of other
projects in the area would not combine to cause a significant cumulative impact related to

Pure Water Soquel A-51 ESA / 160164
CEQA Findings of Fact Page'70 of 442

ATTACHMENT 2 - ITEM 2.52

Exhibit A
CEQA Findings of Fact for the Pure Water Soquel: Groundwater Replenlshment and Seawater Intrusion Prevention Project

seismically induced groundshaking, liquefaction and lateral spreading, or expansive or
corrosive soils. Therefore, the Project would have a less-than-significant contribution to a
cumulative effect.

Greenhouse Gas Emissions

Impact CU-GHG: Implementation of the Project, in combination with past, present, and
reasonably foreseeable future development, would not result in a
cumulatively significant impact related to greenhouse gas emissions (p. 5-
18).

Findings. Because greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have global climate change
implications, the evaluation of GHG emissions impacts is inherently a cumulative impact
analysis. The amortized construction and operational emissions that would be associated
with the Project would be approximately 406 metric tons CO2e per year, which would result
in a less-than-significant impact and a less-than-significant contribution to the overall
significant cumulative impact associated with climate change. Therefore, the Project's
incremental contribution to the cumulative climate change impact related to GHG emissions
would be less than significant.

Hazardous Materials

Impact CU-HAZ: Implementation of the Project, in combination with past, present, and
reasonably foreseeable future development, would not result in a
cumulatively significant impact related to hazards and hazardous
materials (p. 5-18).

Findings. The geographic scope of analysis for cumulative hazards and hazardous materials
impacts encompasses and is limited to the Project site and its immediately adjacent area.

The Project would have no impact with respect to being within 2 miles of a private airstrip
or wildland fire hazards. Accordingly, the Project could not contribute to cumulative
impacts related to these topics.

Construction • There are numerous projects in the cumulative scenario near or adjacent to
the Project that could be constructed at the same time, Each project would be subject to the
same regulatory requirements, including the implementation of health and safety plans and soil and groundwater management plans, as needed. Therefore, while it is possible that the project and cumulative projects could result in releases of hazardous materials at the same location and time, the responsible party associated with each spill would be required to
remediate site conditions to the same established regulatory standards. The potential
residual effects of the project that would remain after compliance with regulatory
requirements would not combine with the potential residual effects of cumulative projects
to cause a significant cumulative impact because residual impacts would be highly site-
specific. Accordingly, no substantial cumulative impact with respect to the use of hazardous
materials would result. For these reasons, the Project would have a less-than-significant

Pure Water Soquel A-52 ESA / 160164
CEQA Findings of Fact Pagé'71 of 442

ATTACHMENT 2 - ITEM 2.52

Exhibit A

contribution to a cumulative impact with respect to hazards and hazardous materials
during construction.

As with the Project, cumulative projects could also require temporary lane closures that could interfere with emergency plans or routes, which would be significant cumulative impact. However, similar to the Project, cumulative projects that require temporary lane closures would also be required by the local agency with jurisdiction to implement traffic control plans to flow around construction zones. Therefore, the Project would have a less-
than-significant contribution to a cumulative impact with respect to emergency plans or
routes.

Operation During operation, the Project and several projects in the cumulative scenario
would require the transport, use, storage, and disposal of chemicals that may be hazardous.
All project facilities involving the transport, use, storage, and disposal of hazardous
materials would be required to prepare and implement a Hazardous Materials Business
Plan and comply with applicable regulations, including those governing containment, site
layout, and emergency response and notification procedures in the event of a spill or release. Transportation and disposal of wastes, such as spent cleaning solutions, would also
be subject to regulations for the safe handling, transportation, and disposal of chemicals and wastes. Therefore, the combined effects of the project and other cumulative projects would
not be cumulatively significant; the Project would have a less-than-significant contribution to a cumulative impact regarding hazards and hazardous materials during operation.

Hydrology Resources - Groundwater
Impact CU-HYD-GW: Implementation of the Project, in combination with past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future development, would not result in a cumulatively significant impact related to groundwater resources
(p. 5-20).
Findings. The geographic scope for the cumulative analysis of groundwater resources
includes the entire Santa Cruz Mid-County Groundwater Basin (basin). The geographic
scope of this analysis also includes a vertical element, because other cumulative projects
could affect the groundwater levels in the subsurface aquifers.
Because construction and development of production and monitoring wells proposed by the
Project are temporary operations that do not require substantial quantities of groundwater
or degrade aquifer groundwater quality, Project-related construction-phase effects are not
considered to be cumulatively significant in nature or extent and thus would be less than
significant.

Generally, the cumulative groundwater resource management projects are intended to
improve groundwater conditions by recharging aquifer levels and/or by reducing the
groundwater pumping. None of the cumulative projects propose to extract additional groundwater that would lead to overdraft or operate in a manner that results in depressed groundwater levels or the exacerbation of seawater intrusion. Additionally, the cumulative
projects, especially those that would recharge the groundwater aquifers through surface

Pure Water Soquel A-53 ESA /160164

ATTACHMENT 2 - ITEM 2.52

Exhibit A

water infiltration, must comply with applicable state groundwater regulations and would
not contribute to the degradation of groundwater quality. The Project's objectives include helping replenish the groundwater basin and preventing seawater intrusion, while allowing
the District to meet its water demand. Although the Project and the cumulative projects may be in different geographical areas, could affect different basins and aquifers, and occur either simultaneously or at different times; their collective implementation could improve
groundwater resources to some degree in the Santa Cruz Mid-County and Pajaro Valley
Basins and, thus, cumulatively, the effect would be beneficial to water resources.

Hydrology - Surface Water

Impact CU-HYD: Implementation of the Project, in combination with past, present, and
reasonably foreseeable future development, would not result in a cumulatively significant impact related to hydrology resources and
surface water quality (p. 5-22).

Findings. The geographic scope for potential cumulative hydrology and water quality
impacts consists of the Project area and surrounding watershed lands as well as marine
waters in Monterey Bay.

Construction - Construction activities associated with the Project could result in the
degradation of water quality from increased soil erosion and associated sedimentation of
water bodies due to stormwater runoff, as well as accidental releases of hazardous
materials. In addition, discharges of dewatering effluent from excavated areas and
disinfectant from pipelines could adversely affect water quality. Most of the cumulative
projects that are presently under construction or planned for construction involve
excavation and use of heavy equipment during construction. With adherence to the
mandatory and non-discretionary regulatory requirements, the effects of the Project would
not combine with those of cumulative projects to cause a cumulatively significant water
quality impact from increased soil erosion and sedimentation, or inadvertent releases of
toxic chemicals during general construction activities. Therefore, no overall cumulatively
significant effect would occur and the Project would have a less-than-significant
contribution to a cumulative effect.

Operations - Project would be required to demonstrate compliance with the City's MS4
permit for all onshore Project components. Operation of several cumulative projects have
the potential to adversely affect stormwater hydrology and quality, and would be required
to implement the same MS4 stormwater program actions as the Project. All Project
conveyance pipelines would be buried underground, except where pipes are proposed to
span existing bridges, and upon completion of installation, surface conditions would be
restored to pre-construction conditions. The residual effects of the Project that would
remain after compliance with regulatory requirements would not combine with the
potential residual effects of cumulative projects to cause a substantial adverse effect on surface hydrology or water quality. The Project, therefore, would have a less-than- significant contribution to a cumulative impact related to Project operations.

The cumulative projects whose discharge impacts could combine with those of the Project
to adversely affect Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary water quality which could
affect SC WWTF treatment demands and effluent discharges or otherwise involve direct
discharges to the ocean. Assessment of the Project brine discharge from the outfall indicates
that operational discharges would conform to NPDES effluent limitations, which
incorporate Ocean Plan Water Quality Objectives (WQ0s). Direct outfall discharges from
cumulative projects would be at sufficient distances such that the likelihood of discharge
plumes from different outfalls intersecting or merging and resulting in exceedances of
established water quality objectives or adversely affecting beneficial uses of receiving waters (MBNMS) would be low. Further, the effects of Project operations on SC WWTF effluent would be regulated by the water quality requirements of the SC WWTF'S operational NPDES Permit. Similarly, the effects of projects within the cumulative scenario
on SC WWTF's effluent would also be subject to the water quality requirements of the same
NPDES permit system, administered by the CCRWQCB. With mandatory compliance with
the regulatory requirements and the NPDES effluent limitations, effluent from the Project
and those in the cumulative scenario would not combine to cause substantial adverse water
quality effects. The Project therefore would have a less-than-significant contribution to a
cumulative impact related to operational discharges.
The Project would require site disturbance in a manner that could alter drainage patterns
and increase impervious surface area. Implementation of the Project would not represent a
substantial land use change within the geographic scope when combined with the projects
identified in Table 5-1 as compared to current conditions at the Project sites and in the
surrounding area. Stormwater requirements under the MS4 permit are part of a regional
program designed to address the potential cumulative effects of past, present, and
foreseeable projects within the region. Adherence to these requirements would ensure
hydrology and water quality effects related to the alteration of drainage patterns would not
cause a significant cumulative impact. The Project, therefore, would have a less-than-
significant contribution to a cumulative impact related to alteration of drainage patterns.
The Project would not involve the siting of facilities in locations within or near areas subject
to inundation due to 100-year flooding, tsunami, dam or levee failure related inundation
zones or coastal flooding, including as a result of sea level rise with the exception of
facilities proposed within the existing SC WWTF Site and small portions of the conveyance
pipelines. Some of the cumulative projects identified could be subject to adverse effects
related to flooding, which include the effects of tsunamis, and/or sea level rise, but for the
above reasons are not geographically relevant to the cumulative analysis. Thus, the Project
would not combine with projects in the cumulative scenario to cause a significant
cumulative impact related to flooding or flood hazards. The Project, therefore, would have a
less-than-significant contribution to a cumulative impact related to flooding.

Land Use and Recreation

Impact CU-LU: Implementation of the Project, in combination with past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future development, would not result in a

Pure Water Soquel A-55 ESA / 160164
CEQA Findings of Fact Page 74 of 442

ATTACHMENT 2 - ITEM 2.52

Exhibit A
CEQA Findings of Fact for the Pure Water Soquel: Groundwater Replenishment and Seawater Intrusion Prevention Project

cumulatively significant impact related to land use and recreation (p. 5-
25).

Findings. The geographic scope for cumulative impact analysis related to land use and recreation consists of the lands and recreational resources that would be affected by the
project.

The Project would not divide an established community, increase the use of existing
neighborhood parks or other recreational facilities, or include or require the construction of
recreational facilities. Therefore, the Project could not cause or contribute to any cumulative impact related to these issues. The Project components would not conflict with applicable plans, policies, or regulations of the jurisdictions in which they are proposed.
While it is possible that other cumulative projects could conflict with such requirements,
the Project would not be expected to cause or contribute to any such conflicts. The
combined effects of the Project and other cumulative projects would, therefore, not be
cumulatively significant and the Project would have a less-than-significant contribution to
a cumulative impact related to land use and recreation.

Noise and Vibration

Impact CU-NOI: Implementation of the Project, in combination with past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future development, could result in a cumulatively significant impact related to noise and vibration.

Finding: The geographic context for cumulative changes in the noise and vibration
environment include residential and commercial areas of unincorporated areas of Santa
Cruz County, as well as the cities of Santa Cruz and Capitola.

In order for a cumulative vibration impact to occur, equipment used to construct the Project would have to operate within at least 100 feet of a neighboring cumulative project's
construction equipment, at the same time.

Application of recommended mitigation (Mitigation Measure 4.13-4) would reduce the
potential for Project vibration that could result in building damage. The measure calls for
monitoring of ambient vibration levels, and work stoppage if levels exceed the building
damage threshold. With application of this measure, Project work would not be able to proceed if its individual or cumulative contribution to vibration impacts caused an
exceedance of the threshold. Therefore, the Project would not to contribute substantially to
a significant cumulative impact related to construction vibration. The cumulative effect
related to Project construction would be less than significant with mitigation.
Project operations would not be expected to generate substantial permanent increases in
ambient noise levels, above those without the Project, or otherwise expose nearby sensitive
receptors to noise levels that could exceed noise standards. None of the projects identified in the cumulative scenario would be located in proximity to a Project site that would have
operational noise and themselves be expected to generate substantial sources of
operational noise. Therefore, a cumulatively significant operational noise impact would not

CEQA Findings of Fact Page 75 of 442

ATTACHMENT 2 - ITEM 2.52

Exhibit A

be expected, and the Project's contribution to cumulative operational noise impacts would
be less than significant.

Impact CU-NOI: Implementation of the Project, in combination with past, present, and
reasonably foreseeable future development, could result in a
cumulatively significant impact related to noise and vibration (p. 5-26)

Finding. The geographic context for cumulative changes in the noise and vibration
environment include residential and commercial areas of unincorporated areas of Santa
Cruz County, as well as the cities of Santa Cruz and Capitola. Construction activities would
expose nearby sensitive receptors to noise levels that could exceed noise standards found in
the County of Santa Cruz noise ordinance and result in a substantial temporary noise
increase after application of available mitigation at the Chanticleer Site, Headquarters-West Annex Site, Willowbrook Lane Site and along pipeline routes (see Impact 4.13-1).
Construction activities would also result in temporary or periodic increases in ambient
noise levels, above those existing without the Project. Specifically, sensitive receptors in the vicinities of the Chanticleer Site, Headquarters-West Annex Site, Monterey Avenue Recharge
Well Site and along Pipeline routes could be exposed to substantial temporary or periodic
noise (1.e., above 75dBA), after application of available mitigation (see Impact 4.13-2)

Although construction noise is temporary in nature, it is reasonably foreseeable that
construction of the Project and one or more nearby cumulative projects could occur
simultaneously. Noise resulting from simultaneous construction of these projects could
result in a significant cumulative impact on sensitive receptors in the vicinity of the above- referenced sites. Given its size and scale, Project construction activities could have a cumulatively significant contribution to the impact. Application of recommended mitigation
identified in Section 4.13 (Mitigation Measures 4.13-1a, 4.13-1b) would reduce
construction noise exposure at nearby sensitive receptors by requiring the District to
develop and implement a Construction Noise Reduction Plan which specifies noise reducing
mechanisms (e.g., maximum physical separation, selection of equipment types, noise
barriers, etc.) and by providing temporary hotel accommodations for all residences within
200 feet of the well sites during nighttime drilling activities (the contour distance to achieve
the applicable nighttime noise standard). The noise level reductions achievable through
Mitigation Measure 4.13-1a may be greater than the 5 dB assumed in the EIR (e.g., as high as
10 dB or more). However, as the specific locations of construction equipment and their
proximity to sensitive receptors remains unknown, the analysis conservatively assumes a 5
dB reduction. For this reason, and due to the close proximally between Project construction sites and nearby sensitive receptors, it is unlikely that any additional construction noise
reduction measures would be capable of further mitigating cumulative construction noise levels to levels that would meet the identified thresholds. Therefore, the Project's
contribution to a cumulative impact related to construction noise would be significant and
unavoidable.

Population and Housing
Impact CU-POP: Implementation of the Project, in combination with past, present, and
reasonably foreseeable future development, would not result in a
cumulatively significant impact related to population and housing (p. 5-
27).

Findings. The geographic scope for the analysis of direct cumulative population and housing impacts during Project construction and operation is the Project area and the
broader Monterey Bay region (i.e., counties of Santa Cruz, San Benito, and Monterey).

The Project would have no impact related to the displacement of substantial numbers of housing units or people. Therefore, the Project would not cause or contribute to a cumulative impact associated with the displacement of housing units or people that would
necessitate the construction of replacement housing.

Because of the limited duration of construction jobs and the size of the regional
construction workforce, the construction workforce in Monterey, San Benito, and Santa Cruz counties is expected to be capable of accommodating cumulative project demand for construction labor. The cumulative impact of Project construction would not be
cumulatively considerable and would be less than significant.
Operation of the Project and those in the cumulative scenario would increase demand for
permanent employees for Project operations. Due to the nature of these jobs, it is assumed that most employees would be sourced from the local or regional labor pool. The effects of
the Project would not be expected to combine with those of projects in the cumulative
scenario to create a substantial adverse effect related to population or housing in the
Project area or the broader region. The Project's contribution to these effects would,
therefore, be less than significant.

Transportation

Impact CU-TRA: Implementation of the Project, in combination with past, present, and
reasonably foreseeable future development, could result in a
cumulatively significant impact related to transportation and traffic (p.
5-29)

The following mitigation measure within the authority of the Board to impose has been
adopted to address this impact to the extent feasible:
Mitigation Measure CU-TRA-1: Construction Traffic Coordination Plan.

Finding. The geographic scope for cumulative traffic impacts analysis encompasses the
local and regional roadways and highways that would be used for Project-related
construction and operational activities and for access by construction worker and full-time
employee vehicles.

Pure Water Soquel A-58 ESA / 160164
CEQA Findings of Fact Paäé'77 of 442

ATTACHMENT 2 - ITEM 2.52

Exhibit A
CEQA FIndings of Fact for the Pure Water Soquel: Groundwater Replenishment and Seawater Intrusion Prevention Project

The Project would result in no impact with respect to conflicts with an applicable
congestion management plan, changes in air traffic patterns, permanent increases in traffic
a safety hazards due to a design feature or incompatible uses, or conflicts with adopted
policies, plans, or programs regarding public transit, bicycle, or pedestrian facilities.
Therefore, it could not cause or contribute to any cumulative effect related to these traffic
and transportation topics (No Impact).

The Project would have less-than-significant long-term traffic increases on regional and
local roadways during Project operations and maintenance. A significant cumulative impact
associated with long-term traffic increases would occur if the traffic or transportation-
related effects of Project operations combined with those of one or more of the cumulative
projects to cause traffic on local and regional roadways to exceed established level of
service standards. However, the addition of traffic associated with Project operation and maintenance would be negligible and, therefore, not contribute cumulatively considerably
to those impacts. As a result, the Project would have a less-than-significant incremental
contribution to cumulative operations-related traffic.

The Project's significant impact related to increased congestion from construction traffic
would be reduced to less-than-significant levels with the implementation of mitigation. Due
to increased traffic and transportation network disruptions, concurrent construction of the
Project and the cumulative projects could result in potentially significant cumulative
impacts on traffic and transportation access and facilities.
As discussed on pages 5-29-5-31, implementation of Mitigation Measure CU-TRA-1
(Construction Traffic Coordination Plan) would reduce the Project's incremental contribution to construction-related traffic and transportation impacts by requiring the development and implementation of a plan, in coordination with local planning agencies
with jurisdiction, that considers other planned projects in the region, their anticipated vehicle use and timing, and routes, among other elements identified in the measure, such
that it would not be cumulatively considerable with the implementation of mitigation.

With implementation of the mitigation measure, this impact is reduced to a less than
significant level

Tribal Cultural Resources

Impact CU-TRI: Implementation of the Project, in combination with past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future development would not result in a cumulatively significant impact related to tribal cultural resources (p. 5-
31).

Findings. The geographic scope for cumulative effects on tribal cultural resources consists of the northern Monterey Bay Area including the cities of Santa Cruz, Soquel, and Capitola.
This area was selected because of the similar themes of its Native American use and
associated prehistoric resources.

The Torres Martinez Desert Cahuilla Indians requested consultation with the District
pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21080.3.1. On September 19, 2018, after
reviewing information provided by the District in response to the consultation request, including a map depicting the District's service area boundary within which the Project is
proposed, an authorized representative of the Tribe notified the District that the project is
outside of the Tribe's traditional use area. In addition, the Amah Mutsun Tribal Band has
indicated the Project is within the lands of the Awaswas (Northerners), and that there is
very little cultural information about this area. While there are no known sacred,
ceremonial, or gathering places in the Project area, Project construction has potential to
affect known and unknown archaeological resources that may be tribal cultural resources.
depending upon the extent of the resource, the potential for the Project and cumulative
projects to affect the same undiscovered tribal cultural resource cannot be entirely
discounted.

All development in the geographic scope would be required to comply with the same
provisions of CEQA and the California Public Resources Code, and implement measures (i.e.,
Mitigation Measure 4.5-2a-4.5-2c and Mitigation Measure 4.5-3). These measures would
provide for advance planning around areas of known archaeological resources, pre-
construction assessment to identify potential archaeological sites within a project area, and
protocols for responding in the event of inadvertent discovery of archaeological resources
or human remains. These measures comply with PRC Section 21084.3 through avoidance
and preservation in place where feasible, and provisions for dignified treatment in the event of discovery. Accordingly, this cumulative impact on tribal cultural resources would be less
than significant.

Utilities

Impact CU-UTL: Implementation of the Project, in combination with past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future development, would not result in a
cumulatively significant impact related to utilities including water,
wastewater, and solid waste (p. 5-32).
Finding. The geographic scope for cumulative utilities systems impacts consists of the
service areas of utility providers for wastewater treatment, water treatment, stormwater
drainage, water supply, and solid waste landfill needs.

Project construction and operation would generate wastewater streams that would be
disposed via storm drain, sanitary sewer, and/or the SC WWTF existing ocean outfall.
Several of the cumulative projects that are in the immediate Project vicinity would have
similar types of wastewater generation and disposal requirements. Through adherence to
these mandatory requirements, the combined wastewater streams generated by the Project and other projects in the cumulative scenario would not be expected to cause a substantial adverse effect related to water treatment requirements or capacity. Therefore, the Project's
cumulative contribution to water treatment and capacity impacts would be less than
significant.

CEQA Findings of Fact Page 79 of 442

ATTACHMENT 2 - ITEM 2.52

Exhibit A
CEQA Findings of Fact for the Pure Water Soquel: Groundwater Replenishment and Seawater Intrusion Prevention Project

Project construction water would be provided by the District and can be adequately
supplied with its existing available water supply. As the water would be produced by the
District, Project construction water needs would not affect the ability of other projects in
the cumulative scenario to obtain water such that new or expanded entitlements would be
required. Project operations would utilize sourcewater effluent from the SC WWTF, which
would be purified and used to supplement the District's existing water supply. While other
Projects in the cumulative scenario could involve new or expanded water demands, the
Project would have a beneficial effect with respect to water supply through groundwater
replenishment. Therefore, the Project would have a less-than-significant cumulative effect
with respect to available water supply.

Construction of the Project would generate an estimated 142,000 cubic yards of excess
spoils and construction debris and a negligible amount of operational wastes.
Conservatively assuming all Project construction waste would be disposed at the Buena Vista Landfill, the Project would not have a cumulatively considerable effect on remaining
landfill capacity (i.e., 0.6 percent). Cumulative projects would also be expected to generate
construction waste that would also require disposal, possibly at the same landfill. Through
adherence to regulatory requirements, the amount of solid waste generated by the Project
and cumulative projects would be substantially reduced and, therefore, would not be
expected to have a cumulatively significant effect with respect to landfill capacity or compliance with solid waste statutes. The Project's cumulative contribution to this impact
would be less than significant.

Section 4. Alternatives

The Board has considered the project alternatives presented and analyzed in the Final EIR
and presented during the comment period and public hearing process. Some of these alternatives have the potential to avoid or reduce certain significant or potentially
significant environmental impacts, as set forth below. The Board finds, based on specific economic, legal, social, technological, or other considerations, that these alternatives are infeasible. Based on the impacts identified in the Final EIR and other reasons summarized below, and as supported by substantial evidence in the record, the Board finds that approval and implementation of the Project as proposed is the most desirable, feasible, and
appropriate action and hereby rejects the other alternatives and other combinations and/or variations of alternatives as infeasible based on consideration of the relevant factors set
forth in CEQA Guidelines Section 15126.6, subdivision (f). (See also CEQA Guidelines,
Section15091, subdivision(a)(3).) Each alternative and the facts supporting the finding of
infeasibility of each alternative are set forth below.

Alternatives Considered and Dismissed from Further Consideration

The alternatives described below were rejected for further consideration and analysis
because they failed to meet most of the basic project objectives, were determined to be
infeasible, and/or would not avoid or substantially lessen significant environmental impacts
(p 7-24 - 7-35).

ATTACHMENT 2 - ITEM 2.52

Exhibit/
CEQA Findings of Fact or the Pure Water Soquel: Groundwater Replenishment and Seawater Intrusion Prevention Project

Develop Project at Other Site Locations: Under this alternative, the District would
construct an AWPF at a site other than those considered as part of the Project (SC WWTF,
Chanticleer, or Headquarters-West Annex). Under this alternative, secondary-treated SC
WWTF effluent (sourcewater) would be conveyed via a new pipeline to an AWPF at one of
the alternative sites for purification. Brine concentrate would be routed via dedicate brine concentrate pipeline from the AWPF back to the SC WWTF for disposal via existing ocean outfall. The pipelines between the SC WWTF and AWPF would follow the same alignment. Purified water would be conveyed via dedicated purified water pipeline from the AWPF to
new recharge wells at Monterey Avenue, Willowbrook Lane, or the Cabrillo College Drive
area.

This alternative would meet the project objectives, but was rejected due to increased
construction and operations impacts, inability to secure site control, and insufficient space
to accommodate the facility.

Develop Project with Other Treatment Technology: Under this alternative, the District
would construct an AWPF with membrane bioreactor technology (MBR-AWPF), capable of
advanced purification of raw municipal wastewater, at the Headquarters-West Annex site.
The District would also construct a new source water pump station and main to convey raw
wastewater from the existing force main at the Soquel Pump Station to the Headquarters-
West Annex Site for MBR plus advanced purification. Brine/RO concentrate would be
conveyed via new dedicated pipeline to the SCCSD collection system, into which it would
discharge brine concentrate for treatment at the SC WWTF. Purified water would be
conveyed via new dedicated purified water pipeline from the AWPF to new recharge wells
at Monterey Avenue, Willowbrook Lane, or the Cabrillo College Drive area.
This alternative would meet project objectives, but was rejected as this alternative would
not reduce or avoid a significant impact of the Project and would increase some
construction and operations impacts at the purification facility location. Furthermore,
operational impacts associated with MBR-AWPF were raised during CEQA scoping for the Project; resulting in a request by the District Board of Directors to discontinue planning efforts associated with potential use of raw wastewater from the Santa Cruz County
Sanitation District collection system as source water for Project.

Implement Water Rationing Program: Under this alternative, the District would not
undertake an advanced water purification project for groundwater recharge. Rather, it would implement a program of additional conservation measures and use restrictions. These measures and restrictions would be designed to achieve, through water conservation, a reduction in demand sufficient in size to offset the portion of the District's groundwater
pumping that is contributing to Basin overdraft conditions (approx. 1,500 afy).
This alternative was rejected as, while it will meet some of the Project objectives, it would
not meet Project objectives related to supply diversification and timely implementation. In
addition, while this alternative would lessen the significant impacts of the Project, it was rejected due to the infeasibility of relying upon conservation alone, given past reductions and low levels of current consumption.

Participation in City of Santa Cruz's In-Lieu and/or Aquifer Storage and Recovery Project(s) as an Alternative Supply Source: Under this alternative, the District would not
undertake an advanced water purification project for groundwater recharge. Instead, the
District would enter into an agreement with the City of Santa Cruz to participate in its In- Lieu and/or Aquifer Storage and Recovery Project(s) that is the first priority project they
are evaluating under the recommendations of the City's Water Supply Advisory Committee.

This alternative was rejected as it would meet some of the project objectives, but not meet
project objectives related to timeliness, affordability, or reliability during drought periods.
In addition, this alternative would also not substantially reduce significant Project impacts.

Participation in DeepWater Desal Project as an Alternative Supply Source: Under this
alternative, the District would not undertake an advanced water purification project for
groundwater recharge. Instead, the District would enter into a purchase agreement with
DeepWater Desal, LLC (DWD) for the purchase of desalinated water from its proposed
desalination facility in Moss Landing.

This alternative was rejected as, while it would meet some of the project objectives and
lessen the significant impact(s) of the Project, it would not meet objectives related to
providing a timely or affordable alternative supply.
Develop a New Dam and Reservoir: Under this alternative, the District would construct a
new dam and reservoir in the Santa Cruz Mountains to capture rain and surface water
runoff to meet the District's water supply needs. The reservoir water would be conveyed via
a new pipeline to a new water treatment plant and new percolation ponds for groundwater
recharge. This alternative would require the District to repurpose District-owned lands or locate and obtain control of a parcel or parcels of land in the Santa Cruz Mountains of
sufficient size and topographic configuration to accommodate a dam and reservoir.
Relatedly, the District would need to obtain water rights to streams affected by the dam.
This alternative would also require the District to repurpose District-owned lands or locate
and obtain control over a parcel or parcels of sufficient size and geologic composition,
within the Soquel Basin, to accommodate percolation ponds capable of recharging the
groundwater basin at rates comparable to that of the Project's recharge wells.
This alternative was rejected as, while it will meet some of the Project objectives, it would
not meet Project objectives related to providing timely or affordable alternative supply. In
addition, this alternative would also not substantially reduce significant Project impacts.

Summary of Alternatives Considered
CEQA mandates that an EIR evaluate a reasonable range of alternatives to the Project or
Project locations that generally reduce or avoid potentially significant impacts of the
project. CEQA requires that every EIR also evaluate a "No Project" alternative. Alternatives
provide a basis of comparison to the Project in terms of their significant impacts and their ability to meet project objectives. This comparative analysis is used to consider reasonable, potentially feasible options for minimizing environmental consequences of the Project. The
range of alternatives to the proposed Project analyzed in the Final EIR present specific

CEQA Findings of Fact Page 82 of 442

ATTACHMENT 2 - ITEM 2.52

Exhibit A

environmental impacts and how they would differ in severity compared to those associated
with the proposed Project. For the most part, significant impacts of the alternatives can be
mitigated to less-than-significant levels through adoption of mitigation measures identified
in Chapter 4 of the Draft EIR, which contains the environmental analysis of the proposed
Project. To varying degrees, the following alternatives would also avoid and/or lessen
impacts, including some or all of the significant and unavoidable impacts, of the proposed
Project.

The approach to Project alternatives selection for the Final EIR focused on identifying
alternatives that: (1) could meet most of the basic objectives of the project while reducing
one or more of its significant impacts, (2) could foster informed decision-making and public
participation, and (3) could be feasibly implemented. CEQA Guidelines Section 15364
defines "feasible" as "capable of being accomplished in a successful manner within a
reasonable period of time, taking into account economic, environmental, legal, social, and
technological factors." CEQA Guidelines Section 15126.6(0)(1) states that "the factors that
may be taken into account when addressing the potential feasibility of alternatives include
site suitability, economic viability, availability of infrastructure, general plan consistency,
other plans or regulatory limitations, jurisdictional boundaries (projects with a regionally
significant impact should consider the regional context), and whether the proponent can
reasonably acquire, control, or otherwise have access to the alternative site (or the site is
already owned by the proponent)."

The alternatives considered in this section include:

Alternative 1: No Project
Alternative 2: Reduced Project with Treated Surface Water Purchase
Alternative 3: Seawater/Brackish Desalination Plant

Alternative 1: No Project

Description
State CEQA Guidelines Section 15126.6(e) requires : "No Project" alternative be evaluated in a Draft EIR. Under Alternative 1, the District would not construct any part of the project.
No new water purification facilities, pipelines, or recharge wells would be built, and the
1,500 afy of advanced purified water would not be produced.

Relationship to Project Objectives
The No Project Alternative would not meet any of the Project objectives.

Facts in Support of Finding of Infeasibility
While the No Project Alternative would eliminate all construction and operational impacts
at all of the Project sites, thereby avoiding all significant impacts identified for the proposed
Project, this alternative would not further any of the Project's objectives. The groundwater basin would continue to be in a state of overdraft. No project benefits related to a

ATTACHMENT 2 - ITEM 2.52

Exhibit A

replenished groundwater basin would occur, such as prevention of seawater intrusion and
the creation of a sustainable water supply.

Therefore, the Board rejects this alterative for the above-stated reasons, each of which provides sufficient justification for rejection of this alternative. Alternative 1 is eliminated 1
from further consideration.

Alternative 2: Reduced Project with Surface Water Purchase

Description
Under Alternative 2, the District would construct a 1,200 afy AWPF and would purchase
300 afy of surface water from the City of Santa Cruz. The City of Santa Cruz has Pre-1914
water rights to North coast water sources, providing a source of water that could be
available within a reasonable time frame. The District is currently implementing a 5-year
pilot study to purchase a limited amount of water from the City. For Alternative 2, this
agreement would need to be extended by approximately 50 years and would require
additional discussion and commitments by the City and the District, including the guarantee
that water would be available during drought and non-drought conditions (to be a
comparable alternative to the Project (1,500 afy volume). Under this alternative, slight
reductions in the Project's treatment facility components would be made but the same
distribution pipelines would be required as the proposed Project, as well as up to 3
recharge wells for the purified water that would be produced.

Relationship to Project Objectives
Alternative 2 would meet most of the project objectives. It would meet the It overall goal of recharging the local groundwater basin and of supplementing the District's water supply by 1,500 afy. However, the goal to replenish the local groundwater basin to prevent further
seawater intrusion and develop a sustainable water supply in a timely manner that meets the District's supply objectives and the State's mandate under SGMA would not be met to the same extent as the Project. Assuming completion of the current pilot study and approval of a new 50-year water purchase agreement, Alternative 2 would allow the District to
continue to provide customers with a high-quality and safe water supply. Alternative 2 would also provide additional environmental benefits to marine waters, associated with the
overall reduction in treated wastewater discharges to Monterey Bay National Marine
Sanctuary; however, the volume of the reduction would be less than under the Project.
Further, ongoing and long-term use of surface water supplies could impact surface water
resources; therefore, environmental benefits to surface waters would not occur.

Facts in Support of Finding of Infeasibility
The overall intensity of construction impacts would be slightly reduced under Alternative 2,
because Alternative 2 would include a 5- to 10-percent reduction in the process building
footprint and a reduction in the process and chemical storage tanks. All of the significant
impacts of the proposed project would remain significant under the Alternative 2. However,
the magnitude of significance would generally be less for the air quality and energy

ATTACHMENT 2 - ITEM 2.52

consumption effects and potentially the tree removal effects. All of the impacts would be
reduced to a less-than-significant level with implementation of the same mitigation
measures specified in this EIR for the proposed project, with the exception of construction
noise effects which would remain significant and unavoidable with mitigation. However,
Alternative 2 would result in impacts to surface water bodies that would provide the long-
term District water supply during drought and non-drought conditions, and would also
therefore impact aquatic and other biological and natural resources dependent on those
surface water bodies. This impact would not occur under the Project.
While the overall intensity of the construction impacts would be slightly reduced for some resource areas, Alternative 2 would result in additional impacts to surface water bodies
thereby impacting aquatic and other biological and natural resources which would not
occur under the Project. In addition, Alternative 2 would not meet the Project objectives to
the same extent as the project.

Therefore, the Board rejects this alterative for the above-stated reasons, each of which
provides sufficient justification for rejection of this alternative. Alternative 2 is eliminated
from further consideration.

Alternative 3: Local Seawater/Brackish Desalination Plant

Description
Under Alternative 3, the District would construct a desalination plant or brackish water
desalination plant to supplement or replace the water supply of the proposed Project. The
District would not construct a new AWPF, recharge well facilities, or distribution pipelines.
The District would produce a sustained capacity of approximately 1,500 afy.

Relationship to Project Objectives
Alternative 3 would meet most of the project objectives. It would meet the overall goal of
recharging or allowing recovery of the local groundwater basin and supplementing the
District's water supply by 1,500 afy. However, the goal to replenish the local groundwater
basin to prevent further seawater intrusion and develop a sustainable water supply in a
timely manner that meets the District's supply objectives and the State's mandate under
SGMA would not be met to the same extent as the Project. Furthermore, groundwater
recharge would occur at a slower rate in the targeted zone than under the Project.
Alternative 3 would allow the District to continue providing customers with a high-quality
and safe water supply. However, Alternative 3 would not provide additional environmental
benefits to marine waters and could result in additional impacts to MBNMS associated with
the intake of seawater and discharge of an additional brine supply

Facts in Support of Finding of Infeasibility
While Alternative 3 would avoid or reduce some of the significant impacts of the Project, it
would result in additional construction and operational impacts compared to the Project.
Marine organisms could become entrained and/or impinged, and degradation of marine
water quality could result from discharges of saline water from the desalination plant.

Further, operational energy use, air quality emissions, and GHG emissions would be
substantially greater than under the Project. In addition, Alternative 3 would not meet the Project objectives to the same extent as the Project.
Therefore, the Board rejects this alterative for the above-stated reasons, each of which provides sufficient justification for rejection of this alternative. Alternative 3 is eliminated
from further consideration.

Environmentally Superior Alternative
The State CEQA Guidelines Section 15126.6(e) requires the identification of an
environmentally superior alternative to the proposed project. To determine the
environmentally superior alternative, the impacts of all the alternatives were compared to
determine which alternative would have the least adverse effects:

Alternative 1 would eliminate the short term construction effects relative to the proposed project. However, under Alternative 1 the groundwater basin would continue to be over
drafted because groundwater pumping would continue at existing rates, without
groundwater replenishment and creation of a freshwater barrier.

Alternative 2 would slightly reduce short-term construction effects relative to the Project
but would also introduce different impacts with a new long-term surface water use that
would result in a reduction in stream flow volumes, which could affect fisheries and
wetland habitat.

Alternative 3 would reduce some of the short-term construction impacts of the Project, but
would also introduce different impacts than the proposed project related to operation of the
desalination plant. These operational impacts include potential adverse effects on special-
status species, degradation of water quality, increased energy consumption and greenhouse
gas emissions, and exposure to hazardous materials. If the brackish facility is chosen, then
seawater intrusion could move farther inland, potentially impacting groundwater wells.
Based on the evaluation above, Alternative 2 is considered to be the environmentally
superior alternative among the Project alternatives (other than the No Project Alternative).
Alternative 2 would slightly decrease the intensity of construction-related air emissions and
energy consumption, and potentially tree removal impacts, relative to those of the Project.
However, this alternative would not meet Project goals to the same extent as the Project.

Section 5. Significant Irreversible Environmental Changes
According to Sections 15126(c) and 15126.2(c) of the State CEQA Guidelines, an EIR is
required to address any significant irreversible environmental changes that would occur
should the Project be implemented.

A resource commitment is considered irreversible when primary or secondary impacts
from its use limit future use options. Irreversible commitment applies primarily to non- renewable resources, such as minerals or cultural resources, and to those resources that are

Pure Water Soquel A-67 ESA / 160164
CEQA Findings of Fact Pad2'86 of 442

ATTACHMENT 2 - ITEM 2.52

Exhibit A

renewable only over long-time spans, such as soil productivity. A resource commitment is
considered irretrievable when the use or consumption of the resource is neither renewable
nor recoverable for use by future generations. Irretrievable commitment applies to the loss of production, harvest, or natural resources. The Project would involve two types of
resources: (1) general industrial resources including fuels and construction materials; and
(2) Project-specific resources such as land, biotic and cultural resources at the Project
facility sites. Determining whether the proposed project may result in significant
irreversible effects requires a determination of whether key resources would be degraded
or destroyed in such a way that there would be little possibility of restoring them.
During the life of the Project, the land used for the facilities would be committed to the
Project. Project components, including the AWPF, recharge wells, and monitoring wells,
which could permanently occupy approximately 2 acres via physical siting and enclosures.
This land could be used for other purposes in the future; however, the baseline condition of
the land would either be irretrievable or renewable in an undeterminable timeframe. Siting
of the AWPF, recharge wells, and monitoring wells could displace non-native grassland and
riparian habitats. Conveyance pipelines would be below ground or attached to existing
bridges. Following project construction, the pipeline alignments would be returned to
existing use conditions and continue to serve as roads, railroad right-of-ways, and bridges.
Accidents, such as the release of hazardous materials, could trigger irreversible
environmental damage. However, compliance with the various regulations regarding the safe transport, use, and storage of hazardous materials as well as the National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System General Construction Permit requirements would ensure that
public health and safety risks are maintained at acceptable levels. Therefore, significant
irreversible changes from accidental releases are not anticipated.

Therefore, the Project would not result in significant irreversible environmental changes.

Section 6. Growth-Inducing Effects
Section 15126.2(d) of the State CEQA Guidelines requires an EIR to discuss the ways the Project could foster economic or population growth or the construction of additional housing, directly or indirectly, in the surrounding environment. Growth-inducing impacts include the removal of obstacles to population growth (e.g., the expansion of a wastewater treatment plant allowing more development in a service area) and the development and construction of new service facilities that could significantly affect the environment
individually or cumulatively. In addition, growth must not be assumed as beneficial,
detrimental, or of little significance to the environment.

By improving the District's water supply sustainability, the Pure Water Soquel Project
would support a degree of planned growth within the District's service area. The Project
would not directly contribute to population growth, or the creation of additional housing or
jobs within the District's service area, as it would require only limited construction and
operation of water supply facilities and infrastructure. However, the Project could indirectly
support population, housing, and economic growth by removing water supply limitations as
an obstacle to growth. As explained previously in the context of the Santa Cruz County and

Capitola General Plan EIRs, development in the District's service area planned and approved
through the general plan process would have environmental impacts related to population,
housing, and economic growth. These environmental impacts are the indirect effects of
growth that would be supported in part by the Project. Some of the indirect effects of growth identified in the EIRs prepared for those general plans would be significant and
unavoidable. These impacts generally concern air quality, aesthetics, hydrology and water
quality, land use, public services, utilities, transportation, and greenhouse gas emissions.

Section 7. Statement of Overriding Considerations
The Board hereby declares that, pursuant to State CEQA Guidelines Section 15093, it has balanced the benefits of the Project against any unavoidable environmental impacts in
determining whether to approve the Project. Pursuant to the State CEQA Guidelines, if the
benefits of the Project outweigh the unavoidable adverse environmental impacts, those
impacts may be considered "acceptable."
Having reduced the adverse significant environmental effect of the Project to the extent feasible by adopting the Mitigation Measures contained in the Final EIR, the MMRP, and this
Exhibit, having considered the entire administrative record on the Project, and having
weighed the benefits of the Project against its unavoidable adverse impact after mitigation, the Board has determined that each of the following social, economic, and environmental benefits of the Project separately and individually outweigh the potential unavoidable adverse impacts and render those potential adverse impacts acceptable based upon the
following overriding considerations.

The considerations that have been taken into account by the Board in making this decision
are identified below.

Policy Considerations

State

Policy for Water Quality Control for Recycled water. On December 11, 2018, the State Water
Board adopted an Amendment to the Policy for Water Quality Control for Recycled Water (Recycled Water Policy). The Recycled Water Policy goals include minimizing the direct
discharge of treated wastewater to enclosed bays, estuaries and coastal lagoons, and ocean
waters, except where necessary to maintain beneficial uses, and maximizing the use of recycled water in areas where groundwater supplies are in a state of overdraft, to the extent
that downstream water rights, instream flow requirements, and public trust resources are
protected (State Water Board 2018).

Project role in meeting the Recycled Water Policy. The Project would help the meet the Recycled Water Policy goals as it is designed to utilize 25% of the treated effluent being discharged/wasted out to the Monterey Bay that would be put to beneficial reuse in the groundwater supply which is threatened with seawater intrusion. Further, The Santa Cruz Mid-County Groundwater Basin (3-001) is identified as critically overdrafted by the State
(DWR, Bulletin 118, Interim Update 2016).

Local
District Water Supply Needs and Community Water Plan. The Soquel Creek Water District
Community Water Plan was developed by the District in 2015 and updated in 2017 to
protect endangered groundwater resources, ensure water supply reliability and resiliency
to our customers, and prepare for climate change and other future challenges. The District
released the Community Water Plan in 2015 that was updated in 2017. The District has
determined through its Community Water Plan and Board Guiding Principles, and Board
Resolution 14-221 that supplemental water supply is required to restore protective
groundwater levels basin-wide, and aid in meeting the mandates of the Sustainable
Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) that basin groundwater use be sustainable by 2040. The District's groundwater supply is currently in a state of critical overdraft, meaning more
water has been extracted from the aquifers than the natural rate of recharge via rainfall,
resulting in depressed groundwater levels. The District has declared a Groundwater
Emergency (ongoing since 2014).2 The Santa Cruz Mid-County Groundwater Agency (MGA)
commissioned a study of the salinity of groundwater aquifers along the Monterey Bay
coastline in the Project vicinity. The study did detect seawater intrusion on shore in some
areas, and also confirmed that it is occurring along the entire coastline of the District's
service area immediately offshore. Moreover, the results of the study demonstrate that the
extent of elevated salinity levels among coastal aquifers is substantial in this area. The study represents a moment in time, and does not indicate the rate at which the interface between
saltwater and freshwater is advancing landward through the underground aquifers.
However, the study's findings regarding proximity of the interface to the coast emphasizes the need for actions that would facilitate the recovery, maintenance, and protection of groundwater levels to prevent further onshore intrusion (HydroMetrics WRI, 2018).

Project role in meeting District Policies. The project would meet the Community Water Plan
as the District would continue to provide customers with a high-quality and safe water
supply. In addition, the project would provide an affordable, reliable, and drought-resistant supplemental water source that contributes to the diversification of the District's water
supply portfolio and enhances resiliency.

The proposed Project's treatment facilities would be capable of producing 1.3 million
gallons per day (mgd), approximately 1,500 afy, of purified water - the estimated volume
required to offset the portion of the basin's cumulative groundwater overdraft attributable
to District groundwater pumping.

The Project would provide a supplemental water supply that would enable continued
provision of community services in a manner that meets the needs of the population, while
also protecting groundwater resources.

Resolution of the Board of Directors of the Soquel Creek Water District Declaring a Groundwater Emergency (Resolution No. 14-22), passed and adopted June 17, 2014.

Economic Considerations
The District has applied for and/or received state and federal grant funds. The District has
received over $2.2 million from the State's Prop 1 Groundwater Planning Grant program to
assist with feasibility, evaluation, and outreach for the Project. In November 2018, the
District was invited to apply for an implementation grant under the Prop Groundwater
Grant program for up to $50M. In addition, in July 2018, the District applied for grant funding through the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation's Title XVI Program for Recycled Water
Projects, which will fund up to $20M. Therefore, with the projected capital cost for the
Project estimated to be $90M, grant funding of up to $70M could reduce the capital cost of
the Project by half. The balance of Project costs (not funded by grants) would be eligible for
low interest financing from either the State Water Board Clean Water State Revolving
Funding Low Interest Loan Program or the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Water
Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Low Interest Loan Program.
A Technical Memorandum (TM) Estimating Benefits of the Pure Water Project was
prepared for the Project (Haddad and Pratt 2018) (2018 TM). According to the 2018 TM,
the Project's total benefits include both at least $796 million of direct benefits, plus
approximately $107 million in environmental and non-District benefits. This adds up to
total monetized benefits of $903 million.

Social Considerations

The 2018 TM also quantified social benefits of the Project, which included the avoidance of
a moratorium on development that would prevent 2,100 new housing units, and avoiding
roughly 725 job losses, or 3.8 percent of employment in the service area.

Having considered the benefits outlined above, the Board finds that the benefits of
approving the proposed Project outweigh and override the unavoidable adverse
environmental effects associated with the Project, and therefore, the Project's unavoidable
adverse environmental effects are acceptable.

water, especially groundwater.

Indirect Potable Reuse (IPR): Recycled water treated to drinking water standards, which
is blended with other environmental systems such as river, reservoir, or in the case of the
project, a groundwater basin, before the water is reused.

Level of service (LOS): A qualitative description of a facility's performance based on average delay per vehicle, vehicle density, or volume-to-capacity ratios. Levels of service range from LOS A, which indicates free-flow or excellent conditions with short delays, to
LOS F, which indicates congested or overloaded conditions with extremely long delays.
microfiltration (MF): A type of physical filtration process where a contaminated fluid is
passed through a special pore-sized membrane to separate microorganisms and suspended particles from process liquid. Similar to ultrafiltration; but with a larger pore size range.
overdraft: A condition in which groundwater use exceeds the amount of recharge into an
aquifer, which leads to a decline in groundwater level.

Tertiary treatment includes removal of nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen and practically all suspended and organic matter from wastewater.
ultrafiltration (UF): A step in the treatment process to treat secondary effluent to tertiary standards. The UF process involves water being forced through microscopic pores in a series of polymeric hollow fiber membranes. Similar to microfiltration; but with a smaller
pore size range.

ultraviolet light-based advanced oxidation process (UV AOP): A treatment process that typically involves the combination of ultraviolet light with a chemical oxidant (e.g., hydrogen peroxide or sodium hypochlorite) for disinfection of trace pollutants.

Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program for Pure Water Soquel: Groundwater
Replenishment and Seawater Intrusion
Prevention Project

Introduction

The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) requires that when a public agency makes
findings pursuant to Public Resource Code Section 21081 before approving a project that would
result in one or more significant impacts on the environment, the agency must adopt a reporting
or monitoring program for mitigation measures incorporated into a project or imposed as
conditions of approval. The program must be designed to ensure compliance during project
implementation (Public Resource Code Section 21081.6).

This Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Plan (MMRP) for the Pure Water Soquel: Groundwater
Replenishment and Seawater Intrusion Prevention Project (Project) will be in place through all
phases of the Project, including design and construction, and will help ensure that Project
objectives are achieved. As the CEQA Lead Agency, the Soquel Creek Water District (District) is
responsible for verifying that the provisions of the MMRP as a whole are carried out, pursuant to
Section 15097(a) of the CEQA Guidelines. The District may delegate reporting or monitoring
responsibilities to a private entity such as a Project contractor who accepts the delegation;
however, until mitigation measures have been completed, the District remains responsible for
ensuring that implementation of the mitigation measures occurs in accordance with the program.
The District will ensure that monitoring is documented through periodic reports and that
deficiencies are promptly corrected.
The following table identifies the mitigation measures by resource area. The table also provides the
specific mitigation monitoring requirements, including implementation documentation, monitoring
activity, timing, and responsible monitoring party. The District and its contractor(s) shall be
responsible for implementation of all mitigation measures. The MMRP table presents the mitigation measures adopted for the Project by the District. The table also includes improvement measures
which are not required under CEQA to reduce an impact to a less-than-significant level, but have
been added to the Project at the suggestion of regulatory agencies with jurisdiction over the
corresponding resource. The purpose of the table is to provide a single comprehensive list of the
measures that will be implemented to avoid or reduce impacts of the Project on the environment, the timing for their implementation, and related monitoring and reporting requirements.

The plan shall identify the parameters for phasing construction activities associated with each of the Project components to reduce daily construction
emissions of NO,. For example, limiting daily construction activities to activities at one pipeline site and at either the Chanticleer Site or at one of the well sites would be sufficient to reduce NO% emissions to less than 137 pounds per day. In addition, although off-road construction equipment at the Chanticleer, Headquarters-West Annex, SC WWTF, Willowbrook Lane Recharge Well, and Monterey Avenue Recharge Well Sites would be required to meet USEPA Tier 4 emission standards or otherwise be equipped with Level 3 diesel particulate filters per requirements of Mitigation Measure 4.3-4, the Construction Emissions Reduction Plan may include an additional commitment to use a certain percentage of Tier 4 compliant equipment and/or equipment fueled by alternative fuels associated with pipeline construction. The identified construction phasing parameters and the percentage of Tier 4 compliant equipment and/or equipment fueled by altemative fuels associated with pipeline construction would be substantiated within the Plan to define how the resulting emissions would be less than 137 pounds NOx per day using either the air emissions calculations prepared for the Environmental Impact Report or other air emissions calculations estimated using the CalEEMod emissions model.
If the Plan includes : commitment that a certain percentage of pipeline- related off-road equipment would be Tier 4 compliant and/or fueled by alternative fuels, then it shall identify the initial pipeline construction equipment listing with each off-road unit's horsepower, certified tier specification status, and the associated maximum daily NO, emissions.

If they cannot be avoided, the District shall, in coordination with the USFWS and/or CDFW (as applicable based on plant rarity), avoid plants through Project design, protect plants from construction activities through the use of exclusion fencing and signage, or relocate plants to other suitable habitat nearby.
Prior to construction, staging areas shall be identified that avoid impacts to Santa Cruz tarplants and any other special-status plants identified, and construction exclusion fencing shall be used to define the work area and minimize disturbance to these areas. The fencing shall be maintained through the construction phase and monitored on a weekly basis during construction to ensure protection of tarplants and their habitat.
If avoidance is not feasible, rare plants and their seeds shall be salvaged and relocated, and habitat restoration shall be provided to replace any destroyed special-status plant occurrences at a minimum 1:1 ratio (i.e., no net loss) or as specified by resource agencies based on area of lost habitat. Compensation for loss of special-status plant populations shall include the restoration or enhancement of temporarily impacted areas, and management of restored areas. Restoration or reintroduction shall be located on-site (i.e., at Schwan Lagoon). At a minimum, the restoration areas shall meet the following performance standards by the fifth year:
a. The compensation area shall be at least the same size as the impact area.

b. Vegetation cover and composition in special-status plant restoration areas near Schwan Lagoon shall emulate existing Santa Cruz tarplant reference populations.

C. Monitoring shall demonstrate the continued presence of rare plants in the restoration area.

d. Invasive species cover shall be less than or equal to the invasive species cover in the impact area.
Additionally, restored populations shall have greater than the number of individuals of the impacted population, in an area greater than or equal to the size of the impacted population, for at least 3 consecutive years without irrigation, weeding, or other manipulation of the restoration site. The Habitat Monitoring Plan to be prepared in accordance with Mitigation Measure 4.4-11 (Habitat Monitoring Plan) shall detail the monitoring I requirements and success criteria.

Soquel, CA 95073

Dear Board of Directors,

am respectfully requesting that your Board reconsider your actions taken December 18, 2018
regarding Item 2.52 on the meeting agenda. I feel there were reasons your Board should have
delayed the actions approved by your adoption of Resolution 18-30 to certify the Final
Environmental Impact Report (EIR), and Resolution 18-31 to adopt the CEQA Mitigation
Monitoring and Reporting Program (MMRP), Findings, and Statement of Overriding
Considerations, and approve the Project.

It is my opinion that your Board had not fully read the materials associated with your actions,
and therefore did not act in the best interest of the District ratepayers or the community at-
large. It is also my opinion that significant new information was presented at the meeting that warrants reconsideration and at the very least, to correct and re-circulate the Project EIR. Both
pieces of information regard the Chanticleer. Avenue AWTF site, the site your Board identified
as first priority for the Project. Director Lather divulged a knowledge of potential asbestos and
other industrial contaminants associated with the historic property uses, and Santa Cruz County
Supervisor John Leopold divulged that with the proposed Kaiser Medical Facility in the
immediate area that most likely will affect land costs and other environmental concerns.

f

Please reconsider and rescind Resolution 18-30 and Resolution 18-31.

Sincerely,

repeatedly authorizing an unbalanced allocation of District resources to pursue
the Project, including Prop. 218 restructuring of water rates and service fees
with intent to fund the expected debt of the Project before completion of CEQA
process and Project approval; and, failure by the General Manager to respect

⅓

and honor the supreme purpose of CEQA process to include and encourage the
public's participation in reasonable Project review by repeatedly denying
significant and multiple public requests for extensions of comment time to
examine complex and voluminous Draft EIR and Responses to Comments
documents.

The amended petition will seek the following relief:

1. For a peremptory writ of mandate directing Soquel Creek Water District:
(a) To vacate and set aside Resolutions 18-30 and 18-31 certification of
the Final EIR and approval of the Project, MMRP and Conditions of
Overriding Consideration and the Mitigated Negative Declaration
(MND) for the Twin Lakes Church Recharge Pilot Well Project;
(b) To vacate and set aside its filing of the Notice of Determination for the
Project and associated Twin Lakes Church Pilot Recharge Well Project;
(c) To review the Project in its entirety and revise and recirculate the Draft
EIR, to prepare a legally adequate Draft EIR providing a De Novo "No
Project" analysis that includes existing and expanded Surface Water
Transfer Agreements with the City of Santa Cruz recognizing
conjunctive use related to water rights amendments and place of use
agreements currently undergoing environmental review by the City of
Santa Cruz, and otherwise to comply with CEQA and all other
applicable state, federal and local laws, regulations, ordinances, and
policies in reviewing the Project, granting reasonable public comment
period extensions when requested by the public;

2. For an order staying the effects of the Soquel Creek Water District's
certification of the Final EIR and possible approvals related to any
component of the Project, including the Twin Lakes Church Pilot Recharge
Well Project, pending the entry of judgement or filing of an appeal in this
action;
3. For the issuance of a temporary restraining order, and a preliminary and
permanent injunction restraining and prohibiting the Soquel Creek Water
District from carrying out or engaging in any action related to the Project
that could result in any changes or alteration in the physical environment,

U

until the Soquel Creek Water District has complied with CEQA and all
other applicable laws;
4. For an order directing the Soquel Creek Water District to pay Rebecca
(Becky ) Steinbruner any costs of suit in this action;
5. For an order directing the Soquel Creek Water District to pay Rebecca
(Becky) Steinbruner any reasonable associated attorney fees; and 6. For such other and further relief as the Court deems proper.

Under Public Resources Code 21167.6(a), a copy of the Amended Petition
to be filed by petitioner will be sent by certified mail to Respondents: the
Soquel Creek Water District, Board of Directors for the Soquel Creek
Water District, General Manager of the Soquel Creek Water District, Mr.
Ron Duncan, and to Real Parties of Interest: the County of Santa Cruz, City
