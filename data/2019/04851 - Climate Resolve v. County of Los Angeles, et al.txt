VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

P4 N m Petitioner, Climate Resolve, alleges:

Introduction
4 1. By this action, Petitioner, Climate Resolve, challenges the decision of the County
5 of Los Angeles (County) and of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors
6 (Board) and Los Angeles County Department of Regional Planning
7 (Department) to approve the development of, and to certify an Environmental
O c Impact Report (EIR) for, the Centennial Specific Plan Project (the Project) in an
unincorporated area of Los Angeles County.
10 2. The Project proposes one of the largest master-planned communities in
11 California. It would build nearly 20,000 residential units, business parks,
12 commercial uses, schools, medical facilities, a library, utility facilities, and so
13 forth-in other words, a new city-in nine "villages."
14 3. The Project is proposed to be developed on nearly 20 square miles of
15 undeveloped land located in the northwestern portion of the Antelope Valley, in 16 2%983 an area featuring rolling hills, which has primarily been used for cattle grazing
for more than 150 years.

4. The Project will be an isolated, "leapfrog" development far from other urban
areas and employment centers, which will require the extension of public
facilities and expansion of power lines into a rural area.
22 5. The Project will have substantial negative environmental impacts, including
23 impacts from greenhouse-gas emissions and significant risks from wildland
fires. 24

25 6. The EIR fails to adequately analyze these and other significant environmental

26 impacts, and fails in its role as a public-information document. The County

27 failed to adopt mitigation measures that are effective, feasible, and enforceable.

28 7. As detailed below, these and other inadequacies in the EIR violate the California
29 Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code sections 21000-21189.3
30 (CEQA), and the CEQA Guidelines, California Code of Regulations, title 14,
31 sections 15000-15387 plus appendices. (CEQA Guidelines).
32 8. The County's approval of the Project is also inconsistent with the Planning and
33 Zoning Law, and the applicable general and specific plans, which limit density in
34 high-fire-severity areas and discourage urban sprawl.
35

R N 9. The County abused its discretion in approving the Project and related
environmental documentation, as described below.
3
4 Parties

5 10. Petitioner Climate Resolve is a California nonprofit corporation that builds
6 collaborations to champion equitable climate solutions, connecting
7 communities, organizations, and policymakers to address the global problem of
8 climate change through local action. Climate Resolve brings this action on its
9 own behalf and on behalf of the public. It has strong beneficial interest in
10 protecting the environment in Southern California, and in this case because the
11 actions taken by the County, and challenged in this case, affect it and the public
12 directly as residents of Southern California.
13 11. Respondent County of Los Angeles (the County), a political subdivision of the 14 State of California, is responsible for regulating and controlling land use in the
15 unincorporated territory of the County, including but not limited to 16 implementing and complying with the provisions of CEQA, the CEQA 17 Guidelines, other State laws, and its own General Plan. Respondent County is 18 the "lead agency" for purposes of Public Resources Code section 21067, with
19 principal responsibility for conducting environmental review for and approving 20 the Project.
21 SE 12. Respondent Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors (Board) is the duly
23 elected legislative body of the County, and is responsible for compliance with
24 CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines, other State laws, and the General Plan.

25 13. Respondent Los Angeles Department of Regional Planning (Department) is an
'26 agency of the County of Los Angeles, which performed land-use planning

27 functions for the unincorporated areas of Los Angeles County. The Department

28 is listed as the Public Agency that prepared and filed the Notice of

29 Determination for the Project.

30 14. Petitioner is informed, believes, and on that basis alleges that Real Party in
31 Interest Centennial Founders, LLC (Applicant) is a Delaware limited liability

32 company with a place of business in Santa Clarita, California. Applicant is the

33 sole applicant identified for the Project, and a recipient of Project approvals.
34

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

WONOUAY N 15. Petitioner is informed, believes, and on that basis alleges that Real Party in
Interest Tejon Ranch Co. is a Delaware corporation and the property owner of
the Tejon Ranch, which includes the Centennial Project Site.
16. Petitioner is currently unaware of the true names and capacities of Real Parties
in Interest Does through 10, and therefore sues those parties by such fictitious
names. Does 1 through 10 are agents of Applicant and/or Tejon Ranch Co. who
are responsible in some manner for the conduct described in this petition, or

10 other persons or entities who claim some legal or equitable interest in the

11 subject matter of this action. Petitioner will amend this petition to show the true

12 names and capacities of Does through 10 when such names and capacities
become known.

13
14 0805555 Jurisdiction and Venue
17. This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this petition under Code
of Civil Procedure (CCP) $$ 1085 and 1094.5, and Public Resources Code
§$ 21167, 21168, and 21168.5.
18. This case is properly classified as an unlimited civil case, and therefore is within
the jurisdiction of this Court, because it is not one of the types of cases listed as
limited civil cases in CCP §$ 86, 86.1, or 87.

22 19. Venue is proper in this Court under CCP $ 394 because Respondents are a

23

24 county and local agencies situated within Los Angeles County, which is where
the Project's environmental effects will be felt.

25

26 20. Petitioner has performed all conditions precedent to filing this action and have

27 exhausted all available administrative remedies to the extent required by law.

28 General Allegations

29 Background on Climate Change and Fire Hazards

30

31 21. There is an overwhelming scientific consensus that emissions of greenhouse

32 gases from human activity have caused climate change, and that climate change

33 will worsen in the future unless atmospheric greenhouse-gas concentrations are
controlled and reduced.

34

35 22. In its Climate Change 2014 Synthesis Report, the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change has said that "continued emissions of greenhouse gases will

- 3 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

R Nm cause further warming and long-lasting changes in all components of the
climate system, increasing the likelihood of severe, pervasive, and irreversible
impacts for people and ecosystems. Limiting climate change would require 4 substantial and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, which,
5 together with adaptation, can limit climate change risk."
6 23. The effects of climate change are pervasive. It has resulted in rising 7 temperatures, disruptions of weather systems, changes in wind patterns, 8 disturbance of historical hydrological cycles, shifts in ocean currents and ocean 9 acidification, and a myriad of other harmful changes to global climate regimes. 10 24. Effects of climate change extend far beyond meteorological systems. It threatens 11 ecosystems and is causing extinctions of many species. It disrupts systems that 12 provide food and water to human communities. It threatens human health, 13 security, and livelihoods. 14

15 25. Climate change increases both short- and long-term weather phenomena that
lead to more extreme wildfires. Climate change is responsible for an increased 16

17 frequency of fires, and changes fire behavior, making them burn hotter and
18 more intensely, and spread faster.
19 26. The effects of climate change are being felt very strongly in California.
83888 According to California's Fourth Climate Change Assessment, published in
2018 by the Governor's Office of Planning and Research, the California Energy
Commission, and the California Natural Resources Agency (Fourth
Assessment), California is one of the most climate-challenged regions of North
America. Average temperatures are increasing, and climatic conditions are
25 hotter and drier, contributing to recent extended, severe drought.
26 27. The Fourth Assessment also predicts that "Climate change will make forests
27 more susceptible to extreme wildfires. By 2100, if greenhouse gas emissions
28 continue to rise, one study found that the frequency of extreme wildfires
29 burning over approximately 25,000 acres would increase by nearly 50 percent,
30 and that average area burned statewide would increase by 77 percent by the end
31 of the century."
32 28. A May 2018 report titled "Indicators of Climate Change in California," issued by 33 the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment, shows a
34 steady increase in statewide annual average temperature, likely to cause heat 35

- 4 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

ooaAWNF waves and droughts. The report shows that the area burned by wildfires has
been increasing each year, because climate change has created conditions for
extreme, high-severity wildfires that spread rapidly.
29. In the face of the threats posed by climate change, California has taken a leading
role in efforts to slow and stop greenhouse-gas emissions. AB 32 mandated a
return to 1990 emission levels by 2020. SB 32 called for reduction 40 percent
below 1990 levels by 2030. SB 100 required that 60 percent of California's

10 electricity portfolio come from renewable sources by 2030, and that the electric

11 grid be powered entirely by clean energy by 2045. Executive Order B-55-18

12 established a statewide goal to achieve carbon neutrality "as soon as possible,
and no later than 2045."

13

14 30. The transportation sector is California's largest source of greenhouse-gas

15 emissions. Greenhouse-gas emissions from transportation are rising in spite of

16 the state's efforts to control them, impeding the state's ability to meet its goals to

8 005 reduce greenhouse gases and climate effects.
31. Significant California policy initiatives seeking to reduce greenhouse-gas (GHG)
emissions from mobile sources (transportation, especially cars and light trucks)
include:

21
22 a. California's 2017 Climate Change Scoping Plan, issued by the California

23 Air Resources Board in November 2017. It calls for supporting and

24 accelerating progress on transitioning to a zero-carbon transportation

25 system, while ensuring vehicle miles traveled (VMT) reductions are still
achieved.

26
27 b. Los Angeles County's draft Countywide Sustainability Plan, which

28 contains Strategy 3A, "Increase housing density and limit urban sprawl."

29 One of the rationales the Plan provides in support of this strategy is that

30 "urban sprawl generally requires expensive and expansive infrastructure

31 networks that drain resources and contribute significantly to greenhouse
gas emissions."

C.

32

33 SB 743, which required the Governor's Office of Planning and Research to

34 amend the CEQA Guidelines to change the criteria used to evaluate the

35 significance of transportation impacts. The result was Guidelines section
15064.3, which changes the focus for evaluating transportation impacts

- 5-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 from Level of Service (LOS) to VMT.
2 32. Land-use decisions that increase VMT are a significant contributing factor in 3 transportation-sector emissions. New developments can also cause significant 4 emissions by burning natural gas, by consuming electricity that was generated 5 by burning fossil fuels, and in many other ways. 6

7 33. Experiences of recent years have demonstrated, dramatically and starkly, the
dangers posed by fires at the wildland-urban interface, the zone of transition 8 between unoccupied land and human development. 9

10 34. Large, destructive fires often result from a combination of highly flammable

11 vegetation in wildland areas, steep topography, and climatic conditions

12 including low rainfall and high winds, such as Santa Ana winds. Such conditions

13 prevail in the area surrounding the Project.

14 35. Extremely damaging wildland fires occur with increasing frequency in
15 California. In 2017 and 2018, California experienced over 15,000 wildfires,
16 including the La Tuna, Atlas, Tubbs, Thomas, Creek, Rye, Mendocino Complex,
17 Holy, Carr, Woolsey, and Camp Fires.
0985838 36. Many studies have shown that real-estate developments with clustered densities
surrounded by flammable vegetation in fire-prone areas-that is, communities in the wildland-urban interface, like Centennial-are a great risk of burning.
37. Homes built in high-fire-risk areas cannot be effectively fire-proofed through
the use of fire-resistant building materials. Research demonstrates that location,
rather than construction materials, is the greatest factor in determining the risk
of homes being damaged or destroyed by fire.
25 38. The majority of California wildfires are caused by human activities in fire-prone 26 areas. Increased public access and activity in and near wildland areas increases 27 the probability of fire starts. This probability is further increased by increases in 28 ambient temperatures caused by urban centers and utility corridors. 29

30 39. A major cause of wildfires is human ignition sources. These include cigarettes,
vehicles, fireworks, power equipment, arson, campfires, and other unintentional 31 fire starts.
32

33 40. Electrical transmission lines running through wildland areas are another human

34 ignition source that poses substantial risk of fire starts. Several of the state's

35 most-destructive recent fires were caused by failures in electrical transmission

- lines.
2 41. Land uses including residential, commercial, and industrial uses involve 00 ÷ 1O O D CO G flammable products such as paint, wood building construction, furniture, and
petroleum-based products. Building development in fire-prone locations
introduces additional fuels and increases the risk of damage from fires.

The Project Site
42. The Centennial Specific Plan Project Site (Project Site) is on 12,323 acres (19.3
square miles) of land located in the northwestern Antelope Valley, in
10 unincorporated Los Angeles County, at the border with Kern County to the
11 north. It is approximately 35 miles north of Santa Clarita, 50 miles south of
12 Bakersfield, and 35 miles west of Lancaster via State Route 138, which runs
13 through the southern portion of the Project Site. The Site lies just east of
14 Interstate 5, near rural communities including Gorman and Neenach.
15 43. The Project Site is in a remote area of northern Los Angeles County, far away
16 from urban areas with major employment centers. It is over 60 miles from
17
18 downtown Los Angeles. It is in the area of Los Angeles County that has the most
19 long-distance out-commuting.

20 44. The Project Site is part of the privately owned, 270,000 acre Tejon Ranch, which
21 extends north into Kern County. The ranch is the largest private property in the
state of California.
22

23 45. Tejon Ranch Co. currently leases most of the Project Site for grazing. The

24 Project Site is mostly undeveloped, with development limited to a few paved

25 roads and unpaved ranch roads, some fencing, and stock ponds.

26 46. The topography of the Project Site is primarily low rolling hills. It is bordered on

27 the north and west by the Tehachapi Mountains, and the San Gabriel Mountains

28 are located to the south. It is a seismically active region that includes portions of

29 the San Andreas and Garlock Fault systems.

30 47. The Project Site's natural features include approximately 4,000 acres of oak
31 woodland or lands designated significant ecological areas (SEAs). It contains
32 drainage and wildlife corridors. It contains grasslands, riparian and wetlands
33 vegetation, and scrub. It is populated by numerous wildlife species, including 42
34 special-status species.

1 48. Under California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection and Los Angeles
2 County Fire Department fire hazard severity designations, the majority of the
3 Project Site is within a Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone (VHFHSZ) and a
4 High Fire Hazard Severity Zone (HFHSZ), areas that are highly vulnerable to
5 wildfires, particularly because of the presence of high brush, woodlands, and
6 steep slopes. The shape of the valley in which the Project Site is located
7 encourages a wind-tunnel effect that facilitates increased wind speeds.
8

9 The Project

10 49. In 2008, Tejon Ranch Co. entered into the Tejon Ranch Conservation and Land
11 Use Agreement with several conservation and environmental organizations.
12 That agreement provides for designation of open space and conservation
13 easements over approximately 240,000 acres of the Tejon Ranch, while allowing
14 for development of portions of the ranch, including the Project Site.
15 50. Tejon Ranch Co. is developing several master-planned real-estate developments
16 on its land, including the Project.
17 51. Centennial would be a master-planned community of nearly 60,000 people. It 18 would include nine separate "villages," with a mix of land uses. It would include 19 néarly 20,000 dwelling units, both multi-family and single-family homes. 20 52. The development would have over 7 million square feet of business park uses 21 and 1 million square feet of commercial uses. 22
23 53. The development would also have over 1,500,000 square feet of

24 "institutional/civic" uses including schools and medical facilities, nearly 200

25 acres of utility facilities including wastewater reclamation and water treatment
26 facilities, a new Los Angeles Sheriff's Department station, and up to four fire
stations. 27
28 54. The Project requires several land-use entitlements, including the Centennial
83 Specific Plan, a general plan amendment including amendments to the AVAP, a conditional use permit, and a vesting parcel map to subdivide the property into 31 20 parcels, with further subdivision contemplated in the future. It includes
32 zoning changes from existing zoning to "Specific Plan" zoning. It also involves a
33 development agreement between the County, Applicant, and Tejon Ranch Co.
34 providing for "public benefits" including dedication of land for development
35 and operations of public facilities.

A0 NP 55. Major improvements to State Route 138 will be necessary to accommodate
cumulative impacts including full Project buildout, resulting in divided-
expressway and limited-access-highway sections. The $800 million cost of this

5 expansion will be borne by County taxpayers.

0yo 56. The Applicant claims that development of light-industrial, business, and other
commercial uses would yield a range of employment opportunities in
Centennial, with approximately 20,000 new jobs. This claim is questionable in
light of analysis by the Southern California Association of Governments

10 showing that there is roughly one job per four residents in this part of Los

11 Angeles County.

12 57. Project buildout is proposed to be implemented in phases, over an approximate

13 20-year time period. Thus, construction will likely continue through at least

14 2040. The phased buildout will be based on future market conditions, such that

15 a balance between new housing and new job opportunities is not assured.

16
b 58. As a sprawl development that will add substantial VMT, the Project is grossly
out of sync with California's climate-change policies.

19 Environmental Review and Project Approval

20
21 59. The County originally prepared an Initial Study and issued a Notice of
Preparation for the Project in 2004. Project modifications were made later, and a

22 revised Notice of Preparation was issued in October 2015.

23 60. The Board approved extensive updates to the County of Los Angeles General

24 Plan, called General Plan 2035 (General Plan), in 2015. The Antelope Valley

25 Area Plan (AVAP) is a component of the General Plan providing goals and

26 policies for unincorporated County land in the Antelope Valley area. The Board

27 adopted the AVAP in 2015.

28

29 61. In May 2017, the County circulated a Draft Environmental Impact Report
(DEIR) for the Project.

30

31 62. The County's Regional Planning Commission held several hearings on the

32 Project and the EIR, including hearings on April 25, June 6, July 11, and August

33 29, 2018, at which public testimony was heard. Climate Resolve testified at the

34 June 6, July 11, and August 29 hearings.

35 63. The County prepared a Final Environmental Impact Report (FEIR) in May

- 9-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

2018, and submitted it to the Regional Planning Commission in advance of the
2 hearing on June 6, 2018.
3 64. The County received nearly 2,300 comment letters on the DEIR, including 91 4 letters from agencies, organizations, and individuals, and 2,204 emailed form
5 letters, responses to which were included in the FEIR.
6

7 65. On August 29, 2018, the Regional Planning Commission recommended several

8 changes and conditions be incorporated into the Project and recommended that

9 the Board approve the Project with those changes and conditions.

10 66. Thereafter, the County continued to receive many comment letters on the

11 Project and its environmental review, to which it provided additional responses.

12 67. In November 2018, shortly before the Board considered the Project, the County
13 prepared a Consolidated Final Environmental Impact Report (CFEIR), which
14 included responses to comments received through October 28, 2018.
15 68. Additional comment letters were submitted thereafter, including by Petitioner
16 Climate Resolve.

17 69. The Board considered the Project at a meeting on December 11, 2018. The 18 Board directed staff to amend the Project, including amendments to the specific
19 plan, conditions of approval, and development agreement. It indicated its intent
20 to certify the FEIR and approve the Project with amendments.
21 22 70. The Board again considered the Project at a meeting on April 30, 2019. The
23 Board voted 4-1 to certify the FEIR (State Clearinghouse No. 2004031072) and
24 adopt the CEQA Findings, Statement of Overriding Considerations, and

25 Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program.

26 71. On April 30, 2019, the Board also voted 4-1 to adopt resolutions and ordinances

27 approving the Project. The approved entitlements are:

28 a. General Plan Amendment No. 02-232 to amend the AVAP and the

29 County General Plan Highway Plan;

30 b. Centennial Specific Plan No. 02-232;
31 C. Development Agreement No. RPPL2016003940 between the County,

16
202 73. Petitioner incorporates gg 1-72 above as though set forth here.
74. In approving the EIR, the County violated CEQA, Public Resources Code
§§ 21000-21189.3, and the CEQA Guidelines (14 Cal. Code Regs. S$ 15000-
20 15387 plus appendices) in significant ways, which are set forth in the following
~ paragraphs.
22 75. The County has failed to disclose, analyze, and mitigate many of the Project's
23 significant environmental impacts, including in the areas of greenhouse-gas

24 emissions and fire hazards.

25 76. Some of the approved mitigation measures are vague, deferred, or inadequate to
26 truly mitigate the Project's impacts.
27 Greenhouse Gases 28

29 Failure to Analyze and Disclose Climate-Change Impacts

30 77. The EIR fails to adequately analyze and disclose impacts related to climate

31 change sufficiently to allow the public and decision makers to understand and

32 evaluate the Project's impacts. Some of these failures are described in the

33 following paragraphs.

34 78. The EIR's discussion of how the California Cap and Trade Program applies to
35 the Project is legally and factually incorrect and therefor misleads the public and

decision makers concerning the Project's climate impacts. In addition, there is
2 no showing that the Cap and Trade Program would actually mitigate any of the
3 Project's climate impacts.
4 79. The final version of the EIR chapter on Climate Change, the "Conformed and 5 Annotated Draft EIR Section 5.21," lists several reductions in GHG emissions
6 from the emissions numbers given in the original DEIR. Some of these claimed * 7 reductions violate CEQA's requirement that environmental impacts be disclosed 8 in an EIR because they are illusory and unsubstantiated and, in some cases, 9 based on conflicting evidence. They mislead readers concerning the true GHG 10 impacts of the Project and constitute a failure to adequately analyze those 11 impacts. They include the following:
12
a. 50% utilization of Electric Vehicles (EVs) at Project buildout: A cited 13 report showing that 55% of new car sales will be electric in 2040 is 14 inconsistent with the EIR's conclusion that the overall vehicle mix on 15 California roads will consist of 50% electric vehicles in that year. EV 16 adoption will be lower in ex-urban areas with long commutes like 17 Centennial. 18 28383 b. There is no analysis showing the Single Occupancy Vehicle (SOV)
program will produce the reductions in SOV usage on the Project Site
projected in the EIR;

C. There is no analysis showing the measures encouraging EV adoption will
produce the high rates of EV usage on the Project Site projected in the 24 EIR;

25 d. Reductions due to new CalEEMod: DEIR Appendix 5.2.1A contains
26 CalEEMod outputs from the original run, prior to the DEIR's release in
27 May 2017. CFEIR S 5.32 refers to a June 2018 CalEEMod run, but the EIR
28 does not contain an updated appendix substantiating the reductions
29 attributed to the new CalEEMod software and input parameters;
30 e, Reductions from mitigation measures MM 10-1, 10-25, 10-26, 21-14, 21-
31 22, and 14-11, and MM 18-1, 21-9, and 21-13: these reductions are
32 claimed to add up to 34,412 MTCO2e/year, but the EIR fails to
33 substantiate this figure.
34 f. Net zero for electricity: The EIR misleadingly and wrongly claims that, 35

• 12 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

A0 H N since the mitigation measures listed in the previous paragraph
purportedly reduce GHG emissions by a quantity greater than the
Project's emissions attributable to its use of electricity, the project will be
"net zero carbon from the electric sector." This label is confusing and
misleading, since most of the listed mitigation measures do not relate to
electric power, and the Project will still import substantial amounts of
00n electric power from utilities;
80. The EIR misleads readers by erroneously claiming compatibility with CARB's
2017 2030 Target Scoping Plan Update, based, among other things, on a 10 purported GHG efficiency of 1.93 MTCO2e per "service population,' but
11 CARB's 2050 efficiency target is 2 MTCO2e per capita, not per service
12 population. The Project is not compatible with the 2017 Scoping Plan Update.
13 81. The EIR fails to analyze the climate impacts of additional wildfires that will be 14 caused by the presence of the Project. 15

16 82. The EIR fails to analyze the Project's energy usage and conservation measures as

17 required by CEQA Guidelines Appendix F.
18 83. The EIR's calculations of Project-related GHG emissions from mobile sources
483 are gross underestimations due to the optimistic and unsubstantiated
assumptions made in the EIR's traffic analysis. For example, the EIR assumes
without appropriate analysis that many residents will find jobs in the Project so
22 they won't need to commute to other locations for work, and that bicycle usage
23 will be significantly higher for Project residents than it is statewide.
24 84. The EIR erroneously claims the Project is compatible with the Regional
25 Transportation Plan/Sustainable Community Strategy (RTP/SCS) adopted in
26 2012 by the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) even
27 though the Project is inconsistent with that document in several respects, for
28 example with its demographic projections.
29 85. The EIR fails to analyze effects on operational GHG emissions during Project
30 buildout, if the Project's phases are built in a different order from the order
31 contemplated. For example, if residential portions of the Project are constructed
32 before commercial portions, there will be no jobs available in the Project, sO all
33 residents will have to travel farther than the EIR predicts, to jobs outside the
34 Project, increasing VMT and related GHG emissions.

P Failure to Adopt Feasible Mitigation
2 86. Since the EIR concludes that the Project will have significant GHG impacts, 3 CEQA requires that all feasible mitigation measures be adopted before the 4 Project may be approved. The County has violated CEQA by failing to require 5 this. The following paragraphs list some of the feasible mitigation measures that 6 were proposed in public comments, which the County failed to adopt: 7
00 n a. Generating all of the Project's electricity on-site via rooftop solar and
battery storage;

10 b. Requiring LEED or comparable standards for all buildings;

11 C. Requiring passive heating and cooling design for all buildings;
12 d. Maximizing buildings' energy efficiency by requiring more insulation,
13 LED lighting, and ultra-efficient appliances;
14 e. Requiring water-reuse systems;
15 f. Maximizing water-conservation measures; 16

17 g. Ensuring that the Project's wastewater and solid waste will be treated in
facilities where GHG emissions are minimized and captured; 18
SODSDT h. Installing more and faster EV chargers;
i. Installing solar water heating to generate all the Project's hot water;
j. Installing on-site solar or wind-powered EV charging stations;
k. Requiring construction equipment to use alternative fuels and best-
available technologies to reduce GHG emissions;
l. Increasing the Project's density; 25 m. Transit subsidies and electric bus services for Project residents; 26
27 n. Subsidies for residents purchasing EVs;

28 o. Offsetting or mitigating via off-site mitigation projects the Project's GHG
29 emissions that remain after reducing on-site emissions as much as
30 possible.

31 87. CEQA requires a detailed good-faith response to comments the agency disagrees
32 with. Many unadopted mitigation measures were proposed in public comments
33 on the Project, and the County failed to adequately respond to some of those
34 comments.

HNMt00 A 0 / 88. The EIR concludes without sufficient analysis that many of the mitigation
measures adopted for the similar Newhall Ranch project are not feasible for
Centennial, but does not adequately explain why.
89. Many of the mitigation measures adopted for the Project are couched as Project
Design Features (PDFs) in the EIR. This violates CEQA, since there is no legal
mechanism under which the County can enforce them. CEQA requires
mitigation measures to be labeled as such, and included in the Mitigation
Monitoring and Reporting Program so they are enforceable.
90. The Project violates CEQA by failing to consider the energy-related mitigation 10 measures listed in CEQA Guidelines Appendix F. 11 91. Reduction of VMT and the associated GHG emissions via a transportation 12
authority is infeasible and unlikely to succeed, and the details of establishing 13

14 such an authority are improperly deferred, with no applicable performance
standards to ensure success. 15

16 92. Several GHG-related mitigation measures violate CEQA by being hortatory
17 rather than mandatory-they "encourage," "promote," or "support" efforts to
02838 reduce emissions. Such measures are legally inadequate as mitigation because
they cannot ensure any particular level of performance.
93. The EIR responds to many of the suggested mitigation measures starting at p. 2-
903 in the CFEIR by stating the Project complies with them when it does not. It
therefore violates CEQA by avoiding a discussion of the feasibility of those
23 measures. For example, when a proposed measure requests that the Project
24 increase energy efficiency, the EIR states that the Project includes some
25 measures to increase energy efficiency, but avoids a discussion of why it is not
26 feasible to further increase energy efficiency.
27 94. The EIR and the Statement of Overriding Considerations claim that significant
28 GHG impacts remaining after mitigation are unavoidable, but this conclusion is
29 false, and not supported with substantial evidence.
30

31 Fire Hazards

32 95. The EIR fails to adequately analyze and disclose impacts related to fire hazards
33 sufficiently to allow the public and decision makers to understand and evaluate
34 the Project's impacts.
35

2 96. The Project will result in the construction of residential areas, commercial and

3 office uses, business parks, institutional uses, and utilities in areas that have been

4 designated as Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zones (VHFHSZ) or High Fire

5 Hazard Severity Zones (HFHSZ). The Project will thus introduce urban

6 development in a currently undeveloped area subject to severe wildfire hazards.

7 97. This development at the wildland-urban interface will increase the risk of

8 wildfire damage to surrounding areas, as a result of introducing many new

9 human ignition sources. By introducing these new sources of fire into an area

10 that is already at great risk from wildfires, the Project poses a significant risk of

11 wildland fires in the areas surrounding the Project Site. The EIR fails to

12 adequately analyze this increased risk from fire hazards due to new human

13 ignition sources.

14 98. The Project will require new electrical transmission capacity to be developed.

15 Power lines have been shown to pose a substantial risk of causing fires in

16 wildland areas. The EIR does not adequately analyze potential fire impacts from

17 transmission lines.

18 99. The EIR underestimates impacts related to fire hazards, for example by
19 SUNSD presenting an inadequate discussion of the risk of wildfires within the Project
Site and in the Project's vicinity. The EIR downplays the risk of development in
a region with severe wildland fire hazards, and erroneously claims that fire
severity will be downgraded as a result of Project development.
100. The EIR does not present sufficient mitigation or demonstrate how the

25 proposed mitigation will reduce the risk of fire hazards to a less-than-significant
impact.

26
27 101. The EIR fails to sufficiently mitigate for the Project's risks from wildfire hazards

28 in the areas surrounding the Project Site. MM 3-9, which provides for preparing
a

29 Fuel Modification Plan and informing property owners of their responsibilities

30 for maintaining fuel modification zones on their property, will not sufficiently

31 mitigate the significant impacts from fire hazards. Brush clearance and

32 maintenance of fuel modification zones on private property within the Project

33 Site does little to mitigate offsite fire impacts.

34 102. The EIR fails to sufficiently or effectively mitigate fire-hazard impacts within the

35 Project Site. Recent wildfires in California have demonstrated that extensive

16 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

OONOUAN- damage can occur to towns with fire-safety measures and plans similar to those
of the Project. MM 3-9 fuel modification is insufficient to mitigate these
impacts. Also, there is no evidence that complying with building standards will
effectively address or mitigate these impacts.
103. The Project will include up to four new fire stations within the Project site. Fire
stations within the Project will do little to address hazards from wildland fires
spreading outside the Project boundaries. These fire stations will not be effective
to reduce or mitigate fire-hazard impacts of the Project to a less-than-significant
level.
10
11 104. The Project will be built within an area designated as Fire Hazard Severity Zones

12 in a State Responsibility Area. The EIR does not disclose whether the County

13 will take over responsibility from the State for firefighting, or how responsibility

14 for fighting fires in this area will be allocated between the California Department

15 of Forestry and Fire Protection and the Los Angeles County Fire Department.

16 105. Climate change has already led to more intense fires in Southern California, and
20983 continues to result in increasing temperatures, higher winds, and more-extreme
and longer drought. The EIR fails to adequately analyze how fire safety and
impacts will be affected by climate change. These impacts are projected to grow
with each passing decade.

22 Second Cause of Action

23 Violation of Planning and Zoning Law

24 106. Petitioner incorporates gg 1-72 as though set forth here.

25 107. The Planning and Zoning Law (Gov. Code $$ 65008-66035) requires specific

26 plans to be consistent with the applicable general plans. The Project violates this

27 requirement in several respects, including the violations discussed in the

28 following paragraphs.

29 108. The Project is inconsistent with AVAP Policy PS1.1, which requires limitation of

30 density in areas designated as VHFHZ.

31 109. The Project, as an extreme example of urban sprawl, is also inconsistent with

32 General Plan policy LU 3, which requires development patterns to discourage
33 sprawl.
